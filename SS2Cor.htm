              In his verbis congrue tangitur materia huius secundae epistolae ad
              Corinthios. Nam in prima epistola agit apostolus de ipsis
              sacramentis, sed in hac secunda agit de ministris ipsorum
              sacramentorum, tam bonis, quam malis. Ratio autem hanc epistolam
              scribendi fuit, quod Corinthii, post praedicationem eius,
              admiserant pseudo-apostolos, quos apostolo praeferebant. Propter
              hoc scribit eis hanc epistolam, in qua commendat apostolos et
              ostendit verorum apostolorum dignitatem; ostendit etiam et
              vituperat falsorum apostolorum falsitatem.

              1. – The subject matter of this second epistle to the Corinthians
              is fittingly touched upon by these words. For in the first epistle
              the Apostle discussed the sacraments; in this one he discusses the
              ministers, both good and bad, of these sacraments. The reason he
              wrote this epistle was that he had preached to the Corinthians,
              but they had welcomed certain false apostles, whom they preferred
              to the Apostle. Therefore he writes them this epistle, in which he
              commends the apostles and the dignity of the true apostles, and
              discloses and reproves the falseness of the false apostles.

              Commendat autem verorum apostolorum dignitatem, ex hoc quod sunt
              ministri Dei. <i>Ministri</i>, inquit, <i>Dei, dicetur vobis</i>,
              scilicet apostolis, qui quidem dicuntur ministri quantum ad tria.
              Primo quantum ad dispensationem sacramentorum. I Cor. IV, 1:
              <i>sic nos existimet homo, ut ministros</i>, et cetera. Christus
              enim institutor est sacramentorum, sed apostoli et eorum
              successores ea dispensant, et ideo subditur in praedicta
              auctoritate <i>et dispensatores mysteriorum Dei</i>. Secundo
              quantum ad gubernationem, scilicet inquantum gubernant populum
              Dei. Sap. c. VI, 5:
              <i>cum essetis ministri, non recte iudicastis</i>, et cetera. Deus
              enim gubernat omnia per prudentiam. Unde quicumque aliquid
              gubernat, dicitur minister Dei. Tertio quantum ad humanae salutis
              operationem, inquantum scilicet eorum ministerio et praedicatione,
              homines ad salutem conversi sunt: cuius salutis solus Deus est
              auctor, quia ipse est qui venit salvum facere quod perierat,
              apostoli vero ministri. I Cor. III, v. 4 s.:
              <i
                >quid ergo est Apollo? Quid Paulus? Ministri eius, cui
                credidistis</i
              >, et cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              2. – He commends the dignity of the true apostles, because they
              are God’s ministers. Men shall speak of you, i.e., the apostles,
              as the ministers of God. They are called ministers under three
              aspects. First, inasmuch as they dispense the sacraments: “This is
              how one should regard us, as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1). For
              Christ instituted the sacraments, but the apostles and their
              successors dispense them; therefore the text just cited continues:
              and stewards of the mysteries of God. Secondly, inasmuch as they
              govern the people of God: “Because, as servants of his kingdom,
              you did not rule rightly, nor keep the law” (Wis. 6:4). For God
              governs all things by his wisdom, so that whoever governs any one
              is called God’s minister. Thirdly, because they labor for the
              salvation of men, namely, inasmuch as many are converted by their
              ministry and preaching. But God alone is the author of man’s
              salvation, because it was he who came to save that which had been
              lost; the apostles, however, are his ministers: “What then is
              Apollos? What is Paul? The ministers of him whom you have
              believed” (1 Cor. 3:5).

              these ministers and points out their dignity: first, he gives his
              greeting; secondly, he begins his message (v. 3). In the greeting
              he does three things: first, he mentions the persons who send the
              greeting; secondly, those who are greeted; thirdly, the good
              things he wishes them. In regard to the first he does two things:
              first, he mentions the principal person who sends the greeting,
              namely Paul; secondly, his companion, Timothy.

              id est principaliter missus. Soli enim duodecim apostoli electi
              missi sunt a Christo. Lc. VI, 13:
              <i>elegit duodecim, quos et apostolos</i>, et cetera. Alii autem
              discipuli non missi sunt principaliter, sed secundario. Et inde
              est quod apostolis succedunt episcopi, qui habent specialem curam
              gregis domini. Alii autem sacerdotes succedunt septuaginta duobus
              discipulis, qui gerunt vices commissas sibi ab episcopis. Est ergo
              eius dignitas quia <i>apostolus</i>. I Cor. IX, 2:
              <i>si aliis non sum apostolus, sed tamen vobis sum</i>, et cetera.
              Gal. II, 8: <i>qui operatus est Petro</i>, et cetera. Sed quare
              vocat se hic apostolum, dicens <i>Paulus apostolus</i>, cum in
              epistola ad Romanos scribit se servum? Ratio huius est, quia
              Romanos reprehendit de dissensione et superbia, quae est mater
              dissensionis, quia <i>inter superbos semper iurgia sunt</i>. Unde
              ut eos revocet a dissensione, inducit eos ad humilitatem, vocando
              se servum. Corinthii vero erant pertinaces et rebelles, et ideo,
              ut reprimat eorum proterviam, usus est hic nomine dignitatis,
              dicens se apostolum. Secundo ponitur cuius sit legatus, quia

              <i>dabo tibi regem, sed in furore meo</i>. Est adeptus apostolatum
              ex voluntate Dei et beneplacito. Act. IX, 15:

              4. – The person who sends the greeting is described by his
              humility, because it is Paul, which in Latin means ‘humble’. He is
              that humble person of whom it is said in Is. (60:22): “The least
              one shall become a clan, and the smallest one a mighty nation.” Or
              by his doctrine, because Paul is called the mouth of the trumpet.
              This is the trumpet mentioned in Zechariah (9:14): “The Lord God
              will sound the trumpet, and march forth in the whirlwinds of the
              south.” He fits what is said in Isaiah (58:1): “Lift up your voice
              like a trumpet.” By the authority of his dignity, because he says,
              an apostle of Jesus Christ. Here he mentions three things: first,
              that he is a representative; hence, he is called an apostle, i.e.,
              principally sent, for only twelve apostles were sent by Christ:
              “He chose from them twelve, whom he named apostles” (Lk. 6:13).
              But the other disciples were not sent principally, but
              secondarily. That is why the apostles are succeeded by bishops,
              who have a special care of the Lord’s flock; but other priests
              succeed the seventy-two disciples and perform duties committed to
              them by the bishops. His dignity, therefore, is that he is an
              apostle: “If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you”
              (1 Cor. 9:2); “He who worked through Peter for the ministry to the
              circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles” (Gal. 2:8).
              But why does he call himself an apostle, whereas in the epistle to
              the Romans he calls himself a servant. The reason for this is that
              he rebuked the Romans for quarreling and for pride, which is the
              mother of quarrels, because there are always disputes among the
              proud. Hence to cure them of quarreling he leads them to humility
              by calling himself a servant. But the Corinthians were obstinate
              and rebellious; so in order to curb their boldness, he uses a
              dignified name here, calling himself an apostle. Secondly, he
              mentions the one he represents, Jesus Christ: “We are ambassadors
              for Christ” (2 Cor. 5:20). Thirdly, he mentions how he obtained
              his ambassadorship, because he is not coming as a false apostle:
              “I did not send them and they ran” (Jer. 23:21), nor was he given
              to the people in God’s anger in the sense of Job (34:30): “Who
              makes a hypocrite to reign”; “I have given you kings, but in my
              anger” (Hos. 13:11). But he obtained apostleship by God’s will and
              pleasure: “He is a chosen instrument of mine” (Ac. 9:15).
              Therefore he says, by the will of God.

              bishop. This is why the Pope calls all bishops brothers. He
              mentions Timothy because, since he [Timothy] had visited them, as
              he said in the first epistle (ch. 16), the people might believe

              9. – He indicates the author of these goods when he says, from God
              our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. These two expressions can be
              distinguished in two ways, because, when he says, from God our
              Father, it can be referred to the entire Trinity. For although the
              person of the Father is called the Father of Christ by nature, the
              entire Trinity in our Father by creation and governance: “For thou
              art our Father” (Is. 63:16); “You would call me My Father” (Jer.
              3:19). Therefore good things come from God our Father, i.e., from
              the entire Trinity: “If you, then, who are evil, know how to give
              good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is
              in heaven give good things to those who ask him” (Matt. 7:11). But
              if God our Father is taken for the entire Trinity, why is the
              person of the Son added, when he says, and the Lord Jesus Christ?
              Is there another person in the Trinity? I answer that he is added,
              not as though he were an additional person, but on account of
              another nature, namely, of the humanity assumed by the Son to the
              divine person. The reason he lists him along with the Trinity is
              that all good things come to us from the Trinity through the
              Incarnation of Christ, first of all grace: “Grace and truth came
              through Jesus Christ” (Jn. 1:17), and secondly peace: “He is our
              peace” (Eph. 2:14).

              Trinity is our Father, as has been said, the person of the Father
              is our Father by appropriation. Then the Lord Jesus Christ can be
              referred to the person of the Son. No mention is made of the Holy
              Spirit because, as Augustine says, since he is the nexus of the
              Father and the Son, whenever the person of the Father and the
              person of the Son are mentioned, the person of the Holy Spirit is

              source of every good; hence he says, Blessed be the God, i.e., the
              entire Trinity; and to the person of the Father when he says, and
              Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the Father has given
              us all things. It should be noted that we bless God and God
              blesses us, but in different ways. For when God speaks, he
              accomplishes: “He spoke and they were made” (Ps. 148:5). Hence,
              for God to bless is to produce something good, and to infuse
              something good, and so to be a cause: “I will indeed bless you and
              multiply your descendants” (Gen. 22:17). But our speech does not
              cause things, but acknowledges or expresses them; hence, our
              blessing is the same as recognizing good. Therefore, when we thank
              God, we bless him, i.e., acknowledge that he is good and the giver
              of all good: “Bless God and acknowledge him in the presence of all
              the living for the good things he has done for you.” (Tob. 12:6);
              “Bless the Lord, all you works of the Lord; praise and exalt him
              above all for ever” (Dan. 3:57).

              quiesceret cor eius, quando superveniunt mala, non subsisteret.
              Tunc ergo aliquis consolatur aliquem, quando affert ei aliquod
              refrigerium, in quo quiescat in malis. Et licet in aliquibus malis
              homo possit in aliquo consolari et quiescere et sustentari, tamen
              solus Deus est, qui nos consolatur in omnibus malis. Et ideo dicit

              Deus, quia ipse misericors est. Si affligeris, consolatur te, vel
              eruendo ab afflictione per potentiam suam, vel iudicando per
              iustitiam. Si laboras, consolatur te remunerando, Gen. XV, 1:

              merciful; hence he says, the Father of mercies: and because he is
              a comforter he says, and God of all comfort. He thanks God for the
              two things men especially need: first, to have evil removed from
              them, and this is done by mercy which takes away misery, for it is
              characteristic of a father to have compassion: “As a father pities
              his children, so the Lord pities those who fear him” (Ps. 103:
              13). Secondly, they need to be supported in the face of evils
              which occur, and that is to receive comfort. Because unless a man
              had something in which his heart could rest, he would not stand
              firm when evils come upon him. Therefore a person comforts another
              by affording him something refreshing, in which he can rest in
              evil times. And although a man might be comforted by something and
              find rest and be supported by it in the case of some evils, it is
              God alone who comforts us in all evils; hence he says, the God of
              all comfort. For if you sin, God comforts you, because he is
              merciful; if you are afflicted, he comforts you either by rooting
              out the affliction by his power or by judging justly; if you
              labor, he comforts you with a reward: “I am your shield; your
              reward shall be very great (Gen. 15:1). Therefore, it says in
              Matthew (5:4): “Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be
              comforted.”

              able to comfort those who are in any affliction. Here it should be
              noted that there is an order among God’s gifts. For God gives
              special gifts to some, that they may pour them out for the benefit
              of others; for he does not give light to the sun in order that the
              sun may shine for itself alone, but for the whole world. Hence,
              God desires that some profit accrue to others from all our gifts,
              whether they be riches or power of knowledge or wisdom: “As each
              has received a gift, employ it for one another” (1 Pet. 4:10).
              This then is what the Apostle says, who comforts us in all our
              affliction.

              too. Hence, he says, so that we may be able to comfort those who
              are in any affliction. For we can comfort others by the example of
              our own comfort. For one who is not comforted does not know how to
              comfort others: “He who has not been tried, what manner of things
              does he know” (Sir. 34:9, Vulgate) about any affliction; “The

              Zion” (Sir. 48:27, Vulgate). We are able, I say, to comfort them

              rewards, i.e., because we exhort you by the Scriptures and

              He says, in Christ’s sufferings, i.e., begun by Christ: “Begin at
              my sanctuary” (Ez. 9:6). For the sufferings for our sins began in
              Christ, because ‘he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree”
              (1 Pet. 2:24); then by the apostles, who said: “We are slain all
              the day long” (Ps. 44:22; Rom. 8:36); then by the martyrs, who
              were cut in two and were tempted (Heb. 11:37). Finally, sinners
              themselves will bear patiently God’s anger for their sins. Or the
              sufferings of Christ, i.e., what we endure for Christ: “Then they
              left the presence of the Council, rejoicing that they were counted
              worthy to suffer dishonor for the name” (Ac. 5:41); “For your sake
              we are slain all the day long, and accounted as sheep for the
              slaughter” (Ps. 44:22). Just as we share abundantly in these
              sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too:
              “When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my
              soul” (Ps. 94:19).

              <i>pro vestra exhortatione</i>, scilicet ut vos ad maiora
              animemini, et salutem speretis. Unde dicitur II Mach. ult., quod

              20. – In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle
              says that he received three things: afflictions, when he says, “In
              all our afflictions”; comfort, when he says, “who comforts us”;
              exhortation, when he says, “so that we may be able to comfort
              those who are in any affliction”. By taking these three things in
              a passive sense, we say that the apostles are afflicted, comforted
              and exhorted. Hence, the Apostle also shows that three things
              result in the comfort of others, and these in a definite order.
              First, their affliction, when he says, If we are afflicted it is
              for your comfort and salvation, because by our example God is
              telling you to endure suffering, from which eternal salvation will
              come to you. Hence in 1 Maccabees (6:34) we read that “they showed
              the elephants the juice of grapes and mulberries, to arouse them
              for battle”. This is done when the lukewarm and lazy are shown the
              sufferings of the saints as an example. Secondly, he shows that
              their comfort turns out to the advantage of others, when he says,
              and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort: as if to say, the
              very comfort by which we are comforted by the hope of a reward is
              a comfort to you, for by our example you also rejoice in having
              the same hope of a reward. Thirdly he shows that the exhortation
              they receive turns out to the benefit of others, saying, if we are
              exhorted by an internal inspiration or by scourges, it is for your
              exhortation, i.e., that you be inspired to greater things and hope
              for salvation. Hence it says in 2 Maccabees (15:17) that,
              “exhorted by the word of Judas, they determined to attack
              bravely.”

              for you is unshaken by the fact that you are made heirs of eternal
              life: “Suffering produces endurance, and endurance true hope”
              (Rom. 5:3-4): “Hope in God becomes firmer to the extent that one
              suffers more difficult things for his name. For as a result of the
              sufferings the saints endure for Christ, the hope of eternal life
              rises in them” (Gregory). And the cause of this hope is knowing
              that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our
              comfort, i.e., in eternal life: “The saying is sure: If we have

              also reign with him” (2 Tim. 2:11-12); “But rejoice in so far as

              only what we have said about our afflictions in general, but we do
              not want you to be ignorant, because it is profitable for you to

              example: we do not want you to be ignorant, brethren, of the
              affliction we experienced; “Remember my affliction and my
              bitterness, the wormwood and the gall” (Lam. 3:19). This is the
              persecution mentioned in Acts (19:23ff), which was launched by a
              certain Asian silversmith, who incited the people against him. The
              Apostle describes it from three aspects: from the place, because
              it was in Asia; hence he says, in Asia, i.e., Ephesus, which is in
              Asia, where he should rather have been honored and comforted; from
              its bitterness, because it was an extreme suffering; hence he
              says, for we were so utterly crushed. Also it was beyond his
              strength, and so he says, unbearably.

              one’s strength can be understood in two ways: first, above one’s
              natural strength, which the Apostle means here, above which God
              sometimes permits his servants to be tempted; secondly, above the
              strength of grace, which the Apostle means in 1 Corinthians
              (10:13): “God is faithful.” That the Apostle is speaking of
              natural strength is indicated by what he says next, we despaired
              of life itself. For it is evident that among all else, life is
              most desirable. Therefore when a persecution is so great that life
              itself becomes wearisome, it is obviously above the strength of
              our nature. And this is what he says, we despaired of life itself,
              as if to say, this persecution was so cruel that life itself
              became a burden to us: “I loathe my life” (Jb. 10:1). But against
              this James (1:2) says: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you
              meet various trials.” I answer that affliction can be considered
              in two ways: either in itself, and then it is wearisome, or in
              relation to faith, and then it is joyful, inasmuch as it is
              endured for God and with the hope of eternal life. We were not
              only weary of life, but we were certain of death; hence, he says,
              we felt that we had received the sentence of death, i.e., the
              certainty of death. As if to say: in my opinion I was about to
              die. Or another way, the sentence of death, i.e., reason itself
              would say to choose death because of the weariness of life.

              28. – But because the Lord does not abandon those who trust in
              him, the Apostle mentions the comfort he received from the Lord,
              saying, he delivered us from so deadly a peril. In regard to this
              he does three things: first, he describes his present comfort
              against past evils; secondly, the comfort to come; thirdly, the
              cause of love. He says, therefore: We have been comforted by God,
              who delivered us in the past from so deadly a peril, and is
              delivering us in the present, because he does not stop delivering:
              “When you pass through the waters I will be with you” (Is. 43:2);
              on him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again, adding
              in the future: “You who fear the Lord, hope for good things” (Sir.
              2:9). Your prayers give us cause for this hope; hence he says, you
              also must help us by prayer, which you make for us: “A brother
              helped is like a strong city” (Prov. 18:19); “I appeal to you,
              brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit,
              to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf”
              (Rom. 15:30). These prayers are necessary, because God gives many
              gifts to one person due to the prayers of many. The reason is that
              God wishes to be thanked for the gifts he gives, and as a result
              many are bound to give thanks. This happens when, as a result of
              giving to one person because of the prayers of many, he puts all
              those at whose prayers he gave some good under an obligation to
              him. Consequently, not only the one who received the benefit, but
              those who prayed should give thanks to God. And this is what he
              says, so that many will give thanks. And he says, from many faces,
              either as to age or condition or the diversity of nations or
              customs. On our behalf for the blessing, i.e., for the gift of
              faith which we have, granted us in answer to many prayers: “Always
              and for everything giving thanks in the name of our Lord Jesus
              Christ to God the Father” (Eph. 5:20). Or another way: “from the
              faces of many persons”, i.e., the condition of persons. I say,
              “For the blessing granted to us”, i.e., because they have the same
              gift, namely of faith or of charity; i.e., by means of the many
              persons who are in the faith of Christ, “thanks may be given on
              our behalf.” Therefore, according to this explanation, by the many
              faces are understood the various virtues, so that the predominant
              virtue in a person is called his face; thus, patience is the face
              of Job, humility the face of David, and so on.

              nostra est in simplicitate et sinceritate Dei, sic doctrina non
              est in sapientia carnali, sed in gratia Dei. Sed tamen duae primae
              magis valent. Et licet sic bene conversati simus in mundo isto,
              tamen <i>abundantius quantum ad vos</i>, quia scilicet ab aliis
              Ecclesiis receperat sumptus, ab eis non. Infra XI, 8:

              33. – He discloses the source of the cause of this glory when he
              says, not by earthly wisdom. This can be taken in two ways. First,
              as referring to what he had just said, namely, godly sincerity,
              and then he is suggesting the source of his sincerity and
              simplicity; as if to say: many of the ancients were wise in
              earthly wisdom, as the philosophers, and many Jews lived
              honorably, trusting in the justice of the Law, but we have behaved
              in the world, not by earthly wisdom, which is according to the
              nature of things, nor by the desires of the flesh, but by the
              grace of God: “To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set
              the mind on the Spirit is life and peace” (Rom. 8:6); “not in
              plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and
              of power” (1 Cor. 2:4); “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1
              Cor. 15:10). Or even according to this manner, not by earthly
              wisdom, i.e., as though relying on human wisdom, but by the grace
              of God: “Do not rely on your own insight” (Prov. 3:5) Or it might
              be explained in another way, so that in saying, in simplicity of
              heart and godly sincerity, he is referring to his purity of life;
              but in saying, not by earthly wisdom, but by the grace of God, he
              is referring to the truth of his teaching; as if to say: Just as
              our life is in the simplicity and sincerity of God, so our
              teaching is not in earthly wisdom, but in the grace of God. But
              the first two interpretations are more valid. And although we have
              behaved thus in the world, yet still more toward you, because he
              had received collections from the other churches, but not from
              them: “I robbed other churches” (2 Cor. 11:8). The reason for this
              might be that they were greedy; hence, in order not to sadden
              them, he refused to take any revenue from them.

              life, saying, For we write you nothing but what you can read and
              understand. As if to say: these things I write to you are not
              unknown to you, because you have already read them in the first
              letter, and you know them by experience: “I am writing you no new
              commandment, but an old commandment” (1 Jn. 2:7). And although you
              do not know fully, because you have received false apostles, I
              hope you will to the end, namely, of your life, understand,
              namely, perfectly, as you have understood in part. The reason for
              this is that when we see someone starting well, we should hope
              that he will always progress well. And why? Because “he who began
              a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus
              Christ” (Phil. 1:6) And you will understand, that you can be proud
              of us, i.e., that through us you should obtain eternal glory,
              which a person reaches through the faith of Christ, which we
              preach to you: “The glory of sons is their fathers” (Prov. 17:6).
              I say that you can be proud of us as we can be of you, because we
              hope for the reward of eternal glory through you who have been
              instructed by us: “For what is our hope or joy or crown of
              boasting? Is it not you?” (1 Th. 2:19). And this boast will be
              ours from you on the day of the Lord Jesus, i.e., on the day of
              judgment, which is called Christ’s day, because he will then
              accomplish his will with sinners by punishing those who in this
              world did their own will by sinning against the will of Christ the
              Lord: “At the set time which I appoint I will judge with equity”
              (Ps. 75:2); “And books were opened... and the dead were judged by
              what was written in the books, by what they had done” (Rev.

              promiserat eis quod primo iret ad eos antequam iret in Macedoniam,

              epistle (which we do not have), which the Apostle has sent to the
              Corinthians by a messenger, he had promised them that he would
              visit them before going to Macedonia, and that he would return
              again to Achaia, where Corinth is, and from Achaia to Judea. Then
              in a second epistle, which we call the first, he wrote them that
              he would first go to Macedonia and later to Corinth. Therefore,
              because this seemed contrary to the first promise, the Apostle now
              excuses himself for this by first mentioning the promise he
              originally made; hence, he says, Because I was sure of this. As if
              to say: you know my honesty and sincerity and you are my witnesses
              and my glory; therefore, because I was sure of this, i.e., relying
              on this, because we hope to be glorified by you, I wanted to come
              to you first, so that you might have a double pleasure, because a
              second visit and strengthening of the faith is called a second
              grace in relation to the time they were first converted by his
              ministry and his teaching. I wanted to visit you on my way to
              Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia, and have you
              send me on my way to Judea. This is the sequence of the first
              promise, but in the preceding epistle this is a contrary sequence,

              charged him with two things: light-mindedness, because he changed
              his mind: “The fool changes like the moon” (Sir. 27:11); and
              carnal love, because it seemed to them that he had done this from
              some carnal and human affection. Hence, he touches on two points:
              first, light-mindedness, and he says, Was I vacillating, if I
              failed to do what I once wanted to do? God forbid! “Neither must

              levity of our mind” (Est. 16:9, Vulgate); “In the mighty throng I
              will praise you” (Ps. 35:18). Secondly he touches on carnal
              affection, when he says, Do I make my plans like a worldly man,

              character and from the cause [for his not lying]. From his
              character, because we should not suppose that a person would
              easily lie, if he has never been found to be a liar. According to
              this explanation, As surely as God is faithful, is spoken with the
              force of an oath. As if to say: God is my witness that my word,

              is no falsity in it: “A faithful God, without deceit, just and
              upright is he” (Deut. 32:4). But if God is faithful is taken for
              the truth of the divine promise, then the sense is: God is
              faithful, i.e., he keeps his promises, but he had promised to send
              you preachers of the truth: “I will give you shepherds after my
              own heart” (Jer. 3:15). Therefore, since I was sent by him, our
              word to you has not been Yes and No.

              in Christ, and has anointed us, the Apostle proves that he has not
              lied by the efficient cause. For although a man by his free will
              can employ his tongue for speaking truth or falsity, God can
              establish a man so well in the truth, that he would speak nothing
              but the truth. Therefore, if God established someone in the truth,
              it is obvious that he could not say anything false; but God
              establishes us in the truth. And therefore he says, it is God who
              establishes us with you in Christ, i.e., in the true preaching of
              Christ. As if to say: if Christ were outside us, we could lie, but
              because he is with us and we in Christ, we do not lie: “It is I
              who keep steady its pillars” (Ps. 75:3). Therefore we are in
              Christ in two ways, namely, by grace and by glory: by grace,
              inasmuch as we have been anointed with the grace of the Holy
              Spirit and made members of Christ and joined to him; by which
              grace Christ as man was also anointed: “God, your God, has
              anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows” (Ps.
              45:7). And from the fullness of that anointing it has overflowed
              to all of us as “the precious oil on the head”, namely of Christ,
              “has flowed down on the beard, the beard of Aaron” (Ps. 133:2).
              Therefore, he says that God has anointed us. He anointed us, I
              say, as kings and priests: “You made them a kingdom and priests to
              our God” (Rev. 5:10); “You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood,
              a holy nation” (1 Pet. 2:9).

              resulting from the hope of this union. One is by a sign, the other
              by a pledge. [The first is] by an evident sign, which is of faith.
              Hence he says, he has put his seal upon us with the sign of
              Christian faith: “Put a mark on their foreheads” (Ez. 9:4), i.e.,
              the sign of the cross: “Till we have sealed the servants of our
              God upon their foreheads” (Rev. 7:3). And this is done through the
              Holy Spirit: “Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does
              not belong to him” (Rom. 8:9). Therefore the special and certain
              sign of obtaining eternal life is configuration to Christ: “Set me
              as a seal upon your heart” (Sg. 8:6). Or he sealed us with the
              sign of life. [The second is] by the greatest pledge, i.e., of the
              Holy Spirit; and so he says and given us his Spirit in our hearts

              excuse for not coming; and this is by oath which is greater. In
              regard to this he does three things: first, he states the excuse;
              secondly, he answer a tacit question (v. 24a); thirdly, he
              explains what he says (v. 24b). He excuses himself with a double
              oath: one of attestation, when he says, I call God to witness; the
              other of execration, when he says, against me, i.e., against my
              soul: “For God is my witness” (Rom. 1:9). As witness, I say, I
              call upon God, because I refrained from coming, i.e., after the
              first time or after I departed from you; and this I did to spare
              you, namely, because he knew that they were incorrigible. Hence,
              if he had gone then, he would either have punished them, and they
              perhaps would have left the faith altogether, or he would not have
              punished them, and then he would have been giving them occasion to
              sin more. But because someone could say, Why do you say spare us?
              Are you our lord? He removes this, saying, not that we lord it
              over your faith; we work with you for your joy. As if to say: I do
              not say this as a lord, but as a helper: “Not as those domineering
              over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock” (1
              Pet. 5:3). A helper, I say, for your joy, or for your improvement.
              Why he says, of your faith, he explains, saying, for you stand
              firm in your faith, i.e., you stand in that grace of Christ by
              faith.

              to avoid paining them; secondly, he speaks in particular about a
              certain person who had grieved him (v. 5). In regard to the first

              grieve you that I did not come to you. Therefore, I made up my
              mind, i.e., about what I mentioned when I sent the other letter:
              “Reason is the beginning of every work, and counsel precedes every
              undertaking” (Sir. 37:16); not to make you another painful visit,
              i.e., not to cause you pain. The reason he did not wish to grieve
              them is the same one whereby the Lord did not wish his disciples
              to fast, namely, in order that they be drawn to Christ and be
              joined to him not by fear but by love. For the Lord wished to
              strengthen and nourish them in the faith in all sweetness and
              heartfelt desire, so that, being thus established in love, they
              would not easily turn away from him because of tribulations, for
              “many waters cannot extinguish love” (Sg. 8:7). For the same
              reason the Apostle does not want to pain them on this account.

              fall into sadness was that your sadness pains me, and I rejoice in
              your consolation; and you only console me when I am with you.
              Hence, if I had come and pained you, I would be sad at your
              sadness; then there would be no one among you to gladden me,
              because you would be sad on my account. For one who is sad does
              not easily console another person: “A wise son makes a glad
              father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother” (Prov. 10:1);
              “He who loves wisdom makes his father glad” (Prov. 29:3). Or in
              another way, there are two kinds of sadness. One is according to
              the world, and the other according to God who produces repentance
              leading to salvation. The Apostle is not speaking of the first,
              but of the second. He says: I will be consoled if I cause you
              pain, i.e., if by scolding you I bring you to repentance; but if I
              had come and seen you unrepentant of your sins, I would have had
              no consolation, because no one is sad and repentant because of me,
              i.e., because of my correction and rebuke.

              vexed in his righteous soul day after day with their lawless
              deeds” (2 Pet. 2:8), in order that you might prepare and arrange

              uncorrected—a greater pain than I had when you sinned and I was
              obliged to sadden you with a sharp rebuke: for I wrote you in the
              first epistle out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with
              many tears, which I shed for you when you were already dead in
              sin: “O that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears”
              (Jer. 9:1); “It is a disgrace to be the father of an undisciplined
              son” (Sir. 22:3); “The righteous man perishes and no one lays it
              to heart” (Is. 57:1). But it should be noted that he mentions two
              things that amplify his pain, namely, affliction and anguish,
              because one added to the other increases sadness. For sometimes a
              person is sad but without anguish, namely, when he is pricked by
              some adversity as though by a very sharp thorn; and yet various
              ways of escape seem open to him, because if no way is open,
              anguish is joined to affliction. He says, therefore, for I wrote
              you out of much affliction, with which he was pricked by your
              deeds and your evil, and anguish of heart, because he could not
              see where a remedy could easily be found: “Trouble and anguish
              have come upon me” (Ps. 119:143).

              but in some measure. For it should be noted that sometimes a
              person is completely saddened and sometimes not. He is completely
              saddened when he is engrossed by pain with his grief. This is the
              sadness that works death, as he says below (7:10), but that,
              according to the Philosopher, does not happen to a wise man. He is
              not completely sad when, although he is sad about some evil he is
              suffering or seems to be on its way, he nevertheless rejoices for
              other good reasons. This sadness is according to God and does
              happen to a wise man. Therefore, because the Apostle says that he
              was very sad, he adds that he was sad in some measure, as though
              not entirely, lest they suppose that he was altogether engrossed
              by sadness, which does not befit a wise man. According to this,
              the meaning is: He, i.e. the fornicator, has pained me on account
              of his sin, but he has not pained me entirely. For although I
              grieved for him because of his sin, yet I take joy in you because
              of the many good things you do, and in him because of his
              repentance. I say, in some measure, that I may not burden you all,
              i.e., that I may not lay this burden on you, namely, that you
              should grieve me.

              Church and delivered to Satan (1 Cor. 5:5). Therefore this

              sufficient, not as to God’s judgment, but as was expedient for the
              time and the person. For it is better to observe such a spirit of

              the penance, than to correct so harshly that the sinner despairs

              62. – He gives the reason for this admonition, saying, or he may
              be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow. For some are sometimes so
              steeped in sorrow because of sin and punishment of sin, that they
              are overcome, when they have no one to comfort them; and this is
              bad, because it does not result in the hope for the fruit of
              repentance, namely reformation, but in despair he delivers himself
              over to all sins, as Cain, when he said: “My punishment is greater
              than I can bear” (Gen. 4:13); “Who, despairing, have given
              themselves up to licentiousness, greedy to practice every kind of
              uncleanness” (Eph. 4:19). For this reason, despair is called a
              dangerous thing in 2 Samuel (2:26), so that David said in Psalm 69
              (v. 15): “Let not the flood sweep over me, or the deep swallow me
              up, or the pit close its mouth over me.” Therefore, in order to
              prevent this, he says, comfort him, so that he will cease sinning:
              “This will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin” (Is.
              27:9).

              other causes to do this, when he says, so I beg you to reaffirm

              and harshness you have ruled them” (Ez. 34:4). To reaffirm your
              love for him, which happens if you show your charity for him and
              not hate him for his sins, or despise him, but for your
              consolation make him hate his sin and love justice: “Strengthen
              your brethren” (Lk. 22:32).

              <i>palpebrae tuae praecedant</i>, et cetera. Secundum est finis,
              quia non propter amorem vel odium debet fieri, sed propter
              utilitatem aliquam Ecclesiae vel aliquorum. Et ideo dicit
              <i>propter vos</i>. Tertium est auctoritas, quia non debet fieri
              auctoritate propria, sed Christi, qui remittit peccata
              auctoritate; alii vero, quibus commissum est, ministerio, et sicut
              membra Christi. Et ideo dicit <i>in persona Christi</i>, scilicet

              remittit. Io. XX, v. 23: <i>quorum remiseritis peccata</i>, et

              <i>ut non circumveniamur a Satana</i>. Diabolus enim multos
              decepit, quosdam scilicet trahendo ad peccatorum perpetrationem,
              quosdam vero ad nimiam rigiditatem contra peccantes, ut si non
              potest eos habere per perpetrationem facinorum, saltem perdat quos
              iam habet per praelatorum austeritatem, qui eos non misericorditer
              corrigentes in desperationem inducunt, et sic hos perdit, et illos
              Diaboli laqueus includit. Eccle. VII, 17:
              <i>noli esse nimis iustus</i>, et cetera. I Petr. V, 8:
              <i>adversarius vester Diabolus</i>, et cetera. Et hoc continget

              66. – And this is obvious, for what I have forgiven, if I have
              forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the [person] of
              Christ. In this he touches four things required for such pardon or
              forgiveness. The first is discernment, so that pardon is not
              granted indiscriminately and rashly; hence he says, if I have
              forgiven anything, namely, in the proper way: “Let your eyes look
              directly forward” (Prov. 4:25). The second is the end, because it
              should be done not for love or hatred, but for some benefit to the
              Church or others; hence he says, it has been for your sake. The
              third is authority, because it should not be done on one’s own
              authority, but Christ’s, who forgives sin by authority, but the
              others to whom it has been entrusted, forgive as ministers and
              members of Christ; hence he says, in the [person] of Christ,
              namely, not by my own authority. Yet whatever is forgiven, Christ
              forgives: “If you forgive the sins of any they are forgiven” (Jn.
              20:23). The fourth is need; hence he says, to keep Satan from
              gaining the advantage over us. For the devil had deceived many:
              some by leading them to commit sins, and others by excessive rigor
              against sinners; so that if Satan cannot get them for having
              committed sin, he at least destroys those he already has by the
              severity of prelates who drive them to despair by not correcting
              them in a compassionate way. Hence, he destroys these, and the
              others he puts in the snare of the devil: “Be not righteous
              overmuch” (Ecc. 7:16); “Your adversary the devil prowls around
              like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour” (1 Pet. 5:8). And
              this will happen to us if we do not forgive sinners. Therefore
              that we might not be deceived by Satan, to keep Satan from gaining
              the advantage over us, I have forgiven, if I have forgiven
              anything, for we are not ignorant of his designs, namely, those of
              Satan. This is true in general, but in particular no one can know
              his thoughts but God alone: “Who can strip off his outer garment?
              Who can penetrate into the midst of his mouth?” (Jb. 41:13,
              Vulgate).

              that ease and of the preparation: “Convert us to yourself, O Lord,
              that we may be converted” (Lam. 5:21, Vulgate). When, I say, a
              door was thus opened for me in the Lord my mind [spirit] could not
              rest, i.e., I was unable to do what my spirit wished, i.e.,
              dictated. For the spirit is said to have rest, when it achieves
              what it wishes, just as the flesh is said to rest when it has what
              it desires: “Soul, you have ample goods laid up for many years;
              take your ease” (Lk. 12:19). The Apostle does not say, I had no
              rest in my flesh or my body, but in my mind, i.e., in my spiritual
              will, which is to establish Christ in the hearts of men. And I was
              hindered because I saw hearts prepared and disposed, and was
              unable to preach.

              causa est melior, quae est, quia apostolo imminebant in Troade
              multa facienda. Nam ex una parte imminebat ei praedicare his qui
              parati erant recipere Christum per fidem; ex alia parte imminebat

              adds, because I did not find my brother Titus there, i.e., because
              of Titus’ absence. And this for two reasons. One reason was that
              although the Apostle knew all their languages, so that he could
              say: “I thank God that I speak in tongues more than you all” (1
              Cor. 14:18), he was more skilled in Hebrew than in Greek, but
              Titus more in Greek. Therefore, he wanted to have him present to
              preach in Troas. And because he was absent, for the Corinthians
              had detained him, he says, my spirit could not rest. But because
              God’s gifts are not imperfect, and the gift of tongues was
              specifically given to the apostles for preaching throughout the
              whole world: “Their voice goes out through all the earth, and
              their words to the end of the world” (Ps. 19:4), the other reason
              is better, namely, that many things remained for the Apostle to do
              in Troas. For on the one hand, he had to preach to those who were
              prepared to receive Christ by faith; and on the other, he had to
              resists the adversaries who opposed him; therefore, because he
              could not do these things alone, he was grieved by the absence of
              Titus, who could concentrate on preaching and converting the good,
              while the Apostle withstood the adversaries. And he is at pains to
              write this to them in order to suggest that not only the first,
              but also the second reason for his delay was due to them. For on
              account of their hardness and quarreling, they delayed Titus for a
              long time. Hence he says, because I did not find my brother Titus
              there, either in Christ or in my co-worker: “A brother helped is
              like a strong city” (Prov. 18:19).

              every place? For there are many places in which our preaching is
              not accepted. The Apostle explains this, saying: I do not care,
              because whether they accept our preaching or not, the knowledge of
              God is manifest everywhere through us, because we are the aroma of
              Christ to God, namely, to the honor of God. He says this in a
              likeness to the Law, where it is said that a sacrifice becomes the
              sweetest fragrance of sweetness to God. As if to say: we are a
              holocaust offered to God as a fragrance of sweetness among those
              who are being saved, namely, that they not perish, which is theirs
              from God; and among those who are perishing, which is theirs from
              themselves. Hence, it is written in Hosea (13:9, Vulgate):
              “Destruction is your own, O Israel, your help is only in me”. But
              is that fragrance related to the good and the wicked in the same
              way? No, but to one a fragrance from death to death, i.e., of envy
              and malice, which are the occasion of bringing them to eternal
              death, i.e., those who envy the good reputation of the Apostle and
              strive against the preaching of Christ and the conversion of the
              faithful: “This child is set for the fall and rising of many in
              Israel, and for a sign that is spoken against” (Lk. 2:34). To the
              other a fragrance from life to life, of love and good opinion
              leads them to eternal life, namely, to those who rejoice and are
              converted by the preaching of the Apostle: “For the word of the
              cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being
              saved it is the power of God” (1 Cor. 1:18). Thus, from the
              fragrance of the Apostle the good live and the wicked die, as it
              is read that serpents die from the smell of flourishing vines.

              O God, are exceedingly honorable” (Ps. 138:17, Vulgate). But on
              the other hand, it says in Proverbs (27:2): “Let another praise
              you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips.”
              Gregory, in his commentary on Ezekiel, answers this by saying that
              the saints praise themselves for two reasons, and not for their
              own glory and vanity. The first reason is that they not despair in
              tribulations, as Job, when his friends tried to bring him to
              despair, recalled to his mind the good things he had done, in
              order to comfort himself and not despair. Hence, he said: “I have
              made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I look upon a
              virgin?” (31:1). We read of a holy father, that when he was
              tempted to despair, he recalled to mind the good things he had
              done, in order to comfort himself; when he was tempted to pride,
              he recalled the evil he had done, in order to be humbled. The
              second reason is for profit, namely, that he obtain a greater
              reputation and that his teaching be believed more readily. This is
              the reason why the Apostle praises himself here. For the
              Corinthians had preferred false apostles to him and disdained him.
              As a result they were not ready to obey him. Therefore, to assure
              that they would not disdain but obey him, he prefers himself to
              them and praises himself, saying, Who is sufficient for these
              things? as we are. Not the false apostles, because even though
              they preach, they adulterate God’s word—which we do not do.

              false apostles, peddlers of God’s word, mingling contrary
              doctrines, as the heretics, who although they confess Christ, do
              not admit that he is true God. This is what the false apostles do,
              who say that along with the Gospel the legal observances must be
              kept. Hence he says, for we are not, like so many, peddlers
              [adulterers] of God’s word, i.e., preaching for gain or for
              praise. For thus are women called adulteresses, when they receive
              seed from another man for the propagation of children. In
              preaching, the seed is nothing less than your end or intention.
              Therefore, if your end is gain, if your intention is your own
              glory, you adulterate God’s word. This the false apostles were
              doing who were preaching for gain: “We refuse to practice cunning
              or to tamper with God’s word, but by the open statement of the
              truth we would commend ourselves to every man’s conscience in the
              sight of God” (2 Cor. 4:2). But the apostles preached neither for
              monetary gain nor their own glory, but for the praise of God and
              the salvation of their neighbor. Hence, he adds, but as men of
              sincerity, i.e., with a sincere intention; not for gain and
              without corrupted admixtures: “We have behaved in the world, and
              still more toward you, with holiness and godly sincerity” (2 Cor.

              77. – He points out three aspects of this sincerity: the first is
              taken from the dignity of the one who sent them. For it is
              expected of a messenger of the truth to speak the truth; hence he
              says, as commissioned by God, i.e., with that sincerity which
              befits a messenger of God: “Whoever speaks as one who utters
              oracles of God” (1 Pet. 4:11). The second is taken from the
              authority of the one presiding, before whom he stands. Hence he
              says, in the sight of God, in whose presence we should speak with
              sincerity: “As the Lord the God of Israel lives, before whom I
              stand” (1 Kg. 17:1). The third is taken from the dignity of the
              subject of which he speaks. For the preaching of the apostles is
              about Christ; therefore, it should be sincere, as also Christ and
              God are. Hence, he says, we speak in Christ alone, and not in the
              ceremonies of the Law, as false apostles do: “For I decided to
              know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified” (1
              Cor. 2:2).

              of his hearers, the Apostle continues toward his main intention,
              namely, to treat about the ministers of the New Testament. In
              regard to this he does two things: first, he commends the dignity
              of the good ministers; secondly, he expands on the guilt of the
              evil ministers (chap. 10ff.). In regard to the first he does two
              things: first, he commends the ministry of the New Testament;
              secondly, he commends the exercise of this ministry in others by
              exhorting them to this (chap. 6). In regard to the first he
              commends the ministry of the New Testament from three aspects:
              first, in this chapter, from its dignity; secondly, from its
              exercise (chap. 4); thirdly, from its reward (chap. 5). In regard

              secondly, he commends the ministers of the New Testament (v. 6).
              In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle
              intended to commend the ministers of the New Testament, of which
              he is one. Therefore, lest the Corinthians object that in doing
              this he wishes to commend himself, he at once removes this,
              saying, Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Here he does

              yourselves are our letter of recommendation; as if to say: I have
              a good letter; I do not need others. In regard to this, he does
              two things: first, he shows what that letter is which he has;
              secondly, he explains this (v. 3). In regard to the first he does
              two things: first he shows what that letter is; secondly, he shows
              that it is sufficient for commending him (v. 3b). He says,
              therefore, you are our letter, i.e., the letter through which our
              dignity is made manifest, by which we are commended, so that we do
              not need other letters: “You are our glory” (1 Th. 2:20); “My
              little children, with whom I am again in travail, until Christ be
              formed in you” (Gal. 4:19). But is this letter sufficient? Yes,
              because it is written on your hearts. Here he touches on two
              things causing the sufficiency of such letters. One is that it
              should be understood and known by the one for whom it is sent; the
              other that he still seeks, and not that he knows himself to have
              it. As to this he says, written on our hearts, because we always
              have you in mind, having a special care for you: “I hold you in my
              heart” (Phil. 1:7). The other is that he to whom it is sent may
              read and know it; hence, he says, to be known and read by all men.
              To be known, I say, because you have been instructed and converted
              by us; but it is read, because by our example even others imitate
              you: “Write the vision; make it plain upon tablets, so he may run
              who reads it” (Hab. 2:2).

              that you are a letter from Christ, and in regard to this he does
              three things. First, he explains whose letter it is; secondly, how
              it was written; thirdly, on what. He shows whose it is when he
              says, from Christ. Hence, he says, you show that you are a letter
              from Christ, i.e., informed and led by Christ, principally and
              authoritatively: “For you have one teacher” (Matt. 23:8), but by
              us secondarily and instrumentally. Hence he adds, delivered by us:
              “This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ” (1 Cor.
              4:1); “What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom
              you believed” (1 Cor. 3:5) He shows how it was written, not with
              ink, i.e., not mixed with errors, as the letters of the false
              apostle; not changeable and imperfect as the Old Law, which led no
              one to perfection (cf. Heb. 7:19); for black ink is that by which
              error is understood, and delible by which changeableness is
              understood. It is written not with ink, I say, but with the Spirit
              of the living God, i.e., by the Holy Spirit, by whom you live and
              by whose teaching you have been instructed: “In whom you were
              sealed with the promised Holy Spirit” (Eph. 1:13). He suggests

              Old Law, to exclude hardness; as if to say: not in the stony

              Spirit” (Ac. 7:51); but on tablets of human hearts, i.e., hearts
              opened by charity, and human, i.e., made receptive as a result of

              says, not that we are competent of ourselves to claim anything as
              coming from us, much less say and accomplish. For in the pursuit
              of any work there is first an assent, which is done by thinking,
              then discussion by word, and finally accomplishment by work. Hence
              if a person does not have the thinking from himself but from God,
              there is no doubt that not only the completion of a good work is
              from God, but even the very beginning: “He who began a good work
              in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ”
              (Phil. 1:6). This is contrary to the Pelagians, who say that the
              beginning of a good work is from us, but its completion is from
              God: “O Lord, you have wrought for us all our works” (Is. 26:12).

              propter quod facimus. Non est autem procedere in infinitum, sed
              est devenire ad aliquid primum, puta ad consilium. Sic ergo bonum

              87. – The Philosopher also teaches that a man can never do any
              good through his free will without God’s help. The reason is that
              in the things we do it is necessary to seek that for which we do
              it. But there can be no infinite process, for we must come to
              something which is first, e.g., to counsel. Thus, therefore, I do
              good, because there is in me the counsel to do so, and this is
              from God. Hence, he says that the counsel of something good is
              from something above man, moving him to act well; and this is God,
              who moves men and all things that act to their actions; but men
              are moved in one way, and other things in another. For since
              motion of this kind is something received into the thing moved, it
              is necessary that this be done according to the mode of its
              nature, i.e., of the thing moved. And therefore he moves all
              things according to their natures. Therefore, those things whose
              nature is to have free will and have dominion over their actions,
              he moves in such a way that they act freely, as rational and
              intellectual creatures. But others not freely, but according to
              the mode of their nature. But although we are not sufficient to
              think anything of ourselves as coming from ourselves, yet we have
              a certain sufficiency, namely that by which we are able to will
              the good, and to begin to believe, and this is from God: “What
              have you that you did not receive?” (1 Cor. 4:7).

                not in a written code but in the Spirit; for the written code
                kills, but the Spirit gives life. 7 Now if the dispensation of
                death, carved in letters on stone, came with such splendor that
                the Israelites could not look at Moses’ face because of its
                brightness, fading as this was, 8 will not the dispensation of
                the Spirit be attended with greater splendor? 9 For if there was
                splendor in the dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation
                of righteousness must far exceed it in splendor. 10 Indeed, in
                this case, what once had splendor has come to have no splendor
                at all, because of the splendor that surpasses it. 11 For if
                what faded away came with splendor, what is permanent must have
                much more splendor.

              Apostle then commends its ministers. First, he stipulates two
              things, which correspond to the above words. For he had mentioned
              a gift received from God when he said, our competence is from God,
              and the confidence born of this gift when he said, such is the
              confidence that we have through Christ toward God. First,
              therefore, he determines the things pertaining to the gift
              received; secondly, those pertaining to the confidence born of it
              (v. 12). In regard to the first he does three things: first, he
              discloses the gift received from God, namely, the ministry of the
              New Testament; secondly, he describes the New Testament (v. 6b);
              thirdly, from the dignity of the New Testament he shows the
              dignity of its ministers (v. 9).

              this we hold the place of angels: “Who make angels your

              90. – He describes what this New Testament is when he continues,
              not in a written code but in the Spirit. He describes it in regard
              to two things, namely, as to that in which it consists and as to
              its cause for which it has been given: for the written code kills.
              In regard to the first it should be noted that the Apostle speaks
              profoundly, for it is stated in Jeremiah (31:31): “I will make a
              new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of
              Judah, not like the covenant which I made with their fathers”; and
              later on (v. 33): “I will put my law within them, and I will write
              it on their hearts; and I will be their God and they shall be my
              people.” The Old Testament, therefore, is written in a book, later
              to be sprinkled with blood, as it says in Hebrews (9:19): “He took
              the blood of calves and goats and sprinkled both the book itself
              and all the people, saying: ‘This is the blood of the covenant
              which God commanded you.’” So it is clear that the Old Law is a
              covenant of words, but the New Covenant is a covenant of the Holy
              Spirit, by whom the love of God is poured out in our hearts [Et
              sic patet, quod vetus lex est testamentum litterae. Sed Novum
              Testamentum est testamentum Spiritus Sancti, quo charitas Dei
              diffunditur in cordis nostris], as it says in Rom. 5:5.
              Consequently, when the Holy Spirit produces charity in us, which
              is the fulness of the Law, it is a New Covenant, not in a written
              code, i.e., not written down, but in the Spirit, i.e., through the
              Spirit who gives life: “The law of the Spirit of life” (Rom. 8:2),
              i.e., life-giving.

              Causa autem quare datum sit novum testamentum per spiritum,

              <i>littera occidit</i> occasionaliter. Nam littera legis dat solam
              cognitionem peccati. Rom. III, 20:
              <i>per legem autem cognitio peccati</i>. Ex hoc autem, quod
              cognosco peccatum, solum duo sequuntur. Nam lex dum per eam
              cognoscitur, non reprimit concupiscentiam: sed magis
              occasionaliter auget, inquantum concupiscentia ferventius fertur
              in rem prohibitam. Unde huiusmodi cognitio, nondum destructa causa
              concupiscentiae, occidit; hinc vero addit praevaricationem. Nam
              gravius est peccare contra legem scriptam et naturalem simul, quam
              contra legem naturalem solum. Rom. VII, 8:
              <i>occasione accepta</i> non data, <i>peccatum</i>, et cetera.

              vetus, quia ad minus prohibet mala. Est tamen imperfecta,
              inquantum non removet causam. Est ergo lex sine spiritu interius
              imprimens legem in corde, occasio mortis. Et ideo necessarium fuit
              dare legem spiritus, qui charitatem in corde faciens, vivificet.

              91. – The reason why the New Testament was given by the Spirit is
              indicated when he says, for the written code kills, not as a cause
              but as an occasion. For the written Law only gives knowledge of
              sin: “For through the Law comes knowledge of sin” (Rom. 3:20). But
              as a result of merely knowing sin, two things follow. For the Law,
              although sin is known by it, does not repress concupiscence, but
              is the occasion of increasing it, inasmuch as concupiscence is
              enkindled the more by something forbidden. Hence such knowledge
              kills, when the cause of concupiscence has not yet been destroyed.
              As a result it adds to the sin. For it is more grievous to sin
              against the written and natural law than against the natural law
              only: “But sin, finding opportunity in the commandment, wrought in
              me all kinds of concupiscence” (Rom. 7:8). But although it is the
              occasion of killing inasmuch as it increases concupiscence and
              increases the sin, the Law is not evil, because at least it
              forbids evil; nevertheless, it is imperfect, inasmuch as it does
              not remove the cause. Therefore, the Law without the Spirit
              inwardly impressing the Law on the heart is the occasion of death;
              hence, it was necessary to give the Law of the Spirit, who gives
              life by producing charity in the heart: “It is the Spirit that
              gives life” (Jn. 6:63).

              93. – In regard to the first, it should be noted that the Apostle
              argues from a statement in Exodus (34:24), where our text says
              that Moses had his face horned, so that the people of Israel could
              not come near. Another version says that his face shone, and this
              is better. For it should not be supposed that he literally had
              horns, as some depict him, but he is described as horned because
              of the rays which seemed to be like horns. He argues from this in
              the following way: first, by a similarity and by arguing from the
              lesser. For it is obvious that if something less has glory, then
              much more something which is greater. But the Old Testament is
              less than the New: therefore, since the former was in glory, so
              that the Israelites could not look at Moses’ face, it seems that
              the New is much more in glory.

              94. – That the Old Testament is less than the New he proves in
              three ways. First, from its effect, because the former is a
              covenant of death, but the latter of life, as has been said. In
              regard to this he says, If the dispensation of death, i.e., the
              Old, which is the occasion of death; and this corresponds to what
              he said, namely, that the written code kills, but the Spirit gives
              life. Secondly, as to the way it was delivered, for the Old was
              delivered written on stone tablets, but the New was impressed by
              the Spirit on human hearts. He suggests this when he says, carved
              in letters, i.e., perfectly formed, on stone, i.e., on tablets of
              stone. This corresponds to his statement, not in a written code
              but in the Spirit. Thirdly, as to perfection: for the glory of the
              Old Testament is without assurance, because the Law brought no one
              to perfection. But in the New there is glory with the hope of a
              better glory, i.e., eternal: “My salvation will be forever” (Is.
              51:6). This is suggested when he says, fading as this was: “If you
              receive circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you” (Gal.
              5:2). He states the conclusion when he says, will not the
              dispensation of the Spirit be attended with greater glory? which
              is plain.

              95. – Then he assigns the reason for all these when he says, For
              if there was glory in the dispensation of condemnation, the
              dispensation of justice must far exceed it in glory. This is his
              reasoning: Glory is owed more to justice than to condemnation, but
              the ministry of the New Testament is a ministry of justice,
              because it justifies by giving life within. The ministry of the
              Old Testament is a ministry of condemnation, as being its
              occasion: the written code kills, but the Spirit gives life.
              Therefore, since the dispensation of condemnation, i.e., the
              ministry of the Old Testament, is the occasional cause of
              condemnation, as has been said, is in glory, which appeared on the
              face of Moses, it is obvious that much more abundant in glory,
              i.e., gives an abundance of glory to its ministers, is the
              dispensation of justice, i.e., of the New Testament, by which the
              Spirit is given through whom is given justice and the fulfillment
              of the virtues: “The wise shall possess glory” (Prov. 3:35).

              in that ministry, which they did, because they observed the
              ceremonies of the Law along with the Gospel. Therefore the Apostle
              rejects this when he says, indeed, in this case, what once had
              glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that

              abounds in glory to such a degree that the glory of the Old
              Testament should not be called glorious, for what once had glory
              has come to have no glory at all by reason of the glory that
              surpasses it. This is explained in two ways. First, that that
              glory is nothing in comparison to that of the New Testament,
              because such glory was not conferred on all the ministers, but on
              Moses alone, and it did not shine on Moses entirely, but in part,
              i.e., on his face alone. Therefore, it has come to have no glory
              at all, i.e., should not be glorified because of the glory that
              surpasses it, i.e., in comparison to the excelling glory of the
              New Testament, which abounds in grace, so that men purified by it
              might not see the glory of a man but of God. It is explained in a
              second way by punctuating it thus: that which was glorious in this
              part has come to have no glory: as if to say, for in this part,
              i.e., in respect to this particular nature, that we are servants,
              has come to have no glory, i.e., that was not glorious which shone
              in the Old Testament: and this by reason of the glory that
              surpasses it, which is in the New, because it is the glory of God
              the Father.

              faded away came with glory, what is permanent must have much more
              glory. His reasoning is thus: that which was given to pass away is
              nothing in relation to that which is given to remain always. If,
              therefore, the Old Testament, which is rendered void, is done away
              with: “But when the perfect comes, the imperfect will pass away”
              (1 Cor. 13:10). For with glory the ministry of Moses came, at
              least with a particular glory. And it is obvious that the New
              Testament remains, because it is begun here and completed in
              heaven: “Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
              pass away” (Lk. 21:33). It will be much more in eternal glory, in
              which it will be perfected; it will be, I say, for us who are its
              ministers.

              figure, over his face; this veil is made void, i.e., is taken away
              by Christ, namely, by fulfilling in truth what Moses delivered in
              figure, because all things happened to them in a figure. For thus
              Christ by his death removed the veil of the killing of the paschal
              lamb. Therefore, as soon as he gave up his spirit, the veil of the
              Temple was rent. Likewise by sending the Holy Spirit into the

              the Jews understood carnally. He removed the veil, when he opened

              believe, but not for the unbelieving Jews. The reason for this is
              that their minds were hardened, i.e., their reasoning power is
              dull and their senses weak and clouded, so that they cannot see
              the brightness of the divine light, i.e., of divine truth, without
              the veil of figures. The reason for this is that they close their
              eyes so as not to see, because the veil of the Temple was rent.
              Therefore, this is due to their sin of unbelief, and not to a
              weakness in the truth; because with the removal of the veil the
              truth is manifested very clearly to all who open the eyes of their
              mind through faith: “A hardening has come upon part of Israel”
              (Rom. 11:25); “For judgment I came into this world, that those who
              do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind” (Jn.
              9:39). For this was foretold by Isaiah (6:10): “Make the heart of
              this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest
              they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand
              with their hearts, and turn and be healed.” And indeed their minds
              are so dulled to the truth that to this day they do not understand
              the truth manifested to us. But the same veil remains which was in
              the Old Testament before the veil of the Temple was rent, when
              they read the Old Testament, because they understand it no
              differently than before. For they still rely on figures, so as not
              to reveal the truth, i.e., not understand. Thus they still believe
              that the veil of God is not a figure, but the truth, which namely
              is lifted as to believers through Christ, i.e., in the faith of
              Christ. But it remains in them, because they do not believe that
              Christ has come.

              a veil lies over their minds, he shows how even among the Jews the
              veil remains, as to unbelievers, although it has been removed by
              Christ. In regard to this it should be noted that a veil is said
              to be put on something in two ways: either because it is put on
              the thing seen, so that it cannot be seen; or because it is put on
              the one seeing, so that he may not see. But the veil was put on
              the Jews of the Old Law in both ways. For their eyes have been
              blinded not to see the truth because of their hardness; and the
              Old Testament had not yet been fulfilled, because the truth had
              not yet come. As a sign of this the veil was on Moses’ face and
              not theirs. But with the coming of Christ the veil was removed
              from the face of Moses, i.e., from the Old Testament, because it
              was not fulfilled: but it has not been removed from their hearts.
              Hence, he says, to this day the veil remains. As if to say: the
              veil has been removed from the believers of the Old Testament, but
              still when Moses is read, i.e., when the Old Testament is
              explained to them: “For from early generations, Moses has had in

              111. – But the reason why they are converted and the veil removed
              in this manner is because God wills it. For they could claim that
              God put the veil on them and therefore it cannot be removed. But
              the Apostle shows that it cannot only be removed, but even that it
              is removed by him who is the Lord. Hence, he says, now the Lord is
              the Spirit. This can be understood in two ways. In one way, so
              that Spirit is taken as the subject, as though saying: the Spirit,
              i.e., the Holy Spirit, namely who is the author of the Law, is the
              Lord, i.e., works by his own free will: “The Spirit blows where it
              wills” (Jn. 3:8); “The Spirit, who apportions to each one
              individually as he wills” (1 Cor. 12:11). And where the Spirit of
              the Lord is there is freedom; as if to say: because the Spirit is
              the Lord, he can give freedom to enable us freely to use the
              writings of the Old Testament without a veil. Therefore, those who
              do not have the Holy Spirit cannot use it freely: “You were called
              to freedom” (Gal. 5:13); “Live as free men, yet without using your
              freedom as a pretext for evil” (1 Pet. 2:16). It can be understood
              another way so that by the Lord is meant Christ, as though saying:
              the Lord, i.e., Christ, is Spirit, i.e., has spiritual power.
              Therefore, where the Spirit of the Lord is, i.e., the law of
              Christ spiritually understood, not in a written code, but
              impressed on the heart by faith, there is freedom from every
              obscurity of the veil.

              of the unjust. Nevertheless, this does not mean that the just are
              not bound to it. Similarly, where the Spirit of the Lord is there
              is freedom, is explained thus: the free man is one who exists for
              himself, but the servant exists for the sake of the master.
              Therefore, whoever acts of himself acts freely, but one who is
              moved by another does not act freely. Therefore, one who avoids
              evils, not because they are evil, but because of God’s
              commandment, is not free. But one who avoids evils because they
              are evils is free. But this is done by the Holy Spirit who
              perfects man inwardly with a good habit, so that from love he
              avoids evil, as if the divine law had commanded. Consequently, he
              is called free, not as though he is not subject to the divine law,
              but because he is inclined by a good habit to do what the divine
              law ordains.

              saw some glory on the face of Moses as a result of his speaking

              doctrine, when we exercise this ministry. As to conduct in two
              ways, namely in our actions and in our intentions. But if a person
              avoids doing evil and has a good intention, he avoids evil
              completely. But evil is avoided in our activity by enduring evils
              patiently in adversity. Hence, he says, we do not lose heart by
              impatience: “Let us not grow weary in well-doing” (Gal. 6:9); “For
              when I am weak, then I am strong” (2 Cor. 12:10). It is also
              avoided in prosperity by making moderate use of the things that
              are going well for us. Hence he says, we have renounced
              disgraceful, underhanded ways, i.e., we remove from ourselves
              whatever makes a man base and dishonorable, namely, things unclean
              and foul and not only open but even hidden: “Therefore put away
              all filthiness” (Jas. 1:21); “For it is a shame even to speak of
              the things that they do in secret” (Eph. 5:12). Evil conduct is
              avoided in our intention, if it is a right intention. In regard to
              this he says, we refuse to practice cunning, i.e., fraud and
              pretense and hypocrisy. That is what the false apostles do, who
              pretend one thing outwardly, but do something else inwardly in the
              heart: “Dissemblers and crafty men provoke the wrath of God” (Job
              36:13, Vulgate). Evil is avoided in doctrine when the Lord’s word
              is proposed in the proper way. In regard to this he says, or to
              tamper with God’s word. This is explained in two ways. First, not
              mixing false doctrine with the doctrine of Christ, as the false
              apostles do when they teach that the ceremonies of the Law must be
              observed along with the Gospel. Secondly, not preaching for gain
              and for one’s own glory. The first of these is a wolf and the
              second a hireling, but one who preaches the truth and for the
              glory of God is a shepherd. Hence Augustine says: “The shepherd
              should be loved and the wolf avoided, but the hireling must be
              tolerated for the present.”

              120. – But because perfect justice requires more than avoiding
              evil, but doing good, he says something about doing good in the
              exercise of this ministry. The first good is against evil
              teachings; the second against evil conduct; the third against an
              evil intention. Against evil teaching, which must be avoided, they
              perform the good of manifesting the truth. In regard to this he
              says, by the open statement of the truth: as if to say, we do not
              lose heart but, avoiding evil, we walk and act in the
              manifestation of the truth, i.e., we manifest the pure truth: “For
              this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth”
              (Jn. 18:37); “Those who show me forth shall have everlasting life”
              (Sir. 24:31, Vulgate). Against evil conduct they perform good
              works. In regard to this he says, we would commend ourselves to
              every man’s conscience. We do not do this by saying good things
              about ourselves, because it is not easy to believe a person who
              recommends himself, but by doing good, because we do such works,
              so that by the works themselves we make ourselves commendable to
              every man’s conscience: “Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles”
              (1 Pet. 2:12). Against an evil intention we do good by making
              ourselves commendable not only to every man’s conscience, but even
              in the sight of God, who sees the heart.: “For it is not the man
              who commends himself that is accepted, but the man whom the Lord
              commends” (2 Cor. 10:18); “Providing good things not only before
              God but before all men” (Rom. 12:17, Vulgate).

              God’s commandment in this: “Let your light so shine before men,
              that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father
              who is in heaven” (Matt. 5:16); “Beware of practicing your piety
              before men” (Matt. 6:1): the first by saying, we would commend
              ourselves to every man’s conscience; but the second by saying, in
              the sight of God: “For he is not a real Jew who is one outwardly”
              (Rom. 2:28). Or this whole passage can be read in the following
              manner without interrupting the text: Therefore, having this
              ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart, namely in
              doing good. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways.

              Causa ergo huius occultationis est non ex parte Evangelii, sed

              <i>in quibus Deus huius saeculi</i>, et cetera. Et hoc potest
              exponi tribus modis. Primo modo sic: <i>Deus huius saeculi</i>, id
              est Deus qui est dominus huius saeculi et omnium rerum creatione
              et natura, iuxta illud Ps. XXIII, 1:
              <i
                >domini est terra, et plenitudo eius, orbis terrarum, excaecavit
                mentes infidelium</i
              >, non inducendo malitiam, sed merito, imo demerito praecedentium
              peccatorum subtrahendo gratiam. Is. VI, 10:
              <i>excaeca cor populi huius</i>, et cetera. Unde et praecedentia
              peccata insinuat, cum dicit <i>infidelium</i>, quasi infidelitas
              eorum fuerit causa huius excaecationis. Secundo modo sic:
              <i>Deus huius saeculi</i>, id est Diabolus, qui dicitur Deus huius
              saeculi, id est saeculariter viventium, non creatione sed
              imitatione, qua saeculares eum imitantur. Sap. II, 25:
              <i>imitantur eum, qui sunt</i>, et cetera. Et hic excaecat
              suggerendo, trahendo et inclinando ad peccata. Et sic quando iam
              sunt in peccatis, operiuntur in tenebris peccatorum ne videant.
              Eph. IV, 18: <i>tenebris obscuratum habentes intellectum</i>, et
              cetera. Tertio modo sic: Deus habet rationem ultimi finis, et
              complementum desideriorum totius creaturae. Unde quidquid aliquis
              sibi pro fine ultimo constituit in quo eius desiderium quiescit,
              potest dici Deus illius. Unde cum habes pro fine delicias, tunc
              deliciae dicuntur Deus tuus; similiter etiam si voluptates carnis,
              vel honores. Et tunc exponitur sic: <i>Deus huius saeculi</i>, id
              est illud quod homines saeculariter viventes sibi pro fine
              constituunt, ut puta voluptates, vel divitiae et huiusmodi. Et sic
              Deus excaecat mentes, inquantum impedit ne homines lumen gratiae
              hic, et gloriae in futuro, videre possint. Ps. LVII, v. 9:
              <i>supercecidit ignis</i>, scilicet concupiscentiae,
              <i>ut non viderent solem</i>. Sic ergo excaecatio infidelium non
              est ex parte Evangelii, sed ex culpa infidelium.

              124. – The cause of this concealment is not on the part of the
              Gospel, but on account of their own guilt and malice; and this is
              what he adds: in their case the god of this world has blinded the
              minds of the unbelievers. This can be explained in three ways: in
              one way so that the god of this world, i.e. God, who is the Lord
              of this world and of all things by creation and nature: “The earth
              is the Lord’s and the fullness thereof, the world and those who
              dwell therein” (Ps. 24:1), has blinded the minds of the
              unbelievers, not by producing malice, but by the merit, or rather
              demerit of preceding sins, by withdrawing his grace: “Make the
              heart of this people fat, and their ears heavy, and shut their
              eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and
              understand with their hearts, and turn and be healed” (Is. 6:10).
              Therefore he hints at their preceding sins when he says, of
              unbelievers, as though their unbelief is the cause of this
              blindness. In a second way, so that the god of this world, i.e.,
              the devil, who is called the god of this world, i.e., of those who
              live in a worldly manner, not by reason of creation but by
              imitation, because worldly persons imitate him: “They follow him
              that are on his side” (Wis. 2:25, Vulgate). Here he blinds them by
              suggesting, by attracting and by inclining to sins. And so, when
              they are already in sin, they work in the darkness of sin, lest
              they see: “Darkened in their understanding, alienated from the
              life of God” (Eph. 4:18). In the third way thus: God has the
              nature of the ultimate end and fulfillment of the desires of every
              creature. Hence, whatever a person assigns to himself as an
              ultimate end in which his desire rests, can be called his god.
              Hence, when you have pleasure as end, pleasure is called your god,
              and the same for pleasures of the flesh and for honors. Then it is
              explained so that the god of this world, i.e., that which men
              living in a worldly way set up as their end, say pleasure or
              riches and the like. And God blinds their minds, inasmuch as he
              prevents them from seeing the light of grace here, and the light
              of glory in the future: “Fire”, namely of concupiscence, “has
              fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun” (Ps. 57:9,
              Vulgate). Thus, therefore, the blindness of unbelievers is not on
              the part of the Gospel, but from the sin of unbelievers.

              God the Father is the source of all light: “God is light and in
              him is no darkness at all” (1 Jn. 1:5). From this fountain of
              light is derived the image of this light, namely the Son, the Word
              of God: “He reflects the glory of God and bears the very stamp of
              his nature” (Heb. 1:3). Therefore, this brightness of glory and
              image of the fountain of light took our flesh and accomplished
              many glorious and divine works in this world. The disclosing of
              this light is the Gospel. Hence, the Gospel is also called the
              knowledge of the glory of Christ, which knowledge has the power to
              enlighten: “Wisdom is radiant and unfading” (Wis. 6:12). As far as
              it is concerned, it shines upon all and enlightens all. But those
              who place an obstacle are not enlightened. And this is what he
              says: the god of this world has blinded the minds of the
              unbelievers, to keep them from seeing, namely, with their
              unbelieving minds, the light of the gospel, which enlightens
              because it is the glory of Christ, i.e. his brightness: “We have
              beheld his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father” (Jn.
              1:14). This glory is Christ’s, inasmuch as he is the likeness
              [image] of God: “He is the image of the invisible God” (Col.
              1:15).

              image of God. For in order that something be perfectly an image of
              something, three things are necessary, and these three are
              perfectly in Christ. First, a likeness; second, origin; third,
              perfect equality. For if there is unlikeness between the image and
              that of which it is the image, and one does not arise from the
              other, or even if there is not perfect equality according to the
              same nature, then the notion of perfect image would not be there.
              For the likeness of a king on a coin is not called a perfect image
              of the king, because equality according to the same nature is
              lacking; but the likeness of a king in his son is called a perfect
              image of the king, because it possesses the three marks mentioned
              Therefore, since those three are present in Christ, the Son of
              God, because namely he is similar to the Father, arises from the
              Father and is equal to the Father, he is in the highest degree and
              perfectly called the image of God.

              in the Gospel. Hence it is that what we preach is not ourselves,

              not use our preaching for our praise or gain, but we refer it all
              to Christ and his praise: “We preach Christ crucified” (1 Cor.
              1:23); “That I may tell of all your works,” not mine, “in the
              gates of the daughter of Zion” (Ps. 73:28). But Jesus Christ as

              master. That is why a minister of the Church, who does not seek
              the honor of God and the welfare of his subjects, is not a true
              ruler, but a tyrant. For whoever rules well should be as a servant
              seeking the honor and profit of his subjects: “The elder shall
              serve the younger” (Gen. 25:23); “For though I am free from all

              132. – He says, therefore: God has shone on our minds to give
              light to others, and this light is our greatest treasure: “It is
              an unfailing treasure for men” (Wis. 7:14); “Abundance of
              salvation, wisdom and knowledge” (Is. 33:6). But we do not have
              that greatest treasure in a precious place, but in a lowly fragile
              thing, in order that its power may be attributed to God. Hence, he
              says, We have this treasure, i.e., that light by which we
              enlighten others, in earthen vessels, i.e., in our frail and lowly
              body: “For he knows our frame; he remembers that we are dust” (Ps.
              103:14); “Like the clay in the potter’s hand, so are you in my
              hand, O house of Israel” (Jer. 18:6); “Yet, O Lord, you are our
              Father, we are the clay” (Is. 64:8). Therefore we have it in
              earthen vessels to show that the transcendent power of that light
              belongs to God, i.e., attributed to God, and not believed to
              belong to us. For if we were rich or powerful or noble according
              to the flesh, any great good we did would be attributed not to God
              but to ourselves. But now, because we are poor and contemptible,
              such excellence is attributed to God and not to ourselves.
              Therefore, God wants us to be held in contempt and to be exposed
              to tribulations: “Lest they should say, ‘Our hand is triumphant,
              the Lord has not wrought all this’” (Deut. 32:27); “That no human
              being might boast in the presence of God” (1 Cor. 1:29); “You sent
              them as your forerunners not to speak” (Wis. 12:8).

              type of tribulation has missed us: “Through many tribulations we

              135. – Then when he says, perplexed, but not driven to despair, he
              lists the tribulations in particular. Now there are four things by
              which men are wont to be troubled; and the apostles were also
              troubled by them, namely, by external things, by the disquiet of
              their state, by injury to their reputation, and by affliction of
              their body. Therefore, in regard to the first he says, we are
              perplexed, i.e., impoverished. As if to say: we are so poor that
              we lack necessities: “To the present hour we hunger and thirst” (1
              Cor. 4:11). But we are not driven to despair, i.e., abandoned by
              God, who is our treasure. For riches are no sought for their own
              sake, but for a sufficiency of life. Hence, men who live without
              God’s help and without hope, are destitute, if they lack riches.
              But those who trust and hope in God alone, no matter how perplexed
              they be, are not destitute: “As having nothing and possessing
              everything” (2 Cor. 6:10). But this is not all, for along with
              this we are disquieted: persecuted, namely, from place to place:
              “When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next” (Matt.
              10:23), but not forsaken by God, because he offers help: “I will
              never fail you nor forsake you” (Heb. 13:5): “You, O Lord, have
              not forsaken those who seek you” (Ps. 9:10). Along with this we
              are injured in our reputation, because we are humiliated, i.e.,
              scorned and regarded as nothing: “The hour is coming when whoever
              kills you will think he is offering service to God” (Jn. 16:2);
              “Blessed are you when men hate you” (Lk. 6:22). But because when a
              man is scorned and there is reason for it, the scorned one is
              usually ashamed. But when there is not cause, he is not ashamed.
              And there was no reason for their being scorned, hence he
              continues, but not ashamed. As if to say: since there is no
              reason, we do not care: “In you, O Lord, have I hoped; let me
              never be put to shame” (Ps. 31:2). But as though these were
              trifles, he adds to the amount of tribulation, saying: struck down
              into the dangers of death, but not destroyed, i.e., we do not
              cease doing good; or we are not destroyed because God sustains us:
              “We have become, and are now, as the refuse of the world, the
              offscouring of all things” (1 Cor. 4:13); “When you shall think
              yourself consumed, you shall rise as the daystar” (Job 11:17,
              Vulgate); “We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter” (Ps.
              44:22).

              Jesus, he gives the reason for this patience. Here it should be
              noted that in Christ the process was this: having from the
              beginning of his conception a flesh that could suffer, he both
              suffered and died, yet within he was leading a spiritual life. But
              after the resurrection that spiritual and glorious life flowed
              into the body, so that his body became glorious and immortal,
              because “Christ being raised from the dead will never die again”
              (Rom. 6:9). Hence we can think of two states in the body of
              Christ, namely, of death and of glory. Hence, he says that we
              endure the perils of death and suffering patiently, in order to
              attain to the glorious life.

              Jesus” (Gal. 6:19), because we have suffered for the truth, as
              Jesus did. In our body, not only in our mind: “For your sake we
              are slain all the day long” (Ps. 44:23). That the life of Jesus,
              i.e., the life of grace which Jesus gives, or the life of glory
              which Jesus reached by his sufferings: “Was it not necessary that
              the Christ should suffer these things and enter into his glory?”
              (Lk. 24:26), may also be manifested, i.e., be evident even to
              enemies. He says therefore, in the future, namely, in the
              resurrection, or even now the life of grace, in our bodies, and
              not only in our souls: “When they had broken the wine jars, the

              not fear to die on account of the promised resurrection.” Bearing
              about, i.e., carrying it about and enduring, because wherever we
              go, we suffer and do not give up. And this so that the life of
              Jesus, which is now hidden in our hearts, may be manifested in our
              bodies, namely, when “He will change our lowly body to be like his
              glorious body” (Phil. 3:21); “You have died and your life is hid

                Since we have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, “I
                believed, and so I spoke,” we too believe, and so we speak, 14
                knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also
                with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence. 15 For it is
                all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more
                people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.

              shows how he bears the mortification of Jesus in his body;
              secondly, how he bears the life of Jesus (v. 11b); thirdly, what
              he and others have obtained from this (v. 12). He says therefore:
              I say that we bear the death of Jesus in our bodies; not that we
              might die, but because while we live with bodily life or powers,
              we are always being given up to death or dangers of death; and
              this for Jesus’ sake: “We are accounted as sheep for the
              slaughter” (Ps. 44:22). But how we carry the life of Jesus in our
              body is explained when he says, so that the immortal and
              incorruptible life of Jesus may be manifested in our now mortal
              flesh, so that our mortal flesh may put on immortality at the
              resurrection: “This mortal nature must put on immortality” (1 Cor.
              15:53). What results from this is mentioned when he continues, so
              death is at work, i.e., exercises its sway, in us, but life,
              namely, the present one, works in you, because you live in
              prosperity: “We are fools for Christ’s sake, but you are wise in
              Christ. We are weak, but you are strong” (1 Cor. 4:10). And death
              works in us a great good, namely, the attainment of spiritual
              life: “Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his
              saints” (Ps. 116:15). But the earthly life that you love works in
              you a great evil, namely, eternal death: “The wage of the
              righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin” (Prov.
              10:16): “He who loves his life loses it, and he who hates his life
              in this world will keep it for eternal life” (Jn. 12:25). Or
              another way: there were two things in Christ, namely, bodily death
              and spiritual life. He says therefore, so death is at work in us.
              As if to say: not only does spiritual life work in us, inasmuch as
              we imitate him spiritually, but death is at work, i.e., because of
              the hope of the resurrection and for the love of Christ, the marks
              of Christ’s death appear in us, inasmuch as we are exposed to the
              sufferings of death: “For your sake we are slain all the day long”
              (Ps. 44:22). But in you, only the life of Christ works, through
              which faith and the spiritual life are planted in you.

              141. – Now the cause of this certainty is the Spirit instilling
              faith into their hearts. First, therefore, he mentions this cause;
              secondly, he explains it with an example (v. 13b). He says
              therefore: the reason we hope and do not faint is that we have the
              same spirit of faith which the ancients had, because although the
              times have changed, the Spirit and the faith have not changed,
              except that they believed that the Christ would come and suffer,
              whereas we believe that he has already come and suffered. And this
              Spirit is the Holy Spirit, who is the Spirit of faith: “All these
              are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each
              one individually as he wills” (1 Cor. 12:11). Having, therefore,
              this Spirit that the ancients had, we do the same things as they
              did and we believe. But what they did is described in Ps. 116:20,
              “I have believed”, namely, God perfectly. And this is what the
              ancients did: “And all these, though well attested by their faith,
              did not receive what was promised” (Heb. 11:39). And so, namely,
              for believing, I spoke, i.e., I confessed the faith: “For man
              believes with his heart and so is justified, and he confesses with
              his lips and so is saved” (Rom. 10:10). But we do this because,
              since we believe, we speak and confess the faith and preach: “We
              cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard” (Ac. 4:20).
              Therefore the Holy Spirit is the cause of this certitude.

              14b). He says therefore, knowing, i.e., having certain knowledge,

              Trinity, will raise us also with Jesus, namely, to put on the same

              with the head: “Where I am, there shall my servant be also” (Jn.
              12:26); “He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will give life
              to your mortal bodies also through his Spirit which dwells in you”
              (Rom. 8:11). And I am certain not only of our salvation but of
              yours also, because he will bring us with you, i.e., we will be
              together. For just as we are members of Christ, so you are also

              4:17); “Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered
              together” (Matt. 24:28). Therefore he says, with you, to urge them
              to good, inasmuch as he shows that they are not inferiors but

              place us with you; therefore we do not lose heart, namely, in our
              tribulations, i.e., we are reduced to the state in which we cannot
              bear and endure more for Christ. For to lose heart is the same as
              not being able to bear: “I was wearied, not being able to bear it”

              as to the outward man, we are always renewed as to the inward man.
              Hence, he says, though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner
              nature is being renewed every day. Here it should be noted that by
              occasion of these words a certain heretic, Tertullian by name,
              said that the rational soul, which is in the body of a man, has a
              bodily shape and bodily members, just as the body has; and this is
              called the inward man. This, of course, is false. Hence, to
              understand the passage, it must be known that even according to
              the Philosopher in <i>Ethics</i> 9.9, and according to the way we
              speak, each thing is said to be that which is most important in
              it. For example, the most important thing in the city is the power
              and the council, so that whatever the power and council do, the
              city is said to do. Now something can be judged the most important
              thing in man either in truth or according to appearance. In truth
              the most important thing in man is the mind. Hence, according to
              the judgment of spiritual men, the mind is called the inward man.
              But according to appearance, the most important thing is the
              outward body with its senses. Hence, according to the judgment of
              those who consider only bodily and sense-perceptible things and
              savor earthly things, and whose god is the belly, the body with
              the sense is called the outward man.

              fuit in integritate condita et, si in illa integritate

              etiam vetustas poenae. Unde ibi erit consummata renovatio. Ps.

              is speaking here when he says, though our outer nature, i.e., the
              body with its sentient nature, is wasting away, in tribulations,
              fasts, abstinences and watchings: “Our old self was crucified with
              him” (Rom. 6:6); “Rottenness enters into my bones” (Hab. 3:16),
              yes this man, who is inner, namely, the mind or reason
              strengthened with the shield of faith, is being renewed. This
              should be understood in the following way: oldness is the road to
              corruption: “And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is
              ready to vanish away” (Heb. 8:13). But human nature was
              established in wholeness, and if it had continued in that
              wholeness, it would have always been new. But through sin it began
              to be corrupted. As a result, whatever followed, such as
              ignorance, difficulty in doing good, inclination to evil,
              punishment, and so on, all pertain to oldness. Therefore, when
              such a human nature gets rid of the results of sin, it is said to
              be renewed. Such riddance begins in the saints here, but is
              perfectly completed in heaven. For here the oldness of sin is put
              off; for the spirit removes the oldness of sin and is subjected to
              the newness of justice. Here the intellect removes errors and
              assumes the newness of truth. It is according to this that the
              inner man, namely, the soul, is renewed: “Be renewed in the spirit
              of your minds” (Eph. 4:23). But in heaven, even the oldness of
              punishment is removed. Hence, there will be a complete renewal
              there: “Your youth is renewed like the eagle’s” (Ps. 103:5). But
              because the saints advance daily in purity of conscience and
              knowledge of divine things, he says, every day: “Ascending in his
              heart” (Ps. 84:7, Vulgate). Consequently, patience is
              unconquerable, because it is renewed from day to day.

              of itself slight and, as it were, imperceptible. Hence, he says,
              this, i.e., the least: “For a brief moment I forsook you” (Is.
              54:7). Likewise it is transitory; hence he says, present, i.e., in
              this life, which is one of affliction and toil: “The life of man
              is warfare” (Job 7:1, Vulgate). Likewise it lasts a short time;
              hence he says, momentary: “For a moment I hid my face from you”

              eternity is only momentary. Likewise it is light; hence he says,

              because in contrast to what is this, he places beyond all measure:
              “I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth
              comparing to the glory that is to be revealed to us” (Rom. 8:18).
              But on the other hand: “He will give to each one according to his
              works” (Matt. 16:27). Therefore it will not be beyond all measure.
              I answer that the word “according” does not denote an equality of
              amount, as though a person will be rewarded so much for so much
              merit, but an equality of proportion, so that one who merits more
              will receive more reward. Likewise, against that which is in the
              present he places exceedingly, i.e., in an excellent state without
              disturbance: “I will make you ride upon the heights of the earth”
              (Is. 58:14). Against that which is momentary, he places eternal:
              “Everlasting joy shall be upon their heads” (Is. 35:10). Against
              that which is light he places a weight. He says, weight for two
              reasons: first, because a weight inclines and draws to its motion
              all things under it. In the same way eternal glory will be so
              great that it will make the whole man glorious in soul and in
              body. There will be nothing in man that does not follow the
              impulse of glory. Or it is called weight, because it is precious,
              for only precious things are weighed. Against that which is called
              tribulation he places of glory. Or of glory can be common to the
              other four, which are said of the state of glory, so that of
              tribulation is common to the four which are said of the present
              life. It is preparing, namely, above the tribulations we suffer,
              for these are the cause and merit for which God confers that glory
              on us. And so the patience of the saints is unconquerable, their
              reward ineffable, and the recompense of their reward right and
              delightful.

              seen but to the things that are unseen. As if to say: although the
              things we hope for are still to come, and in the meantime our body
              is corrupted, nevertheless, we are renewed, because we do not pay
              attention to those temporal things, but to eternal. And this is
              what he says: it works in us a weight of glory. In us, I say, not

              i.e., earthly things, but to the things that are unseen, namely,
              heavenly things: “Forgetting what lies behind and straining
              forward to what lies ahead” (Phil. 3:13); “Eye has not seen nor
              ear heard, nor the heart of man conceived, God has prepared for
              those who love him” (1 Cor. 2:9). And why do we look on heavenly
              things? Because the things that are seen, i.e., earthly things,
              are transient and temporal, but the things that are unseen,
              namely, heavenly things, are eternal: “My salvation will be

              heavenly glory, he says, For we know. As if to say according to a
              Gloss [Lombard]: indeed he works in us a weight of glory, because
              this glory will be not only in our souls, but in our bodies. For,
              i.e., because we know, i.e., are certain, because we already have
              it in hope, that if our earthly tent, i.e., the body. For as has
              been said, man is called a mind, since that is the most important
              thing in man. Now this mind is to the body as a man is to a house.
              For just as the man living in a house is not destroyed, when the
              house is destroyed, but he continues to exist, so when the body is
              destroyed, the mind, i.e., the rational soul, is not destroyed,
              but continues to exist. The body, therefore, is called the earthly
              tent we live in: “Those who dwell in houses of clay, whose
              foundation is in the dust, who are crushed before the moth” (Job
              4:19). Is Destroyed, i.e., dissolved. We know, I say, we have a
              building from God, i.e., prepared by God; a building, I say, a
              house not made with hands, i.e., not a work of man or of nature,
              but an incorruptible body, which we shall assume. It is not made
              with hands, because incorruptibility in our bodies is the result
              of a divine action alone: “He will change our lowly body to be
              like his glorious body” (Phil. 3:21). Eternal in the heavens,
              i.e., a house prepared for us from all eternity: “A tabernacle
              that shall never be destroyed in heaven” (Is. 33:20, Vulgate);
              “Your reward shall be great in heaven” (Matt. 5:12). This
              exchange, namely, to get a heavenly home for an earthly one, is
              what Job desired: “All the days of my service I would wait, till
              my release should come” (Job 14:14).

              with the Apostle’s meaning, nor with what preceded and what
              follows. For when he is dealing with one continuous subject, he
              does not interject another. Therefore, let us see what the Apostle
              really means, for he wants to show that the saints are reasonable
              in enduring the tribulations by which the present life is
              destroyed, because this results in obtaining glory at once, and
              not a glorified body, as the Gloss says. Therefore he says: the
              reason we endure these things is that we know, i.e., we hold it as
              certain, that if the earthly tent we live in, i.e., the body, is
              destroyed, i.e., corrupted by death, we have at once, not in hope
              but in reality, a better house, namely, a building, a house not
              made with hands, i.e., heavenly glory, not a glorified body. Of
              this house it says in John (14:2): “In my Father’s house are many
              rooms.” This house is from God, not made with hands, because
              eternal glory is God himself: “Be a rock of refuge for me, a
              strong fortress to save me” (Ps. 31:2), and eternal in the literal
              sense, because it is the eternal God. In the heavens, i.e., on
              high, because as soon as the body is dead, the holy soul obtains
              this glory, not in hope but in reality. For thus even before the
              body is dissolved, we have this home in hope.

              real proof that we have a house not made with hands, because if
              the desire of nature is not in vain, much less is the desire of
              grace in vain. Therefore, since we have a most fervent desire of
              grace for heavenly glory, it is impossible for it to be in vain;
              and this is what he says, we groan, i.e., groaning we desire,
              namely with our soul’s desire that we are delayed: “Woe is me that
              I sojourn in Meshech” (Ps. 120:5). We groan, I say, and long to
              put on our dwelling, i.e., the enjoyment of glory, which is from
              heaven, i.e., heavenly. It is called a dwelling because the saints
              dwell in that glory as their place of consolation: “Enter into the
              joy of the Lord” (Matt. 25:21). In saying, to put on, he is
              stating that the heavenly home of which he spoke above is not
              something separated from man, but something inhering in him. For a
              man is not said to put on a house, but clothes, but he inhabits a
              house. In this way he shows that the desire is for something that
              inheres, because it is put on, and something which contains and
              exceeds because it is inhabited.

              157. – But because he did not merely say, “put on” (indui), but
              “put on over” (superindui), he gives the reason for this, when he
              says, so that by putting it on we may not be found naked. As if to
              say: if the soul were to put on a heavenly dwelling, in such a way
              that the earthly dwelling were not taken off, i.e., in such a way
              that our body were not dissolved by death, the attainment of that
              heavenly dwelling would be “to be put on over”. But because it is
              necessary to be divested of that earthly dwelling, if the heavenly
              is to be put on, it cannot be a “putting on over”, but simply a
              “putting on.” Hence he says, so that by putting it on we may not
              be found naked. As if to say: we would indeed be putting on over,
              if we were found clothed and not naked. For a naked person is not
              said to be clothed over, but to be clothed. But a Gloss [Lombard]
              explains it as a spiritual dress, saying: “We desire to be clothed
              over, and this will indeed be done, but under this condition, that
              we be found clothed, namely, with the virtues, and not naked,
              namely, of the virtues.” Of this clothing it says in Colossians
              (3:12): “Put on then, as God’s chosen ones, holy and beloved,
              compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness, and patience.” As if to
              say: no one will attain to this glory, unless he has the virtues.
              But this explanation does not seem to agree with the Apostle’s
              intention.

              of grace, because we would prefer to be found clothed and not
              naked, i.e., we would prefer that the soul attain to glory without
              the body’s being dissolved by death. The reason for this is that
              there is a natural desire in the soul to be united to the body;
              otherwise, death would not be a punishment. And this is what he
              says: For while we are still in this tent, i.e., who live in this
              mortal body: “Since I know that the putting off of my body (tent)
              will be soon” (2 Pet. 1:14), we sigh, i.e., inwardly in the heart,
              and not outwardly with our voice: “We moan and moan like doves”
              (Is. 59:11), because it is hard to think of death, and yet
              burdened as with something against our desire, in that we cannot
              attain to glory without the putting off of the body. This is so
              much against our natural desire that, as Augustine says, not even
              old age itself could remove the fear of death from Peter. And so
              he says, not that we would be unclothed, namely, of our earthly
              tent, but that we would be further clothed with super-heavenly
              glory, or, according to a Gloss, with a glorified body. But
              because it could seem unbecoming that the body, on the one hand
              should be corruptible of its very nature, if it had not been
              dissolved before, and, on the other hand, glorified, he mentions
              the way in which he would like this to happen, saying, so that
              what is mortal may be swallowed up by life. As if to say: we do
              not desire to be clothed over in such a way that the body remains
              mortal, but so that the glory take away corruption altogether from
              the body without its dissolution. Hence he says, so that what is
              mortal, i.e., the very corruption of the body, may be swallowed up
              by life, i.e., glory: “Death is swallowed up in victory” (1 Cor.
              15:54).

              160. – Here he discloses the author of the supernatural desire for
              a heavenly dwelling. For the cause of a natural desire that we be
              not despoiled is that the soul is naturally united to the body,
              and vice versa. But the desire to be clothed upon with a heavenly
              dwelling is not from nature but from God. Hence, he says, he who
              has prepared us for this very thing is God. As if to say: we wish
              to put on the heavenly dwelling, but in such a way as not to lose
              the earthly one. And yet it is God who effects in us the desire to
              be thus clothed over: “God is at work in you, both to will and to
              work for his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13). The reason for this is
              that upon every nature follows a desire suited to the end of that
              nature, as something heavy naturally tends downward and seeks to
              rest there. But if a thing’s desire is above its nature, that
              thing is not moved to that end naturally, but by something else,
              which is above its nature. Now it is evident that to enjoy eternal
              glory and to see God by his essence, although it is appropriate to
              a rational creature, is above its nature. Therefore, the rational
              creature is not moved to desire this by nature, but by God
              himself, who prepared us for this very thing.

              the Spirit as a guarantee [pledge]. In regard to this it should be
              noted that God produces natural desires and supernatural desires
              in us: the natural, when he gives us a natural spirit suited to
              human nature: “God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life”
              (Gen. 2:7); but he gives the supernatural desires when he infuses
              in us the supernatural spirit, i.e., the Holy Spirit. Therefore he
              says, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee, i.e., the Holy
              Spirit producing in us the certainty of this thing, with which we
              desire to be filled: “You were sealed with the Holy Spirit, which
              is the guarantee of our inheritance” (Eph. 1:13-14). He says,
              pledge, because a pledge has as much value as the thing for which
              it is given; but it differs from the thing for which it is given
              in this way, namely, that the thing is possessed with a fuller
              right, when it is already had, than the pledge is. For the thing
              is possessed as one’s own, but the pledge is kept and held as
              though giving assurance that the thing will be possessed. So it is
              with the Holy Spirit: because the Holy Spirit has as much value as
              heavenly glory. But there is a difference in the way he is
              possessed, because now we have him as a surety of obtaining that
              glory; but in heaven we shall have him as something now possessed
              by us. For then we shall have him perfectly, but now imperfectly.
              In this way, therefore, is grace’s desire deferred by a natural
              desire.

              always of good courage [always daring], knowing that while we are
              at home in the body we are away from the Lord. Properly speaking,
              to dare is to involve oneself in dangers of death and not to yield
              through fear. But although the saints naturally fear death, yet
              they dare to face the dangers of death and not yield because of a
              fear of death: “The righteous are bold as a lion” (Prov. 28:1);
              “In his days he feared not the prince” (Sir. 48:13, Vulgate).

              prolonged” (Ps. 120:5, Vulgate). We are absent inasmuch as we are
              outside our native land, which is God. Otherwise, we would not be
              described as away from him. And this is not from our nature, but

              for we walk by faith, i.e., we pass through this life in faith,
              and not by sight: because faith deals with things not seen. For
              the word of faith is as a lamp with which the road is lit in this
              life: “Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light for my steps”
              (Ps. 119:105). But in heaven there will be no such lamp, because
              the radiance of God, i.e., God himself, has enlightened it (Rev.
              21:23). Therefore, we shall then see him by sight, i.e., in his
              essence. But he says, we walk by faith, because faith is concerned
              with things unseen: “Faith is the substance of things hoped for;
              the conviction of things not seen” (Heb. 11:1). But as long as the
              soul is united to the body, it does not see God in his essence:
              “No man shall see me and live” (Ex. 33:20). Hence, inasmuch as we
              assent by believing the things we do not see, we are said to walk
              by faith and not by sight. Thus, therefore, the incompatibility of
              the two desires is plain, because we cannot, along with this body,
              be clothed over by the heavenly habitation, the proof of this
              being that we walk by faith.

              audacia. Ideo dicit <i>audemus</i>. Aliud importat imperfectionem

              165. – He follows with the victory of the one desire, namely, of
              grace, when he says, we are of good courage and would rather be
              away from the body. This should be read as follows: knowing what
              was said above, i.e., that while we are at home in the body we are
              away from the Lord [we dare and have a good will]. He says two
              things: one implies the repugnance he has in willing, a repugnance
              caused by the fear of death. For where there is no fear, there is
              no daring. For the fear of death springs from our nature’s desire,
              but the daring of grace’s desire. Therefore, he says, we dare. The
              other implies an imperfection of the soul in desiring, because
              unless we desired properly, the fear of death would not be
              overcome, since it is quite natural. Therefore, it is not only
              necessary to dare, but also to have a good will, i.e., to will
              gladly. For although, according to the Philosopher, in the act of
              courage, joy is not required for the perfection of the virtue as
              it is in the other virtues, but only not to be sad. Yet because
              the courage of the saints is more perfect, they are not only not
              sad at the dangers of death, but they rejoice: “My desire is to
              depart and be with Christ” (Phil. 1:23). But what do we dare?
              Rather to be away from the body, i.e., to be separated from the
              body by its dissolution, which is contrary to the desire of
              nature, and at home with the Lord, i.e., to walk by sight, which
              is the desire of grace. He desired this who said in Psalm 42 (v.
              5): “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God.”

              mansions until the day of judgment. For the saints dared and
              desired in vain to be away from the body, if they would not be
              present to God when separated from the body. Therefore, the answer
              is that the saints see the essence of God immediately after death

              twelve tribes of Israel” (Matt. 19:28). Therefore, not all will be
              before the tribunal to be judged. I answer that there are two
              things in a judgment, namely, a discussion of merits, and as to
              this not all will be judged, because those who have completely
              renounced Satan and all him pomps, and have clung to Christ in all
              things, will not be judged, because they are gods already. But
              those who did not adhere to Christ in any way, neither by faith
              nor works, will also not need discussion. But those who have
              something with Christ, namely, faith, and in something have
              withdrawn from him, namely by evil works and wicked desires, will
              be discussed as to the things they committed against Christ.
              Hence, as to this, only sinful Christians will be manifested
              before the judgment seat of Christ. But sentence will also be
              pronounced during the judgment; and as to this, all will be
              manifested. But it seems that children will be exempt, because he
              says, so that each one may receive good or evil according to what
              he has done in the body. But children have done nothing in the
              body. This is answered by a Gloss [Lombard]: for they will not be
              judged for the things they did by themselves, but for the things
              they did through others, when they believed or did not believe,
              were baptized or not baptized through them. Or they will be
              condemned for the sin of their first parents.

              whereas they are good; or good, whereas they are evil. The reason
              for this is that hearts are not manifest. But in that judgment
              there will be absolutely perfect certainty, because there will be
              a manifestation of hearts. Hence, he says, be manifested:
              “Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the
              Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in
              darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart” (1 Cor.

              judge men in the same form in which he was judged by men, so that
              appearing in human form, he may be seen by the good and by the
              evil; for the wicked cannot see the glory of God: “And has given
              him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of man”
              (Jn. 5:27). “Tribunal” implies juridical power, and is taken from
              an ancient custom of the Romans, who chose three tribunes of the
              people, whose function was to pass judgment on the excesses of
              consuls and senators. Their places were called tribunals.

              he has done: “He will render to each one according to his works”

              with bodily movement, but for those accomplished by the mind;
              otherwise, unbelievers would not be punished. Therefore, when he
              says, in the body, it is understood to mean things performed while
              he lived in the body.

              177. – To them, I say, who pride themselves on a man’s position
              and not on his heart [who glory in face and not in heart]. This
              can be explained in three ways. First, they glory in face, i.e.,
              in the external observances of the Law, because that is what they
              taught, and not in heart, i.e., in the virtue of Christ, which is
              in the heart, unlike the Apostle, who in virtue of the cross of
              Christ, said: “Far be it from me to glory except in the cross of
              our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal. 6:14). Likewise they glory in face,
              i.e., in the presence of men, as hypocrites do, and not in heart,
              i.e., in the testimony of conscience, as the Apostle says above (2
              Cor. 1:12): “For our boast is this, the testimony of our
              conscience.” Or they glory in face, because they pretend some
              things outwardly, which they do not feel in the heart, namely,
              that they claimed to have been instructed by the apostles and were
              following their doctrine, which on the contrary they were trying
              to destroy. It is clear, therefore, how the Apostle procured the
              salvation of his neighbor by teaching.

              is for God; if we are in our right mind [if we are sober], it is

              commending himself, and sober when he is not speaking of his own
              commendation. According to this he is saying: no matter how we

              neighbor; for if we are beside ourselves, i.e., commend ourselves,
              it is for God, i.e., for the honor of God or for observing God’s
              judgment; if we are in our right mind [if we are sober], i.e., not

              179. – But there is another and more literal sense. I say that we
              give you opportunity for glorying in us, because in everything we
              do and even in the way we do it, we intend your good. Hence it
              should be noted that the apostles were midway between God and the
              people: “While I stood between the Lord and you at that time”
              (Deut. 5:5). Therefore, they were required to draw from God
              whatever they poured out upon the people. Hence it was necessary
              that sometimes they raised themselves to God by contemplation to
              obtain heavenly things, and sometimes conformed themselves to the
              people to deliver what they had received from God; and all this
              tended to their profit. Hence he says, for if we are beside
              ourselves, i.e., raised to the state of receiving gifts of graces,
              and this in order to be united to God, which is done by means of
              temporal things: “I said in my vision” (Ps. 116:11, Vulgate);
              Dionysius: “Divine love causes ecstasy.” If we are in our right
              mind, i.e., adapt ourselves to you by delivering God’s precepts,
              it is for you, i.e., for your benefit. This sobriety is not
              opposed to inebriation in wine, which brings wars on earth, but to
              that inebriation which is from the Holy Spirit and draws men to
              divine things and about which Song of Songs (5:1) says: “Eat, O
              friends, and drink: drink deeply, O lovers!” For that sobriety is
              for the benefit of our neighbor, but the inebriation is for the
              love of God. Such a descent was signified by the descent of the
              angels on the ladder which Jacob saw (Gen. 28:12): “You will see
              heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon
              the Son of man” (Jn. 1:51).

              explained in three ways. First, as if to say that all have died
              with the death of sin in Adam. For it would not have been
              necessary for Christ to suffer for all, if all were not dead with
              the death of Adam’s sin: “For as in Adam all die, so also in
              Christ shall all be made alive” (1 Cor. 15:22). Secondly, as if to
              say: all have died, namely, to the old life. For Christ died to
              remove sins; therefore, all should die to the old life, namely, of
              sin, and live the life of justice: “The death he died he died to
              sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you
              also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in
              Christ Jesus” (Rom. 6:10-11). Thirdly, and more literally, all
              have died, i.e., each person should regard himself as though dead
              to himself: “You have died and your life is hid with Christ in
              God” (Col. 3:3).

              1 Th. 5:10; 1 Jn. 4:9)). Hence he continues, that those who live
              might live, namely, with a natural life, no longer for themselves,
              i.e., solely for themselves and their own good, but for him who
              for their sake died and was raised, namely, for Christ, i.e., he
              should direct his whole life to the service and honor of Christ:
              “It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me” (Gal.
              2:20); “Forget not the kindness of your surety, for he has given
              his life for you” (Sir. 29:20, Vulgate). The reason for these
              things is that everyone who acts takes the rule of his work from
              the end. Hence, if Christ is the end of our life, we should
              regulate our life not according to our will but according to
              Christ’s will. For this is what Christ himself said: “For I have
              come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of him
              who sent me” (Jn. 6:38)

              Christus resurrexit pro nobis, et nos debemus ita mori peccato et
              veteri vitae et nobis ipsis, quod tamen resurgamus ad novam vitam
              Christi. Rom. VI, 4:

                nos in novitate</i
              >, et cetera. Et propter hoc dominus non dixit solum:
              <i>abneget semetipsum et tollat crucem suam</i>, sed addidit
              <i>et sequatur me</i>, scilicet in novitate vitae, proficiendo in
              virtutibus. Ps. LXXXIII, 8: <i>ibunt de virtute in virtutem</i>,

              and that he rose for us; wherein two things are required of us.
              For since he dies for us, we, too, should die to ourselves, i.e.,
              deny ourselves for him: “If any man would come after me, let him
              deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow me” (Lk.
              9:23). This is the same as saying: let him die to himself. But
              because Christ rose for us, we should so die to sin and to the old
              life and to ourselves that we might rise to the new life of
              Christ: “So that as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory
              of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life” (Rom. 6:4).
              This is why the Lord not only said, “Let him deny himself and take
              up his cross,” but added, “and follow me,” namely, in newness of
              life, by advancing in the virtues: “They shall go from virtue to
              virtue” (Ps. 84:7, Vulgate).

              188. – He says therefore: inasmuch as I am so certain of eternal
              glory, From now on, therefore, we regard no one from a human point
              of view [according to the flesh]. Here it should be noted that
              according to the flesh is a restriction and can be explained in
              two ways according to the possible connections that can be made.
              In one way, so according to the flesh is connected with no one. In
              this case, a Gloss explains it thus: we regard, i.e., approve of
              no one according to the flesh, i.e., living carnally. This is the
              way “flesh” is taken in Romans (8:9): “You are not in the flesh,
              you are in the Spirit.” In another way, we regard, i.e., approve
              of, no one according to the flesh, i.e., living according to the
              carnal observances of the Law. This is the way “flesh” is taken in
              Philippians (3:4): “Who have confidence in the flesh,” i.e., the
              carnal observances of the Law. In a third way, we regard, i.e.,
              consider, no one according to the flesh, i.e., according to the
              corruption of the flesh. For although the faithful still have
              corruptible flesh, yet in hope they already have an incorruptible
              body. Hence, they do not consider themselves from the point of
              view that they have corruptible flesh now, but that they shall
              have an incorruptible body. This is the way “flesh” is taken in 1
              Corinthians (15:50): “Flesh and blood shall not inherit the
              kingdom of God.” But according to the flesh can be taken in
              another way, namely, as connected with the verb, we regard. Then
              the sense is this: I say that inasmuch as we should not live for
              ourselves but for him who died for us, then from now on, we regard
              no one according to the flesh, i.e., we do not follow carnal
              affection in anyone or regard him in this light. This is the way
              Deuteronomy (33:9) should be understood: “Who said of his father
              and mother, ‘I regard them not’; he disowned his brothers, and
              ignored his children.” In this way, according to the flesh is
              referred to the knower, but in the first explanation to the object
              known.

              Manichaeus adducebat verba ista pro se in fulcimentum sui erroris.
              Ipse enim dicebat Christum non habuisse verum corpus, nec fuisse
              ex semine David natum. Et sic Augustinus dicit in libro contra
              Faustum: si quis contra eum allegaret verbum apostoli ad Rom. I,
              3: <i>qui factus est ei ex semine David secundum carnem</i>, et

              <i
                >memor esto dominum Iesum Christum resurrexisse a mortuis ex
                semine David</i
              >, etc., respondebat, quod apostolus aliquando fuerat huius
              opinionis, scilicet quod fuisset ex semine David et quod verum
              corpus habuisset, sed postea hanc opinionem mutavit et correxit se
              hic. Unde dicebat
              <i>et si cognovimus secundum carnem Christum</i>, id est si
              fuerimus aliquando huius opinionis, quod Christus habuisset veram
              carnem, <i>sed nunc iam non novimus</i>, id est modo mutavimus
              illam opinionem et non credimus ita. Quod quidem dupliciter
              improbat Augustinus. Primo quia de eo, quod falso putamus, nullus
              dicit novimus, sed opinamur. Cum ergo apostolus utatur hic hoc
              verbo <i>cognovimus</i>, videtur quod non aliquando falso
              putaverit. Secundo quia supra apostolus dicit
              <i>neminem novimus secundum carnem</i>. Si ergo verum esset quod
              dicit Manichaeus, apostolus nullum cognosceret habere verum
              corpus, quod est falsum. Est ergo falsum quod Manichaeus dicit.

              Christ according to the flesh, he excludes this, saying: even
              though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we
              regard him thus no longer. In regard to this it should be noted
              that Manicheus appealed to those words to support his error. For
              he said that Christ did not have a true body and was not born of
              the seed of David. This is the way Augustine puts it in the book,
              Against Faustus: If anyone alleged against him the words of the
              Apostle to the Romans (1:3), “Who was descended from David
              according to the flesh,” and to Timothy (1 Tim. 3:16), “Great
              indeed, we confess, is the mystery of our religion, which was
              manifested in the flesh” (and 2 Tim 2:8), “Remember Jesus Christ,
              risen from the dead, descended from David, as preached in my
              gospel,” he answered that the Apostle was first of the opinion
              that he was of the seed of David and that he had a true body, but
              he changed that opinion later to correct himself; that is why he
              said, even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of
              view, we regard him thus no longer, i.e., we have changed our
              opinion and no longer believe that. But Augustine disproves this
              in two ways. First, because no one says, “we regarded,” but “we
              are of the opinion,” when speaking of something he falsely held.
              Therefore, when the Apostle uses the words, “we regarded” it does
              not seem that he once held something false. Secondly, because the
              Apostle says, we regard no one from a human point of view.
              Therefore, if what Manicheus says were true, the Apostle would
              have known no one to have a true body, which is false. Therefore
              what Manicheus says is false.

              the truth, and this in two ways. In one way so that flesh is taken
              for the corruption of the flesh: “Flesh and blood cannot inherit
              the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the
              imperishable” (1 Cor. 15:50). Then the sense is this: if we once
              regarded Christ from a human point of view, i.e., to have
              corruptible flesh before the passion, we regard him thus no
              longer, namely, that he has corruptible flesh, because it says in
              Romans (6:9): “Christ being raised from the dead will never die
              again; death no longer has dominion over him.” In another way
              according to a Gloss [Lombard], so that the clause, even though we
              once regarded Christ from a human point of view, is referred to
              Paul’s condition before his conversion; then what follows, we
              regard him thus no longer, refers to his state after conversion.
              Then the sense is this: both I and other Jews once, i.e., before
              my conversion, knew Christ according to the flesh, i.e., according
              to what we thought of Christ in the Law. But now, i.e., after I
              was converted, we regard him thus no longer, i.e., this opinion
              ceased. Indeed I believe that he is true God and that he should
              not be worshipped with carnal observance. Hence, he said to the
              Galatians (5:2): “If you receive circumcision, Christ will be of
              no advantage to you.”

              statement, even though we once regarded Christ from a human point
              of view, is made by the Apostle in the person of all the apostles
              of Christ. In this way it seems to correspond to the last
              explanation of the statement, we regard no one from a human point
              of view. Hence it should be noted that when Augustine explains
              John (16:17): “It is to your advantage that I go away,” where the
              Lord’s reason is given as being, “For if I do not go away, the
              Counselor will not come to you,” he says that this was because the
              disciples were attracted toward him as a man in the flesh to a
              friend in the flesh. As a result, they could not be raised to a
              spiritual love, which causes one to suffer many things even for a
              person who is absent. Therefore, in order to plant in them a
              spiritual affection, which is from the Holy Spirit, and root out
              the carnal one, the Lord said to them: “Peace be with you” (Jn.
              20:21). Therefore, the Apostle in the person of all the disciples
              recalled this and said, even though we once regarded, i.e., if we
              have clung to Christ at one time, namely, when he was present with
              us in his bodily presence, according to the flesh, i.e., with
              carnal love, we regard him thus no longer, i.e., that affection
              ceased in us by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.

              concludes from the foregoing that a certain effect follows,
              namely, newness in the world. Hence he says, if anyone is in
              Christ, i.e., in the faith of Christ, or through Christ, he is a
              new creation [creature]: “For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
              nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but faith working through
              love” (Gal. 5:6). Here it should be noted that renewal by grace is
              called a creature. For creation is a change from nothing to
              existence. But there are two kinds of existence, namely, of nature
              and of grace. The first creation was made when creatures were
              produced by God from nothing to exist in nature; and then the
              creature was new, but became old by sin: “He has made my flesh and
              my skin waste away” (Lam. 3:4). Therefore, a new creation was
              required by which we would be produced to exist in grace. This,
              too, is a creation from nothing because those who lack grace are
              nothing: “And if I understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and
              if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love,
              I am nothing” (1 Cor. 13:2); “In his tent,” i.e., of sin, “dwells
              that which is none of his” (Job 18:15). Augustine says: “For sin
              is nothing, and men become nothing, when they sin.” So it is clear
              that the infusion of grace is a creation.

              passed away, behold, the new has come. This of course was taken
              from Leviticus (26:10), where it says: “And you shall clear out
              the old to make way for the new.” From this he argues thus: if all
              things have been made new, and according to the Law when new
              things come, the old things shall be cast away, then if there be
              any new creature, the old has passed away, i.e., they should pass
              away from it. But the old things that should pass away are the
              legal observances: “So that we serve not under the old written
              code but in the new life of the Spirit” (Rom. 7:6), and in the
              errors of the Gentiles: “The old error is gone” (Is. 26:3,
              Vulgate); likewise the corruption of sin: “We know that our old
              self was crucified with him so that the sinful body might be
              destroyed, and we might no longer be enslaved to sin” (Rom. 6:6).
              When such things pass from us, the virtues contrary to these vices
              should be renewed: “And he who sat upon the throne said, ‘Behold,
              I make all things new’” (Rev. 21:5).

              reconciliation to God. And this is what he says, all this is from
              God, namely, God the Father, who reconciled us to God, i.e., made
              peace between us and God. And this is by Christ, i.e., by the
              Incarnate Word. For men were enemies of God because of sin, but
              Christ removed this enmity from their midst, satisfying for sin
              and producing harmony: “Whether on earth or in heaven, making
              peace by the blood of his cross” (Col. 1:20). Therefore he says,
              through Christ: “We were reconciled to God by the death of his
              Son” (Rom. 5:10). But a special gift was conferred on the
              apostles, namely, that they are ministers of this reconciliation.

              you and your God” (Is. 59:2). Therefore, sin being destroyed by

              said to have reconciled us to himself, inasmuch as he does not
              impute our sins to us: “Blessed is the man to whom the Lord
              imputes no iniquity (Ps. 32:2). Then when he says, and entrusting
              to us the message of reconciliation, he explains the second thing,
              namely, the benefit conferred on the apostles. As if to say: he
              has given us the mystery of reconciliation in this way, namely,
              that he has entrusted to us the message of reconciliation, i.e.,
              he has given the power and has inspired in our hearts to announce
              to the world that this reconciliation was made by Christ. By doing
              this we induce men to conform themselves to Christ by baptism:
              “Behold, I have put my words in your mouth” (Jer. 1:9).

              need is there to be reconciled? For we are already reconciled. I
              answer that God reconciled us to himself as efficient cause,
              namely, on his part, but in order that it be meritorious for us,
              it is necessary that reconciliation be made on our part, namely,
              in baptism and in penance. And then we cease from sins.

              201. – Where we get the faculty to reconcile to God is indicated
              by the fact that he gave us the power to live justly and abstain
              from sins. By doing this we are reconciled to God. Hence he says,
              for our sake, he made him to be sin who knew no sin. As if to say:
              you can be reconciled to God, because he, namely, Christ, who knew
              no sin: “He committed no sin; no guile was found on his lips” (1
              Pet. 2:22); “Which of you convicts me of sin?” (Jn. 8:46). For our
              sake, he made him to be sin. This can be explained in three ways.
              In one way because it was the custom of the Old Law to call a
              sacrifice for sin “sin”: “They feed on the sin of my people” (Hos.
              4:8), i.e., the offerings for sin. Then the sense is: he made him
              to be sin, i.e., the victim of sacrifice for sin. In another way,
              because sin is sometimes taken for the likeness of sin, or the
              punishment of sin: “God sending his own Son in the likeness of
              sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh” (Rom.
              8:3). Then the sense is: he made him to be sin, i.e., made him
              assume mortal and suffering flesh. In a third way, because one
              thing is said to be this or that, not because it is so, but
              because man considers it such. Then the sense is: he made him to
              be sin, i.e., made him regarded a sinner: “He was numbered with
              the transgressors” (Is. 53:12).

              is like a strong city” (Prov. 18:19); or helping, namely, God: “We
              are God’s helpers” (1 Cor. 3:9). But this seems contrary to Isaiah
              (40:9): “Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord?” (Is. 40:13).
              Therefore it is not correct to say, helping God. I answer that to
              help God can be taken to mean that a person gives God the power to
              do something. In this sense, no one helps God or can help him; or
              to mean that a person carries out his commandment. Then holy men
              are said to help God by carrying out his commands. We, I say, so
              helping do entreat [exhort] you: “He that exhorts, in his
              exhortation” (Rom. 12:8), not to accept the grace of God in vain.
              As if to say: let not the reception of grace be useless and vain
              for you, which it is when a person does not perceive the fruit of
              the grace he received. This fruit is twofold: the remission of
              sins: “And this will be the full fruit of the removal of his sin”
              (Is. 27:9); and that a man by living righteously attain to
              heavenly glory: “The return [fruit] you get is sanctification”
              (Rom. 6:22). Therefore, whoever does not use the grace he has
              received for avoiding sin and obtaining eternal life, receives the
              grace of God in vain: “I did not run in vain or labor in vain”
              (Phil. 2:16).

              206. – He says therefore: I say that you should be prepared to
              receive this grace fruitfully, which has been conferred on you or
              prepared for you, for the Lord says as much in Is. (44:8): “In a
              time of favor I have answered you.” In regard to this it should be
              noted that the Lord is said to make grace for us either by hearing
              us in our petitions or by helping us in our actions. But he hears
              that we might receive what we ask: “If any of you lacks wisdom,
              let him ask God, who gives to all men generously and without
              reproaching, and it will be given him” (Jas. 1:5); “If the LORD
              had not been my help, my soul would soon have dwelt in the land of
              silence” (Ps. 94:17). This grace is of two kinds: prevenient and
              cooperating, i.e., subsequent, which it is necessary for us to
              obtain. First of all, prevenient grace, which we ought to desire
              in order to be accepted by God: “Therefore let every one who is
              godly offer prayer to you” (Ps. 32:6). As to this he says, At an
              acceptable time, i.e., for accepting and being put in the state of
              grace, for in that acceptable time that is done which is done
              gratuitously: “So also David pronounces a blessing upon the man to
              whom God reckons righteousness apart from works” (Rom. 4:6). I
              have listened to you, i.e., accepted you. Or at an acceptable
              time, i.e., in the time of grace; and in this way prevenient grace
              is the name given to the grace by which we are freed from sin, and
              subsequent grace that by which we the virtues and perseverance in
              good are conferred on us. Secondly, we need cooperating grace,
              such as David requested in Ps. 23 (v. 6): “Surely goodness and
              mercy shall follow me all the days of my life.” As to this he
              says, and helped you on the day of salvation, for the time before
              Christ was not day but night: “The night is far gone, the day is
              at hand” (Rom 13:12). But the time of Christ is called the day,
              and not only the day, but the day of salvation. For before there
              was not salvation, because no one reached the end of salvation,
              namely, the vision of God. But now, when salvation has been born
              in the world, men attain to salvation: “And you shall call his
              name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins” (Matt.
              1:21); “Work out your salvation” (Phil. 2:12). And this is done by
              the help of cooperating grace, by which we arrive at eternal life
              through our works: “For God is at work in you, both to will and to
              work for his good pleasure” (Phil. 2:13).

              obstacle in any one’s way. For grace is given for two things: to
              avoid evil and to do good. Therefore, he teaches these two things,
              namely, that we avoid evil, in regard to which he says, putting no
              obstacle in any one’s way. This can be explained in two ways: in
              one way as referring to the apostles. As if to say: we, helping
              you, do exhort you. We, I say, giving no offense to any one,
              because if we were to offend others by a wicked life, our ministry
              would be blamed and our preaching ridiculed: “The name of God is
              blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you” (Rom. 2:24); “If
              one’s life is despised, it follows that his preaching is scorned”
              (Gregory). Hence, a public and notorious sinner should beware of
              preaching; otherwise, he would commit sin: “But to the wicked God
              says: ‘What right have you to recite my statutes, or take my
              covenant on your lips?’” (Ps. 50:17). In another way as referring
              to his subjects. As if to say: we exhort you, that you not receive
              the grace of God in vain; you, I say, putting no obstacle in any
              one’s way, i.e., not doing anything that would scandalize others:
              “Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God” (1
              Cor. 10:32); “Decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance
              in the way of a brother” (Rom. 14:13). The reason for this is so
              that no fault may be found with our ministry, i.e., our
              apostleship. For when subjects behave badly, the blame is put on
              the prelates: “Maintain good conduct among the Gentiles” (1 Pet.
              2:12). Or that the common ministry in regard to you and us, who
              are ministers of God, not be blamed. We, I say, are ministers of
              God to fulfil his will in you and in others, but you to fulfil it
              well in yourselves only: “You shall be called the priests of the
              LORD, men shall speak of you as the ministers of our God” (Is.

              first he does three things in keeping with the three things in
              which external activity consists: first, it consists in enduring
              evil, and concerning this he says, through great endurance;

              necessities; hence, he says, in hardships [necessities], namely,
              of things necessary for life: “Bring me out of my distresses” (Ps.

              patience is concerned. First, with things that pertain to
              tribulations which are voluntary, and this as to the soul. Hence,
              he says, in calamities [distresses], namely of the heart, when we
              are so beset with tribulations that there is no way of escape:
              “Destitute, afflicted, ill-treated” (Heb. 11:37), and then as to
              the body; hence, he says, in beatings, namely, inflicted by
              others, and in prisons: “And when they had inflicted many blows
              upon them, they threw them into prison” (Ac. 16:23); “Far more
              imprisonments, with countless beatings” (2 Cor. 11:23). In
              tumults, namely, of an entire people in an uproar: “For we are in
              danger of being charged with rioting today, there being no cause
              that we can give to justify this commotion” (Ac. 19:40). Secondly,
              in things that pertain to necessities. But necessity is sometimes
              voluntary, and so he says, in labours, by working with his own
              hands among the Corinthians, so as not to burden them with his
              support, because they were avaricious; and among the
              Thessalonians, to give them an example of work because they were
              idle: “You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my
              necessities, and to those who were with me” (Ac. 20:34). In
              watchings, for the sake of preaching: “Through many a sleepless
              night” (2 Cor. 11:27). In hunger [fasting], sometimes voluntary
              and sometimes involuntary because of need: “I pommel my body and
              subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27)

              distasteful. I answer that these are hard in themselves, but they

              all the virtue of chastity, which holds a prominent place in the
              virtue of temperance: in regard to this he says, in purity
              [chastity], namely, of mind and body. Here it should be noted that
              immediately after many labours, watches and fasts he mentions
              chastity, because a person who wills to have the virtue of
              chastity must be given to labours, continue in watchings, and be
              worn out with fasts: “But I pommel my body and subdue it, lest
              after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified” (1 Cor.
              9:27); “Strive for peace with all men, and for the holiness
              without which no one will see the Lord” (Heb. 12:14). But if
              anyone should ask why he makes no mention of the other virtues,
              but only of temperance, the answer is that he does mention them
              implicitly, because when he says, “in much patience, in
              tribulations” (v. 4), they pertain to the virtue of courage; when
              he says, “by the armor of justice” (v. 7), there is reference to
              the virtue of justice.

              namely, one inward and one outward. In the inward effect it has
              sweetness toward one’s neighbor: for it is unseemly for a person
              not to be sweet toward those he loves; therefore he says, in
              kindness [sweetness], in our behavior toward others, and gentle:
              “A pleasant voice multiplies friends, and a gracious tongue
              multiplies courtesies” (Sir. 6:5). Not in the sweetness of the
              world, but in that which is caused by the love of God, i.e., by
              the Holy Spirit; hence he says, in the Holy Spirit, i.e., which
              the Holy Spirit causes in us: “O how good and sweet is your
              Spirit, Lord, in all things” (Wis. 12:1, Vulgate). In the outward
              effect it has truth without pretense, i.e., that a person not
              pretend outwardly the contrary of what he has within; hence he
              says, in genuine love: “Let us not love in word or speech but in
              deed and in truth” (1 Jn. 3:18); “And above all these put on love”
              (Col. 3:14). The reason for this is because, as it says in Wis.
              (1:5): “For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from deceit.”

              in much patience and what is more with the weapons of
              righteousness [by the armor of justice]. Here it should be noted
              that justice ordains and makes a man keep his place for the right
              hand, i.e., in prosperity, namely, that he not be lifted up; and

              224. – Now there are two things which pertain to pride, namely,
              excellence of state and of works. Hence he says, in honor, i.e.,
              by a condition of excellence. As if to say: let us show ourselves
              as God’s ministers, namely, by the glory of God, that is, in
              prosperity: “The LORD of hosts has purposed it, to defile the
              pride of all glory” (Is. 23:9). That the apostles seemed glorious
              is shown in Acts (chap. 14), when Paul and Barnabas were taken as
              gods. And dishonor, which is on the left. As if to say: let us
              neither be lifted up by glory nor, if we are contemptible, be cast
              down: “God chose what is low and despised in the world, even
              things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are” (1 Cor.
              1:28). As to reports about works, he says, in ill repute and good
              repute. Here it should be noted that, as Gregory says, a man
              should not be the cause of his own bad reputation among those who
              are outside; rather he should try to acquire a good reputation, as
              Sir. (41:15) says: “Better is the man who hides his folly than the
              man who hides his wisdom,” and this for the sake of others,
              because we need to have a good reputation among those who are
              outside (1 Tim. 3:7). But if anyone happens to fall into bad
              repute unjustly, he should not be fainthearted or abandon holiness
              on that account. But if he has a good reputation among
              unbelievers, he should not be proud but take a middle path between
              the two. Then he explains the two things he mentioned. First, the
              evil reputation they had and to what a degree. Hence he says, as
              imposters and yet true. As if to say: some regard us as deceivers
              and some as honest. But this is not strange, because even in the
              case of Christ some said that he was good, and some that he was
              not, but that he was deceiving the multitude, as it says in Jn.
              (7:12). Secondly, he shows how they were noble and ignoble. Hence
              he says, as unknown and yet well known, i.e., approved by the good
              and unknown, i.e., despised by the evil: “We have become, and are
              now, as the refuse of the world, the offscouring of all things” (1
              Cor. 4:13).

              concupiscence of the flesh and mentions three things which the
              flesh desires: first, it desires a long life; as to this he says,
              as dying, i.e., although we are exposed to the dangers of death:
              “And often near death” (2 Cor. 11:23), and behold we live in
              virtue and faith. Therefore, Hab. (2:4) says: “But the righteous
              live by their faith”; “I shall not die, but I shall live” (Ps.
              118:17). Secondly, it desires health and repose; as to this he
              says, as punished and yet not killed. As if to say: although we
              are chastised with many stripes by the Lord, yet he has not
              delivered us over to death: “The Lord has chastened me sorely, but
              he has not given me over to death” (Ps. 118:13); “Indeed all who
              desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted” (2
              Tim. 3:12). Thirdly, it desires joy and pleasantness; as to this
              he says, as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing. For although in
              outward things and things which pertain to the flesh, we suffer
              sadness and bitterness, yet inwardly we have continual joy, which
              grows in us by the consolations of the Holy Spirit and by the hope
              of an eternal reward: “Count it all joy, my brethren, when you
              meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2); “You will have pain, but your
              pain will turn into joy” (Jn. 16:20).

              concupiscence of the eyes, and in regard to this he mentions two
              things. One of these is in relation to others, and according to
              this the right hand in riches consists in a man abounding, so that
              he can minister to others from his riches. But the left hand
              consists in a man’s being so poor that he must beg from others.
              Hence he says that in these temporal things we are as poor, i.e.,
              receiving from others; but as to spiritual things, yet making many
              rich. He does not say, “all,” because not all are ready to be
              enriched: “Another pretends to be poor, yet has great wealth”
              (Prov. 13:7). The second is in relation to themselves, and
              according to this, prosperity in riches is to possess many; but
              the left side is that he have absolutely nothing. In regard to
              this he says that in external things they are as having nothing,
              namely, in temporal things, because they have forsaken all things
              for Christ: “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess
              and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven” (Matt.
              19:21). But inwardly and in spiritual things, possessing all
              things, namely, by an inner greatness of heart. And this is so
              because they lived not for themselves, but for Christ.
              Consequently, all that were Christ’s they regarded as their own.
              Hence, since all things are subject to Christ, they possessed all
              things, and all things tended to their glory: “Every place that
              the sole of your foot will tread upon I have given to you” (Jos.
              1:3).

              227. – Note in regard to the foregoing that the Apostle employs a
              remarkable manner of speaking. For he, as it were, always sets one
              thing against another, and temporal against spiritual. But yet in
              temporal things he always adds a condition, namely, as or as
              though, but in the opposite spiritual things he adds nothing. The
              reason for this is that temporal things, whether they be good or
              evil, are changeable and apparent, and they have only a likeness
              to good and evil. Hence he says, as imposters and as unknown,
              because they were not so in reality, but only in men’s opinion.
              Consequently, they were transitory good or evils. But spiritual
              goods are existent and true; therefore, he adds no condition to
              them.

              by the mouth are express signs of the thoughts of the heart: “For
              out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks” (Matt. 12:34).

              manifested: “After this Job opened his mouth” (Job 3:1); “And he

              widening the heart. Hence he says, our heart is wide [enlarged]:
              “The raising of the eyes is the enlarging of the heart” (Prov.
              21:4, Vulgate). But sometimes the heart is narrow, namely, when it
              is pressed together and confined in a small place, as when a
              person cares for nothing but earthly things and scorns the
              heavenly, not being able to grasp them with his mind. But
              sometimes is it wide, namely, when a person seeks and desires
              great things. Such was the case with the Apostle, who did not
              regard the things which are seen, but desired heavenly things.
              Hence he says, our heart is enlarged, i.e., expanded for desiring

              unbelievers. Here it should be noted that a yoke is anything which
              binds several to do something. Hence, because some come together
              sometimes to do something good, which is from God, and some to do
              something evil, which is from the devil, we speak of God’s yoke
              and the devil’s yoke. God’s yoke is charity, which binds a man to
              serve God: “Take my yoke upon you” (Matt. 11:29). But the devil’s
              yoke is for doing evil: “The yoke of his burden” (Is. 9:4).
              Therefore he says this: Do not be mismated, i.e., do not take part
              in works of unbelief, with unbelievers; and this for two reasons.
              First, because there were some among them who considered
              themselves wiser, not refraining from idolatry; as a result they
              scandalized the lowly. But there were others who took part with
              the Jews in the traditions of their elders. Hence, the Apostle
              exhorts them and says, do not be mismated with unbelievers, i.e.,
              do not communicate with the Jews in the traditions of the Law or
              with Gentiles in the worship of idols, for both groups were
              unbelievers.

              partnership have righteousness and iniquity? This is based on two
              distinctions: one regards the cause and the other the state. The
              distinction as to cause is twofold, namely, as to habitual and as
              to efficient cause. The habitual cause is also twofold: one as to
              effect, and this is what he says: For what partnership have
              righteousness and iniquity [justice with injustice]? As if to say:
              you should not bear the yoke with unbelievers, because there is
              one habit in you and another in them. In you it is the habit of
              justice; in them it is the habit of iniquity. But the higher
              justice is to render to God what is his, and this is to worship
              him. Hence, since you worship God, the habit of justice is in you.
              But the greatest iniquity is to take from God what is his and give
              it to the devil: “I cannot endure iniquity and solemn assembly”
              (Is. 1:13); “What has straw in common with wheat” (Jer. 23:28).
              The other habitual cause is in regard to the intellect; and this
              distinction is that the faithful are enlightened with the light of
              faith, but unbelievers are in the darkness of errors. As to this
              he says, Or what fellowship has light with darkness? As if to say:
              it is not right for you to communicate with them, because it is
              not a suitable fellowship, because you are light through knowledge
              of the faith: “For once you were darkness, but now you are light
              in the Lord” (Eph. 5:8), but they are darkness through ignorance:
              “The way of the wicked is like deep darkness” (Prov. 4:19). Hence,
              from the beginning the Lord separated the light from the darkness,
              as it says in Gen. (1:18).

              submit to God’s yoke: “For long ago you broke your yoke and burst
              your bonds” (Jer. 2:20). That there cannot be concord between

              unbeliever? As if to say: there is not the same part on both
              sides, because the part of the believer is God, whom he has as a
              reward and as the end of his happiness: “The Lord is my chosen
              portion and my cup” (Ps. 16:5). But the part of the unbeliever is
              earthly goods: “Because this is our portion and this is our lot”
              (Wis. 2:9); “And he will punish him and put him with the
              hypocrites” (Matt. 24:51). As to the state of grace he says, What
              agreement has the temple of God with idols? As if to say: there is
              no agreement. Hence, you are a temple of God by grace: “Do you not
              know that you are God’s temple and that God’s Spirit dwells in
              you?” (1 Cor. 3:16). Therefore, you should not communicate with
              unbelievers, who are temples of idols. But it should be noted that
              in Ez. 25, the Lord forbids idols to be worshipped in God’s
              temple. Much more then are men forbidden, whose souls are God’s
              temple, to violate them by partaking of idols: “If any one

              pertinet ad gratiam operationum quod est Deum esse in aliquo per
              gratiam. Et hoc est quod dicit <i>inhabitabo in eis</i>, scilicet
              in sanctis, per gratiam excolens eos. Licet autem Deus in omnibus
              rebus dicatur esse per praesentiam, potentiam et essentiam, non
              tamen dicitur in eis inhabitare, sed in solis sanctis per gratiam.
              Cuius ratio est quia Deus est in omnibus rebus per suam actionem,
              inquantum coniungit se eis, ut dans esse et conservans in esse. In
              sanctis autem est per ipsorum sanctorum operationem, qua attingunt
              ad Deum, et quodammodo comprehendunt ipsum, quae est diligere et
              cognoscere: nam diligens et cognoscens dicitur in se habere
              cognita et dilecta. Secundum pertinet ad gratiam cooperantem, quo
              scilicet proficiunt sancti auxilio Dei, et quantum ad hoc dicit
              <i>inambulabo in eis</i>, id est promovebo eos de virtute in
              virtutem. Nam hic profectus sine gratia Dei esse non potest. I
              Cor. XV, 10: <i>gratia Dei sum id quod sum</i>: nam, sicut gratia
              operans facit nos esse aliquid in esse iustitiae, ita et gratia
              cooperans facit nos in ipso esse proficere. Tertium pertinet ad
              Dei beneficium, et hoc vel protectionis per providentiam, et hoc
              tangit, dicens <i>ego ero illorum Deus</i>, id est providentia mea
              protegam eos. Ps. CXLIII, 15:
              <i>beatus populus, cuius dominus</i>, et cetera. Vel beneficium
              remunerationis, ut sic dicatur <i>ero illorum Deus</i>, id est
              dabo eis meipsum in mercedem. Gen. XV, 1:
              <i>ego ero merces tua</i>, et cetera. Et Hebr. XI, 16:
              <i>non confunditur Deus eorum vocari Deus</i>. Quartum pertinet ad
              debitum cultum et servitium sanctorum, et quantum ad hoc dicit
              <i>et ipsi erunt mihi in populum</i>, id est me colent et mihi

              240. – To prove this he cites an authority, proving this very
              point from the use to which a temple is put. For the use of a
              temple is that God dwell in it, because a temple is a place
              consecrated for God to dwell in: “The Lord is in his holy temple”
              (Ps. 11:4). This authority is taken from Lev. (26:11), which says:
              “And I will make my abode among you”. In this authority four
              things are touched as pertaining to this use. The first pertains
              to operating grace, which consists in God’s being is someone
              through grace; and this is what he says, I will live in them,
              namely, in the saints, adorning them with grace. For although God
              is said to be in all things by his presence, power, and essence,
              he is not said to dwell in them, but only in the saints through
              grace; the reason being that God is in all things by his activity,
              inasmuch as he joins himself to them as giving esse and conserving
              it, but in the saints by their very activity, by which they attain
              to God and in a way comprehend him, which is to love and to know.
              For those who know and those who love have within themselves the
              thing known and loved. The second pertains to cooperating grace,
              by which the saints make progress with God’s help; as to this he
              says, I will move among them, i.e., I will promote them from
              virtue to virtue, for this progress is impossible without grace:
              “By the grace of God I am what I am” (1 Cor. 15:10). For just as
              operating grace makes us to be something in the being [esse] of
              justice, so cooperating grace makes us progress in that being
              [esse]. The third pertains to God’s benefits: and this is either
              the benefit of his protection through providence; hence, he
              touches this when he says, and I will be their God, i.e., I will
              protect them by my providence: “Happy the people whose God is the
              Lord” (Ps. 144:15), or the benefit of recompense. As if to say: I
              will be their God, i.e., I will give them myself as a reward:
              “Your reward shall be very great” (Gen. 15:1); “Therefore God is
              not ashamed to be called their God” (Heb. 11:16). The fourth
              pertains to correct worship and service offered by the saints; as
              to this he says, and they shall be my people, i.e., they will
              worship me and obey me as mine and not another’s: “We are the
              people of his pasture, the sheep of his hand” (Ps. 95:4).

              come out from them: “Depart, depart, go out from there! Touch no
              unclean thing; go out from the midst of it” (Is. 52:11). Here he
              says three things: go out, be separated from them, and do not
              touch anything unclean, because there are three ways we should
              behave toward unbelievers. First, we should go out from them by
              abstaining from sins: “Ho! ho! Flee from the land of the north”
              (Zech. 2:6). But the Donatists say that we must depart bodily from
              an evil society. But this is not true. Hence, the Apostle’s words
              must be understood of a spiritual separation and are explained in
              this way: go out spiritually by not following their life: “As a
              lily among brambles” (S of S 2:2), and this in order to avoid the
              very occasions of sin given by them. Hence he says, be separate,
              i.e., be far from consenting to them: “For I have come to set a
              man against his father” (Matt. 10:35); “Depart, I pray you, from
              the tents of these wicked men” (Num. 16:26). Thirdly, to rebuke
              them when they do wrong; hence he says, touch nothing unclean,
              i.e., do not consent to them in evil: “They not only do them but
              approve those who practice them” (Rom. 1:32); “Take no part in the
              unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.” (Eph.
              5:11). And this because “whoever touches pitch will be defiled [by
              it]” (Sir. 13:1).

              scilicet gula et luxuria, caetera vero peccata sunt spiritualia.
              Si vero considerentur quantum ad sui originem, sic omnia peccata

              cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit,

              so let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and
              spirit, i.e., of carnal and spiritual vices: “Purify yourselves,
              you who bear the vessels of the Lord” (Is. 52:11). Here it should
              be noted that every sin which is consummated in carnal delight is
              carnal, while that which is consummated in spiritual delight is
              spiritual. That is why carnal sins, if they are considered in
              their consummation, are two in number, namely, gluttony and lust;
              but the others are spiritual sins. But if they are considered in
              their origin, then all sins can be considered carnal, because all
              of them have their origin in a conception of the flesh. In this
              sense he speaks to the Galatians (5:19): “Now the works of the
              flesh are plain: fornication, impurity, licentiousness, idolatry,
              sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, anger, selfishness, dissension,

              mundus. Lev. XI, 44 et XIX, 2:
              <i>sancti estote, quoniam ego sanctus sum</i>, et cetera.
              Perficiamus, inquam, quia philosophi conati sunt perficere et non
              potuerunt, quia non potuerunt omnia peccata vitare: quantumcumque
              enim aliqua peccata vitarent et exercerent actus virtutum, adhuc

              248. – Thirdly, he mentions how they can fulfil the admonition
              when he says, making holiness perfect in the fear of God. For
              someone could say: were we not cleansed in baptism? That is why he
              added, making holiness perfect, i.e., let us perfect the original
              cleansing in baptism. For the same is holy that is clean: “Be
              holy, for I am holy” (Lev. 11:44). Let us perfect, I say, because
              philosophers have tried to be perfect and have failed, because
              they were unable to avoid sins. For no matter how many other sins
              they avoided or how well they exercised the acts of the virtues,
              the sin of unbelief remained in them. Consequently, cleanness is
              made perfect only in the true worship of God. And this is what he
              says: in the fear, i.e., in the worship, of God: “The fear of God
              has set itself over all things” (Sir. 25:14, Vulgate). But this
              seems contrary to Col. (3:14): “And above all these put on love,
              which binds everything together in perfect harmony.” Therefore,
              sanctification is not perfected in the fear of God, but in the
              love of God. I answer that he is speaking here of filial fear,
              which is the effect of charity, and not of servile fear, which is
              contrary to charity. He says, in the fear, to teach us to love God
              with a certain reverence and carefulness. For love causes
              security, which sometimes begets negligence; but one who fears is
              always careful.

              imitators of me as I am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1). For I have
              guarded myself against uncleanness by holiness, because I have
              injured no one. Here it should be noted that a person might injure
              his neighbor in three ways, but Paul did not injure them in any of
              these ways. First, in his person, as to this he says, we have
              wronged no one, namely in his person, as wicked masters do: “Who
              tear the skin from off my people” (Mic. 3:2). Secondly, in their
              reputation by inducing them to evil by example and persuasion; as
              to this he says, we have corrupted no one: “Bad company ruins good
              morals” (1 Cor. 15:33). Thirdly, by stealing their goods; as to
              this he says, we have taken advantage of no one: “That no man
              transgress and wrong his brother in this matter” (1 Th. 4:6).

              discloses his intention. As if to say: I do not say this to
              condemn you, but to correct you. For past evils are wont to be
              recalled sometimes for condemnation, when there is no further hope
              of correction; and sometimes for amendment, so that they will be
              corrected. And this is the way he speaks here: I do not say this
              to condemn you: “I say this for your own benefit” (1 Cor. 7:35).
              The reason for this is because I rejoice in your good: for I said
              before that you are in our hearts: “You yourselves are our letter
              of recommendation, written on your hearts, to be known and read by
              all men” (2 Cor. 3:2); “It is right for me to feel thus about you
              all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers
              with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and
              confirmation of the gospel” (Phil. 1:7). You are, I say, in our
              hearts, namely, to die together and to live together. This can be
              understood of the death of guilt and of natural death. Of the
              death of guilt, not that we are prepared to die with you, i.e.,
              not that when you sin, we want to sin, but we take your death of
              guilt with as much pain as our own: “Who is weak, and I am not
              weak?” (2 Cor. 11:29); “I die everyday” (1 Cor. 15:31). And to
              live together, because I take as much joy in your good life in
              grace as in my own. Of natural death: then to die together it
              taken to mean that I am prepared to die for you: “I will most
              gladly spend and be spent for your souls” (2 Cor. 12:15); to live
              together, i.e., I desire you to be companions in eternal life: “If
              we have died with him, we shall also live with him” (2 Tim. 2:11).

              love there are four feelings (affectus) that usually arise from
              the good works, which the lovers accomplish. First, the feeling of
              confidence. Hence, he says, I have great confidence in you,
              inasmuch as I am confident that, having begun well, you will
              always get better. Consequently, from the good things I have heard
              about you I hope for greater things to come: “And I am sure that
              he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the
              day of Jesus Christ” (Phil. 1:6); “Though we speak thus, yet in
              your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things that belong to
              salvation” (Heb. 6:9). And this confidence is good and salutary:
              “Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great
              reward” (Heb. 10:35).

              sicut de propriis, glorietur. Et hoc specialiter, quoniam ipse est

              glory; for as a result of loving a friend’s good as his own, a
              person glories in that good as he glories in his own. And this is
              especially true here, because he is the cause of their goods, as a
              teacher is the cause of his disciple’s doctrine. Hence he says, I
              have great pride in you: “The glory of a father is a wise son”

              Tertio ex praedictis concipit affectum consolationis, quando is
              qui laetatur et gloriatur de bonis suis vel amici, habet remedium
              contra tristitias. Consolatio enim est remedium contra tristitias.
              Naturale autem est quod semper delectatio et gaudium, tristitiae
              opponitur. Et, secundum philosophum, omnis delectatio debilitat,
              vel totaliter tollit tristitiam. Si delectatio sit contraria
              tristitiae, totaliter absorbet tristitiam; si autem non sit
              contraria, debilitat et diminuit eam. Et inde est quod quando quis
              est in tristitia, quandocumque nuntiantur sibi aliqua laeta,
              diminuitur tristitia. Et ideo, quia audit laeta de Corinthiis,
              dicit
              <i>repletus sum consolatione</i>, audita scilicet correctione
              vestra. Supra I, 5 s.: <i>sicut abundant Christi passiones</i>, et

              254. – Then as a result of these two feelings he conceives a
              feeling of consolation, when the one who rejoices and glories in
              his own goods or in those of his friend has a remedy against
              sadness. This consolation is a cure for sadness; and according to
              the Philosopher every delight weakens or entirely destroys
              sadness. If the delight is contrary to the sadness, it totally
              swallows up the sadness; but if it is not contrary, it weakens or
              diminishes it. This is why when a person is sad, his sadness is
              lessened whenever something joyful is announced to him. Therefore,
              because he heard joyful things about the Corinthians, he says, I
              am filled with comfort, having heard of your amendment: “For as we
              share abundantly in Christ’s sufferings, so through Christ we
              share abundantly in comfort too” (2 Cor. 1:5); “So if there is any
              encouragement in Christ, any incentive of love, any participation
              in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by
              being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord
              and of one mind” (Phil. 2:1-2).

              Licet enim ex aliquibus delectationibus diminuatur tristitia, non
              tamen totaliter tollitur, nisi gaudium sit magnum. Quamvis autem
              apostolus multas tribulationes sustineret, quia tamen multum
              gaudebat de bonis Corinthiorum, ideo non solum non absorbebatur
              tristitia totaliter, sed etiam superabundabat gaudio. Et ideo
              dicit
              <i>superabundo gaudio in omni tribulatione nostra</i>, id est
              gaudium meum superat omnem tribulationem, quae erat in animo meo.

              for although sadness is lessened by certain delights, it is not
              entirely displaced unless there is great joy. But although the
              Apostle had endured many tribulations, yet because he found great
              joy in the good actions of the Corinthians, not only was sadness
              entirely absorbed, but his joy superabounds. Hence he says, With
              all our affliction, I am overjoyed, i.e., my joy overcomes every
              tribulation that was in my soul: “For what is our hope or joy or
              crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming?” (1 Th.

              because the cure was removed, and because the tribulations were
              multiplied. Because of the removal of the cure he says: For even
              when we came, etc. As if to say: indeed I have tribulation,
              because I am consoled by no one, for even when we came into

              bodies had no rest, but not “our spirit,” because the saints
              always have peace in spirit. For even in adversity the soul, which
              suffers in the body, rests in the hope of a reward to come,
              although it suffers many things contrary to the desires of the

              number when he says, we were afflicted at every turn, i.e., every
              type of tribulation in the body and in the soul: “In the world you
              have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have overcome the world”
              (Jn. 16:33). That he had suffered all tribulations he explains
              when he says, fighting without and fear within, i.e., outside
              myself the combat of persecutions, but within, i.e., in the heart,
              the fear of evil, fearing persecutions in the future: “In the open
              the sword shall bereave” (Deut. 32:25) But this seems contrary to
              Prov. (28:1): “But the righteous are bold as a lion.” I answer
              that he is without dread as to the spirit, but not as to the
              flesh. Or without, i.e., outside the Church, combats are started
              by unbelievers; but fear within, lest those who are in the Church
              fall away from the faith on account of persecutors. Or without,
              i.e., in public, fighting, because we are attacked by obvious
              enemies; fear within, which is produced in us by those who call
              themselves friends but are not. For as Boethius says in The
              Consolation: “No pest can inflict more harm than a friendly
              enemy”; “A man’s foes will be those of his own household” (Matt.

              mentions the feeling he conceived from Titus’ consolation, namely,
              one of joy. Hence, in regard to this he does three things: first,
              he mentions the joy he felt; secondly, he intimates his doubts;

              pleased with the things Titus related to me, that I rejoiced still
              more in that than I grieved in my tribulations. For spiritual
              things must be preferred to temporal things. Or that I rejoiced
              still more for having saddened you than I sorrowed before. For
              they had sinned by fornication, and the Apostle has rebuked them,
              as is evident from the first epistle (chaps. 5-6). But at that
              time he wondered what effect that sadness would have, whether good
              or bad; therefore, in his wonder he felt sad. But later, seeing
              that good had come from it, he was glad. Hence, he says: For even
              if I made you sorry with my letter, I do not regret it now,
              because you have been corrected. And though I did regret it
              before, namely, when I was uncertain whether the sadness would
              bring you to correct yourselves or to despair, seeing that that
              letter grieved you, though only for a while, now I am glad,
              because you have been converted. Then he gives the reason for his
              joy, because I am not glad that you were made sorrowful, but at
              the effect, namely, your amendment, because you were grieved not
              unto despair, but you were grieved into repenting; just as a
              physician is not glad at the bitterness of the medicine, but at
              the effect, namely, health: “As sorrowful, yet always rejoicing”

              Causa autem ex qua commendatur eorum tristitia, haec est, quia est

              per epistolam, tamen gaudeo, id est quia
              <i>contristati estis secundum Deum</i>. Ubi sciendum est, quod
              tristitia et gaudium et communiter omnis affectio, ex amore
              causatur. Tristatur enim quis, quia caret eo quod amat. Qualis
              autem est amor, talis est tristitia ex amore causata. Est autem
              duplex amor. Unus quo diligitur Deus, et ex hoc causatur tristitia
              quae est secundum Deum; alius amor quo amatur saeculum, et ex hoc
              causatur tristitia saeculi. Amor, quo diligimus Deum, facit nos
              libenter servire Deo, sollicite quaerere honorem Dei, et vacare
              Deo dulciter. Et quia peccando impedimur a servitio Dei et ideo ei
              non vacamus, nec eius honorem quaerimus, ideo amor Dei causat
              tristitiam de peccato, et haec est tristitia secundum Deum, quae
              quidem tristitia non fuit vobis ad malum, nec detrimentum, sed
              potius ad fructum et meritum. Et ideo dicit
              <i>ut in nullo detrimentum patiamini ex nobis</i>, quia non solum
              bona et grata quae vobis impendimus, vobis prosunt, sed etiam hoc
              ipsum quod vos corrigimus et contristamus. Hebr. XII, 11:

              266. – The cause on account of which he commends their sorrow is
              that it was according to God. Therefore he says: although for a
              time I was sorry for the epistle, nevertheless I rejoice now, for
              you felt a godly grief. Here it should be noted that sorrow and
              joy and generally every emotion arise from love; for a person is
              sad when he lacks what he loves. The kind of love determines the
              kind of sorrow it causes. But there are two kinds of love: one by
              which God is loved, and from this arises a sorrow which is
              according to God; the other is that by which the world is loved,
              and from this arises a worldly sorrow. The love by which we love
              God makes us serve him gladly, honor him carefully and set some
              time apart for God joyfully. But because sin hinders us from
              serving God, we devote no time to him or seek his honor, the love
              of God causes sorrow for sin: and this is sorrow according to God.
              This sorrow was not in you to produce evil and loss, but fruit and
              merit. Hence, he says, that you suffered no loss through us,
              because you profit not only from the good and pleasant things we
              bestow on you, but also from the fact that we correct and sadden
              you: “For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than
              pleasant; later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to
              those who have been trained by it” (Heb. 12:11).

              Poenitere enim est tristari de malo, et secundum Deum. Non ergo
              operatur poenitentiam. Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod poenitentia
              habet tres partes, quarum pars prima est tristitia, scilicet dolor
              et compunctio de peccatis; aliae duae sunt confessio et
              satisfactio. Cum ergo dicit, quod

              269. – But against what he says, that sadness which is according
              to God works penance, it seems that the very sorrow according to
              God is penance. For penance is sorrow over evil and is according
              to God. Therefore it does not work penance. I answer that penance
              has three parts, the first of which is sorrow, namely grief and
              compunction over sins; the other two are confession and
              satisfaction. Therefore, when he says that sorrow works penance,
              it is to be understood that compunction or sorrow for sin works
              penance in us, i.e., the other parts of penance, namely,
              confession and satisfaction. Or we might say that sorrow according
              to God is more common than penance, because penance is about one’s
              own sins, but one sorrows according to God for his own sins and
              those of others. Thus, therefore, the effect of sorrow according
              to God is eternal salvation, but the effect of sorrow according to
              the world is death. For since a person who loves the world is made
              an enemy of God, as it says in Jas. (4:4), the love of the world
              causes death. For a person is sorrowful according to the world,
              not because he offended God by sin, but because, being caught in
              his sin, he is punished for it and exposed; and this sadness
              should be avoided in sins (Sir. 30:24, Vulgate).

              grief has produced in you to avoid evil and to do good: “He has

              inward feeling, some are for the removal of sin, and some for the
              attainment of good. For a true penitent should depart from evil
              and do good. In regard to the removal of evil he lists three, the
              first of which is to desist from evil; as to this he says, what
              eagerness to clear yourselves, against those who induce us to
              evil: “Resist him, firm in your faith” (1 Pet. 5:9). Or according
              to a Gloss, to defend me against the false apostle: “Take the
              whole armor of God” (Eph. 6:13). The second is that a man be
              indignant against himself for the sins he has committed; as to
              this he says, what indignation. For indignation at oneself works
              sorrow according to God: “And my wrath upheld me” (Is. 63:5). The
              third is that he live in continual fear of the future, so as to be

              that the same thing might happen in the future: “The fear of God
              came upon all” (Sir. 25:14, Vulgate). As to the attainment of good
              he lists two things. The first is desire for what is good; as to
              this he says, what longing [desire], by which a man is inclined to
              do good: “The desire of the righteous ends only in good” (Prov.

              those who are good; as to this he says, what zeal to imitate me
              and other good men: “But earnestly desire the higher gifts” (1

              The first is that they take revenge on themselves for having
              sinned; and this is useful. For since every evil must be punished
              either by man or by God, if he [God] does not punish here, it is
              better that a man punish in himself the evil that he has done than
              that God do it, because as it says in Heb. (10:31): “It is a
              fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.” As to
              this he says, what punishment, i.e., because you punish sinners
              and even yourselves: “But I pommel my body and subdue it, lest
              after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified” (1 Cor.
              9:27); (Is. 26:18). The second is that he refrain from sin
              altogether; hence he says, At every point you have proved
              yourselves, namely, with faith leading you, guiltless in the
              matter, i.e., of being a Christian: “But as servants of God we
              commend ourselves in every way” (2 Cor. 6:4); “He chose us in him
              before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and
              blameless before him” (Eph. 1:4); “He who walks in the way that is
              blameless shall minister to me” (Ps. 101:6). Or in the matter
              about which you were corrected, for the favor you did for the
              fornicator; but later by punishing and condemning him you showed
              that you were undefiled in this.

              apostolus commendaverat Corinthios Tito, antequam iret ad eos.
              Quia vero nunc ita invenit Titus, sicut apostolus dixit, gaudet
              apostolus verba sua vera fuisse, et hoc est quod dicit
              <i>et si quid apud illum de vobis gloriatus sum</i>, commendando
              vos. Dicit autem <i>gloriatus sum</i>, quia gloria apostoli erat
              bonum illorum. <i>Non sum confusus</i>, id est non erubesco me
              falsa dixisse. Quando enim aliquis invenitur mendax, confunditur.
              Eccli. XXXVII, 20: <i>ante omnia sermo verax</i>, et cetera.

              ratio est ex parte Corinthiorum. Nam amici desiderant, ut illi
              quos diligunt, ab omnibus diligantur. Quia ergo Titus diligebat
              Corinthios propter eorum devotionem, ideo de hoc apostolus
              gaudebat. Et ideo dicit apostolus <i>et viscera eius</i>, etc.,

              quia <i>viscera eius</i>, id est viscerosa charitas eius, et

              on the part of the Apostle, namely, because he was found to be
              truthful. For the Apostle had commended the Corinthians to Titus
              before he went to them. But now, because Titus found them to be
              just as the Apostle had said, he rejoiced that his words were
              true. And this is what he says, for if I have expressed to him
              some pride in you, by commending you, I was not put to shame,
              i.e., I do not blush as having said something false. For when a
              person is found to be a liar, he is ashamed: “A man skilled in
              words may be hated” (Sir. 37:20). But just as everything we said
              to you was true, i.e., as I have preached the truth to you, so our
              boasting before Titus has proved true. The other reason is on the
              part of the Corinthians. For friends desire that those whom they
              love be loved by everyone. Therefore, because Titus loved the
              Corinthians for their devotion, the Apostle rejoices over this and
              says, and his heart goes out all the more to you. As if to say: I
              not only rejoice because I was found to be right, but also because
              his heart, i.e., his charity and great love, goes out all the more
              to you than before, because he has seen your progress; or, more
              abundantly than towards others: “Put on then, as God’s chosen
              ones, holy and beloved, compassion, kindness, lowliness, meekness,
              and patience” (Col. 3:12).

                1 We want you to know, brethren, about the grace of God which
                has been shown in the churches of Macedonia, 2 for in a severe
                test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme
                poverty have overflowed in a wealth of liberality on their part.
                3 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and
                beyond their means, of their own free will, 4 begging us
                earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the
                saints— 5 and this, not as we expected, but first they gave
                themselves to the Lord and to us by the will of God. 6
                Accordingly we have urged Titus that as he had already made a
                beginning, he should also complete among you this gracious work.
                7 Now as you excel in everything—in faith, in utterance, in
                knowledge, in all earnestness, and in your love for us—see that
                you excel in this gracious work also. 8 I say this not as a
                command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your
                love also is genuine.

              apostoli imposuerunt Paulo et Barnabae, ut proponerent verbum

              Corinthii liberaliter tribuant, proponit eis Macedones in
              exemplum. Et commendat eos quantum ad duo, scilicet primo quantum

              them to a particular good, namely, to contribute to the things
              being collected for the saints at Jerusalem. For, as it says in
              Acts (chap. 5), and suggested in Gal. (2:10), the apostles had
              charged Paul and Barnabas to preach the word of salvation to the
              Gentiles and exhort them to help the saints in Jerusalem, who
              having sold all their possessions and placed them at the feet of
              the apostles, were in dire need. It is to this that he induces
              them now, and he does two things. First, he urges them to give;
              secondly, he advises them how to give, namely, quickly and
              generously (chap. 9) In regard to the first he does two things.
              First, he treats of what should be given; secondly, of the
              ministers by whom these things will be collected (v. 16). In
              regard to the first he does two things. First, he exhorts them to
              give; secondly, he rejects any excuse (v. 13). He uses three
              things to urge them to give. First, the example of others who
              gave; secondly, the example of Christ (v. 9); thirdly, their own
              benefit (v. 10). In regard to the first he does three things.
              First, he gives the example; secondly, he shows how he was moved
              by this example (v. 6); thirdly, he suggests that they follow this
              example (v. 7). In regard to the first it should be noted that in
              order to induce the Corinthians to contribute generously, he
              proposes to them the example of the Macedonians and commends them
              for two things, namely, their patience in adversity and their
              generosity in giving.

              Consequently, he did this at a time when they could merit, namely,
              in the time of grace, for that is when alms are meritorious.
              Therefore he says, We want you to know, brethren, about the grace,
              i.e., the gratuitous gift, of God, namely, the bestowing of alms.
              He calls this a grace, because every good we do is from God’s
              grace. Which grace was not given to them but to me, namely,
              inasmuch as it was by my management and care and urging that the
              Macedonians were moved to this: “To me, though I am the very least
              of all the saints” (Eph. 3:8). It was shown, I say, to me in the
              churches of Macedonia, i.e., among the faithful in Macedonia.

              because, i.e., for in a severe test of affliction, they have had
              an abundance of joy. Here he lays down the conditions of perfect
              patience: one is that a person be constant, so that he will not be
              cast down by fear of tribulation or by the very experience of
              tribulation. Hence he says, for in a severe test of affliction,
              they were constant. The other is that they rejoice in those
              tribulations, as we read of St. Lawrence. As to this he says, they
              had an abundance of joy, i.e., the Macedonians: “Count it all joy,
              my brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2); “Rejoice in
              your hope, be patient in tribulation”(Rom. 12:12). Or: in a severe
              test of affliction, not that which they suffered, but which he saw

              Gloss, the raising of the spirit above temporal things and a
              contempt for them makes poverty profound. And so their poverty was
              very profound, because they did not have riches and scorned them:
              “Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in
              faith and heirs of the kingdom” (Jas. 2:5). This poverty, I say,

              supra, <i>abundavit</i>, id est effectum abundantiae fecit,
              <i>in divitias simplicitatis eorum</i>, quia cor eorum erat solum

              accord with the Apostle’s intention; therefore, it must be
              explained another way. Here it should be noted that there are two
              causes which make a man sufficiently ready to give: one is from an
              abundance of riches, or from a contempt for riches. Consequently,
              in a poor man contempt for riches produces the same effect as
              abundance in a rich man. Hence he says, their extreme poverty so
              overflowed, i.e., produced the effect of abundance, in a wealth of
              liberality on their part, because their heart was solely on God.
              And from this arose their contempt for riches: “The integrity of
              the upright guides them” (Prov. 11:3).

              dupliciter, scilicet simpliciter seu absolute, et secundum
              proportionem aliorum. Quando ergo dat plus quam alii suae
              proportionis, non peccat; sed si simpliciter dat supra virtutem,
              tunc immoderate dat.

              287. – As to the quantity given, it was beyond their power. Hence,
              he says: truly I abounded in riches, for they gave according to
              their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, because
              they gave so much that they were in need later. Or it might be
              said, and better, that there is an internal power of the soul and
              an external power, namely, the amount of one’s riches. The
              internal power is the soul’s readiness to give; hence he says, I
              can testify that of their own free will that they were willing to
              give according to the internal power of their soul and beyond the
              external power of their riches: “So you will be laying up a good
              treasure for yourself against the day of necessity” (Tob. 4:9).
              But on the other hand, whoever gives beyond his power gives
              immoderately; therefore, he is not worthy of praise. I answer that
              power in giving can be considered in two ways, namely, absolutely
              and according to a proportion. Therefore, when a person gives more
              than others of his proportion, he does not sin; but if he gives
              absolutely above his power, then he gives immoderately.

              giving, because they not only gave what they owned, but they first
              gave themselves. For this should be the order of giving, namely,
              that a man be first acceptable to God, for if a man is not
              pleasing to God, his gifts are not acceptable: “And the Lord had
              regard for Abel and his offering” (Gen. 4:4). Therefore he says,

              we considered, that is, that they would give in reparation for
              sin; but first they gave themselves to the Lord, by amending their
              life, and to us, by obeying in all things, by the will of God,
              which is that man be subject to his vicars: “Obey your leaders and
              submit to them” (Heb. 13:17). A Gloss says that their offerings
              would not have been acceptable, unless they had first given
              themselves to God. Therefore, it seems that alms should not be
              accepted from sinners. I answer that they should not be accepted,
              when they are given with the intention of being nourished in their
              sins.

              saying: I say this not as a command, i.e., what I asked Titus, or

              commanding: “Not as domineering over those in your charge but
              being examples to the flock” (1 Pet. 5:3). But I say this to
              prove, i.e., desiring to prove, by the earnestness of others,

              should be noted that a good disposition refers not only to an
              aptitude to learn easily, but also to acting well, the reason
              being that in order to act well, a knowledge which directs is
              necessary. Therefore, just as in learning, a person is said to
              have a good disposition, if he quickly grasps the words of the
              teacher, so in doing good a person is said to have a good
              disposition, if he is quickly moved to do good by the example of
              others. That is why the Apostle says, to prove that your love also
              is genuine, i.e., how prompt a will you have for giving when moved
              by the example of the Macedonians: “I do not write this to make
              you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children” (1 Cor.

              Corinthians to give alms, saying: I wish to approve your good
              disposition, namely, for giving to the poor, and you should do
              this by reason of Christ’s example. For, that is, because you know
              the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, which he conferred on the
              human race: “Grace and truth came through Jesus Christ” (Jn.
              1:17). This is called grace, because whatever the Son of God
              assumed of our punishments, all must be imputed to grace, because
              he was not anticipated by anyone’s goodness, or compelled by
              anyone’s power, or induced by any necessity of his own. But it is
              grace, because he for your sake he became poor [needy]. He says,
              needy, which is more than poor; for a needy person is one who not
              only has very little, but is destitute; but a poor man is one who
              has a little. Therefore, to signify the extent of his poverty, he
              says, he became poor [needy], namely, in temporal things: “The Son
              of Man has nowhere to lay his head” (Lk. 9:58); “Remember my
              affliction” (Lam. 3:19). He was made needy not from necessity but
              willingly, because that grace would not then be a grace. Hence he
              says, though he was rich, namely, in spiritual goods: “The same
              Lord is Lord of all and bestows his riches upon all who call upon
              him” (Rom. 10:12); “Riches and honor are with me” (Prov. 8:18). He
              says, being, and not “having been,” lest it seem that Christ lost
              his spiritual riches when he assumed poverty. For he assumed this
              poverty in such a way that he did not lose those inestimable
              riches: “Both rich and poor together” (Ps. 49:2). Rich is
              spiritual things, poor in temporal things.

              says, so that by his poverty you might become rich, i.e., that
              through his poverty in temporal things, you might become rich in
              spiritual things. And this for two reasons: for an example and for
              a sacrament. For an example, indeed, because if Christ loved
              poverty, we also should love it because of his example. But by
              loving poverty in temporal things, we are made rich in spiritual
              things: “Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be
              rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom which he has promised to
              those who love him?” (Jas. 2:5). This is why he says, so that by
              his poverty you might become rich. For the sacrament, however,
              because everything Christ did or endured was for our sake. Hence,
              just as by the fact that he endured death, we were delivered from
              eternal death and restored to life, so by the fact that he
              suffered need in temporal things, we have been delivered from need
              in spiritual things and made rich in spiritual things: “That in
              every way you were enriched in him with all speech and all
              knowledge” (1 Cor. 1:5).

              Corinthians, abounded in temporal things and were wanting in
              spiritual things; but the saints in Jerusalem abounded in
              spiritual things and were lacking in temporal things. Therefore he
              desired that an equality of quantity be established between them,
              namely, that those who abounded in temporal things give half of
              everything to those in need of them, while the others should give
              half of their spiritual things to them, so that they would be
              equally rich. Therefore, he says rather, that as a matter of
              equality of quantity, i.e., from a half-share of your goods at the
              present time, which is short, let your abundance of earthly goods
              supply their want in spiritual goods, i.e., that you may be
              partakers of eternal life: “Make friends for yourselves by means
              of unrighteous mammon” (Lk. 16:9); “In dividing the lot, give and
              take” (Sir. 14:15); i.e., give temporal things and accept
              spiritual things.

              spiritual goods. I wish, therefore, that as a matter of equality,

              that as they are sustained by your alms, so may you be enriched by

              as pilgrims over the world: “We know that while we are at home in
              the body we are away from the Lord” (2 Cor. 5:6). And this is true
              of Luke, because he was one of the seventy-two disciples and a
              companion of Paul. It is also true of Barnabas, because it was
              said by the Holy Spirit in Acts (13:2): “Set apart for me Barnabas
              and Saul for the work to which I have called them.” And he was
              made a companion for this gracious work, namely, to collect the
              alms, of for this gracious work of preaching, of which it says in
              Eph. (3:8): “To me, though I am the very least of all the saints.”
              He also commends him from his office, because he is a minister of
              grace which we are carrying on: “This is how one should regard us,
              as servants of Christ” (1 Cor. 4:1); “Who has made us competent to
              be ministers of a new covenant” (2 Cor. 3:6). But that grace is
              administered for the glory of the Lord, namely, that our Lord be
              glorified by the alms collected after the conversion of many
              people by our preaching, because, as it says in Prov. (14:28): “In
              a multitude of people is the glory of a king.” Likewise it is
              administered in order that our will be fulfilled, because we want
              this to be done; hence, he says, and to show our good will, i.e.,
              predestined by God, who from eternity predestined us to have such
              a will.

              one after the Apostle to preach to the Corinthians: “I planted,
              Apollos watered, but God gave the growth” (1 Cor. 3:6). But being
              disturbed at their sin, he departed and put aside the carefulness

              help them: “My heart is steadfast, O God”(Ps. 108:1). That your
              mind is ready I prove by two things. First, from our boasting of
              you, for unless I knew that you were ready for this, I would not
              have boasted to them about you. Therefore he says, of which,
              namely, the promptitude of your mind: “For our boast is this, the
              testimony of our conscience” (2 Cor. 1:12); “I have great
              confidence in you” (2 Cor. 7:4). I boast about you to the people
              of Macedonia, saying that Achaia, in which Corinth is the
              metropolis, has been ready since last year to give. Secondly, from
              the effect, because you have provoked many to do this by your
              example. Hence he says, and your zeal, i.e., the desire to imitate
              you, has stirred up most of them, for since they heard of your
              progress after your amendment, many were provoked to make
              progress: “Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another”
              (Prov. 27:17); “For a good purpose it is always good to be made
              much of” (Gal. 4:18); “But earnestly desire the higher gifts” (1

              say, he who sows sparingly, i.e., who gives little in this world,
              will also reap sparingly, i.e., will receive little in the other
              world. And he says, sows, because our seeds are whatever good we
              do; and again, if little is sown, not much is gathered: “For he
              who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption”
              (Gal. 6:8); but multiplied: And he who sows bountifully, i.e.,
              abundantly, will also reap bountifully, i.e., the generous reward
              of God. But will not all reap abundantly? Yes, as to the quantity
              of the reward, because all will abound and no one will reap
              sparingly. But he says, bountifully, in proportion to those sowing
              well: “Star differs from star in glory” (1 Cor. 15:41). All will
              reap abundantly as to the substantial reward, but sparingly as to
              the accidental reward, in which the saints will differ: “As it is
              written, ‘He who gathered much had nothing over, and he who
              gathered little had no lack’” (2 Cor. 8:15), because sometimes a
              person gives sparingly and with great charity, and reaps
              abundantly.

              suam, sed secundum quid, scilicet quod nisi faciat incurrit maius
              damnum, sicut si non proiiciantur merces in mari, navis

              intend to give as a gift, i.e., abundantly, and as worthy of a
              blessing, and not as an exaction, i.e., not sparingly. He says
              this, because what is done spontaneously cannot be done with
              covetousness. Therefore he adds, Each one must do as he has made
              up his mind, as though without covetousness, because each one of
              you should give his alms as he has made up, i.e., decided
              beforehand, in his mind [heart], namely, conferring with himself.
              Not reluctantly or under compulsion: as if to say: let each one
              give willingly, not as being forced. Here he mentions the two
              things opposed to a voluntary action, namely, sadness and
              necessity. For a voluntary action is destroyed by violence, which
              is of two kinds, namely, simple and mixed. It is simple, when
              someone is absolutely compelled to do something against his will.
              To remove that violence he says, not reluctantly, which would be
              present if they gave as though compelled by the command of the
              Apostle. As if to say: do not permit my command to compel you to
              give, but let your ready will move you to do this: “Whoever is of
              a generous heart, let him bring the Lord’s offering” (Ex. 35:5).
              But a mixed violent action happens when one is not absolutely
              forced to do something against his will, but in a qualified sense,
              namely, that he would incur great harm, unless he did it; for
              example, if a ship would sink, unless the cargo were thrown
              overboard. Therefore in one sense it is done willingly, and in
              another sense by force, inasmuch as he is compelled by fear of a
              greater loss. Therefore, to remove this he says, not under
              compulsion, i.e., not making it a mixed violent action. As if to
              say: not from fear of shame, but from the joy you have conceived
              because of the love you have towards the saints: “With a freewill
              offering I will sacrifice to thee” (Ps. 54:6).

              332. – Then when he says, For God loves a cheerful giver, he gives
              the reason, which is this: everyone who rewards gives a reward for
              things worthy of a reward; but only acts of the virtues are such.
              But in the acts of the virtues there are two elements, namely, the
              species of the act and the manner of acting, which is taken on the
              side of the one acting. Hence, unless both are found in an act of
              virtue, that act is not said to be absolutely virtuous, just as a
              person is not said to be perfectly just according to the virtue,
              when he does works of justice, unless he acts with delight and
              with joy. And although with men, who see only what is obvious, it
              is enough that one perform an act of justice according to the very
              species of the act, say an act of justice; nevertheless, with God,
              who sees the heart, it is not enough merely to perform the act of
              a virtue according to the species, but he must also act according
              to the proper manner, namely, with delight and joy. Therefore, it
              is not the giver, but the cheerful giver that God loves, i.e.,
              approves and rewards, and not the sad and grumbling one: “Serve
              the Lord with gladness” (Ps. 100:2); “For the Lord is the one who
              repays” (Sir. 35:11); “He who does acts of mercy, with
              cheerfulness” (Rom. 12:8).

              multiplied for him should give promptly, abundantly and
              cheerfully, just as when we see men sowing seed abundantly and
              promptly and cheerfully, because they gather it up again
              multiplied. Since therefore alms are multiplied for those who give
              them, you should give them promptly, joyfully and abundantly. That
              they are multiplied is evident, because God is able to provide you
              with every blessing. As if to say: do not be afraid to give, as
              though you will be burdened with need and regret having given,
              because God is able to provide you with every blessing of the Holy
              Spirit in abundance, namely, the grace by which you will always
              rejoice in the good work you have done. He says therefore, so that
              you may always be provided in abundance for every good work, i.e.,
              have an abundant will to give alms, just s you have for the other
              works of the virtues, and also that you have a full sufficiency of
              external goods; hence he says, always having enough of everything,
              i.e., considering yourself to have: “He gives to all men
              generously and without reproaching, and it will be given him”
              (Jas. 1:5); “But if we have food and clothing, with these we shall
              be content” (1 Tim. 6:8). Of that sufficiency it says below (2
              Cor. 12:9): “My grace is sufficient for you.” But concerning the
              multiplication it says in Is. (30:25): “And he will give rain for
              the seed with which you sow the ground”; “And every one who has
              left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children
              or lands, for my name’s sake, will receive a hundredfold, and

              in two ways, namely, by authority and from experience. He proves
              it by an authority when he says: rightly should this reason move
              you, because, As it is written, “He scatters abroad, he gives to
              the poor; his righteousness endures for ever.” But a Gloss adduces
              this authority in a sense different from the Apostle’s intention;
              for the Gloss says: I say that you shall abound for every good
              work, namely, by the giving of alms, because, As it is written,
              “He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor.” But the Apostle wishes
              to refer this to his statement that God is able to make every
              grace abound in you; and this, because he who scattered abroad and
              given to the poor, his justice remains forever: “Do good to a
              godly man, and you will be repaid” (Sir. 12:2). In the authority
              cited we note to whom should be given, namely, to the poor, i.e.,
              to the needy: “When you give a dinner or a banquet, do not invite
              your friends or your brothers or your kinsmen or rich neighbors,
              lest they also invite you in return, and you be repaid” (Lk.
              14:12); how to give, namely, he scatters abroad, i.e., not all to
              one person, but divided among many: “If I give away all I have” (1
              Cor. 13:3); “Is it not to share your bread with the hungry” (Is.
              58:7); his righteousness [justice], i.e., the reward for justice,
              endures forever: “But one who sows righteousness gets a sure
              reward” (Prov. 11:18).

              eleemosynas facitis. Tertium est, quia posset aliquis dicere, quod

              336. – He confirms his reason by experience when he says, He who
              supplies seed to the sower and bread for food. As if to say: you
              know from experience that what you give in alms you have from the
              Lord; therefore you should give gladly for the love of God: “For
              all things come from you, and of your own have we given you” (1
              Ch. 29:14). He suggests three things in regard to this. The first
              is that someone could say: if we give now what we have, what is
              necessary for daily food will be wanting to us. But he rejects
              this, saying: he not only supplies seed to the sower, but bread
              for food, i.e., the necessities of life: “He who gives food to all
              flesh” (Ps. 136:24). The second is that they could say: if we give
              much, we will not have enough to give again. The Apostle answers
              this, saying that they will not want, but he will multiply your
              sowing, from which you can give more alms. The third is that
              someone could say: if we give now, the will to give will be lost,
              and we will regret having given, and so we shall lose everything.
              But he removes this, saying: he will increase the harvest of your
              righteousness [justice], i.e., he will increase the ability to
              give alms and the will from which your justice proceeds, to such a
              degree that you will always be prepared and ready to give alms,
              and the fruit will be the most in comparison with the small seed:
              “Honor the LORD with your substance and with the first fruits of
              all your produce” (Prov. 3:9); “I will command my blessing upon
              you” (Lev. 25:21); “Godliness is of value in every way” (1 Tim.

              <i>ut in omnibus locupletati</i>, id est tam in corporalibus, quam
              in spiritualibus bonis. I Cor. I, 5: <i>divites facti estis</i>,

              abundantia divitiarum temporalium, aut quod divitias spirituales
              aliquis otiose absque usu possidere deberet, refert hoc primum ad

              perfectam, <i>simplicitatem</i>, id est largitatem simplici animo
              factam, ut largitio procedat ex divitiis temporalibus, simplicitas
              autem ex spiritualibus. Prov. XI, 3: <i>simplicitas iustorum</i>,

              considered, the first of which is their enrichment, which
              corresponds to what has gone above. For he had said above: he will
              multiply your sowing and increase the fruits of your justice; and
              he recalls the first, saying: You will be enriched in every way,
              i.e., both in bodily and spiritual goods: “That in every way you
              were enriched in him” (1 Cor. 1:5). But lest anyone suppose that
              his end should be placed in an abundance of temporal riches or
              that he should possess spiritual goods in idleness without using
              them, he refers this first to another second thing: have great
              generosity directed by a simple spirit, so that the giving comes
              from temporal goods but the simplicity from spiritual goods: “The
              integrity of the upright guides them” (Prov. 11:13). But this
              should itself be referred to another end, namely, to God;
              therefore he adds in the third place, which, namely, simple
              abundance, through us will produce thanksgiving to God: “Give
              thanks in all circumstances” (1 Th. 5:18).

              poor, and for all others, namely, the faithful in need, and given

              us do good to all men” (Gal. 6:10). Thirdly, on account of what
              these saints have from God that they may give thanks to God; hence

              they consider that the Apostle acts in a worldly manner, i.e.,
              walks according to the flesh. And because every person works
              according to what rules the work, and the end should be the rule,
              it follows that everyone directs his own work to the end he
              intends. Therefore, those who place their end in carnal goods are
              said to walk according to the flesh. And because these things can
              be taken from them, men who tend to carnal things behave gently
              and humbly toward others. Therefore, because they believed that

              destroy strongholds, he indicates the power of spiritual armor,
              which is evident from its threefold effect. The first effect is
              that rebellious persons are put to shame by those arms; in regard
              to this he says, to destroy strongholds. As if to say: the power
              of God is quite capable of destroying the rebellious: “That he may
              be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to confute
              those who contradict it” (Titus 1:9); “See, I have set you this
              day over nations and over kingdoms, to pluck up and to break down,
              to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant” (Jer. 1:10).
              Men fortify themselves against God in two ways: some with astute
              plans, such as tyrants, who plot with their evil designs to
              destroy the things of God, that they may exercise their tyranny;
              as to this he says, we destroy arguments [counsels], namely, of
              tyrants: “He takes the wise in their own craftiness” (Job 5:13).

              this he says, and every proud obstacle [height], namely, of their
              pride: “Do not be haughty” (Rom. 12:16), i.e., proud things, or by
              profundity of intellect, both of lawyers and philosophers:
              “Neither height nor depth” (Rom. 8:39); “Woe to those who are wise
              in their own eyes” (Is. 5:21). Every proud obstacle to the
              knowledge of God, i.e., the faith, which is knowledge of God,
              because they attack things said about God, namely, the virgin
              birth and other of God’s marvels: “For the earth shall be full of
              the knowledge of the Lord” (Is. 11:9); “Who have not learned what
              some call the deep things of Satan” (Rev. 2:24); “So do not become

                7 Look at what is before your eyes. If any one is confident that
                he is Christs, let him remind himself that as he is Christs, so
                are we. 8 For even if I boast a little too much of our
                authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for
                destroying you, I shall not be put to shame. 9 I would not seem
                to be frightening you with letters. 10 For they say, “His
                letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak,
                and his speech of no account.” 11 Let such people understand
                that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present. 12
                Not that we venture to class or compare ourselves with some of
                those who commend themselves. But when they measure themselves
                by one another, and compare themselves with one another, they
                are without understanding.

              laid against me by the false apostles is false, nevertheless, if
              some among you are not convinced by reason and refuse to acquiesce
              to it, at least look at, i.e., consider, the things that are
              before your eyes, i.e., that are evident, concerning me. But he
              submits the judgment of his cause to them in order to indicate how
              secure he is in his heart: “Turn, I pray, let no wrong be done”
              (Job. 6:29). But this is contrary to Jn. (7:24): “Do not judge by
              appearances.” Therefore it is not proper for him to say, what is
              before your eyes. I answer that the phrase, what is before your
              eyes [according to outward appearance], is taken there for things
              that appear outwardly in a man, namely, for that which appear to
              be true, according to which a man should not judge, because
              sometimes the contrary is present in the heart: “Beware of false
              prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing but inwardly are
              ravenous wolves” (Matt. 7:15). But here it is taken for the
              Gospel’s truth itself and the evidence of the fact according to
              which judgment can be made. A Gloss explains it another way,
              namely, according to outward appearance, i.e., of the false
              apostles, see, i.e., look to. As if to say: consider the facts
              about them, because it is impossible that among the many good
              things they pretend they not do some things from which you can
              recognize their wicked intention: “Thus you will know them by
              their fruits” (Matt. 7:20).

              circumcised worked through me also for the Gentiles” (Gal. 2:8).

              building you up, i.e., the church, and not for destroying you, as
              the false apostles do, who abuse the power given to them by using

              this in order that he not despair, seeing that he is treated with
              contempt, and be able to refute his adversaries. This is the way
              Job commended himself, as it is clear from (27:6), where he says:

              humble out of fear or to win their favor; but when he was absent,
              he wrote harshly to them. But the Apostle says that this is not
              so, and that if they would carefully weigh the things that appear,
              they would find him to be in fact as he appears in his epistles;

              given in 1 Cor. (2:3): “And I was with you in weakness and in much
              fear and trembling,” which he did, because they were not firm in
              faith and he wanted to strengthen them by the gentleness of his
              manner. Furthermore, the reason he spoke plain words and did not
              preach subtle things to them is suggested in 1 Cor. (3:1): “But I,
              brethren, could not address you as spiritual men, but as men of
              the flesh, as babes in Christ.” For they were not yet ready for a

              the Apostle now explains that reason. For he had said that he
              measures himself by himself and did not go beyond that measure.
              But a person could be excessive in two ways in glorying and
              commending himself. First, in regard to that about which he
              glories; for example, if he glories about something he does not
              have. Secondly, in regard to that in which he glories; for
              example, if a person has something from someone else, but glories
              in himself as though he has it of himself. Thus the Apostle shows
              that he did not go beyond the measure in glorying or praising
              himself. In regard to the first he does three things. First, he
              states his proposition; secondly, he proves it (v. 14); thirdly,
              he draws the conclusion (v. 15).

              ourselves to ourselves, namely, by doing what our office demands.
              But in doing this we will not boast beyond limit [our measure],
              i.e., when we exercise our power and commend ourselves: “You shall
              do no wrong in judgment, in measures of length or weight or
              quantity” (Lev. 19:35); but will keep to the limits God has
              apportioned us. A Gloss [Lombard] explains this of the limit of
              the Apostle’s prelacy and says: according to the measure, i.e.,
              according to the people measured out to him by God, the people
              whose prelate and rule of conduct he is. But this same thing can
              be taken more universally, such that the measure of the rule is
              the quantity of grace. Then the sense is this: but we glory
              according to the limits God has apportioned us, i.e., according to
              the amount of grace God has given us: “But grace was given to each
              of us according to the measure of Christ’s gift” (Eph. 4:7). This
              grace is a rule keeping us from being lifted up or separated from
              God. Which God has apportioned us, because whatever good we do in
              preaching the Gospel and in converting you and others, it is all
              from God, granted to me for you and others: “I planted, Apollos
              watered, but God gave the growth” (1 Cor. 3:6). A measure, I say,
              to reach even to you, because you are under the measure of grace
              granted to me, by which you have been converted to Christ and obey
              the Gospel. Therefore, what he is proposing is this, namely, that
              he is not going beyond the measure of glorying and praising
              himself that he is their prelate and that they were converted by
              him.

              increases, our field among you may be greatly enlarged, he shows
              that he is not going beyond the measure, when he glories about the
              future. But it should be noted that a preacher has two reasons for
              glorying in his preaching: one is that those converted by his
              preaching are making progress; the other is that other people are
              converted by his converts, because as it says in Ex. (cf. 36:10):
              “Curtain is joined to curtain”; “And let him who hears say,
              ‘Come’” (Rev. 22:17). For one is easily converted when he sees
              others converted. In regard to those two things the Apostle hopes
              that his glorying in the Corinthians will be increased. First, in
              regard to their progress; hence he says: I say that we do not
              glory beyond measure over your conversion caused by us in the
              past, but will hope to be greatly enlarged in the future, i.e.,
              for our glory to be increased in your increasing faith, and in the
              progress of your good works: “Long for the pure spiritual milk,
              that by it you may grow up to salvation” (1 Pet. 2:2). Secondly,
              we hope to be magnified in the conversion of others by you;
              therefore he says, abundantly, i.e., in the abundance of preaching
              not only among you but even in lands beyond you; and this
              according to our rule, i.e., according as Christ has enjoined us
              to preach not only to you but to all the Gentiles “Go into all the
              world and preach the gospel to the whole creation” (Mk. 16:15).
              Without boasting of work already done in another’s field, i.e., we
              do not hope to glory, nor do we glory in another man’s rule. As if
              to say: not in things prepared by others, i.e., whom others have
              brought to the faith, but I will bear fruit among those to whom
              others have not preached: “Thus making it my ambition to preach
              the gospel, not where Christ has already been named” (Rom. 15:20).
              But to the contrary, Peter preached at Rome before Paul preached
              there. I answer that he does not say this as though refusing to
              preach where another has preached; but he says that he intends to
              preach even where no other have preached.

              he shows that he is not going beyond the measure as to that in
              which he glories, saying: if I glory in him in whom one should
              glory, I am not going beyond. But since one should glory in God,
              Let him who boasts, boast of the Lord: “Let him who glories glory
              in this, that he understands and knows me” (Jer. 9:24). This can
              be explained in three ways: in one way, Let him who boasts, boast
              of the Lord, so that in the Lord denotes the object in which he
              glories. As if to say: let him glory in the fact that he possesses
              the Lord by knowing and loving. In another way, Let him who
              boasts, boast of the Lord, i.e., according to God; and one glories
              in this way when he glories in the things of God and not in evil,
              as the one who is asked in Ps. (52:1, Vulgate): “Why do you glory
              in malice?” In the third way, Let him who boasts, boast of the
              Lord, i.e., let him regard himself as having his glory from God,
              referring to God everything that redounds to his own glory: “What
              have you that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do
              you boast as if it were not a gift?” (1 Cor. 4:7). This is the way
              it is taken here when he says: Let him who boasts, boast of the
              Lord. As if to say: I glory in the foregoing, but not as though I
              had this from myself and not from God. And this is also your
              measure, because all your good has sprung from us. And indeed we
              should glory in the Lord, not imputing our glory to ourselves, but
              to God. For it is not the man who commends himself that is
              accepted, i.e., approved by God or by men: “Let another praise
              you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips”
              (Prov. 27:2), but the man whom the Lord commends, i.e., makes
              commendable by good works and miracles. For God is the cause of
              the entire good done by me.

              regula indefinite, sed oportet quandoque praeter regulam communem
              aliquid facere in aliquo casu emergente. Quando autem hoc modo fit
              aliquid praeter communem regulam, sapientes, qui causam huius
              considerant, non turbantur, nec reputant insipienter factum esse.
              Indiscreti vero et minus sapientes non considerantes ex qua causa
              hoc ita fiat, turbantur et reputant stulte factum fore; sicut
              patet, quia praeceptum morale est <i>non occides</i>, aliquando
              tamen necesse est malos occidere. Et quando hoc fit, sapientes
              commendant vel non reputant male factum. Stulti autem et haeretici
              damnant, dicentes hoc esse male factum. Quia ergo communis lex
              moralis est quod homo non commendet seipsum, secundum quod dicitur
              Prov. XXVII, 2: <i>laudet te alienus</i>, etc., potest fieri in

              urgente, tunc nihil esset ibi insipientiae. Sed quia commendat se,

              372. – The Apostle’s desire is that the Corinthians bear with him
              as he commends himself; therefore he begins with an optative
              expression: I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness.
              In regard to this it should be noted that the moral precepts deal
              with actions which, since they are particular and variable, cannot
              be confined within the limits of one general reason and rule with
              no exceptions. But sometimes it is necessary to do something
              beside the common rule in some case that crops up. But when
              something is done beside the common rule in this way, wise men,
              who consider the cause of it, are not troubled and do not think it
              was done foolishly. For example, the moral precept forbids
              killing, but sometimes it is necessary to kill evil men. When this
              is done, wise men commend it or do not think it was wicked to have
              done so, but the undiscerning and less wise, not considering the
              cause why one acted in this manner, are disturbed and think it was
              foolish to do. So when the wicked are killed, fools and heretics
              condemn it, saying it was a wicked thing to do. Therefore, because
              the common law is that a man should not commend himself, as it
              says in Prov. (27:2): “Let another praise you, and not your own
              mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips”, it could happen in some
              case beside this common rule, that a man commends himself and is
              acting praiseworthily; nevertheless, the undiscerning regard it as
              folly. Therefore, since the Apostle was confronted with a case in
              which he should commend himself, he urges them not to lay it to
              his folly, saying, I wish you would bear with me in a little
              foolishness. He says, little, because were he to commend himself
              without cause, it would be the utmost folly. Again, if he
              commended himself for a reason entirely urgent, then there would
              be no folly involved. But because he is commending himself for a
              reason not altogether urgent, since he could refute the false
              apostles in some other way, and because he is commending himself
              very much, there seems to be some folly there; and that is what he
              says, in a little foolishness: “I have been a fool! You forced me
              to it” (2 Cor. 12:11).

              zeal, to exclude folly; secondly, he says that this zeal is not
              irregular, to avoid indiscretion (v. 3); thirdly, he rejects their
              excuse (v. 4). In regard to the first he does two things. First,
              he mentions the holy zeal he has for them; secondly, the cause of
              this zeal, because his office obliged him (v. 2b).

              375. – His zeal, therefore, is holy, because I feel a divine
              jealousy for you, i.e., I love you fervently with the jealousy of
              God, i.e., to God’s honor, not mine. In regard to this it should
              be noted that jealousy taken as being the same as zeal is nothing
              more than a good or evil movement of the spirit concerning itself
              with the state of one’s neighbor, and implies a fervor of love.
              Consequently, zeal is an intense love that does not permit any
              sharing of the beloved. If it does not permit any sharing of an
              evil, say of a vice or some imperfection, but it alone wishes to
              have the beloved exclusively, then the zeal is good and the
              jealousy good. Thus it says in 1 Cor. (12:31): “But earnestly
              desire the higher gifts”; “For a good purpose it is always good to
              be made much of” (Gal. 4:18); “I have been very jealous for the
              Lord, the God of hosts” (1 Kg. 19:10); “For zeal for your house
              has consumed me” (Ps. 69:10). But if it does not allow a sharing
              in something excellent or in some worldly prosperity, because
              someone wants it all for himself, then the zeal is evil and the
              jealousy evil. Now a person is sometimes jealous for his wife, to
              keep her for himself. This is the way the Apostle was jealous on
              behalf of his people, whom he saw prepared for a fall and,
              although espoused to Christ, wished to be prostituted to the
              devil. Consequently, he would not permit Christ, the true spouse,
              to suffer their being shared with the devil; hence he says, a
              divine jealousy. As if to say: Not for me but for Christ, who is
              the spouse: “He who has the bride is the bridegroom” (Jn. 3:29);
              “I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts” (1 Kg.
              19:10).

              husband, Christ, that is, to a perfect man filled with the
              virtues: “The Orient is his name” (Zech. 6:12, Vulgate). Christ is
              called one husband because he is unique both as to the manner of
              conception (as to the manner of being born), and as to the
              fullness of grace: “One man among a thousand I found” (Ecc. 7:28).

              feared that they might set aside his teaching on account of the
              false apostles’ teaching; hence they could say: it is obvious that
              lesser goods should be discarded in favor of greater goods.
              Therefore, if the false apostles teach better doctrines, you
              should not be disturbed if we acquiesce in them. Hence, he

              382. – For the Apostle preached and taught three things. First,
              that they were Christ’s: “For what we preach is not ourselves, but
              Jesus Christ as Lord” (2 Cor. 4:5); secondly, that they have the
              Spirit of Christ: “Any one who does not have the Spirit of Christ
              does not belong to him” (Rom. 8:9); thirdly, that they received
              the Gospel of Christ: “For I am not ashamed of the gospel: it is
              the power of God for salvation to every one who has faith, to the
              Jew first and also to the Greek” (Rom. 1:16). If, therefore, the
              false apostles preach and teach something better to you, you would
              do right and would be excusable; but they do not do this. And this
              is what he says: For if some one comes and preaches another Jesus
              than the one we preached, or if you receive a different spirit
              from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel
              from the one you accepted, you submit to it readily enough. As if
              to say: I fear that a false apostle might come to you unsent, but
              of himself, as a thief and a robber: “All who came before me are
              thieves and robber” (Jn. 10:8); “I did not send the prophets, yet
              they ran” (Jer. 25:21); “And how can men preach unless they are
              sent?” (Rom. 10:15). If, I say, such a preacher preaches to you
              another Christ, namely, more excellent than the one we have
              preached, which cannot be, because as it says in 1 Cor. (8:6):
              “And one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and
              through whom we exist”; and this as to the first. Or if you
              receive a different spirit from the one you received, namely,
              better than the one you have received from us, i.e., by our
              ministry, which cannot be, because as it says in 1 Cor. (12:11):
              “All these are inspired by one and the same Spirit, who apportions
              to each one individually as he wills”; and this as to the second.
              Or if you accept a different gospel, i.e., another preaching or
              doctrine, from the one you accepted from us: “I am astonished that
              you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of
              Christ and turning to a different gospel” (Gal. 1:6). If, I say,
              they did other and better things for you, you submit to it readily
              enough, i.e., you would be right in excusing yourselves. But
              because another, i.e., better Gospel cannot be delivered to them,
              the Apostle excommunicates the Galatians, if they receive another
              Gospel: “If any one is preaching to you a gospel contrary to that
              which you received, let him be accursed” (Gal. 1:9).

              ita proponebat verbum fidei, ut omnes possent capere, conformans

              obtain the faculty to do this, since you are unskilled in our
              speech? He shows that the faculty is due to the vastness of his
              knowledge, saying, even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not in
              knowledge: “So also our beloved brother Paul wrote to you
              according to the wisdom given him” (2 Pet. 3:15). But this should
              be noted, namely, that the false apostles, seeking their own glory
              and pursuing gain, tried to attract people by ornate and subtle
              and exquisite words, trying only to stroke their ears gently. But
              the Apostle, because he was not seeking his own advantage but only
              the spread and growth of the faith, proposed the word of faith in
              such a way that all could understand, adjusting himself to the
              condition and capacity of his hearers. Hence, because they were
              not capable of lofty doctrine in the beginning, he proposed the
              faith to them not in subtle terms but in a way they could
              understand, namely, plainly and clearly. That is why they said he
              was rude in speech: “Not with eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of
              Christ be emptied of its power” (1 Cor. 1:17). On this account the
              Apostle says: although I be rude in speech, as it seems to you,
              this was not due to a lack of knowledge but for your sake by way
              of dispensing it, because I “could not address you as spiritual
              men, but as men of the flesh, as babes in Christ” (1 Cor. 3:1) Or
              according to the letter, it must be said that the Apostle
              stuttered, and on this account the false apostles ridiculed him.
              Therefore he says: for even if I am unskilled in speaking, i.e.,
              have a speech impediment, I am not in knowledge: “I am slow of
              speech and of tongue” Ex. 4:10).

              no less than the others, unless you think I did less and acted
              wrongly, because I lessened my authority in not accepting payments
              from you. But if this were so, I would have done evil. Therefore
              he shows that it is not evil, and this is what he says: Did I
              commit a sin in abasing myself and lessening my authority? As if
              to say: No: “The greater you are, humble yourself in all things,
              and you will find grace in the sight of God” (Sir. 3:20, Vulgate);
              “For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to
              all, that I might win the more” (1 Cor. 9:19); “Whoever humbles
              himself like this child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of
              heaven” (Matt. 18:4). The reason for humbling myself is not for my
              own gain but for your improvement; hence he says: so that you
              might be exalted, i.e., be strengthened in faith. But the
              Corinthians were very covetous, and if he had accepted payment
              from the very beginning, they might perhaps have left the faith.
              Likewise, the false prophets preached for monetary profit.
              Therefore, in order that the Corinthians receive the Apostle, and
              the false prophets remove the occasion for profit, the Apostle
              preached for free and without subsidy.

              support? He answers that it came from the other churches, saying:
              I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to
              serve you. By this he convinces them that they could not say to
              the Apostle that it is unlawful for him to take from them. For if
              it is taken from others for serving them, it is much more lawful
              for him to take from them. From this it is apparent that a papal
              legate visiting one part of his jurisdiction can accept stipends,
              and that the Pope can take subsidies from various parts of the
              world to relieve the needs of some country. The reason is that the
              Church is as one body. But we see in a natural body that, when

              his glory, but to increase it. For the Apostle attributed to
              himself before Christ as his great glory that he alone of all the
              apostles preached to the Corinthians without payment; hence he
              says: I will not burden anyone; this boast of mine shall not be
              silenced, i.e., lessened, namely, that I preached to you free and
              that I refrained from what is lawful for your salvation which is
              Christ’s glory, because he is glorified in me by this, or because
              I particularly have this glory with Christ. This would have been
              broken off in the regions of Achaia, where Corinth was the
              metropolis, if he had taken anything from them, because they were
              avaricious: “For I would rather die than have any one deprive me
              of my ground for boasting” (1 Cor. 9:15).

              Ecclesiam et reciperet corpus Christi. Cui suggestioni

              407. – But it should be noted that Satan sometimes transfigures
              himself so that he can be seen, as by St. Martin, in order to
              deceive men. But for this the discerning of spirits, which God
              conferred in a special way on St. Antony, is necessary and
              sufficient. One is able to know that it is Satan by the fact that
              a good angel urges one to good works from the very beginning and
              continues to do so, but a bad angel pretends good things in the
              beginning, but later, in order to fulfil his desire and accomplish
              what he intends, namely, to deceive, he induces and instigates to
              evil: “Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits
              to see whether they are of God” (1 Jn. 4:1). According to Joshua
              (5:13), when he saw an angel in the field, he said: “Are you for
              us, or for our adversaries?” Another sign is that a good angel,
              even though he causes one to be fearful in the beginning,
              immediately comforts and consoles, as he did Zechariah: “Do not be
              afraid, Zechariah” (Lk. 1:13), and the Blessed Virgin: “Do not be
              afraid, Mary” (Lk. 1:30). But an evil angel stupefies and leaves
              one desolate, in order the more easily to deceive and persuade
              him. But sometimes he transforms himself but cannot be seen; and
              this when he makes things, which are in themselves evil, appear
              good by perverting a man’s senses and inflaming concupiscence:
              “There is a way which seems right to a man, but its end is the way
              to death” (Prov. 14:12). This is the way he deceived a certain
              monk, who had resolved never to leave his cell. But the devil
              suggested to him that it would be good to go to Church and receive
              the body of Christ. Consenting to this suggestion, he broke his
              resolve by going to the Church. Later, recognizing that it was the
              devil, the monk congratulated himself for not being deceived,
              because he had left for a good purpose. Later on, he suggested to
              him that his father had died and left many riches to be
              distributed among the poor, and that he should go to the city.
              When he went there, he never returned and died in sin. Hence, it
              is very difficult for a person to be too careful, but one should
              have recourse to divine help: “Who can open the doors of his face?
              Round about his teeth is terror” (Job 41:14). As if to say: no one
              but God.

              glory according to the flesh on the ground that the false apostles
              glory. I answer that although both are glorying about the same
              thing, the intention and end are not the same, because the false
              apostles commended themselves for their own glory and to acquire

              pseudo, qui volunt vos reducere in servitutem legis. Secundum est
              grave valde, scilicet quod pseudo vivunt de bonis vestris laute,
              nos vero non. Supra VIII, 13: <i>non ut aliis sit remissio</i>, et
              cetera. Et ideo dicit <i>si quis devorat</i>, Matth. c. XXIII, 14:
              <i>vae qui comeditis domos viduarum</i>, et cetera. Tertium grave
              est depraedatio et expoliatio, quia isti ad litteram blandis
              verbis et praetextu pietatis accipiebant eis omnia, et quantum ad
              hoc dicit <i>si quis accipit</i>, id est blande decipit,
              subtrahendo vestra. Rom. c. XVI, 18:
              <i>per blandos sermones seducunt corda insipientium</i>. Quartum
              grave est nimia iactantia super eos cum Corinthiorum contemptu.
              Ideo dicit <i>si quis extollitur</i>, iactando se importune.
              Eccli. c. VI, 2: <i>non te extollas in cogitatione</i>, et cetera.
              Quintum grave est illatio opprobriorum. Nam pseudo non solum tam
              gravia eis inferebant, sed super hoc addebant improperia, dicentes
              eis iniurias, et maxime de ignobilitate. Nam quia ipsi erant
              Iudaei, et cultores unius Dei, dicebant se nobiles esse, et
              Corinthios ignobiles, quia non erant de semine Abrahae, nec
              circumcisi, et quod de idololatris. Et quantum ad hoc dicit
              <i>si quis in faciem vos caedit</i>, id est coram vobis infert
              contumelias et dicit iniurias. Et huiusmodi iniuriae sunt
              <i>secundum ignobilitatem</i>, quam vobis obiiciunt, vel
              ignominiam quam inferunt. Et tamen illos sustinetis, et nos non,
              <i>quasi nos fuerimus infirmi in hac parte</i>
              gloriae, quam attribuistis eis, praeferendo eos nobis, praesertim
              cum pseudo dicant, quod ideo nos non dicimus nec facimus vobis
              ista, quia nos sumus infirmi in hac parte, id est quia sumus
              ignobiles. I Cor. c. IV, 10:
              <i>nos infirmi, vos fortes; vos nobiles, nos autem ignobiles</i>.

              416. – Secondly, he shows wherein they bear with the foolish and
              points out five cases of oppression imposed by the false apostles.
              The first is the yoke of slavery; as to this he says, for you bear
              it if a man, i.e., the false apostles, makes slaves of you. As if
              to say: through Christ you were freed from the bondage of the Law,
              which is in fear, and were raised to the freedom of the sons of
              God, which is charity: “So, brethren, we are not children of the
              slave but of the free woman” (Gal. 4:31). And yet you suffer the
              false apostles, who take such liberty from you and reduce you to
              the slavery of the Law, because they compel you to observe the
              ceremonies of the Law: “Do not submit again to a yoke of slavery”
              (Gal. 5:1). With greater reason, then, should you bear with me,
              who want to preserve you in the freedom of Christ, than with the
              false apostles, who wish to reduce you to the slavery of the Law.
              The second is a very heavy burden, because the false apostles live
              sumptuously on your goods, but we do not: “I do not mean that
              others should be eased and you burdened” (2 Cor. 8:13). Therefore
              he says: or preys upon [devours] you: “Woe to you scribes and
              Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour the houses of widows,
              praying long prayers. For this you shall receive the greater
              judgment” (Matt. 23:14). The third oppression is depredation and
              despoilation, because they literally took everything from them
              with soft words and under the pretext of piety; as to this he
              says, or take advantage of you, i.e., smoothly deceive you by
              taking your property: “By fair and flattering words they deceive
              the hearts of the simple-minded” (Rom. 16:18). The fourth
              oppression is their excessive vaunting of themselves over them
              along with contempt for the Corinthians; therefore he says: or
              puts on airs by conducting himself in a conceited manner: “Do not
              exalt yourself through your soul’s counsel, lest your soul be torn
              in pieces like a bull” (Sir. 6:2). The fifth oppression is verbal
              abuse; for the false apostles not only oppressed them in these
              ways but added reproaches by saying insulting things to them and
              especially about their low estate. For because they were Jews and
              worshippers of the one true God, they called themselves noble and
              the Corinthians ignoble, because they were not of the seed of
              Abraham or circumcised, but descended from idolaters; as to this
              he says, or strikes you in the face, i.e., insults you publicly
              and says harmful things. For these harmful things, I was too weak,
              I must say, to my shame, and yet you bear with them and not with
              us, as if we were too weak for that and for the glory you have
              attributed to them by preferring them to us, especially since the
              false apostles say that the reason we do not say or do such things
              to you is that we are weak in this part, i.e., because we are
              lowly: “We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor,
              but we in disrepute” (1 Cor. 4:10).

              causes why they should bear with him, he now begins to commend
              himself. In regard to this he does two things. First, he shows
              himself equal to the false apostles and others who commended
              themselves; secondly, he prefers himself to them (v. 23b). The
              Apostle makes himself their equal in glory. But glory is of two
              kinds: one is according to the flesh and is slight and worthy of
              scorn; hence he says to the Philippians (3:7): “But whatever gain
              I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ”; the other in
              according to Christ, because “it is great glory to follow the
              Lord” (Sir. 23:38, Vulgate), and this should be sought: “But far
              be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus
              Christ” (Gal. 6:14). The Apostle therefore makes himself equal to
              them in regard to both glories: first, in regard to the first;
              secondly, in regard to the second (v. 23).

              in detail that he is equal to them, indicating one by one the
              points in which he is equal to them, and in which the false
              apostles found glory. But they took glory and commended themselves
              on three points. First, in their nationality and tongue, because
              they called themselves Hebrews; secondly in their race, because
              they said they were of the race of Israel; thirdly, in the
              promise, because they said they were partakers of the promise to
              Abraham, since they were of his seed. So he shows that he is equal
              to them on these three points. First, as to nationality, as if to
              say: I am as they are. It should be noted that, as some say, they
              are called Hebrews from Abraham, because before him that name was
              uncommon. But it can be said, and perhaps better, that the word is
              derived from a certain Eber mentioned in Gen. (11:14-15): “Shelah
              had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber,” and then
              Eber lived thirty-four years and begot Peleg. It was during this
              time that languages became distinct, and the language of the
              Hebrews remained in the family. Secondly, he shows himself equal
              to them in race, saying Are they Israelites? So am I, namely,
              according to rite. Thirdly, as to the third he says: Are they
              descendants of Abraham? So am I. Of these three things it says in
              Phil. (3:4): “If any other man thinks he has reason for confidence
              in the flesh, I have more, circumcised on the eighth day” as to
              the third point; “Of the people of Israel, of the tribe of
              Benjamin,” as to the second point; “A Hebrew born of Hebrews,” as
              to the first: “I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham,
              a member of the tribe of Benjamin” (Rom. 11:1).

              suffered from his own, that is, from the Jews. Hence he says, Five
              times I have received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes
              less one. It should be noted that, as it says in Deut. (25:2): “A
              number of stripes in proportion to his offense. Forty stripes may
              be given him, but not more; lest, if one should go on to beat him
              with more stripes than these, your brother be degraded in your
              sight.” This shows that men should be whipped for lesser sins, yet
              so that the victim never receive more than forty stripes. But the
              Jews, to appear merciful, always acted short of the Law, giving
              less than forty, according as it appeared to them. Therefore,

              the least possible number of strokes below the Law’s limit,

              of his clothing: “His troops come on together; they have cast up
              siegeworks against me, and encamp round about my tent” (Job
              19:12). Secondly, he lists the dangers that inspire fear either
              from his own; hence he says, in danger from my own people, i.e.,
              managed by the Jews: or from outsiders; hence he says, in danger
              from Gentiles, who wanted to capture him for preaching the one
              true God. Consequently, he had no rest from his own or from
              others: “My mother, you bore me, a man of strife and contention to
              the whole land!” (Jer. 15:10). Thirdly, he lists the dangers as to
              their places. First, as to cities he says, danger in the city,
              i.e., in cities stirred up against me, as at Ephesus and Corinth
              (Ac. 18 & 19); or as to a desert place; hence he says, danger in
              the wilderness, either from evil beasts, as when a viper bit his
              hand (Ac. 28:3) as he was collecting sticks; or from want of food.
              Secondly, as to danger at sea, such as perils from plunderers and
              pirates: “Let those who sail the sea tell of its dangers” (Sir.
              43:26, Vulgate). But he mentions a more serious danger, saying,
              danger from false brethren, i.e., from false Christians and
              heretics and false apostles: “Let every man beware of his
              neighbor” (Jer. 9:4).

              endured in homes, and he lists three evils opposed to the three
              goods which are necessary for domestic life. The first good is
              restful sleep; the second is sustenance from food; the third is
              the warmth of clothing. To restful sleep he opposes labor and
              watchings, in regard to which he says, in toil, i.e., manual
              labor: “You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my
              necessities, and to those who were with me” (Ac. 20:34), because
              he literally made his living with his own hands: “With toil and
              labor we worked night and day, that we might not burden any of
              you.” (2 Th. 3:8). As to the weakness resulting from labor he
              says, and hardship [tiredness], which is a weakness and tiredness
              that follows upon labor or from a natural sickness: “My strength
              was dried up as by the heat of summer” (Ps. 32:4). But in regard
              to watchings he says, through many a sleepless night, because he
              devoted himself either to preaching at night or to manual labor.
              In Ac. (20:7) it says that he prolonged his sermon until midnight.

              denied food. One is due to necessity; hence he says, in hunger and
              thirst, namely, because he was unable frequently to obtain food
              and drink: “To the present hour we hunger and thirst” (1 Cor.
              4:11); the other is voluntary; hence he says, often without food,
              i.e., voluntarily undertaken both for the good example and to tame
              the flesh: “I pommel my body and subdue it” (1 Cor. 9:27). But
              this seems to be out of harmony with Matt. (6:33): “But seek first
              his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be
              yours as well.” Why then in hunger and thirst? I answer that when
              it is expedient and for our benefit, they are added, i.e.,
              temporal things; but sometimes it is expedient to lack them.

              “Who would not fear thee, O King of the nations?” (Jer. 10:7); one
              by which he excites love, when he says, Father: “Every good
              endowment and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from
              the Father of lights” (Jas. 1:17); “If then I am a father, where
              is my love?”, or according to another version, “my honor?” (Mal.
              1:5); thirdly, to inspire reverence and praise, who is blessed
              forever: “Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ”
              (2 Cor. 1:3). He, therefore, so revered, so worthy of love, so
              worthy of fear, knows that I do not lie, namely, in what I have
              said and will say: “Our word to you has not been Yes and No” (2

              avoided, and this in a certain particular danger. Here it should
              be noted that the Apostle first began to preach Christ in
              Damascus, where he was thrown to the ground and converted to the
              faith, as he was on his way to arrest Christians. Therefore, the
              Jews appealed to the governor of that city, who was representing
              Aretas the king, to arrest Paul and put him to death. So the
              governor ordered the city-gates to be watched day and night, as it
              says in Ac. (chap. 9). But the Christians who were there, desiring
              to save Paul, lowered him by the wall in a basket. This form of
              escape the Apostle touches on, when he says: truly I am not lying
              about what I am telling you now: for at Damascus, the governor
              under King Aretas, i.e., the governor who ruled at Damascus under
              king Aretas, was induced by the Jews to guard the city of the
              Damascenes to seize me, so that after I was apprehended, I would
              be delivered to the Jews and prevented from preaching. But I was
              let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and escaped his
              hands, namely, the governor’s. This was done in keeping with the
              Lord’s command: “When they persecute you in one town, flee to the
              next” (Matt. 10:23). In this way too did Michel let David down
              through a window to escape from Saul (1 Sam. 19:12), and Rahab let
              the spies down with a cord out of a window (Jos. 2:15).

              439. – But some object against the Apostle’s conduct: first,
              because he seems to have lacked confidence in the Lord and fled. I
              answer that as long as human help is available, a man should not
              run for divine help, because this would be tempting God; but he
              should use human help as much as he can. But the Apostle was not
              yet lacking human help. The second objection is based on Jn.
              (10:12): “He who is a hireling and not a shepherd, whose own the
              sheep are not, sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and
              flees.” Hence, it seems that Paul was not a good shepherd. I
              answer that sometimes the person of the prelate alone is sought,
              and sometimes the prelate along with all the people. When the
              prelate alone is sought, then he should entrust his duties to
              another and absent himself. This is what Paul did. Hence, a Gloss
              says that although he fled, he still took care of his people by
              commending them to the Good Shepherd seated in heaven and saving
              himself for their benefit by flight. But when the entire flock is
              sought, then he should prefer the benefit and safety of the flock
              to his own bodily safety. But note that there is a flight inspired
              by humility, when a person flees honors, as Christ fled when they
              sought to make him king (Jn. 6:15). In the same way Saul, when
              chosen, concealed himself at home (1 Sam. 10:22). Another is
              inspired by caution, namely, when a person flees dangers in order
              to be saved for greater ones. This is the way Elijah fled from
              Jezebel (1 Kg. 19:3), and the way the Apostle fled from the hands
              of the governor.

              made to him by God; it is of these that he wishes to glory. Hence
              he says: If I must boast [glory], i.e., because I must glory for
              your sake, although in itself there is nothing to be gained by it,
              because a person who glories in a good he has received runs the

              “are the treasures of the virtues opened, and the clouds fly out
              like birds.” (Sir. 43:15, Aquinas Latin). And this is signified in

              messengers of the king in Babylon (Is. 39:2). And although,

              Apostolo autem facta est et visio, et revelatio, quia secreta,
              quae vidit, plene intellexit a domino, non a malo spiritu. Unde

              understood the meaning of what was seen, it was a revelation and a
              prophecy. Both, however, namely vision and revelation, are
              sometimes produced by God: “There is a God in heaven who reveals
              mysteries” (Dan. 2:28); “It was I who multiplied visions” (Hos.
              12:10); “Open my eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
              your law” (Ps. 119:18); but sometimes by an evil spirit: “They
              prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray” (Jer. 23:13).
              To the Apostle were made both vision and revelation, because he
              fully understood the secret things he saw. They were produced by
              the Lord and not by an evil spirit. Hence he says: I will go on to
              visions and revelations of the Lord. Now a revelation is a
              removing of a veil. But a veil can be of two kinds: one on the
              part of the beholder, and this is unbelief or sin or hardness of
              heart. Of this veil he said above (3:15): “Yes, to this day
              whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their minds”; the other is
              on the part of the object seen, namely, when spiritual things are
              proposed to someone under the figures of sense-perceptible
              objects. Concerning this it says in Num. (chap. 4) that the
              priests delivered the vessels of the sanctuary veiled to the
              Levites, because weaker persons cannot grasp spiritual things as
              they are in themselves. This is why the Lord spoke to the
              multitudes in parables (Matt. 13:13).

              known we may more easily attain to what was not known. First of
              all, the condition of the beholder, which is praiseworthy, because
              he was in Christ, i.e., conformed to Christ. But on the contrary,
              no one is in Christ, unless he has charity, because “He who abides
              in love abides in God” (1 Jn. 4:16). Therefore, he knew that he
              had charity, which is contrary to what is stated in Ec. (9:1):
              “The righteous and the wise and their deeds are in the hand of
              God; whether it is love or hate man does not know.” I answer that
              being in Christ can be taken in two ways: in one way by faith and
              the sacrament of faith according to Gal. (3:27): “For as many of
              you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ,” namely, by
              faith and the sacrament of faith. This is the sense in which the
              Apostle knew that he was in Christ. In another way a person is
              said to be in Christ through charity, and in this way no one knows
              for certain that he is in Christ, except by certain tests and
              signs, inasmuch as he feels himself disposed and joined to Christ
              in such a way that he would not permit himself to be separated
              from him for any reason including death. This the Apostle
              experienced in regard to himself, when he said: “For I am sure
              that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
              things present, nor things to come, nor powers, nor height, nor
              depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate
              us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.” (Rom. 8:38).
              Hence, he could have had such signs that he was in the charity of
              Christ.

              quo scripsit hanc epistolam. Quando enim hanc epistolam scripsit,

              occisus fuit. Unde si computemus annos descendentes a principio
              imperii Neronis usque ad quatuordecim annos, manifeste apparet,
              quod apostolus habuit has visiones in principio suae conversionis.
              Ipse enim conversus fuit ad Christum anno quo Christus passus est.
              Christus autem passus est circa finem Tiberii Caesaris, quo mortuo
              successit ei Gaius imperator, qui vixit quatuor annis, post quem
              Nero factus est imperator. Et sic inter Tiberium et Neronem

              neque bibens, Act. IX, 9. Commemorat autem tempus suae
              conversionis apostolus ut ostendat, quod si a tempore suae
              conversionis tantum erat gratus Christo, ut talia sibi ostenderet,
              quanto magis post quatuordecim annos, cum profecerit et in

              446. – Secondly, the time of the vision, which was fitting,
              because it was fourteen years ago; for fourteen years had elapsed
              from the time he saw the vision, until he wrote this epistle,
              because when he wrote this epistle he had not yet been cast into
              prison. Hence it seems to have been written at the beginning of
              Nero’s reign, by whom he was killed much later. Hence if we go
              back fourteen years from the beginning of Nero’s reign, it is
              clear that the Apostle had these visions at the beginning of his
              conversion. For he had been converted to Christ in the same year
              that the Lord suffered. But Christ suffered near the end of
              Tiberius Caesar’s reign, who was succeeded at death by the emperor
              Caius, who lived four years, after which Nero became emperor.
              Therefore, between Tiberius and Nero there were four years. Adding
              two years from Tiberius’ reign, because he was not yet dead, when
              Paul was converted, and from Nero’s reign the eight years which
              had passed until he wrote this epistle, there were fourteen years
              between the time of his conversion to the time he wrote this
              epistle. Therefore, some say quite probably that the Apostle had
              these visions during those three days after he was struck down by
              the Lord, when he remained neither seeing nor eating nor drinking
              (Ac. 9:9). But he recalls the time of his conversion to show that
              if he was so pleasing to Christ from the time of his conversion
              that he revealed such things to him, then how much more pleasing
              was he after fourteen years, when he had grown in charity before
              God and in the virtues and graces?

              et aliud rapi. Furari quidem proprie est, cum res alicui latenter
              aufertur. Unde Gen. XL, 15 dicebat Ioseph:
              <i>furtim sublatus sum</i>. Sed rapi proprie dicitur quod subito
              et per violentiam aufertur. Iob VI, 15:

              <i>transit in convallibus</i>. Inde est quod praedones, qui
              violenter expoliant, dicuntur raptores. Sed attende quod aliquis
              homo dicitur rapi ab hominibus, sicut Enoch. Sap. IV, 11:
              <i>raptus est, ne malitia</i>, et cetera. Aliquando rapitur anima
              a corpore. Lc. XII, 20: <i>stulte, hac nocte animam tuam</i>, et
              cetera. Aliquando aliquis dicitur rapi a seipso, quando propter
              aliquid homo efficitur extra se ipsum, et hoc est idem quod
              extasis. Sed et extra se ipsum efficitur homo et per appetitivam
              virtutem et cognitivam. Per appetitivam enim virtutem homo est

              vero extra se ipsum, quando non curat quae sua sunt, sed quae
              perveniunt ad bona aliorum, et hoc facit charitas. I Cor. c. XIII,
              4: <i>charitas non quaerit quae sua sunt</i>. Et de hac extasi
              dicit Dionysius, IV cap. de divinis nominibus:
              <i

                ipsius esse, sed amatorum</i
              >, scilicet rerum amatarum. Secundum cognitivam vero aliquis
              efficitur extra se, quando aliquis extra naturalem modum hominis

              447. – Thirdly, let us see the high point of the vision, because
              he was caught up (raptus) to the third heaven. But it should be
              noted that it is one thing to be the victim of thievery and
              another to be rapt. Properly speaking, the former takes place when
              something is taken away from another in a secret way, hence, in
              Gen. (40:13) Joseph said: “For I was indeed stolen out of the land
              of the Hebrews.” A person is properly speaking rapt when something
              is taken suddenly and by force: “As the torrent that passes
              swiftly (raptim)”, i.e., suddenly and rapidly, “in the valleys”
              (Job 6:15). Hence it is that plunderers who despoil violently are
              called ravagers (raptores). But note that a man is said to be rapt
              from men, as Enoch: “He was caught up (raptim) lest evil change
              his understanding or guile deceive his soul” (Wis. 4:11);
              sometimes the soul is rapt from the body: “Fool! This night your
              soul is required of you” (Lk. 12:20). Sometimes a person is said
              to be rapt by himself, when for some reason he is made to be
              outside himself; and this is the same as ecstasy. But a man is
              made to be outside himself both by his appetitive power and by his
              cognitive power. For by the former a person is in himself, when he
              cares only for things that are his own; but he is made to be
              outside himself when he does not care about things that are his
              own, but about things that pertain to others; and this is the work
              of charity: “Love does not insist on its own way” (1 Cor. 13:5).
              Concerning this ecstasy Dionysius says in the Divine Names (chap.
              4): “Ecstasy is produced by divine love not permitting one to be a
              lover of self but of the beloved,” i.e., of the things loved. But
              a person is made to be outside himself according to the cognitive
              power when he is raised up above the human mode to see something.
              This is the rapture about which the Apostle is speaking here.

              448. – But it should be noted that a mode natural to human knowing
              is that a man know simultaneously with his mental power, which is
              the intellect, and with a bodily one, which is a sense. This is
              why a man in knowing has a free judgment of the intellect, when
              the senses are well disposed in their vigor and not hindered by a
              fettering, as happens during sleep. Therefore a man is made to be
              outside himself when he is removed from this natural disposition
              for knowing, namely, when the intellect, being withdrawn from the
              use of the senses and sense-perceptible things, is moved to see
              certain things. This occurs in two ways: first, by a lack of
              power, no matter how it is produced. This happens in phrenitis and
              other mental cases, so that this withdrawal from the senses is not
              a state of being elevated, but of being cast down, because their
              power has been weakened. But the other way is by divine power, and
              then it is, properly speaking, an elevation, because since the
              agent makes the thing it works on to be like itself, a withdrawal
              produced by divine power and above men is something higher than
              man’s nature.

              elevation from that which is according to nature into that which
              is above nature, produced in virtue of a higher nature.” In this
              definition are mentioned its genus, when it is called an
              elevation; the efficient cause, because it is by the power of a
              higher nature; and the two termini of the change, namely, the
              terminus from which and into which, when it is described as being
              from that which is according to nature into what is above nature.
              Thus it is clear what rapture is.

              he says, to the third heaven. But it should be noted that the
              third heaven is taken in three ways: in one way according to the
              things below the soul; in another way according to the things in
              the soul; and in a third way according to things above the soul.
              Below the soul are all bodies, as Augustine says in the book On
              The True Religion. And so we can think of a threefold heaven: the
              ethereal, sidereal, and empyrean. In this way the Apostle is said
              to have been rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to see things in the
              empyrean heaven; not to exist there, because then he would have
              known whether he was in the body or out of the body. Or according
              to Damascene, who does not admit an empyrean heaven, we can say
              that the third heaven, to which the Apostle was rapt, is above the
              eighth sphere, so that he could clearly see the things which exist
              above all corporeal nature.

              itself, then we should call heaven some altitude of mind which
              transcends natural human knowledge. Now there are three kinds of
              sight, namely, bodily, by which we can see and know bodies;
              spiritual or imaginary, by which we see likenesses of bodies; and
              intellectual, by which we know the nature of things in themselves.
              For the proper object of the intellect is the “what it is” (quod
              quid est) of things. But such a sight of things, if it takes place
              according to the natural mode (e.g. if I see something visible, if
              I imagine something previously seen, or if I understand through
              phantasms) cannot be called heaven. But each of these is called
              heaven when they are above the natural faculty of human knowledge.
              For example, if you see something with your bodily eyes above the
              faculty of nature, then you are rapt into the first heaven. This
              is the way Belshazzar was rapt, when he saw the handwriting on the
              wall, as it is stated in Dan. (5:5). But if you are raised up by
              the imagination or spirit to know something supernaturally, then
              you are rapt to the second heaven. This is the way Peter was rapt,
              when he saw the linen sheet descending from heaven (Ac. 10:11).
              But if a person were to see intelligible things themselves and
              their nature, not through sense-perceptible things not through
              phantasms, he would be rapt to the third heaven.

              452. – But it should be noted that to be rapt to the first heaven
              is to be alienated from the bodily senses. Hence, since no one can
              be totally withdrawn from the bodily senses, it is obvious that no
              one can be rapt in the strict sense to the first heaven, but only
              in a qualified sense, inasmuch as it sometimes happens that a
              person is so engrossed in one sense that he is withdrawn from the
              act of the others. One is rapt to the second heaven when he is
              alienated from sense to see imaginable things; hence, such a
              person is always said to be in ecstasy. And so when Peter saw the
              linen sheet (Ac. 10:11), it is said that he was in ecstasy. But
              Paul is said to have been rapt to the third heaven, because he was
              so alienated from the senses and lifted above all bodily things
              that he saw intelligible things naked and pure in the way angels
              and separated souls see them. What is more, he saw God in his
              essence, as Augustine expressly says in Gen. ad Litt.12 and in a
              Gloss, and ad Paulinus in the book, De Videndo Deum. Furthermore,
              it is not probable that Moses, the minister of the Old Testament
              to the Jews saw God, and the minister of the New Testament to the
              Gentiles, the teacher of the Gentiles, was deprived of this gift.
              Hence he says above (3:9): “For if there was splendor in the
              dispensation of condemnation, the dispensation of righteousness
              must far exceed it in splendor.” That Moses saw God in his essence
              is clear, for he begged God: “Show me your face” (Ex. 33:13,
              Vulgate). And although it was denied him at that time, it is not
              stated that the Lord finally denied him. Hence, Augustine says
              that this was granted him by reason of what is stated in Num.
              (12:6): “If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD make myself
              known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with
              my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house.” For he saw
              God openly and not in a dark manner.

              <i>in lumine tuo videbimus lumen</i>. Sed aliquod lumen

              hierarchy do, then it seems that the Apostle was beatified and,
              consequently, was immortal. I answer that although he saw God in
              his essence, he was not absolutely beatified, but only in a
              qualified sense. Yet it should be noted that the vision of God by
              essence takes place by means of a certain light, namely, the light
              of glory, of which it says in Ps. 36 (9): “In your light we see
              light.” But light is communicated to some things after the manner
              of a passing quality and to others after the manner of an inhering
              form, i.e., connaturally produced; but it is found in the air as a
              passing form and not as a permanent form, because it vanishes when
              the sun is absent. Similarly, the light of glory is infused in the
              mind in two ways: in one way, after the manner of a form
              connaturally made and permanent, and then it makes a mind
              beatified in the strict sense. This is the way it is infused in
              the beatified in heaven. Hence they are called comprehenders and,
              so to say, seers. In another way the light of glory affects a
              human mind as a passing quality; this is the way Paul’s mind in
              rapture was enlightened by the light of glory. Hence, the very
              name, “rapture,” suggests that this was done in a passing manner.
              Consequently, he was not glorified in the strict sense or had the
              mark of glory, because that brightness was not produced as a
              property. As a result it was not derived from the soul in the
              body, nor did he remain in this state permanently. Hence, when he
              was in rapture, he had only the act of the beatified, but he was
              not beatified. Thus it is clear what the Apostle saw in his
              rapture, namely, the condition of the beholder, the time of the
              vision, and the high point of the vision.

              in the body or out of the body, although he says that God knew.
              Hence he says, whether in the body or out of the body I do not
              know, God knows. Some interpret this as meaning that the rapture
              referred to his body, saying that the Apostle did not say he did
              not know whether the soul was joined to the body in that rapture,
              but whether he was rapt according to the soul and body
              simultaneously, so as to have been transported bodily into heaven
              as Habakkuk was transported (Dan. 14:35-39), or whether it was
              according to the soul only that he enjoyed the vision of God, as
              it says in Ez. (8:3): “He brought me in visions of God to
              Jerusalem.” This was the way a certain Jew understood, as Jerome
              mentions in the Prol. to Dan. 3ff., where he says: “Finally, he
              says that even our Apostle does not dare to say that he was rapt
              in the body, but he said: whether in the body or out of the body I
              do not know, God knows.” But Augustine disproves this
              interpretation in Gen. ad Litt.12, because it does not agree with
              the other words of the Apostle. For the Apostle says that he was
              rapt to the third heaven; hence he knew for certain that it was
              the third heaven. Consequently, he knew whether that heaven was
              corporeal or incorporeal, i.e., an incorporeal thing. But if it
              was incorporeal, he knew that he could not have been rapt there
              bodily, because a body cannot exist in an incorporeal thing. But
              if it had been corporeal, he knew that the soul was not there
              without the body, because the soul joined to the body cannot be in
              a place where there is no body, unless the incorporeal heaven is
              called a likeness of the bodily heaven. But if that were the case,
              the Apostle would not have said that he knew he was rapt to the
              third heaven, i.e., to a likeness of heaven, because by that same
              token it could be said that he was rapt in the body, i.e., in the
              likeness of a body.

              no one set in this life and living this mortal life can see the
              divine essence. Hence, the Lord says: “For man shall not see me
              and live” (Ex. 33:20), i.e., no man will see me, unless he is
              entirely separated from the body, namely, in such a way that his
              soul is not in the body as a form, or if it is as a form,

              Et si bene consideretur, bis legitur aliquid de apostolo, ad quod
              possunt isti duo raptus referri. Nam Act. IX, 9 legitur de eo quod

              et ad hoc potest referri primus raptus, ut scilicet tunc fuerit
              raptus usque ad tertium caelum. Sed Act. XXII, 17 legitur quod
              factus est in templo in stupore mentis, et ad hoc refertur iste
              secundus raptus. Sed hoc non videtur verisimile, quia quando in
              stupore mentis factus fuit, missus iam fuerat in carcerem
              apostolus; sed hanc epistolam scripsit apostolus diu ante, unde
              prius scripta fuit haec epistola, quam apostolus fuisset in
              stupore. Et ideo dicendum est, quod differt iste raptus a primo,
              quantum ad id in quod raptus est. Nam in primo raptus est in
              tertium caelum; in secundo vero in Paradisum Dei.

              distinct from the first, and if one considers the matter well, two
              things are written of the Apostle to which these two raptures can
              be referred. For in Acts (chap. 9) it is recorded that he remained
              for three days without seeing and without taking food or drink;
              and the first rapture can be referred to this event, namely, that
              he was rapt to the third heaven at that time. But in Acts (chap.
              22) it says that he was in a trance in the temple; hence the
              second rapture can refer to this. But this does not seem to be a
              similar case, because when he was in the trance, the Apostle had
              been cast into prison; but the Apostle wrote this epistle long
              before that. Therefore it must be said that this rapture differs
              from the first in regard to that into which he was rapt. For in
              the first rapture he had been rapt to the third heaven, but in the
              second to the paradise of God

              <i>vincenti dabo manna absconditum</i>, et cetera. Et ista dulcedo
              est gaudium de divina fruitione, de qua Matth. XXV, 21 dicitur
              <i>intra in gaudium domini tui</i>. Sic ergo patet terminus
              raptus, quia <i>in Paradisum</i>, id est in eam dulcedinem, qua

              460. – But if you take the third heaven in a corporeal sense
              according to the first acceptation of the heavens, as mentioned
              above, or if it was an imaginary vision, it could be called a
              bodily paradise, so that he was rapt to an earthly paradise. But
              this is against the author’s intention, according to whom we say
              that he was rapt to the third heaven, i.e., to a vision of
              intelligible things according to which they are seen in themselves
              and in their own natures, as has been said above. Hence, according
              to this we must not understand one thing by heaven and another by
              paradise, but one and the same thing by both, namely, the glory of
              the saints, but according to one thing in one case and according
              to another thing in the other case. For heaven suggests a certain
              loftiness accompanied by brightness, but paradise a certain joyful
              pleasantness. Now these two things are present in an excellent way
              in the saints and angels who see God, because there is present in
              them a most excellent brightness by which they see God, and a
              supreme agreeableness by which they enjoy God. Therefore, they are
              said to be in heaven as to the brightness and in paradise as to
              the pleasantness: “You shall see, and your heart shall rejoice”
              (Is. 66:14). Therefore, both of these were conferred on the
              Apostle, namely to be raised up to that most excellent clearness
              of knowledge, which he signifies when he says, to the third
              heaven, and to experience the agreeableness of the divine
              sweetness; hence he says, into paradise: “O how great is the
              multitude of thy sweetness, O Lord” (Ps. 31:20); “To him who
              conquers I will give some of the hidden manna” (Rev. 2:17). This
              sweetness is the delight experienced in enjoying God, and is
              mentioned in Matt. (25:13): “Enter into the joy of your master.”
              Thus the terminus of the rapture is clear, namely, into paradise,
              i.e., into that sweetness with which those who are in the heavenly
              Jerusalem are unceasingly refreshed.

              rapt to a vision of the divine essence, which of course, cannot be
              seen by any created likeness. Hence, it is clear that what Paul
              saw of the divine essence cannot be described by any human tongue;
              otherwise, God would not be incomprehensible. Therefore, according
              to the first explanation it must be said: he heard, i.e.,
              considered, secret words, i.e., the magnificence of the godhead,
              which no man can utter. He says “heard” for “saw” because that
              consideration was according to an interior act of the soul, in
              which the same is heard and seen, as it says in Num. (12:8): “For
              I speak to him mouth to mouth.” That consideration is called a
              vision, inasmuch as God is seen in it; and an utterance inasmuch
              as man in instructed about divine things in it.

              ut ostendat quod alius sit qui vidit has visiones. Sciendum est
              enim, quod in homine duo possunt considerari, scilicet donum Dei
              et humana conditio. Si ergo aliquis gloriatur in aliquo dono Dei,
              ut a Deo accepto, illa est bona gloria, quia sic in domino
              gloriatur, ut dictum est supra, X, 17. Sed si gloriatur de illo
              dono, sicut a se habito, tunc mala est gloriatio huiusmodi. I Cor.

              <i>gloriabor, pro me autem</i>
              non, id est non gloriabor inde, quasi a me acceperim, quia a Deo
              habui. Sed si pro me oportet gloriari,
              <i>nihil gloriabor, nisi in infirmitatibus meis</i>, id est non

              465. – In regard to the first it should be noted that the
              statement, on behalf of this man I will boast [glory], but on my
              own behalf I will not boast, can be read in two ways. In one way
              so that the Apostle is showing that he is the one in whom he
              glories, i.e., that he is the one who saw these visions. In
              another way, to show that it was someone else who saw these
              visions. For it should be noted that there are two things to
              consider in man, namely, the gift of God and the human condition.
              If a person glories in a gift of God as received from God, that
              glorying is good, as has been state above (10:17). But if he
              glories in that gift as though he had it of himself, then such
              glorying is evil: “What have you that you did not receive? If then
              you received it, why do you boast as if it were not a gift?” (1
              Cor. 4:7). According to this, therefore, the Apostle says, on
              behalf of this man, namely, for the visions and gifts conferred on
              me by God, I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast,
              i.e., will not glory in them as though I were their source,
              because I had them from God. But if I must glory, I will glory in
              nothing except my weaknesses, i.e., I have nothing in which I can
              glory save in my own condition.

              something in which to glory. Although I might glory in such a man

              Circa primum sciendum est quod plerumque sapiens medicus procurat
              et permittit supervenire infirmo minorem morbum, ut maiorem curet,
              vel vitet, sicut ut curet spasmum, procurat febrem; hoc evidenter
              in se beatus apostolus a medico animarum domino nostro Iesu
              Christo factum ostendit. Christus enim, velut medicus animarum
              summus, ad curandum graves animae morbos permittit plurimos
              electos suos et magnos in morbis corporum graviter affligi, et,
              quod plus est, ad curandum maiora crimina, permittit incidere in
              minora etiam mortalia. Inter omnia vero peccata gravius peccatum
              est superbia. Nam sicut charitas est radix et initium virtutum,
              sic superbia est radix et initium omnium vitiorum. Eccli. X, 15:
              <i>initium omnis peccati superbia</i>. Quod sic patet: charitas
              enim ideo dicitur radix omnium virtutum, quia coniungit Deo, qui
              est ultimus finis. Unde sicut finis est principium omnium
              operabilium, ita charitas est principium omnium virtutum. Superbia
              autem avertit a Deo. Superbia enim est appetitus inordinatus
              propriae excellentiae. Si enim aliquis appetit aliquam
              excellentiam sub Deo, si moderate quidem appetit, et propter
              bonum, sustineri potest; si vero non debito ordine, potest quidem
              alia vitia incurrere, scilicet ambitionis, avaritiae, seu inanis
              gloriae, et huiusmodi, tamen non est proprie superbia, nisi quando
              quis appetit excellentiam, non ordinando illam ad Deum. Et ideo
              superbia proprie dicta separat a Deo, et est radix omnium
              vitiorum, et pessimum omnium; propter quod
              <i>Deus resistit superbis</i>, ut dicitur Iac. IV, 6. Quia ergo in
              bonis est maxime materia huius vitii, scilicet superbiae, quia
              eius materia est bonum, permittit aliquando electos suos impediri,
              ex aliqua sui parte, ut per infirmitatem, vel per aliquem
              defectum, et aliquando etiam per peccatum mortale, ab huiusmodi
              bono, ut sic ex hac parte humilientur, quod ex illa non
              superbiant, et homo sic humiliatus recognoscat se suis viribus
              stare non posse. Unde dicitur Rom. VIII, 28:
              <i>diligentibus Deum omnia</i>, etc., non quidem ex eorum peccato,
              sed ex ordinatione Dei.

              472. – In regard to the first it should be noted that very often a
              wise physician procures and permits a lesser disease to come over
              a person in order to cure or avoid a greater one. Thus, to cure a
              spasm he procures a fever. This the Apostle shows was done to him
              by the physician of souls, our Lord Jesus Christ. For Christ, as
              the supreme physician of souls, in order to cure greater sins,
              permits them to fall into lesser, and even mortal sins. But among
              all the sins the gravest is pride, for just as charity is the root
              and beginning of the virtues, so pride is the root and beginning
              of all vices: “Pride is the beginning of all sin” (Sir. 10:15,
              Vulgate). This is made clear in the following way. Charity is
              called the root of all the virtues, because it unites one to God,
              who is the ultimate end. Hence, just as the end is the beginning
              of all actions to be performed, so charity is the beginning of all
              the virtues. But pride turns away from God, for pride is an
              inordinate desire for one’s own excellence. For if a person seeks
              some excellence under God, if he seeks it moderately and for a
              good end, it can be endured. But if it is not done with due order,
              he can even fall into other vices, such as ambition, avarice,
              vainglory and the like. Yet it is not, properly speaking, pride,
              unless a person seeks excellence without ordaining it to God.
              Therefore pride, properly called, separates from God and is the
              root of all vices and the worst of them. This is why God resists
              the proud, as it says in Jas. (4:6). Therefore, because the matter
              of this vice, that is, pride, is mainly found in things that are
              good, because its matter is something good, God sometimes permits
              his elect to be prevented by something on their part, e.g.
              infirmity or some other defect, and sometimes even mortal sin,
              from obtaining such a good, in order that they be so humbled on
              this account that they will not take pride in it, and that being
              thus humiliated, they may recognize that they cannot stand by
              their own powers. Hence it says in Rom. (8:28): “We know that in
              everything God works for good with those who love him,” not by
              reason of their sin, but by God’s providence.

              473. – Therefore, because the Apostle had good reason for glorying
              in the spiritual choice by which he was chosen by God: “He is a
              chosen instrument of mine” (Ac. 9:15), and in his knowledge of
              God’s secrets, because he says that he was caught up into the
              third heaven where he heard secret words, which it is not granted
              to man to utter, and in enduring evils because he had “far more
              imprisonments, with countless floggings, and often near death” (2
              Cor. 11:23), and in his virginal integrity, because “I wish that
              all were as I myself am” (1 Cor. 7:7), and especially in the
              outstanding knowledge with which he shone and which especially
              puffs one up: for these reasons the Lord applied a remedy, lest he
              be lifted up with pride. And this is what he says: to keep me from
              being too elated by the abundance of revelations: “Do not exalt
              yourself through your soul’s counsel, lest your soul be torn in
              pieces like a bull” (Sir. 6:2); “Being exalted I have been humbled
              and troubled” (Ps. 88:15, Vulgate). Furthermore, to show that
              these revelations were made to him, he says: a thorn was given me,
              i.e., for my benefit and my humiliation: “You have lifted me up
              and set me as it were upon the wind” (Job 31:22); there was given,
              I say, to me a thorn tormenting my body with bodily weakness, that
              the soul might be healed. For it is said that he literally
              suffered a great deal from pain in the ileum [pelvis]. Or a thorn
              in the flesh, i.e., of concupiscence arising from my flesh,
              because he was troubled a great deal: “For I do not do the good I
              want, but the evil I do not want is what I do... So I find it to
              be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand...
              So then, I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with
              my flesh I serve the law of sin” (Rom. 7:19, 21, 25). Hence,
              Augustine says that there existed in him movements of
              concupiscence which God’s grace, nevertheless, restrained.

              prayed that it might; hence he says: Three times I besought the
              Lord about this, that it should leave me. Here it should be noted
              a sick person, ignorant of the reason why a physician supplies a
              stinging plaster, asks him to remove it. But the physician,
              knowing its purpose, that is, for health, does not oblige him,
              caring more for his improvement. Similarly the Apostle, feeling
              that the sting was painful to him, sought the help of the unique
              physician to remove it. For he expressly and devoutly asked God
              three times to remove it, the thorn, from him: “We do not know
              what to do, but our eyes are upon you” (2 Chr. 20:12). Perhaps he
              asked this many times, but he asked him expressly and earnestly
              three times, or three times, namely, many times. For three is a
              perfect number. And of course it was right to ask, because “For he

              either asked discreetly and deserved to be heard, or indiscreetly

              means to virtue and an exercise of virtue, it should be desired.
              But because that secret of divine providence, namely, that it
              would turn out to his advantage, had not been revealed to him yet,
              the Apostle considered that in itself it was bad for him. But God
              who had ordained this to the good of his humility did not oblige
              him, as far as his wish was concerned; indeed, once he understood
              its purpose, the Apostle gloried in it, saying, I will all the
              more gladly boast of my weaknesses, that the power of Christ may
              rest upon [dwell in] me. And although he did not oblige him as to
              his wish, yet he heard him and does hear his saints to their
              advantage. Hence, Jerome says in the Letter to Paulinus: “The good
              Lord frequently does not grant what we wish, in order to bestow
              what we should prefer.”

              infirmitas est materia exercendae virtutis. Et primo humilitatis,

              magis sollicitatur ad resistendum, et ex hoc, quod magis resistit

              destruere omnes habitatores terrae; sed aliquos reservavit, ut
              scilicet filii Israel exercitarentur pugnando cum eis. Sic etiam

              479. – Then he gives the reason for the Lord’s response when he
              says, for my power is made perfect in weakness [infirmity]. This
              is a remarkable expression: virtue is made perfect in infirmity;
              fire grows in water. But this can be understood in two ways,
              namely, materially and by way of occasion. If it is taken
              materially, the sense is this: infirmity is the material on which
              to exercise virtue; first, humility, as stated above; secondly,
              patience: “The testing of your faith produces steadfastness” (Jas.
              1:3); thirdly, temperance, because hunger is weakened by infirmity
              and a person is made temperate. But if it is taken as an occasion,
              infirmity is the occasion for arriving at perfect virtue, because
              a man who knows that he is weak is more careful when resisting,
              and as a result of fighting and resisting more he is better
              exercised and, therefore, stronger. Hence it says in Jdg. (3:1)
              that the Lord was not willing to destroy all the inhabitants of
              the land, but preserved some in order that the children of Israel
              might be exercised by fighting against them. In the same way,
              Scipio also did not wish to destroy the city of Carthage, in order
              that the Romans, having external enemies, would not have internal
              enemies, against whom it is more painful to wage war than against
              outsiders, as he said.

              the Lord, saying: I will all the more gladly boast of my
              weaknesses, that the power of Christ may rest upon me. He mentions

              weaknesses, i.e., given to me for my profit; and this because it

              in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ” (Gal. 6:14); “But he that
              is glorified in poverty, how much more in wealth?” (Sir. 10:34.
              Vulgate). The reason I will glory gladly is that the power of
              Christ may rest upon me [dwell in me], i.e., that through
              infirmity the grace of Christ may dwell and be made perfect in me:
              “He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might he
              increases strength” (Is. 40:29).

              says therefore: because the power of Christ dwells in me in all
              tribulations, I am content, i.e., I am greatly pleased and take
              joy in the infirmities I mentioned: “Count it all joy, my
              brethren, when you meet various trials” (Jas. 1:2). The weaknesses
              in which he rejoices abundantly on account of Christ’s grace are

              namely, his infirmities; hence he says, in my weaknesses: “Their
              infirmities were multiplied: afterwards they made haste” (Ps.
              16:5, Vulgate), namely, toward grace. Secondly, those that come
              from an external cause: first, as to the word, when he says, in
              insults: “Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing
              that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name”
              (Ac. 15:4); then as to deed, and this either as to a lack of good
              things, when he says, in hardships, i.e., in the lack of things
              necessary and in the poverty by which he was pressed: “Contribute
              to the needs of the saints” (Rom. 12:13). Or as to experiencing
              evils inflicted, and this as to external things: “Blessed are
              those who are persecuted for righteousness’ sake” (Matt. 5:10),
              when he says, in bodily persecutions, which we experience from
              place to place and everywhere, as well as to internal things,
              saying, in calamities, i.e., in anxieties of soul: “I am
              straitened on every side” (Dan. 13:22, Vulgate). But in all these
              things the material which makes for joy is that they are for
              Christ. As if to say: I am pleased because I suffer for Christ:
              “But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief” (1 Pet.

              good they should have done, in which he enlarges upon their
              ingratitude; secondly, by committing evil, in which he execrates
              their malice (v. 20). In regard to the first he does two things.
              First, he reminds them what they ought to have done by showing the
              cause (v. 11c); secondly, he rejects their excuse (v. 13).

              commended by them? I answer that the Apostle did not need
              commendations for himself, but for others, namely, that in
              commending himself his doctrine would be held in greater authority
              and the false apostles refuted.

              apostle. Yet the signs of a true apostle, i.e., of my preaching,

              which faith is strengthened, because when one’s life agrees with
              his doctrine, the doctrine has greater authority, and the virtue
              of the preacher is more apparent through patience: “The learning
              of a man is known by patience” (Prov. 19:11, Vulgate); therefore

              forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and

              is common to all miracles, for might is the full extent of a
              power. Therefore, something is called mighty [virtuosum] because
              it proceeds from great power [virtute]. Therefore, because
              miracles come from great power, namely the divine, they are
              therefore called “powers” [virtutes]. But “sign” refers to a
              lesser miracle, and “wonder” to a greater one. Or he says “signs”
              as to miracles performed in regard to the present and “wonders” in
              regard to miracles concerning the future. Or signs and wonders
              refer to miracles done contrary to nature; for example, giving
              sight to the blind, raising from the dead, and so on. But mighty
              deeds are things according to nature, not performed in the way
              nature does, as for a sick man to be healed immediately, when
              one’s hands are placed on him; for nature produces the same effect
              step by step. Or mighty deeds mean the virtues of the mind, such
              as chastity and so on.

              things than you. Therefore, we are not willing to commend you to

              than the other churches of Christ have obtained through him in

              the faith and the Apostle preached the faith; they showed signs

              have less, but even more, because the other apostles live on the
              revenues of those to whom they preached, but not the Apostle. For

              his hands, lest they hold a bribe” (Is. 33:15). But if you count
              this an injury, namely, that I refused to take anything from you
              (as I did not), because I did not love you, and it seems to you
              that I have done wrong, spare me. Hence he says in irony, forgive,
              that is, spare me this wrong! In this manner it says in Eph.

                children ought not to lay up for their parents, but parents for
                their children. 15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for
                your souls. If I love you the more, am I to be loved the less?
                16 But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty,
                you say, and got the better of you by guile. 17 Did I take
                advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you? 18 I
                urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take
                advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not
                take the same steps? 19 Have you been thinking all along that we
                have been defending ourselves before you? It is in the sight of
                God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your
                upbuilding, beloved.

              happens that the reason why some do not receive at one time is
              that they might be keeping themselves in reserve for another time,
              in which they can receive both more and more boldly. Therefore,
              lest they suppose something like this of the Apostle, namely, that
              he refused to take anything from them the first time, in order
              that he might receive more the second time, he says that he not
              only did this in the past, but is prepared to do the same in the
              future; hence he says, Here for the third time I am ready to come
              to you. And I will not be a burden. As if to say: not even then
              will I burden you by taking what is yours: “So I refrained and
              will refrain from burdening you in any way” (2 Cor. 11:9); “I hold
              fast my righteousness, and will not let it go” (Job. 27:6). He
              says, here for the third time I am ready to come, and not “this
              third time I am coming,” because he certainly was prepared to go
              to them a third time, yet he went only twice. For he was prepared
              to go the first time; he went and they were converted. He was
              ready a second time, but he was prevented on account of their sin.
              It was for this that he apologized in the beginning of this
              letter. Now he was ready to go a third time, and he went. Hence he
              went twice, but he was ready to go three times.

              495. – Then he gives the reason for this good resolution, when he
              says: for I seek not what is yours but you. The reasoning is this:
              it is clear that an artisan arranges his work according to the end
              he has in view, but when preachers preach, some intend revenue and
              temporal goods; consequently they arrange and direct all their
              preaching to this. Others intend the salvation of souls;
              consequently, they arrange their preaching according as they deem
              it expedient for the salvation of souls. Therefore, because the
              Apostle in his preaching aimed at the salvation of the Corinthians
              and he saw that it was expedient to take no revenue from them,
              both in order to shame the false apostles and also because they
              were covetous, he refused to take any revenue. Hence he assigns
              this reason: I will not burden you by taking anything, because I
              seek not what is yours by my preaching, but you and your salvation
              are what I aim to procure: “Not that I seek the gift; but I seek
              the fruit” (Phil. 4:17). Therefore the Lord said to the apostles:
              “I will make you fishers of men” (Matt. 4:19), not of money. This
              is also prefigured in Gen. (chap. 47), where we read that Joseph
              brought some Egyptians for the service of the king, because the
              good preacher should be intent upon converting believers to the
              service of Christ.

              498. – But there is a question here about parents according to the
              flesh, for it says in Ex. (20:12): “Honor your father and your
              mother,” which includes that we must minister to their needs.
              Therefore the children are bound to lay up for their parents. I
              answer that this precept binds children to minister to and help
              their parents in necessity, but not to gather and lay up for them.
              For laying up and gathering have an eye on the future. But in
              nature the children succeed the parents and not vice versa, except
              in some sad cases. Therefore the love of parents naturally induces
              them to lay up for the children. It is in this way that the
              Apostle speaks; but in Ex. (chap. 20) the Lord is speaking about
              helping them in case of necessity.

              parents, it seems that princes and others do wrong when they give
              their riches to prelates. I answer that they gave them to prelates
              not for themselves, but for the poor, and this is what the Lord

              lay up for and give to the children; in regard to this he says:

              i.e., food them by word, feed them by example, feed them by
              temporal subsidies. Not only will I give those things to you, but

              none of those whom I sent to you overreached you. For I sent Titus
              to you with entreaties. And this is what he says: I urged Titus to
              go, and sent the brother with him, namely, Barnabas or Luke: “With
              him,” namely Titus, “we are sending the brother,” namely one of
              those mentioned, “who is famous among all the churches for his
              preaching of the gospel” (2 Cor. 8:18). But did Titus take
              advantage of you? As if to say: No: “But thanks be to God who puts
              the same earnest care for you into the heart of Titus” (2 Cor.
              8:16). That Titus did not overreach them he proves by showing that
              Titus was of the same mind as the Apostle, and he mentions two
              points of similarity: first, in the heart; hence he says: Did we
              not act in the same spirit?, i.e., have the same will; or we were
              inspired by the same spirit to act well and correctly: “Since we
              have the same spirit of faith as he had who wrote, ‘I believed,
              and so I spoke,’ we too believe, and so we speak” (2 Cor. 4:13).
              Secondly, in work; hence he says: Did we not take the same steps,
              i.e., intent on the same works? That is to say, in the steps of
              Christ, for I walk in the steps of Christ: “I have kept his way,”
              namely, Christ’s, “and have not turned aside” (Job 23:11); “Christ
              also suffered for you, leaving you an example, that you should
              follow in his steps” (1 Pet. 2:21). And Titus follows my steps:
              “Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ” (1 Cor. 11:1). Therefore,
              if he agrees with me in will and in work, and I have not
              overreached you and do not intend to overreach you, the conclusion
              is evident. That he did not overreach them is clear from Matt.

              that way has two things: one is that he does not use true words,
              but fabrications; the other is that he was not wont to suffer the
              loss of reputation and glory. Hence, it is especially because of
              the loss of reputation that they make excuses. But neither of
              these is verified in us. Therefore, your opinion is not true. That
              neither of these is verified in us is clear, because we do not
              employ false words. This he proves first by God’s testimony,
              because it is in the sight of God that we are speaking. As if to
              say: God is my witness, that I speak the truth: “Even now, behold,
              my witness is in heaven” (Job 16:19) Secondly, by the testimony of
              Christ, because we have been speaking in Christ, i.e., by Christ
              in whom there is not falsity: “But as men of sincerity, as
              commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ” (2
              Cor. 2:17). Furthermore, we do not seek our own glory or fear loss
              of reputation, because all things which I have said about my
              revelations and tribulations, I do or say for your upbuilding,
              namely, that you continue in virtue and expel the false apostles:
              “Let us then pursue what makes for peace and for mutual
              upbuilding.” (Rom. 14:19); “Let all things be done for
              edification.” (1 Cor. 14:26); “This voice has come for your sake,

              which consists in clinging to the false apostles, because by
              fostering sin among you they were exposing you to great danger.
              Therefore he says, I fear that perhaps I may come and find you not
              what I wish, namely, just, but sinners and uncorrected, and that
              you will be displeasing to me and I to you, because sinners as
              sinners are not pleasing to a just man; and that you may find me,
              i.e., sad and meting out punishment, not what you wish to have me.
              For evil persons hate correction and the truth: “Have I then
              become your enemy by telling you the truth?” (Gal. 4:16). Thus
              their evil is clear in general, namely, that he feared lest they
              were not yet fully repentant.

              Sciendum est autem, circa primum, quod Corinthienses post
              conversionem inciderunt in peccatum carnale, ut patet de illo qui
              uxorem patris habuit, et de hoc in hac parte correcti sunt per
              primam epistolam, non tamen plene sed adhuc aliquid in eis
              remansit, et supra hoc remanserunt in eis multa peccata
              spiritualia, quae proprie opponuntur charitati. Charitas vero duo
              facit. Primo enim facit corda hominum ad invicem consentientia;
              secundo inducit homines ad mutuum profectum. Et ideo, peccata
              spiritualia, e contrario, primo, faciunt homines ad invicem
              dissentientes; secundo faciunt eos invicem offendentes. Et ideo

              Nam, secundum rectum ordinem, homines primo dissentiunt, inquantum
              unus vult unum, alius vult contrarium; secundo, ex hoc procedunt
              ad inferendum nocumenta, inquantum quilibet vellet obtinere in
              proposito suo; tertio, quando non potest obtinere in proposito
              suo, sed succumbit, accenditur zelo invidiae; quarto, ex hoc

              511. – In regard to the first it should be noted that after their
              conversion the Corinthians fell into sins of the flesh, as is
              evident from the one who had his father’s wife; and for this they
              were corrected by the first epistle, although not completely,
              because something still remained among them. In addition to this
              there remained among them many spiritual sins which are directly
              opposed to charity. Now charity does two things: first, it makes
              men’s hearts consent to one another; secondly, it induces men to
              mutual progress. Spiritual sins, on the other hand, set men
              disagreeing and make them offend one another. First, therefore, he
              lists the spiritual sins which pertain to dissention; secondly,
              those which make for offense (v. 20c). In regard to dissensions he
              proceeds in reverse order. For according to the right order, men
              first disagree, inasmuch as one wants one thing and another the
              contrary; secondly, they pass from this to inflicting injury,
              inasmuch as each one wants to obtain his desire; thirdly, when he
              cannot obtain his desire but fails, he burns with the zeal of
              jealousy [envy]; fourthly, the result of this is verbal argument.

              saying, that perhaps there may be quarreling [contentions]. As if
              to say: not only do I fear your evils in general, but also in
              particular, lest perhaps there be among you contentions over the
              merits of prelates and baptizers: “It is an honor for a man to
              keep aloof from strife” (Prov. 20:3). “Contention is an attack on
              the truth, accompanied by the confidence of shouting” (Ambrose).
              This contention springs from jealousy; hence he says, and jealousy
              by those who are inferior and have less: “For where jealousy and
              selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile
              practice” (Jas. 3:16); “Jealousy slays the simple” (Job 5:2); “But
              through the devil’s envy death entered the world” (Wis. 2:24).
              Envy comes from animosity; hence he says, anger, in revenge and
              inflicting injury: “Go not on the way with a bold man, lest he
              burden you with his evils” (Sir. 8:18, Vulgate). Animosity comes
              from dissensions; hence he says, selfishness, i.e., hatreds and
              conflicts of spirits: “Take note of those who create dissensions
              and difficulties, in opposition to the doctrine which you have
              been taught” (Rom. 15:17); “All of you agree and that there be no

              But because such evils consist mainly in injuries from words and
              not from deeds, he passes over injuries from deeds and lists those
              from words. Here too he proceeds in reverse order, beginning from
              the last; and this is when a person explicitly says something evil
              of another. If this is in public, he is a detractor; hence he
              says, slander [detraction]: “Slanderers, haters of God” (Rom.
              1:30). If it is in secret, he is a whisperer; hence he says,
              gossip [whisperings]. For whisperers are persons who discreetly
              sow discord: “The whisperer and the double tongue is accursed”
              (Sir. 28:5, Vulgate). These two proceed from evil words against
              others; therefore he says, conceit [swelling]. These swellings
              arise from seditions, which are the preparations made by the
              parties to a fight, because they are always quarrels among the
              proud; hence he says, disorder, i.e., uproars for fights: “An evil
              man always seek quarrels” (Prov. 17:11, Vulgate). Thus their
              wickedness is made clear in regard to present evils, which are
              many both in dissensions and in injuries.

              who sinned before and all the others. Here he first suggests the
              judicial process to be followed, which requires that three
              warnings have been given. In regard to this he says: I have warned
              you before twice, as I warned them when present, namely, when I
              was among you, so I warn them now, that is, while absent. Thus he
              warns them three times. I warn, I say, those who sinned before and
              all the others. As if to say: I warn everyone. Secondly, having
              given the warning, he threatens the sentence; hence, he says, that
              if I come again I will not spare them. As if to say: those who
              sinned I spared the first time; but if they sin again, or have not
              done penance, I will not spare them again. This would be just,
              because a person who is forgiven once and sins again, if he were
              forgiven, would grow in malice and become insolent. Hence the wise
              man says in Prov. (13:24): “He that spares the rod hates his son.”
              As a result the Church has decreed that three admonitions must be
              given before it declares one excommunicated, because it happens
              that some, although they are in sin and offend, are corrected by a
              mere word of warning and make satisfaction. But if they are not
              influenced by warnings, the severity of sentence must be applied,
              lest they grow more insolent: “Because sentence against an evil
              deed is not executed speedily, the heart of the sons of men is
              fully set to do evil” (Ec. 8:11).

              of the Father who is also the power of Christ, because the power

              524. – In regard to the first it should be noted that one who
              would appear in judgment securely should first examine himself on
              his deeds; in that way he can tell whether he will appear safely.
              Therefore the Apostle warns them that before they come to
              judgment, which will take place when he comes to them, they should
              examine themselves, saying: examine yourselves, i.e., examine and
              reflect on your acts: “Test everything; hold fast what is good” (1
              Th. 5:21). He advises them to examine themselves on two points,
              namely, on faith; hence he says: to see whether you are holding to
              your faith, namely, which I have preached to you and you have
              received from me concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, or have fallen
              away and lapsed into another. This is necessary because in 1 Cor.
              (11:31) it says: “But if we judged ourselves truly, we should not
              be judged”; “Look at your way in the valley; know what you have
              done” (Jer. 2:23). Likewise all works, when he says: test
              yourselves, whether you be in good works, or whether your
              conscience bothers you for having done some evil. This is useful,
              because it says in 1 Cor. (2:28): “Let a man examine himself”; and
              in Gal. (6:4): “Let each one test his own work.”

              Respondeo. Dicendum est, quod habitare Christum in nobis, potest
              accipi dupliciter: vel quantum ad intellectum, vel quantum ad
              affectum. Si quantum ad intellectum, sic ipse habitat in nobis per

              527. – But here there is a literal question in regard to the
              statement: Do you not realize that Jesus Christ is in you? For
              Christ only remains in those who have charity, as it says in 1 Jn.
              (4:16): “God is love, and he who abides in love abides in God, and
              God abides in him” If therefore we know that Christ is in us by
              faith, it is required that this be by formed faith. But this is
              contrary to Ec. (9:1): “Their deeds are in the hand of God;
              whether it is love or hate man does not know.” I answer that
              “Christ dwelling in us” can be taken in two ways, namely, in
              regard to the intellect or in regard to the affections [affectum].
              If it is taken in regard to the intellect, then he dwells in us by
              unformed faith; and in this way we know there is nothing to
              prevent our knowing with certainty that Christ dwells in us,
              namely, when we know that we hold the faith which the Catholic
              Church teaches and holds. But if it is taken in regard to the
              affectivity, then Christ dwells in us by formed faith; and in this
              way no one can know that Christ dwells in him, or that he has
              charity, unless this certainty be granted to a person by
              revelation and a special grace. But there is nothing to prevent us
              from having a conjecture [coniecturum] that we are in charity,
              namely, when a person finds himself so ready and disposed that he
              would not wish to do anything against Christ in any way for
              something temporal: “Beloved, if our hearts do not condemn us, we
              have confidence before God” (1 Jn. 3:21). It is clear, therefore,
              that the Apostle is speaking in regard to the first way. Or he is
              even speaking of knowledge which is by a conjecture, as has been
              said. But his argument proceeds as to the second way and in regard
              to knowledge which is certain.

              nisi pro veritate et pro ipsa stamus. Constat autem, quod si
              puniremus innocentes, faceremus contra veritatem, et contra
              iustitiam. Unde cum apostolus non possit facere contra veritatem
              sed pro veritate, id est pro iustitia, manifestum est, quod non
              puniet innocentes. Notandum est, secundum Augustinum in Glossa,
              quod ad vitandum peccata, necessaria sunt duo, scilicet liberum
              arbitrium, et gratia Dei. Si enim liberum arbitrium non esset
              necessarium, numquam darentur homini praecepta, nec prohibitiones,
              nec exhortationes. Frustra etiam darentur poenae. Gratia etiam est
              necessaria, quia nisi Deus omnes regeret per gratiam suam, non
              posset homo stare. Frustra etiam oraremus, quod non inducat nos in
              tentationem. Et ideo apostolus ostendens utrumque esse
              necessarium, et orat Deum pro gratia obtinenda, et monet ut per
              liberum arbitrium recedant a malo et faciant bonum. Unde dicit
              <i>oramus</i> quantum ad primum,
              <i>ut nihil mali faciatis</i>
              quantum ad secundum.

              531. – That he would lack this power of judging, if they are good,
              is shown when he says: For we cannot do anything against the
              truth. As if to say: we do not labor for anything but the truth,
              and for it we stand. But it is obvious that if we were to punish
              the innocent, we would be standing against the truth and against
              justice. Hence, since the Apostle could not do anything against
              the truth, but for the truth and for justice, it is clear that he
              will not punish the innocent. It should be noted, according to
              Augustine in a Gloss [Lombard], that two things are necessary for
              avoiding sins, namely, free will and God’s grace. For if free will
              were not needed, neither precepts nor prohibitions nor
              exhortations would ever be given to men; further, punishments
              would be given in vain. But grace, too, is necessary, because
              unless God ruled all by his grace, a man could not stand;
              furthermore, it would be in vain to pray that he not lead us into
              temptation. Consequently, the Apostle, indicating that both are
              necessary, prays God to obtain grace, and advises that they
              withdraw from evil with their free will, and do good; hence he
              says, we pray, as to the first, that you may not do wrong, as to
              the second.

              we notice that each natural thing tends towards its own
              perfection, for which is had a natural desire; hence, to each
              thing is given the natural power to enable it to attain to its
              perfection. But God gives man grace, by which he may attain to his
              ultimate and perfect consummation, i.e., happiness, towards which
              he has a natural desire. Hence, when a person does not tend toward
              perfection, it is a sign that he does not have a sufficiency of
              God’s grace. Therefore, the Apostle, in order that they might grow
              in grace, prays that they be perfected: “And it is my prayer that
              your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all

              for it, saying, I write this while I am away from you, in order
              that when I come I may not have to be severe, i.e., I write these
              things to you in my absence to warn you, lest I be forced to do
              something against my will, which is that I may do nothing severe
              against you, except to the extent that I am compelled by you.
              Hence he says, that when I come among you I may not have to be
              more severe against you than I would wish or than you would wish:
              “For you admonished them and tried them as a father” (Wis. 11:11,
              Vulgate); “I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold to
              you when I am away!— I beg of you that when I am present I may not
              have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing
              against some” (2 Cor. 10:1). But because the Corinthians might
              say, “But supposing that we have acted well, would you be able to
              deal severely against us?” Therefore he answers, saying: No,
              because I neither plan nor am able to act except in my use of the
              authority which the Lord has given me. But God gave me this power,
              namely, of binding and loosing, for building up and not for
              tearing down, i.e., that you might be built up and not that you be
              destroyed. And if I were to correct you severely, I would not be
              building up but destroying: “Our authority, which the Lord gave
              for building you up and not for destroying you” (2 Cor. 10:8). But
              the Lord gave this power to Paul: “Set apart for me Barnabas and

              operatione. Et ideo dicitur in Ps. XCIX, 2:
              <i>iubilate Deo, omnis terra, servite domino in laetitia</i>;
              Phil. IV, 4:
              <i>gaudete in domino semper; iterum dico, gaudete</i>, et cetera.

              joy in the good they had; hence he says: finally brethren, who
              have been constant, farewell [rejoice] in the things you have done
              for God’s service. This is necessary, if you are to be just and
              virtuous, because no one is just or virtuous who does not take joy
              in just and virtuous activities. Therefore it says in Ps. 100 (2,
              Vulgate): “Sing joyfully to God, all the earth: serve the Lord
              with gladness”; “Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say,
              Rejoice” (Phil. 4:4). Indeed, a person should always rejoice
              because joy keeps a man in good condition, whereas one cannot
              continue long that which causes sorrow. Secondly, the good should
              have in themselves a zeal for perfection; in regard to this he
              says, mend your ways [be perfect], i.e., always tend to what is
              perfect: “Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ
              and go on to maturity [perfectionem]” (Heb. 6:1). What is said
              here is not a precept to be perfect, but always tend toward
              perfection. And this is necessary because a person who does not
              aim at progressing is in danger of falling back. For we notice
              that unless the rowers strive to go forward, the ship always goes
              backward. This is what the Lord said: “You, therefore, must be
              perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect” (Matt. 5:48).

              that they agree: therefore he says, agree with one another; and
              that they be at peace: hence he says, live in peace. These two
              things are so related that one is external and the other internal.
              For it is clear that bodies cannot be preserved and kept orderly
              unless the members are mutually coordinated. In like manner
              neither the Church nor the members of the Church, unless they are
              in proper order and united one with another. But there is a double
              union required for uniting the members of the Church: one is
              interior, that is, that they agree by faith in regard to the
              intellect by believing the same things, and by love in the will by
              loving the same things. Hence he says, agree with one another,
              i.e., agree in regard to matters of faith, and love the same
              things with the affection of charity. For true wisdom is present
              when the activity of the intellect is perfected and consummated by
              the repose and delight experienced by the affections: “That
              together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our
              Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom. 15:6); “That all of you agree” (1 Cor.
              1:10); “Complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same
              love, being in full accord and of one mind” (Phil. 2:2). The other
              is exterior, namely, peace: therefore he says, live in peace among
              yourselves: “Strive for peace with all men” (Heb. 12:14); “Seek
              peace, and pursue it” (Ps. 34:15); “Now may the Lord of peace
              himself give you peace at all times in all ways” (2 Th. 3:16).

              you, he mentions the reward given to those who fulfil these
              admonitions. As if to say: if you keep peace among you, the God of
              love and peace will be with you. In regard to this it should be
              noted that among the Gentiles was a custom that certain gifts be
              used as names for the gods, because although there is but one God,
              nevertheless certain special gifts were used for naming the gods
              from those gifts. Thus, from the gift of peace they call a god the
              god of peace, and from the gift of salvation, the god of
              salvation. Alluding to this practice, the Apostle says: the God of
              love and peace will be with you, not that peace is one god, as
              they said, but Christ is called the God of peace because he is the
              giver of peace and is one who loves: “My peace I give to you” (Jn.
              14:27); “For God is not a God of confusion but of peace” (1 Cor.
              14:53); “God’s love has been poured into our hearts through the
              Holy Spirit which has been given to us” (Rom. 5:5). He is also the
              author of peace: “In me you may have peace. In the world you have
              tribulation” (Jn. 16:33); “His abode has been established in
              peace” (Ps. 71:3, Vulgate). Furthermore, he is not only the God of
              peace, but also of love; hence, he says: the God of love and peace
              will be with you. This is so, because a person who exists in true
              peace of heart and body exists in charity, and “He who abides in
              love abides in God, and God abides in him” (1 Jn. 4:16); and
              because a person merits only through peace and love” “If a man
              loves me, he will keep my word, and my Father will love him” (Jn.

              hence he says: Greet one another with a holy kiss. Here it should
              be noted that a kiss is a sign of peace. For a man breathes
              through the mouth with which a kiss is given. Therefore, when men
              give one another kisses, it is a sign that they are uniting their
              spirit of peace. But there is a false peace, and this is done by
              those who “speak peace with their neighbors, while mischief is in
              their hearts” (Ps. 28:3), which is accomplished with the deceit of
              a kiss: “Better are the wounds of a friend, than the deceitful
              kisses of an enemy” (Prov. 27:6, Vulgate). There is also an evil
              and degrading peace, namely, when men come together to commit
              evil: “Afterward it was not enough for them to err about the
              knowledge of God, but they live in great strife due to ignorance,
              and they call such great evils peace” (Wis. 14:22). And this is
              sealed with a lustful kiss. In Prov. (7:13, Vulgate) it is said of
              an evil woman that “Catching the young man, she kisses him, and
              with an impudent face, flatters him.” There is also a holy peace
              which God produces: “And the peace of God, which passes all
              understanding, will keep your hearts and your minds in Christ
              Jesus” (Phil. 4:7), and this is obtained by a holy kiss, because
              it unites the spirit with holiness. It is of this kiss that he
              says here: with a holy kiss. From this there arose the practice
              whereby believers and holy men kiss one another as a sign of
              charity and union

              the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of
              the Holy Spirit be with you all. Here it should be noted that
              there are two modes of appropriating something to the divine
              persons: one is essentially [essentialiter] and the other causally
              [causaliter]. Essentially power [potentia] is appropriated to the
              Father because he is power essentially; inasmuch as he is the
              principle. To the Son, wisdom, inasmuch as he is the Word. To the
              Holy Spirit, love, inasmuch as he is goodness. But here the
              Apostle does not appropriate those things in this way, namely, by
              essence [per essentiam], because then all things would be
              appropriated to the Holy Spirit; rather, he appropriates by cause
              [per causam]. Therefore, since grace is a gift by which sins are
              forgiven: “Justified by his grace as a gift” (Rom. 3:24), and the
              remission of sin is accomplished in us by the Son who took our
              flesh and satisfied for our sins: “Grace and truth came through
              Jesus Christ” (Jn. 1:17): for this reason the Apostle attributes
              grace to Christ, when he says, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ.
              But charity is necessary for us because we must become united to
              God: “He who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him”
              (1 Jn. 4:16). And because this is from God the Father, inasmuch as
              he so loved the world as to send his only begotten Son (Jn. 3:16):
              “God shows his love for us” (Rom. 5:8), he attributes charity to
              him as to its source, when he says, and the love of God, namely,
              the Father. Finally, the communication of divine gifts is
              accomplished by the Holy Spirit: “All these are inspired by one
              and the same Spirit” (1 Cor. 12:11). Therefore he attributes
              communication to the Holy Spirit, when he says, and the fellowship
              [participation] of the Holy Spirit. Or, he attributes this to him
              because he is common to the other two persons.

              things that are necessary when he says: The grace of the Lord
              Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy
              Spirit be with you all. The grace of Christ, by which we are made
              just and are saved; the charity of God the Father, by which we are
              united to him; and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit distributing
              divine gifts to us. Amen.
