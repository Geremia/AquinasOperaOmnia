          <td colspan="2">FIVE QUALITIES OF PRAYER
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Inter alias orationes oratio dominica principalior invenitur. Habet enim quinque excellentia, quae in oratione requiruntur. Debet enim esse oratio secura, recta, ordinata, devota et humilis.
          <td>Among all other prayers, the Lord's Prayer holds the chief place. It has five excellent qualities which are required in all prayer. A prayer must be confident, ordered, suitable, devout and humble.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secura quidem, ut cum fiducia adeamus ad thronum gratiae eius, ut dicitur Hebr. IV. In fide etiam non deficiens: dicitur enim Iac. I, 6: <i>postulet autem in fide, nihil haesitans</i> . Rationabiliter autem haec oratio est securissima: est enim ab advocato nostro formata, qui est sapientissimus petitor, in quo sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae, ut dicitur ad Coloss. II, de quo dicitur I Ioan. II: <i>advocatum habemus apud patrem, Iesum Christum iustum</i> ; unde dicit Cyprianus in Lib. de oratione dominica: <i>cum Christum habeamus advocatum apud patrem pro peccatis nostris, quando pro delictis nostris petimus, advocati nostri verba proponamus</i> .
          <td>It must be confident: "Let us, therefore, go with confidence to the throne of grace."[1] It must not be wanting in faith, as it is said: "But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering."[2] That this is a most trustworthy prayer is reasonable, since it was formed by Him who is our Advocate and the most wise Petitioner for us: "In whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge;"[3] and of whom it is said: "For we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the just one."[4] Hence, St. Cyprian says: "Since we have Christ as our Advocate with the Father for our sins, when we pray on account of our faults, we use the very words of our Advocate."[5]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ulterius securior apparet ex hoc quod ipse qui orationem exaudit cum patre, docuit nos orare, secundum illud Psal. XC, 15: <i>clamabit ad me, et ego exaudiam eum</i> . Unde dicit Cyprianus: <i>amica, familiaris et devota oratio, dominum de suo rogare</i> . Unde ab hac oratione nunquam sine fructu receditur: nam per eam venialia dimittuntur, ut dicit Augustinus.
          <td>Furthermore, this prayer is even more worthy of confidence in that He who taught us how to pray, graciously hears our prayer together with the Father, as it is said in the Psalm: "He shall cry to Me, and I will hear him."[6] Thus writes St. Cyprian: "It is a friendly, familiar, and devout prayer to ask of the Lord in His own words."[7] And so no one goes away from this prayer without fruit. St. Augustine says that through it our venial sins are remitted.[8]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Debet etiam esse oratio nostra recta, ut petat orans a Deo quae sibi conveniunt. Nam Damascenus dicit: <i>oratio est petitio decentium a Deo</i> . Multoties enim non exauditur oratio, quia indecentia postulantur. Iac. IV, 3: <i>petitis et non accipitis, eo quod male petatis</i> . Scire autem quid sit petendum, difficillimum est, cum difficillimum sit scire quid sit desiderandum. Ea enim quae licite petuntur in oratione, licite desiderantur: et ideo apostolus dicit, ad Rom. VIII, 26: <i>nam quid oremus sicut oportet, nescimus</i> . Ipse autem Christus doctor est: nam ipsius est docere quid nos orare oporteat. Nam discipuli dixerunt ei, Luc. XI, 1: <i>domine, doce nos orare</i> . Ea ergo quae ipse orare docuit, rectissime postulantur: unde Augustinus: <i>quaecumque autem verba dicamus, nihil aliud dicimus quam quod in ista oratione dominica positum est, si recte et congruenter oramus</i> .
          <td>Moreover, our prayer must be suitable, so that a person asks of God in prayer what is good for him. St. John Damascene says: "Prayer is the asking of what is right and fitting from God."[9] Many times our prayer is not heard because we seek that which is not good for us: "You ask and you do not receive, because you ask amiss."[10] To know, indeed, what one ought to pray for is most difficult; for it is not easy to know what one ought to desire. Those things which we rightly seek in prayer are rightly desired; hence the Apostle says: "For we know not what we should pray for as we ought."[11] Christ Himself is our Teacher; it is He who teaches us what we ought to pray for, and it was to Him that the disciples said: "Lord, teach us to pray."[12] Those things, therefore, which He has taught us to pray for, we most properly ask for. "Whatsoever words we use in prayer," says St. Augustine, "we cannot but utter that which is contained in our Lord's Prayer, if we pray in a suitable and worthy manner."[13]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Debet etiam esse oratio ordinata sicut desiderium, cum oratio sit desiderii interpres. Est autem hic debitus ordo, ut spiritualia carnalibus, caelestia terrenis desiderando et orando praeferamus, secundum illud Matth. VI, 33: <i>primum quaerite regnum Dei et iustitiam eius; et haec omnia adiicientur vobis</i> . Hoc dominus in hac oratione servare docuit: in qua primo petuntur caelestia, et postmodum terrena.
          <td>Our prayer ought also to be ordered as our desires should be ordered, for prayer is but the expression of desire. Now, it is the correct order that we prefer spiritual to bodily things, and heavenly things to those merely earthly. This is according to what is written: "Seek ye first therefore the kingdom of God and His justice, and all these things shall be added unto you."[14] Here Our Lord shows that heavenly things must be sought first, and then things material.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Debet etiam oratio esse devota, quia pinguedo devotionis facit sacrificium orationis esse Deo acceptum, secundum illud Psal. LXII, 5-6: <i>in nomine tuo levabo manus meas: sicut adipe et pinguedine repleatur anima mea</i> . Devotio autem plerumque propter prolixitatem orationis obtunditur: unde dominus superfluam orationis prolixitatem docuit vitare, dicens Matth. VI, 7: <i>orantes autem nolite multum loqui</i> . Et Augustinus dicit ad Probam: <i>absit ab oratione multa locutio; sed non desit multa provocatio, si fervens perseveret intentio</i> . Unde dominus hanc orationem brevem instituit. Consurgit autem devotio ex caritate, quae est amor Dei et proximi: quorum utrumque in hac oratione ostenditur. Nam ad insinuandum divinum amorem, vocamus eum patrem; ad insinuandum autem amorem proximi, communiter pro omnibus oramus dicentes, <i>pater noster, et dimitte nobis debita nostra</i> : ad quod proximorum dilectio nos induit.
          <td>Our prayer must be devout, because a rich measure of piety makes the sacrifice of prayer acceptable to God: "In Thy name I will lift up my hands. Let my soul be filled with marrow and fatness."[15] Many times because of the length of our prayers our devotion grows cool; hence Our Lord taught us to avoid wordiness in our prayers: "When you are praying, speak not much."[16] And St. Augustine says: "Let much talking be absent from prayer; but as long as fervor continues, let prayer likewise go on."[17] For this reason the Lord made His Prayer short. Devotion in prayer rises from charity which is our love of God and neighbor, both of which are evident in this prayer. Our love for God is seen in that we call God "our Father;" and our love for our neighbor when we say: "Our Father... forgive us our trespasses," and this leads us to love of neighbor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Debet etiam oratio esse humilis, secundum illud Psal. ci, 18: <i>respexit in orationem humilium</i> ; et Luc. XVIII, et Pharisaeo et publicano; et Iudith IX, 16: <i>humilium et mansuetorum semper tibi placuit deprecatio</i> . Quae quidem humilitas in hac oratione servatur: nam vera humilitas est quando aliquis nihil ex suis viribus praesumit, sed totum ex divina virtute impetrandum expectat.
          <td>Prayer ought to be humble: "He hath had regard for the prayer of the humble."[18] This is seen in the parable of the Pharisee and the Publican (Luke, xviii. 9-15), and also in the words of Judith: "The prayer of the humble and the meek hath always pleased Thee."[19] This same humility is observed in this prayer, for true humility is had when a person does not presume upon his own powers, but from the divine strength expects all that he asks for.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Nota insuper, quod tria bona facit oratio. Primo enim est efficax et utile remedium contra mala. Liberat enim a peccatis commissis. Psal. XXXI, 5-6: <i>tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei: pro hac orabit ad te omnis sanctus</i> . Sic latro in cruce oravit, et remissionem obtinuit: quia, <i>hodie mecum eris in Paradiso</i> , Luc. XXIII, 43. Sic publicanus oravit, et iustificatus descendit in domum suam, Luc. XIII. Liberat etiam a timore peccatorum supervenientium, a tribulationibus et tristitiis. Iac. ult., 13: <i>tristatur quis in vobis? Oret</i> (aequo animo). Liberat etiam a persecutionibus et inimicis. Psal. CVIII, 4: <i>pro eo ut me diligerent, detrahebant mihi: ego autem orabam</i> .
          <td>It must be noted that prayer brings about three good effects. First, prayer is an efficacious and useful remedy against evils. Thus, it delivers us from the sins we have committed: "Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin. For this shall every one that is holy pray to Thee in a seasonable time."[20] The thief on the Cross prayed and received forgiveness: "This day thou shalt be with Me in paradise."[21] Thus also prayed the Publican, and "went down to his home justified."[22] Prayer, also, frees one from the fear of future sin, and from trials and sadness of soul: "Is any one of you sad? Let him pray."[23] Again it delivers one from persecutors and enemies: "Instead of making me a return of love, they detracted me, but I gave myself to prayer."[24]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo est efficax, et utilis ad omnia desideria obtinenda. Marc. XI, 24: <i>omnia quaecumque orantes petitis credite quia accipietis</i> . Et si non exaudimur, hoc est quia non instanter petimus: <i>oportet (enim) semper orare, et non deficere</i> , Luc. XVIII, 1, vel quia non petimus id quod magis expedit ad salutem: Augustinus: <i>bonus dominus, qui saepe non tribuit quod volumus, ut tribuat quod mallemus</i> . Et hoc reperitur de Paulo, qui ter petiit a se removeri stimulum, et non est exauditus: II Cor. XII. Tertio est utilis, quia facit nos familiares Deo. Psal. CXL, 2: <i>dirigatur oratio mea sicut incensum in conspectu tuo</i> .
          <td>In the second place, prayer is efficacious and useful to obtain all that one desires: "All things whatsoever you ask when you pray, believe that you shall receive."[25] When our prayers are not heard, either we do not persevere in prayer, whereas "we ought always to pray, and not to faint,"[26] or we do not ask for that which is more conducive to our salvation. "Our good Lord often does not give us what we wish," says St. Augustine, "because it would really be what we do not wish for." St. Paul gives us an example of this in that he thrice prayed that the sting of his flesh be removed from him, and his prayer was not heard.[27] Thirdly, prayer is profitable because it makes us friends of God: "Let my prayer be directed as incense in Thy sight."[28]

          <td colspan="2"><b>OUR FATHER</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo, <i>pater</i> . Nota hic duo, quomodo scilicet pater sit, et quid debemus ei, quia pater est. Dicitur autem pater ratione specialis creationis, quia creavit nos ad imaginem et similitudinem suam quam aliis creaturis inferioribus non impressit. Deut. XXXII, 6: <i>ipse est pater tuus, qui fecit et creavit te</i> . Item ratione gubernationis: quanquam enim omnia gubernet, nos tamen gubernat ut dominos, alia ut servos. Sap. XIV, 3: <i>tua, pater, providentia cuncta gubernat</i> ; et ibid. XII, 18: <i>et cum magna reverentia disponis nos</i> . Item ratione adoptionis: quia aliis creaturis dedit quasi munuscula, nobis autem hereditatem, et hoc quia filii; sed si filii et heredes. Apostolus, Rom. VIII, 15: <i>non accepistis spiritum servitutis in timore, sed spiritum adoptionis filiorum, in quo clamamus, abba, pater</i> .
          <td>Our FATHER.—Note here two things, namely, that God is our Father, and what we owe to Him because He is our Father. God is our Father by reason of our special creation, in that He created us in His image and likeness, and did not so create all inferior creatures: "Is not He thy Father, that made thee, and created thee?"[1] Likewise God is our Father in that He governs us, yet treats us as masters, and not servants, as is the case with all other things. "For Thy providence, Father, governeth all things;"[2] and "with great favor disposest of us."[3] God is our Father also by reason of adoption. To other creatures He has given but a small gift, but to us an heredity—indeed, "if sons, heirs also."[4] "For you have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry, Abba (Father)."[5]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Debemus autem nos ei quatuor. Primo honorem. Mal. I, 6: <i>si ego pater, ubi est honor meus?</i> : Qui consistit in tribus. In laudis datione quoad Deum. Psal. XLIX, 23: <i>sacrificium laudis honorificabit me</i> : quae non solum debet esse in ore, sed etiam in corde. Isai. XXIX, 13: <i>populus hic labiis me honorat; cor autem eorum longe est a me</i> . In corporis puritate quoad seipsum. I Cor. VI, 20: <i>glorificate et portate Deum in corpore vestro</i> . In iudicii aequitate quoad proximum. Psal. XCVIII, 4: <i>honor regis iudicium diligit</i> .
          <td>We owe God, our Father, four things. First, honor: "If then I be a Father, where is My honor?"[6] Now, honor consists in three qualities. (1) It consists in giving praise to God: "The sacrifice of praise shall glorify Me."[7] This ought not merely come from the lips, but also from the heart, for: "This people draw near Me with their mouth, and with their lips glorify Me, but their heart is far from Me."[8] (2) Honor, again, consists in purity of body towards oneself: "Glorify and bear God in your body."[9] (3) Honor also consists in just estimate of one's neighbor, for: "The king's honor loveth judgment."[10]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo debemus ei imitationem, quia pater est. Ier. III, 19: <i>patrem vocabis me, et post me ingredi non cessabis</i> : quae perficitur in tribus. In dilectione. Ephes. V, 1: <i>estote imitatores Dei, sicut filii carissimi, et ambulate in dilectione</i> : et hoc oportet esse in corde. In miseratione. Dilectio enim debet esse cum miseratione. Luc. VI, 36: <i>estote ergo misericordes</i> : et hoc debet esse in opere. In perfectione. Quia dilectio et miseratio debet esse perfecta. Matth. V, 48: <i>estote perfecti, sicut et pater vester caelestis perfectus est</i> .
          <td>Secondly, since God is our Father, we ought to imitate Him: "Thou shalt call Me Father, and shalt not cease to walk after Me."[11] This imitation of our Father consists of three things. (1) It consists in love: "Be ye therefore followers of God, as most dear children; and walk in love."[12] This love of God must be from the heart. (2) It consists in mercy: "Be ye merciful."[13] This mercy must likewise come from the heart, and it must be in deed. (3) Finally, imitation of God consists in being perfect, since love and mercy should be perfect: "Be ye therefore perfect, as also your Heavenly Father is perfect."[14]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio debemus ei obedientiam. Hebr. XII, 9: <i>multo magis obtemperabimus patri spirituum</i> . Et hoc propter tria. Primo propter dominium: ipse enim est dominus. Exod. XXIV, 7: <i>omnia quae locutus est dominus, faciemus, et erimus obedientes</i> . Secundo propter exemplum: quia verus filius factus est patri obediens usque ad mortem, ut dicitur Philip. II. Tertio propter commodum: II Reg. VI, 21: <i>ludam ante dominum qui elegit me</i> . Quarto debemus ei patientiam in castigationibus. Prov. III, 11-12: <i>disciplinam domini, fili mi, ne abiicias, nec deficies, cum ab eo corriperis. Quem enim diligit dominus, corripit, et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi.</i>
          <td>Thirdly, we owe God obedience: "Shall we not much more obey the Father of spirits?"[15] We must obey God for three reasons. First, because He is our Lord: "All things that the Lord has spoken we will do, we will be obedient."[16] Secondly, because He has given us the example of obedience, for the true Son of God "became obedient to His Father even unto death."[17] Thirdly, because it is for our good: "I will play before the Lord who hath chosen me."[18] Fourthly, we owe God patience when we are chastised by Him: "Reject not the correction of the Lord; and do not faint when thou art chastised by Him. For whom the Lord loveth He chastises; and as a father in the son He pleaseth Himself.[19]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><i>Noster</i> . Ex hoc autem ostenditur quod duo debemus proximis. Primo amorem, quia fratres nostri sunt, nam omnes sunt filii Dei: I Ioan. IV, 20: <i>qui non diligit fratrem suum quem videt; Deum, quem non videt, quomodo potest diligere?</i> . Item reverentiam, quia filii Dei sunt. Mal. II, 10: <i>nunquid non pater unus omnium nostrum? Numquid non Deus unus creavit nos? Quare ergo despicit unusquisque vestrum fratrem suum?</i> Rom. XII, 10: <i>honore invicem praevenientes</i> . Et hoc propter fructum, quia ipse <i>factus est omnibus obtemperantibus sibi causa salutis aeternae</i> , Hebr. V, 9.
          <td>OUR Father.—From this we see that we owe our neighbor both love and reverence. We must love our neighbor because we are all brothers, and all men are sons of God, our Father: "For he that loveth not his brother whom he seeth, how can he love God whom he seeth not?"[20] We owe reverence to our neighbor because he is also a child of God: "Have we not all one Father? Hath not one God created us? Why then does everyone of us despise his brother?"[21] And again: "With honor preventing one another."[22] We do this because of the fruit we receive, for "He became to all that obey the cause of eternal salvation."[23]
        <tr style="text-align:center">
          <td colspan="2"><b>WHO ART IN HEAVEN</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><i>Qui es in caelis</i> . Inter cetera quae oranti sunt necessaria, fiducia plurimum valet. Iac. I, 6: <i>postulet autem in fide, nihil haesitans</i> . Unde dominus nos orare docens, ea praemittit ex quibus in nobis fiducia generetur: scilicet ex benignitate patris: unde <i>pater noster</i> dicit, secundum illud Luc. XI, 13: <i>si vos, cum sitis mali, nostis bona data dare filiis vestris; quanto magis pater vester caelestis de caelo dabit spiritum bonum petentibus se?</i> Et ex magnitudine potestatis: unde dicit, <i>qui es in caelis</i> . Unde Psal. CXXII, 1: <i>ad te levavi oculos meos qui habitas in caelis</i> .
          <td>Who Art in Heaven.—Among all that is necessary for one who prays, faith is above all important: "Let him ask in faith, nothing wavering."[24] Hence, the Lord, teaching us to pray, first mentions that which causes faith to spring up, namely, the kindness of a father. So, He says "Our Father," in the meaning which is had in the following: "If you then being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father from heaven give the good Spirit to them that ask him!"[25] Then, He says "Who art in heaven" because of the greatness of His power: "To Thee have I lifted up my eyes, who dwellest in heaven."[26]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Potest autem hoc ad tria pertinere. Primo quidem ad orantis praeparationem: quia dicitur Eccli. XVIII, 23: <i>ante orationem praepara animam tuam</i> : ut intelligatur, in caelis, hoc est in caelesti gloria, secundum illud Matth. V, 12: <i>merces vestra copiosa est in caelis</i> . Et haec praeparatio debet esse per caelestium imitationem, quia filius debet imitari patrem. Unde dicitur I Cor. XV, 49: <i>sicut portavimus imaginem terreni, portemus et imaginem caelestis</i> . Item per caelestium contemplationem: quia homines solent frequentius cogitationem dirigere ubi habent patrem et alia quae diligunt, secundum illud Matth. VI, 21: <i>ubi est thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cor tuum</i> . Unde dicebat apostolus Philip. III, 20: <i>nostra conversatio in caelis est</i> . Et per caelestium intentionem, ut ab eo qui in caelis est, non nisi caelestia quaeramus, secundum illud Coloss. III, 1: <i>quae sursum sunt quaerite, ubi Christus est</i> .
          <td>The words, "who art in heaven," signify three things. First, it serves as a preparation for him who utters the prayer, for, as it is said: "Before prayer prepare thy soul."[27] Thus, "in heaven" is understood for the glory of heaven: "For your reward is very great in heaven."[28] And this preparation ought to be in the form of an imitation of heavenly things, since the son ought to imitate his Father: "Therefore, as we have borne the image of the earthly, let us bear also the image of the heavenly."[29] So also this preparation ought to be through contemplation of heavenly things, because men are wont to direct their thoughts to where they have a Father and others whom they love, as it is written: "For where thy treasure is, there is thy heart also."[30] The Apostle wrote: "Our conversation is in heaven."[31] Likewise, we prepare through attention to heavenly things, so that we may then seek only spiritual things from Him who is in heaven: "Seek things that are above, where Christ is."[32]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo potest pertinere quod dicitur, <i>qui es in caelis</i> , ad audientis facilitatem, quia propinquus est nobis; ut intelligatur, <i>qui es in caelis</i> , idest in sanctis, in quibus Deus habitat, secundum illud Ier. XIV, 9: <i>tu in nobis es domine</i> . Sancti enim caeli dicuntur, secundum illud Psal. XVIII, 2: <i>caeli enarrant gloriam Dei</i> . Habitat autem Deus in sanctis per fidem: Ephes. III, 17: <i>Christum habitare per fidem in cordibus vestris</i> . Per dilectionem: I Ioan. IV, 16: <i>qui manet in caritate in Deo manet, et Deus in eo</i> . Per mandatorum impletionem Ioan. XIV, 23: <i>si quis diligit me, sermonem meum servabit; et pater meus diliget eum, et ad eum veniemus, et mansionem apud eum faciemus</i> .
          <td>"Who art in heaven" can also pertain to Him who hears us, who is nearest to us; and then the "in heaven" is understood to mean "in devout persons" in whom God dwells, as it is written: "Thou, O Lord, art among us."[33] For holy persons are called "the heavens" in the Psalm: "The heavens show forth the glory of God,"[34] since God dwells in the devout through faith. "That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts."[35] God also dwells in us through love: "He that abideth in charity, abideth in God and God in him."[36] And also through the keeping of the commandments: "If any one love Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him, and will make Our abode with him."[37]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio potest pertinere quod dicitur, <i>qui es in caelis</i> , ad efficaciam exaudientis; ut per caelos, corporeos caelos intelligamus: non quod Deus corporalibus caelis includatur, secundum illud III Reg. VIII, 27: <i>caelum et caeli caelorum te capere non possunt</i> ; sed ut significetur quod Deus est perspicax in consideratione, utpote qui de alto videt: Psal. ci, 20: <i>prospexit de excelso sancto suo</i> ; et quod sublimis est in potestate, secundum illud Psal.

Unde et de Christo dicitur Psal. LXXXVIII, 30: <i>thronum eius sicut dies caeli</i> .
          <td>In the third place, "who art in heaven" can pertain to Him who is in heaven, He who cannot be included in the physical heavens, for "the heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain Thee."[38] And so it can mean that God is all-seeing in His survey of us, in that He sees us from above, that is, from heaven: "Because He hath looked forth from His high sanctuary; from heaven the Lord hath looked upon the earth."[39] It also signifies how sublime is God in His power: "The Lord hath prepared His throne in heaven";[40] and that He lives without change through eternity: "But Thou, O Lord, endurest forever."[41] And again: "Thy years shall not fail."[42] And so of Christ was it written: "His throne as the days of heaven."[43]

          <td>The Philosopher says that on account of the incorruptibility of the heavens all have considered them as the abode of spirits.[44] And so "who art in heaven" tends to give us confidence in our prayer which arises from a threefold consideration: of God's power, of our familiarity with Him, and of the fitness of our requests.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Potestas enim eius a quo petitur, insinuatur, si per caelos intelligantur caeli corporei: et quamvis ipse locis corporalibus non comprehendatur, cum scriptum sit Ier. XXIII, 24: <i>caelum et terram ego impleo</i> , tamen dicitur esse in caelis corporeis ad insinuandum duo: scilicet potentiae eius virtutem, et sublimitatem naturae. Primum quidem est contra illos qui dicunt, omnia ex fato caelestium corporum ex necessitate accidere: secundum quam opinionem inutile esset aliquid a Deo orando petere. Sed hoc stultum est, cum Deus in caelis sic esse dicatur ut caelorum dominus et stellarum, secundum illud Psal. CII, 19: <i>dominus in caelo paravit sedem suam</i> . Secundum vero contra illos est qui in orando aliquas sibi corporeas phantasias de Deo proponunt et fingunt: ideo dicitur esse in caelis, ut per id quod in sensibilibus rebus est altissimum, ostendatur divina sublimitas omnia excedens, etiam hominum desiderium et intellectum: unde quidquid cogitari, vel desiderari potest, est minus quam Deus. Propter quod dicitur in Iob XXXVI, 26: <i>ecce Deus magnus vincens scientiam nostram</i> ; Psal. CXII, 4: <i>excelsus super omnes gentes dominus</i> ; Isai. XL, 18: <i>cui similem fecistis Deum?</i> .
          <td>The power of Him to whom we pray is implied if we consider "heaven" as the corporeal heavens. God is not limited by any physical bounds: "Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the Lord."[45] Nevertheless, He is said to be in the corporeal heavens to indicate two things: the extent of His power and the greatness of His nature. The former of these attributes is contrary to the view that all things happen out of necessity, by a fate regulated by the celestial bodies; and thus all prayer would be vain and useless. But such is absurd, since God dwells in the heavens as their Lord: "The Lord has prepared His throne in heaven."[46] The latter attribute, viz., His sublime nature, is against those who in praying propose or build up any corporeal images of God. Therefore, God is stated to be "in heaven" in that He exceeds all corporeal things, and even the desires and intellects of men; so that whatsoever man thinks or desires is far less than God. Thus, it is said: "Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge."[47] And again: "The Lord is high above all nations."[48] And finally: "To whom then have you likened God? Or what image will you make for Him?"[49]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Familiaritas autem Dei ostenditur, si per caelos sancti accipiantur. Quia enim propter eius altitudinem aliqui dixerunt quod humana non curat, oportet considerare quia nobis est vicinus, immo intimus: quia dicitur esse in caelis, idest in sanctis, qui caeli dicuntur, secundum illud Psal. XVIII, 2: <i>caeli enarrant gloriam Dei</i> ; Ierem. XIV, 9: <i>tu in nobis es, domine</i> . Hoc enim affert fiduciam orantibus quantum ad duo. Primo quantum ad propinquitatem Dei, secundum illud Psal. CXLIV, 18: <i>prope est dominus omnibus invocantibus eum</i> . Unde Matth. VI, 6: <i>tu autem cum oraveris intra in cubiculum</i> , scilicet cordis. Secundo, quia per patrocinium aliorum sanctorum possumus impetrare quod petimus, secundum illud Iob V, 1: <i>ad aliquem sanctorum convertere</i> ; Iac. V, 16: <i>orate pro invicem, ut salvemini</i> .
          <td>Familiar intercourse with God is shown through this "in heaven." Some indeed have said that because of His great distance from us God does not care for men, and they cite these words: "He walketh about the poles of heaven, and He doth not consider our things."[50] Against this is the fact that God is nearer to us than we are to ourselves. This brings confidence to one who prays. First, because of the nearness of God: "The Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon Him."[51] Hence, it is written: "But thou when thou shalt pray, enter into thy chamber,"[52] that is, into thy heart. Second, because of the intercession of all the Saints among whom God dwells; for from this arises faith to ask through their merits for what we desire: "Turn to some of the Saints,"[53] and, "Pray one for another, that you may be saved."[54]

          <td>Idoneitatem etiam et congruitatem accipit oratio ex hoc quod dicitur esse in caelis, secundum quod per caelos spiritualia bona et aeterna intelliguntur, in quibus est beatitudo, propter duo. Primo, quia per hoc excitatur nostrum desiderium ad caelestia. Tendere enim debet illuc desiderium nostrum ubi patrem habemus, quia illic est hereditas nostra. Coloss. III, 1: <i>quae sursum sunt quaerite</i> . I Petr. I, 4: <i>in hereditatem immarcescibilem, conservatam in caelis</i> . Secundo, quia per hoc informamur ut sit vita caelestis, ut simus conformes patri caelesti, secundum illud I Cor. XV, 48: <i>qualis caelestis, tales et caelestes</i> . Et haec duo faciunt idoneum ad petendum, scilicet desiderium caeleste, et vita caelestis: ex quibus oratio congrua fit.
          <td>This part of the prayer—that is, "in heaven"—is appropriate and fitting also, if "in heaven" is taken to mean that spiritual and eternal good in which true happiness consists. Because of it our desires are lifted up towards heavenly things; since our desires ought to tend towards where we have our Father, because there is our true home: "Seek the things that are above."[55] And again: "Unto an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that cannot fade, reserved in heaven for you."[56] Moreover, from it we are told that, if our life is to be in heaven, then we ought to be conformed to our Heavenly Father: "Such as is the heavenly, such also are they that are heavenly."[57] From all this the words "in heaven" are most appropriate in prayer in that they signify both a heavenly desire and heavenly life.

          <td>This is the first petition, and in it we ask that God's name be manifested and declared in us. The name of God, first of all, is wonderful because it works wonders in all creatures. Thus said Our Lord: "In My name they shall cast out devils, they shall speak new tongues. They shall take up serpents; and if they shall drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them."[1]

Exemplum de beato Ignatio, qui intantum nomen Christi dilexit, quod cum Traianus requireret ab eo ut nomen Christi negaret, respondit quod de ore eius removeri non posset; et cum ille minaretur sibi caput abscindere, et Christum de eius ore removere, dixit: et si de ore abstuleris, nunquam tamen de corde eripere poteris: hoc enim nomen cordi meo inscriptum habeo, et ideo ab eius invocatione cessare non valeo. Quod audiens Traianus, et probari cupiens, servi Dei abscisso capite, cor eius extrahi iussit, et inventum est habens nomen Christi in se scriptum litteris aureis. Posuerat enim super cor suum hoc nomen quasi signaculum.
          <td>This name is lovable: "There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must be saved."[2] We all should desire to be saved. We have an example in Blessed Ignatius, who had such great love for the name of Christ that, when Trajan ordered him to deny it, he affirmed that it could not be dragged from his mouth. Then, the emperor threatened to have him beheaded, and thus take the name of Christ out of the mouth of the Saint. But Ignatius replied: "Even though you take it from my mouth, you will never snatch it from my heart. I have this name written in my heart and there I never cease to invoke it." Trajan heard this and wished to put it to the test. He had the servant of God beheaded and then commanded that his heart be taken out, and there upon the heart was found the name of Christ inscribed in letters of gold. This name had been engraved on the heart as a seal.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde istud nomen petimus manifestari, ut cognoscatur, et teneatur sanctum. Sanctum autem tripliciter dicitur. Sanctum enim idem est quod firmum: unde omnes beati qui in caelo sunt, sancti dicuntur, quia sunt aeterna felicitate firmati. In mundo non possunt esse sancti, quia sunt continue mobiles. Augustinus: <i>defluxi, domine, a te, et erravi nimis: devius factus sum a stabilitate tua</i> .
          <td>We pray that this name may be manifested in us, that it be known and revered as holy. Now "holy" (or hallowed) may have a threefold meaning. First, it is the same as firm. Thus, those who are firmly established in eternal happiness are all the blessed in heaven, the Saints. In this sense, none is a "Saint" on earth because here all is continually changeable. As St. Augustine says: "I sank away from Thee, O Lord, and I wandered too much astray from Thee who art my firm support."[7]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo sanctum idem est quod non terrenum: unde sancti qui in caelo sunt, nullum habent affectum terrenum: unde apostolus, Phil. III, 8: <i>omnia arbitratus sum ut stercora ut Christum lucrifaciam</i> . Per terram autem designantur peccatores. Primo ratione germinis: terra enim si non colitur, spinas et tribulos germinat; sic anima peccatoris, nisi colatur per gratiam, non germinat nisi tribulos et punctiones peccatorum. Gen. III, 18: <i>spinas et tribulos germinabit tibi</i> . Secundo ratione caliginis. Terra enim caliginosa est et opaca: sic etiam peccator caliginosus et opacus est. Gen. I, 2: <i>tenebrae erant super faciem abyssi</i> . Tertio ratione conditionis. Terra enim est elementum siccum, quod spargitur nisi contineatur ab aquae humiditate: nam Deus posuit terram super aquam, iuxta illud Psal. CXXXV, 6: <i>qui firmavit terram super aquas</i> , quia ex humiditate aquae continetur ariditas vel siccitas terrae. Sic peccator animam habet siccam et aridam, iuxta illud Psal. CXLII, 6: <i>anima mea sicut terra sine aqua tibi</i> .
          <td>Secondly, "holy" may be understood as "unearthly." The holy ones who are in heaven have naught earthly about them: "I count (all things)... but as dung, that I may gain Christ."[8] Earth may signify sinners. This would arise as reference to production. For if the earth is not cultivated, it will produce thorns and thistles. Similarly, if the soul of the sinner is not cultivated by grace, it will produce only thistles and thorns of sins: "Thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee."[9] Again, earth may signify sinners as regards its darkness. The earth is dark and opaque; and so also is the sinner dark and obstructive to light: "Darkness was on the face of the deep."[10] And, finally, earth is a dry element which will fall to pieces unless it is mixed with the moisture of water. So God placed earth just above water: "Who established the earth above the waters."[11] So also the soul of the sinner is dry and without moisture as it is said: "My soul is as earth without water unto Thee."[12]

          <td>"Holy" may, finally, be understood as "laved in blood," since the Saints in heaven are called Saints because they have been washed in blood: "These are they who are come out of great tribulation, and have washed their robes, and have made them white in the blood of the Lamb."[13] And again: "He hath washed us from our sins in His blood."[14]

Now, since God is our Father, we ought not only reverence and fear Him, but also have towards Him a sweet and pious affection.

          <td>It may be asked of us: "Why, since the kingdom of God always was, do we then ask that it may come?" This, however, can be understood in three ways. First, a king sometimes has only the right to a kingdom or dominion, and yet his rule has not been declared because the men in his kingdom are not as yet subject to him. His rule or dominion will come only when the men of his kingdom are his subjects. Now, God is by His very essence and nature the Lord of all things; and Christ being God and Man is the Lord over all things: "And He gave Him power and glory and a kingdom."[2] It is, therefore, necessary that all things be subject to Him. This is not yet the case, but will be so at the end of the world: "For He must reign, until He hath put all His enemies under His feet."[3] Hence it is for this we pray when we say: "Thy kingdom come."

          <td>Et hoc quantum ad tria: scilicet ut iusti convertantur, peccatores puniantur, et mors destruatur. Nam homines dupliciter subiiciuntur Christo: aut voluntarii, aut inviti. Cum enim voluntas Dei sit ita efficax quod oporteat penitus illam compleri, et Deus velit quod omnia subiiciantur Christo: alterum duorum erit necessarium: ut scilicet aut homo faciat voluntatem Dei subiiciendo se mandatis eius, et hoc facient iusti; aut Deus faciat de omnibus voluntatem suam puniendo eos, et hoc faciet peccatoribus et inimicis suis. Et hoc erit in fine mundi. Psal. CIX, 1: <i>donec ponam inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum</i> .
          <td>In so doing we pray for a threefold purpose: that the just may be strengthened, that sinners may be punished, and that death be destroyed. Now, the reason is that men are subject to Christ in two ways, either willingly or unwillingly. Again, the will of God is so efficacious that it must be fully complied with; and God does wish that all things be subject to Christ. Hence, two things are necessary: either man will do the will of God by subjecting himself to His commands, as do the just; or God shall exert His will and punish those who are sinners and His enemies; and this will take place at the end of the world: "Until I make Thy enemies Thy footstool."[4]

Amos V, 18: <i>vae desiderantibus diem domini</i> . Sed et ex hoc destruitur mors. Cum enim Christus sit vita, non potest in regno eius esse mors, quae est vitae contraria: ideo dicitur I Cor. XV, 26: <i>novissime autem inimica destruetur mors</i> . Et hoc erit in resurrectione. Phil. III, 21 <i>reformabit corpus humilitatis nostrae, configuratum corpori claritatis suae</i> .
          <td>It is enjoined upon the faithful to pray that the kingdom of God may come, namely, that they subject themselves completely to Him. But it is a terrible thing for sinners, because for them to ask the coming of God's kingdom is nothing else than to ask that they be subjected to punishment: "Woe to them that desire the day of the Lord!"[5] By this prayer, too, we ask that death be destroyed. Since Christ is life, death cannot exist in His kingdom,[6] because death is the opposite of life: "And the enemy, death, shall be destroyed last."[7] "He shall cast death down headlong forever."[8] And this shall take place at the last resurrection: "Who will reform the body of our lowness, made like to the body of His glory."[9]

          <td>Secundo regnum caelorum dicitur gloria Paradisi. Nec mirum: nam regnum nihil aliud dicitur nisi regimen. Ibi autem est optimum regimen ubi nihil invenitur contra voluntatem regentis. Voluntas autem Dei est salus hominum, quia vult homines salvos fieri; et hoc potissime erit in Paradiso, ubi nihil erit saluti hominum repugnans. Matth. XIII, 41: <i>auferentur de regno eius omnia scandala</i> . In mundo autem isto sunt multa contra salutem hominum. Cum ergo petimus: <i>adveniat regnum tuum</i> , oramus, ut simus participes regni caelestis et gloriae Paradisi.
          <td>In a second sense, the kingdom of heaven signifies the glory of paradise. Nor is this to be wondered at, for a kingdom ("regnum") is nothing other than a government ("regimen"). That will be the best government where nothing is found contrary to the will of the governor. Now, the will of God is the very salvation of men, for He "will have all men to be saved";[10] and this especially shall come to pass in paradise where there will be nothing contrary to man's salvation. "They shall gather out of His kingdom all scandals."[11] In this world, however, there are many things contrary to the salvation of men. Hence, when we pray, "Thy kingdom come," we pray that we might participate in the heavenly kingdom and in the glory of paradise.

          <td>Quod quidem regnum est valde desiderandum propter tria. Primum propter summam iustitiam quae est in eo. Isai. LX, 21: <i>populus tuus omnes iusti</i> . Hic enim mali sunt mixti bonis; sed ibi nullus malus erit, et nullus peccator. Item propter perfectissimam libertatem. Hic enim non est libertas, quanquam omnes naturaliter desiderent eam; sed ibi erit omnimoda libertas contra omnem servitutem. Rom. VIII, 21: <i>ipsa creatura liberabitur a corruptione</i> . Et non solum erunt ibi omnes liberi, sed erunt reges: Apoc. V, 10: <i>fecisti nos Deo nostro regnum</i> . Cuius ratio est, quia omnes erunt eiusdem voluntatis cum Deo, et Deus volet quidquid sancti volent, et sancti quidquid Deus voluerit: unde cum voluntate Dei fiet voluntas eorum. Et ideo omnes regnabunt, quia omnium voluntas fiet, et dominus erit corona omnium. Isai. XXVIII, 5: <i>in die illa erit dominus exercituum corona gloriae, et sertum exultationis residuo populi sui</i> . Item propter mirabilem affluentiam. Isai. LXIV, 4: <i>oculus non vidit, Deus, absque te, quae praeparasti expectantibus te</i> . Psal. CII, 5: <i>qui replet in bonis desiderium tuum</i> .
          <td>This kingdom is greatly to be desired for three reasons. (1) It is to be greatly desired because of the perfect justice that obtains there: "Thy people shall be all just."[12] In this world the bad are mingled with the good, but in heaven there will be no wicked and no sinners. (2) The heavenly kingdom is to be desired because of its perfect liberty. Here below there is no liberty, although all men naturally desire it; but above there will be perfect liberty without any form of oppression: "Because the creature also shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption."[13] Not only will men then be free, but indeed they will all be kings: "And Thou hast made us to our God a kingdom."[14] This is because all shall be of one will with God, and God shall will what the Saints will, and the Saints shall will whatsoever God wills; hence, in the will of God shall their will be done All, therefore, shall reign, because the will of all shall be done, and the Lord shall be their crown: "In that day, the Lord of hosts shall be a crown of glory and a garland of joy to the residue of His people."[15] (3) The kingdom of God is to be desired because of the marvellous riches of heaven: "The eye hath not seen O God, besides Thee, what things Thou hast prepared for them that wait for Thee."[16] And also: "Who satisfieth thy desire with good things."[17]

          <td>Et nota quod homo inveniet omnia in solo Deo excellentius et perfectius omni eo quod in mundo quaeritur. Si delectationem quaeris, summam invenies in Deo; si divitias, ibi omnem sufficientiam invenies, propter quam sunt divitiae; et sic de aliis. Augustinus, in Confess.: <i>anima cum fornicatur abs te, quaerit extra te, quae pura et limpida non invenit, nisi cum redit ad te</i> .
          <td>Note that man will find everything that he seeks for in this world more excellently and more perfectly in God alone. Thus, if it is pleasure you seek, then in God you will find the highest pleasure: "You shall see and your heart shall rejoice."[18] "And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads."[19] If it is riches, there you will find it in abundance: "When the soul strays from Thee, she looks for things apart from Thee, but she finds all things impure and useless until she returns to Thee," says St. Augustine.[20]

          <td>Tertio modo, quia aliquando in mundo isto regnat peccatum. Et hoc est quando homo est ita dispositus quod statim sequitur et prosequitur appetitum peccati. Apostolus, Rom. VI, 12: <i>non ergo regnet peccatum in vestro mortali corpore</i> : sed debet Deus regnare in corde tuo. Isai. VII, 7: <i>Sion, regnabit Deus tuus</i> . Et hoc est quando paratus est obedire Deo, et servare omnia mandata sua. Cum ergo petimus quod veniat regnum, oramus quod non regnet in nobis peccatum, sed Deus.
          <td>Lastly, "Thy kingdom come" is understood in another sense because sometimes sin reigns in this world. This occurs when man is so disposed that he follows at once the enticement of sin. "Let not sin reign in your mortal body,"[21] but let God reign in your heart; and this will be when thou art prepared to obey God and keep all His Commandments. Therefore, when we pray to God that His kingdom may come, we pray that God and not sin may reign in us.

Nam si vindicares te, non quaereres quod adveniret regnum eius. Secundum vero secundam expositionem, si tu expectas regnum eius, idest gloriam Paradisi, non debes curare si perdis res mundanas. Item secundum tertiam expositionem, si tu petis quod Deus regnet in te et Christus; cum ipse fuerit mitissimus, et tu debes esse mitis. Matth. XI, 29: <i>discite a me, quia mitis sum</i> . Hebr.

If you avenge yourself, you do not really desire that the kingdom of God may come. According to our second explanation (i.e., regarding the glory of paradise), if you await the coming of this kingdom which is the glory of paradise, you need not worry about losing earthly things. Likewise, if according to the third explanation, you pray that God may reign within you, then you must be humble, for He is Himself most humble: "Learn of Me because I am meek and humble of heart."[23]

          <td>Tertium donum quod efficit in nobis spiritus sanctus, dicitur donum scientiae. Ipse enim spiritus sanctus non solum efficit in bonis donum timoris et donum pietatis, quae est dulcis affectus ad Deum, ut dictum est, sed etiam facit hominem sapientem. Et hoc petebat David in Psal. CXVIII, 66, dicens: <i>bonitatem et disciplinam et scientiam doce me</i> . Et haec est scientia qua homo bene vivit, quam docuit nos spiritus sanctus. Inter alia autem quae faciunt ad scientiam et sapientiam hominis potissima sapientia est, quod homo non innitatur sensui suo. Prov. III, 5: <i>ne innitaris prudentiae tuae</i> . Nam illi qui praesumunt de sensu suo, ita quod non credunt aliis, sed sibi tantum, semper inveniuntur et iudicantur stulti. Prov. XXVI, 12: <i>vidisti hominem sapientem sibi videri? Magis illo spem habebit insipiens</i> .
          <td>The third gift which the Holy Spirit works in us is called the gift of knowledge. The Holy Spirit not only gives us the gift of fear and the gift of piety (which is a sweet affection for God, as we have said); but He also makes man wise. It was this for which David prayed: "Teach me goodness and discipline and knowledge."[1] This knowledge which the Holy Spirit teaches us is that whereby man lives justly. Among all that goes to make up knowledge and wisdom in man, the principal wisdom is that man should not depend solely upon his own opinion: "Lean not upon thy own prudence."[2] Those who put all their trust in their own judgment so that they do not trust others, but only themselves, are always found to be stupid and are so adjudged by others: "Hast thou seen a man wise in his own conceit? There shall be more hope of a fool than of him."[3]

          <td>Quod autem homo non credat sensui suo, procedit ex humilitate: unde et locus humilitatis est sapientia, ut dicitur Prov. XI. Superbi autem sibi ipsis nimis credunt. Docet ergo hoc spiritus sanctus per donum scientiae, ut scilicet non faciamus voluntatem nostram, sed voluntatem Dei. Et ideo propter hoc donum petimus a Deo ut fiat voluntas sua sicut in caelo et in terra. Et in hoc apparet donum scientiae. Unde hoc modo dicitur Deo, <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> , sicut si esset unus infirmus, et vellet aliquid a medico, non praecise vult, sed de voluntate medici; alias si tantum de voluntate sua vellet, esset stultus. Sic nos a Deo nihil petere debemus nisi quod fiat de nobis voluntas sua, idest ut voluntas sua compleatur in nobis. Tunc enim est rectum cor hominis quando concordat cum voluntate divina. Hoc Christus fecit: Ioan. VI, 38: <i>descendi de caelo, non ut faciam voluntatem meam, sed eius qui misit me</i> . Christus enim, secundum quod Deus, eandem voluntatem habet cum patre; sed, secundum quod homo, habet aliam voluntatem a patre: et secundum hanc dicit se non facere voluntatem suam sed patris. Et ideo docet nos orare et petere: <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> .
          <td>Out of humility one does not trust one's own knowledge: "Where humility is there is also wisdom."[4] The proud trust only themselves. Now, the Holy Spirit, through the gift of wisdom, teaches us that we do not our own will but the will of God. It is through this gift that we pray of God that His "will be done on earth as it is in heaven." And in this is seen the gift of knowledge. Thus, one says to God "let Thy will be done," in the same way as one who is sick desires something from the physician; and his will is not precisely his own, because it is the will of the physician. Otherwise, if his desire were purely from his own will, he would be indeed foolish. So we ought not to pray other than that in us God's will may be done; that is, that His will be accomplished in us. The heart of man is only right when it is in accord with the will of God. This did Christ: "Because I came down from heaven, not to do My own will but the will of Him that sent Me."[5] Christ, as God, has the same will with the Father; but as a Man He has a distinct will from the Father's, and it was according to this that He says He does not do His will but the Father's. Hence, He teaches us to pray and to ask: "Thy will be done."[6]

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed quid est quod dicitur? Nonne in Psal. CXIII, 3; dicitur: <i>omnia quaecumque voluit fecit?</i> Si omnia facit quae vult in caelo et in terra, quid est hoc quod dicit: <i>fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo, et in terra?</i> Ad hoc sciendum est, quod Deus tria vult de nobis, et nos petimus quod haec impleantur. Primum quidem quod Deus vult de nobis, est quod nos habeamus vitam aeternam. Quicumque enim facit aliquid propter aliquem finem, vult de illa re illud pro quo facit eam. Deus autem fecit hominem, sed non pro nihilo: quia, sicut dicitur in Psal. LXXXVIII, 48: <i>numquid vane constituisti omnes filios hominum</i> .
          <td>But what is this that is asked? Does not the Psalm say: "Whatsoever the Lord pleased [has willed], He hath done?"[7] Now, if He has done all that He has willed both in heaven and on earth, what then is the meaning of this: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven"? To understand this we must know that God wills of us three things, and we pray that these be accomplished. The first thing that God wills is that we may have eternal life. Whoever makes something for a certain purpose, has a will regarding it which is in accord with the purpose for which he made it. In like manner, God made man, but it was not for no purpose, as it is written: "Remember what my substance is; for hast Thou made all the children of men in vain?"[8]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Fecit ergo homines propter aliquid, sed non propter voluptates, quia et bruta habent eas, sed ut habeant vitam aeternam. Vult ergo dominus ut homo habeat vitam aeternam. Quando vero aliquid consequitur illud ad quod factum est, dicitur quod salvatur; quando vero non consequitur, dicitur quod res illa perditur. Deus autem fecit hominem propter vitam aeternam. Cum ergo consequitur vitam aeternam, salvatur; et hoc vult dominus: Ioan. VI, 40: <i>haec est autem voluntas patris mei qui misit me, ut omnis qui videt filium et credit in eum, habeat vitam aeternam</i> . Haec autem voluntas iam completa est in Angelis et in sanctis qui sunt in patria, quia vident Deum et cognoscunt, et fruuntur eo; sed nos desideramus quod sicut voluntas Dei completa est in beatis qui sunt in caelis, ita compleatur in nobis qui sumus in terra: et hoc petimus cum oramus: <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> in nobis qui sumus in terra, sicut in sanctis qui sunt in caelo.
          <td>Hence, God made men for a purpose; but this purpose was not for their mere pleasures, for also the brutes have these, but it was that they might have eternal life. The Lord, therefore, wills that men have eternal life. Now, when that for which a thing is made is accomplished, it is said to be saved; and when this is not accomplished, it is said to be lost. So when man gains eternal life, he is said to be saved, and it is this that the Lord wills: "Now, this is the will of My Father that sent Me, that every one who seeth the Son and believeth in Him may have life everlasting."[9] This will of God is already fulfilled for the Angels and for the Saints in the Fatherland, for they see God and know and enjoy Him. We, however, desire that, as the will of God is done for the blessed who are in heaven, it likewise be done for us who are on earth. For this we pray when we say "Thy will be done" for us who are on earth, as it is for the Saints who are in heaven.

          <td>Alia voluntas Dei de nobis est ut servemus mandata eius. Quando enim aliquis desiderat aliquid, non solum vult illud quod desiderat, sed omnia per quae venitur ad illud; sicut medicus ut consequatur sanitatem, vult etiam dietam et medicinam et huiusmodi. Deus autem vult ut habeamus vitam aeternam. Matth. XIX, 17: <i>si vis ad vitam ingredi, serva mandata</i> . Vult ergo ut servemus mandata. Rom. XII, 1: <i>rationabile obsequium vestrum</i> , ib. 2: <i>ut probetis quae sit voluntas Dei bona, beneplacens et perfecta</i> . Bona, quia utilis: Isai. XLVIII, 17: <i>ego dominus docens te utilia</i> . Beneplacens amanti; et si aliis non sit grata, amanti tamen est delectabilis. Psal. XCVI, 11: <i>lux orta est iusto, et rectis corde laetitia</i> . Perfecta, quia honesta: Matth. V, 48: <i>estote perfecti, sicut et pater vester caelestis perfectus est</i> . Sic ergo cum dicimus, <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> , oramus ut impleamus mandata Dei. Haec autem voluntas Dei fit in iustis, sed in peccatoribus nondum fit. Iusti autem designantur per caelum, peccatores autem per terram. Petimus ergo ut fiat voluntas Dei ita <i>in terra</i> , idest in peccatoribus, <i>sicut in caelo</i> , idest in iustis.
          <td>In the second place, the will of God for us is that we keep His Commandments. When a person desires something, he not only wills that which he desires, but also everything which will bring that about. Thus, in order to bring about a healthy condition which he desires, a physician also wills to put into effect diet, medicine, and other needs. We arrive at eternal life through observance of the Commandments, and, accordingly, God wills that we observe them: "But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the Commandments."[10] "Your reasonable service... that you may prove what is the good and the acceptable and the perfect will of God."[11] That is, good because it is profitable: "I am the Lord thy God that teach thee profitable things."[12] And acceptable, that is, pleasing: "Light is risen to the just; and joy to the right heart."[13] And perfect, because noble: "Be you therefore perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect."[14] When we say "Thy will be done," we pray that we may fulfill the Commandments of God. This will of God is done by the just, but it is not yet done by sinners. "In heaven" here signifies the just; while "on earth" refers to sinners. We, therefore, pray that the will of God may be done "on earth," that is, by sinners, "as it is in heaven," that is, by the just.[15]

          <td>Notandum autem, quod ex modo loquendi datur nobis doctrina. Non enim dicit, fac, nec etiam faciamus; sed dicit, <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> : quia ad vitam aeternam duo sunt necessaria, scilicet gratia Dei et voluntas hominis; et licet Deus fecerit hominem sine homine, non tamen iustificat eum sine eo. Augustinus, super Ioan.: <i>qui creavit te sine te, non iustificabit te sine te</i> , quia vult quod homo cooperetur. Zach. I, 3: <i>convertimini ad me, et ego convertar ad vos</i> . Apostolus, I Cor. XV, 10: <i>gratia Dei sum id quod sum, et gratia eius in me vacua non fuit</i> . Non ergo praesumas de te, sed confidas de gratia Dei: nec negligas, sed adhibeas studium tuum: et ideo non dicit, faciamus, ne videretur quod nihil faceret gratia Dei; nec dicit, fac, ne videatur quod nihil faceret voluntas et conatus noster; sed dicit, <i>fiat</i> per gratiam Dei, adhibito studio et conatu nostro.
          <td>It must be noted that the very words used in this petition teach us a lesson. It does not say "Do" or "Let us do," but it says, "[Let] Thy will be done," because two things are necessary for eternal life: the grace of God and the will of man. Although God has made man without man, He cannot save man without his cooperation. Thus, says St. Augustine: "Who created thee without thyself, cannot save thee without thyself,"[16] because God wills that man cooperate with Him or at least put no obstacle in His way: "Turn ye to Me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will turn to you."[17] "By the grace of God, I am what I am. And His grace in me hath not been void."[18] Do not, therefore, presume on your own strength, but trust in God's grace; and be not negligent, but use the zeal you have. It does not say, therefore, "Let us do," lest it would seem that the grace of God were left out; nor does it say, "Do," lest it would appear that our will and our zeal do not matter. He does say "Let it be done" through the grace of God at the same time using our desire and our own efforts.

          <td>Tertium quod vult Deus de nobis, est, ut restituatur homo ad statum et dignitatem in qua creatus fuit primus homo; quae tanta fuit ut spiritus et anima nullam repugnantiam sentiret a carne et sensualitate. Quandiu enim anima subiecta fuit Deo, caro ita subiecta fuit spiritui ut nullam corruptionem mortis seu infirmitatis et aliarum passionum sentiret; sed ex quo spiritus et anima, quae erat media inter Deum et carnem, rebellavit Deo per peccatum, tunc corpus rebellavit animae, et tunc mortem et infirmitates sentire coepit, et continuam rebellionem sensualitatis ad spiritum. Rom. VII, 23: <i>video aliam legem in membris meis, repugnantem legi mentis meae</i> ; et Gal. V, 17: <i>caro concupiscit adversus spiritum, spiritus autem adversus carnem</i> .
          <td>Thirdly, the will of God in our regard is that men be restored to that state and dignity in which the first man was created. This was a condition in which the spirit and soul felt no resistance from sensuality and the flesh. As long as the soul was subject to God, the flesh was in such subjection to the spirit that no corruption of death, or weakness, or any of the passions were felt. When, however, the spirit and the soul, which were between God and the flesh, rebelled against God by sin, then the body rebelled against the soul. From that time death and weaknesses began to be felt together with continual rebellion of sensuality against the spirit: "I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind."[19] "The flesh lusteth against the spirit, and the spirit against the flesh."[20]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sic est continua pugna inter carnem et spiritum, et homo continue deterioratur per peccatum. Est ergo voluntas Dei ut homo restituatur ad statum primum, ut scilicet nihil sit in carne contrarium spiritui: I Thess. IV, 3: <i>haec est voluntas Dei, sanctificatio vestra</i> . Haec autem voluntas Dei non potest impleri in vita ista, sed complebitur in resurrectione sanctorum, quando resurgent corpora glorificata, et erunt incorruptibilia et nobilissima: I Cor. XV, 43: <i>seminatur in ignobilitate, surget in gloria</i> . Est tamen voluntas Dei in iustis quantum ad spiritum per iustitiam et scientiam et vitam. Et ideo cum dicimus, <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> , oramus ut etiam fiat in carne. Nam hoc modo per caelum accipimus spiritum, per terram carnem; ut sit sensus: <i>fiat voluntas tua</i> ita <i>in terra</i> , idest in carne nostra, <i>sicut</i> fit <i>in caelo</i> , idest in spiritu nostro per iustitiam.
          <td>Thus, there is an endless strife between the flesh and the spirit, and man is continually being brought lower by sin. The will of God, therefore, is that man be restored to his primal state so that no more would the flesh rebel against the spirit: "For this is the will of God, your sanctification."[21] Now, this will of God cannot be fulfilled in this life, but it will be fulfilled in the resurrection of the just, when glorified bodies shall arise incorrupt and most perfect: "It is sown a natural body; it shall rise a spiritual body."[22] In the just the will of God is fulfilled relative to the spirit, which abides in justice and knowledge and perfect life. Therefore, when we say "Thy will be done," let us pray that His will also may be done regarding the flesh. Thus, the sense of "Thy will be done on earth" is that it may be done "for our flesh," and "as it is in heaven" means in our spirit. Thus, we take "in heaven" for our spirit, and "on earth" as our flesh.[23]

Item secundum tertiam expositionem, ex pugna quae continue est inter carnem et spiritum, provenit luctus. Non enim potest fieri quin anima saucietur ad minus per venialia a carne: et ideo ut expietur, est in luctu: Psal. VI, 7: <i>lavabo per singulas noctes</i> , idest obscuritates peccati, <i>lectum meum</i> , idest conscientiam meam. Et qui sic plorant, perveniunt ad patriam, ad quam nos perducat Deus.
          <td>By means of this petition we arrive at the happiness of those who mourn, as it is written: "Blessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted."[24] This can be applied to each of the threefold explanations we have given above. According to the first we desire eternal life. And in this very desire we are brought to a mourning of soul: "Woe is me, that my sojourning is prolonged."[25] This desire in the Saints is so vehement that because of it they wish for death, which in itself is something naturally to be avoided: "But we are confident and have a good will to be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord."[26] Likewise, according to our second explanation—viz., that we will to keep the Commandments —they who do so are in sorrow. For although such be sweet for the soul, it is bitter indeed for the flesh which is continually kept in discipline. "Going, they went and wept," which refers to the flesh, "But coming, they shall come with joyfulness," which pertains to the soul.[27] Again, from our third explanation (that is, concerning the struggle which is ever going on between the flesh and the spirit), we see that this too causes sorrow. For it cannot but happen that the soul be wounded by the venial faults of the flesh; and so in expiating for these the soul is in mourning. "Every night," that is, the darkness of sin, "I will wash my bed [that is, my conscience] with my tears."[28] Those who thus sorrow will arrive at the Fatherland, where may God bring us also!

          <td>Multoties accidit quod aliquis ex magna scientia et sapientia efficitur timidus; et ideo est ei necessaria fortitudo cordis, ne deficiat in necessitatibus. Isai. XL, 29: <i>qui dat lasso virtutem, et his qui non sunt, fortitudinem et robur multiplicat</i> . Hanc autem fortitudinem spiritus sanctus dat: Ezech. II, 2: <i>ingressus est in me spiritus (...) et statuit me super pedes meos</i> . Est autem haec fortitudo quam spiritus sanctus dat, ut cor hominis non deficiat timore rerum necessariarum, sed credat firmiter quod omnia quae sunt ei necessaria, ministrentur sibi a Deo. Et ideo spiritus sanctus, qui hanc fortitudinem dat, docet nos petere a Deo: <i>panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie</i> . Unde spiritus fortitudinis dicitur.
          <td>Sometimes it happens that one of great learning and wisdom becomes fearful and timid; and, therefore, it is necessary that he have fortitude of heart lest he lack necessities: "It is He that giveth strength to the weary, and increaseth force and might to them that are not."[1] The Holy Spirit gives this fortitude: "And the Spirit entered into me,... and He set me upon my feet."[2] This fortitude which is given by the Holy Ghost so strengthens the heart of man that he does not fear for the things that are necessary for him, but he trusts that God will provide for all his needs. The Holy Spirit who gives us this strength teaches us to pray to God: "Give us this day our daily bread." And thus He is called the Spirit of fortitude.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sciendum est autem, quod in tribus praecedentibus petitionibus petuntur spiritualia, quae hic inchoantur in hoc mundo, sed non perficiuntur nisi in vita aeterna. Cum enim petimus quod sanctificetur nomen Dei, petimus quod cognoscatur sanctitas Dei; cum vero petimus quod adveniat regnum Dei, petimus quod simus participes vitae aeternae; cum autem oramus quod fiat voluntas Dei, petimus quod compleatur voluntas eius in nobis; quae omnia etsi inchoentur in hoc mundo, non tamen possunt haberi perfecte nisi in vita aeterna. Et ideo necessarium fuit aliqua petere necessaria quae perfecte possent haberi in vita praesenti. Et inde est quod spiritus sanctus docuit petere necessaria in vita praesenti, quae perfecte hic habentur: simul etiam ut ostendat quod etiam temporalia providentur nobis a Deo. Et hoc est quod dicit: <i>panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie</i> .
          <td>It must be noted that in the first three petitions of this prayer only things spiritual are asked for—those which indeed begin to be in this world but are only brought to fruition in the life eternal. Thus, when we pray that the name of God be hallowed, we really ask that the name of God be known; when we pray that the kingdom of God may come, we ask that we may participate in God's kingdom; and when we pray that the will of God be done, we ask that His will be accomplished in us. All these things, however, although they have their beginning here on earth, cannot be had in their fullness except in heaven. Hence, it is necessary to pray for certain necessaries which can be completely had in this life. The Holy Spirit, then, taught us to ask for the requirements of this present life which are here obtainable in their fullness, and at the same time He shows that our temporal wants are provided us by God. It is this that is meant when we say: "Give us this day our daily bread."[3]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>In quibus quidem verbis docuit nos vitare quinque peccata quae consueverunt contingere ex desiderio rerum temporalium. Primum peccatum est quod homo per immoderatum appetitum petit ea quae statum et conditionem eius excedunt, non contentus his quae decent eum: sicut si desiderat vestes, non vult eas ut miles, si est miles, sed sicut comes; non ut clericus, si est clericus, sed sicut episcopus. Et hoc vitium retrahit homines a spiritualibus, inquantum nimis inhaeret eorum desiderium temporalibus. Hoc autem vitium docuit nos vitare dominus, docens nos petere panem tantum, idest necessaria ad praesentem vitam secundum conditionem uniuscuiusque; quae omnia sub nomine panis intelliguntur. Unde non docuit delicata petere, non diversa, non exquisita, sed panem, sine quo vita hominis duci non potest, quia omnibus communis est. Eccli. XXIX, 28: <i>initium vitae hominis panis et aqua</i> . Apostolus, I Tim. VI, 8: <i>habentes alimenta et quibus tegamur, his contenti simus</i> .
          <td>In these very words the Holy Spirit teaches us to avoid five sins which are usually committed out of the desire for temporal things. The first sin is that man, because of an inordinate desire, seeks those things which go beyond his state and condition of life. He is not satisfied with what befits him. Thus, if he be a soldier and desires clothes, he will not have them suitable for a soldier, but rather for a knight; or if he be a cleric, clothes fit for a bishop. This vicious habit withdraws man from spiritual things, in that it makes his desires cleave to transitory things. The Lord taught us to avoid this vice by instructing us to ask for the temporal necessities of this present life as they are in accord with the position of each one of us. All this is understood under the name of "bread." And so He does not teach us to pray for that which is luxurious, nor for variety, nor for what is over-refined, but for bread which is common to all and without which man's life could not be sustained: "The chief thing for man's life is water and bread."[4] And: "Having food and wherewith to be covered, with these we are content."[5]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum vitium est quod aliqui in acquisitione rerum temporalium alios molestant et defraudant. Hoc vitium est adeo periculosum quod est difficile bona ablata restitui. Non enim dimittitur peccatum, nisi restituatur ablatum, secundum Augustinum. Quod quidem vitium docuit nos vitare, docens nos petere panem nostrum, non alienum. Raptores enim non comedunt panem suum, sed alienum.
          <td>The second sin is that some in acquiring temporal goods burden others and defraud them. This vicious practice is dangerous, because goods thus taken away can be restored only with difficulty. For, as St. Augustine says: "The sin is not forgiven until that which is taken away is restored."[6] "They eat the bread of wickedness."[7] The Lord teaches us to avoid this sin, and to pray for our own bread, not that of another. Robbers do not eat their own bread, but the bread of their neighbor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium est superflua sollicitudo. Aliqui enim sunt qui nunquam sunt contenti de eo quod habent, sed semper plus volunt; quod quidem immoderatum est, quia desiderium debet moderari secundum necessitatem. Prov. XXX, 8: <i>divitias et paupertatem ne dederis mihi; sed tantum victui meo tribue necessaria</i> . Et hoc monuit nos vitare, dicens: <i>panem nostrum quotidianum</i> , idest unius diei, vel unius temporis.
          <td>The third sin is unnecessary solicitude. There are some who are never content with what they have, but always want more. This is wholly immoderate, because one's desire must always be measured by his need: "Give me neither beggary nor riches, but give me only the necessaries of life."[8] We are taught to avoid this sin in the words, "our daily bread," that is, bread of one day or for one time.[9]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartum vitium est immoderata voracitas. Sunt enim aliqui qui tantum volunt consumere uno die quod sufficeret pluribus diebus; et isti petunt non panem quotidianum, sed decem dierum; et ex hoc quod nimis expendunt, contingit quod omnia consumunt. Prov. XXIII, 21: <i>vacantes potibus, et dantes symbola, consumentur</i> . Eccli. XIX, 1: <i>operarius ebriosus non locupletabitur</i> .
          <td>The fourth sin is inordinate voracity. There are those who in one day would consume what would be enough for many days. Such pray not for bread for one day, but for ten days. And because they spend too much, it happens what they spend all their substance. "They that give themselves to drinking and that club together shall be consumed."[10] And: "A workman that is a drunkard shall not be rich."[11]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quintum vitium est ingratitudo. Nam cum aliquis ex divitiis superbit, et non recognoscit a Deo ea quae habet, hoc est valde malum: quia omnia quae habemus, sive spiritualia, sive temporalia, a Deo sunt. I Paral. XXIX, 14: <i>omnia tua sunt, de manu tua accepimus</i> . Ideo ad removendum hoc vitium, dicit: <i>da nobis</i> , et <i>panem nostrum</i> , ut sciamus quod omnia nostra a Deo sunt.
          <td>The fifth sin is ingratitude. A person grows proud in his riches, and does not realize that what he has comes from God. This is a grave fault, for all things that we have, be they spiritual or temporal, are from God: "All things are Thine; and we have given Thee what we received of Thy hand."[12] Therefore, to take away this vice, the prayer has, "Give us" even "our daily bread," that we may know that all things come from God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed de hoc habemus unum documentum: quia aliquando aliquis habet multas divitias, et ex eis nullam utilitatem consequitur, sed damnum spirituale et temporale. Nam aliqui propter divitias perierunt. Eccl. VI, 1: <i>est et aliud malum quod vidi sub sole, et quidem frequens apud homines. Vir cui dedit Deus divitias et substantiam et honorem, et nihil deest animae suae ex omnibus quae desiderat: nec tribuit ei potestatem Deus ut comedat ex eo, sed homo extraneus vorabit illud</i> . Item ibid. V, 12: <i>divitiae congregatae in malum domini sui</i> . Debemus ergo petere ut divitiae nostrae sint nobis ad utilitatem. Et hoc petimus cum dicimus: <i>panem nostrum da nobis</i> ; idest, fac divitias nobis utiles. Iob XX, 14-15: <i>panis eius in utero illius vertetur in fel aspidum intrinsecus. Divitias quas devoravit, evomet; et de ventre illius extrahet eas Deus</i> .
          <td>From all this we draw one great lesson. Sometimes one who has great riches makes no use of them, but suffers spiritual and temporal harm; for some because of riches have perished. "There is also another evil which I have seen under the sun, and that frequent among men. A man to whom God hath given riches and substance and honor, and his soul wanteth nothing of all that he desireth; yet God doth not give him power to eat thereof, but a stranger shall eat it up."[13] And again: "Riches kept to the hurt of the owner."[14] We ought, therefore, pray that our riches will be of use to us; and it is this we seek for when we say, "Give us our bread," that is, make our riches be of use to us. "His bread in his belly shall be turned into the gall of asps within him. The riches which he hath swallowed, he shall vomit up; and God shall draw them out of his belly."[15]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Aliud vitium est in rebus mundi, scilicet superflua sollicitudo. Nam aliqui sunt qui hodie solicitantur de rebus temporalibus quae erunt usque ad unum annum: et qui hoc habent, nunquam quiescunt. Matth. VI, 31: <i>nolite soliciti esse, dicentes: quid manducabimus, aut quid bibemus, aut quo operiemur?</i> Et ideo dominus docet nos petere quod hodie detur nobis panis noster, idest ea quae sunt nobis necessaria ad praesens tempus.
          <td>Another great vice is concerned with the things of this world, viz., excessive solicitude for them. For there are some who daily are anxious about temporal goods which are enough for them for an entire year; and they who are thus troubled will never have rest: "Be not solicitous therefore, saying: "What shall we eat, or What shall we drink, or Wherewith shall we be clothed?"[16] The Lord, therefore, teaches us to pray that to-day our bread will be given us, that is, those things which will be needful for us for the present time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Invenitur quidem alius duplex panis: scilicet sacramentalis, et panis verbi Dei. Petimus ergo panem nostrum sacramentalem, qui quotidie in Ecclesia conficitur; ut sicut illud accipimus in sacramento, ita detur nobis ad salutem. Ioan. VI, 51: <i>ego sum panis vivus, qui de caelo descendi</i> . I Cor. XI, 29: <i>qui manducat et bibit indigne, iudicium sibi manducat et bibit</i> .
          <td>One may also see in this bread another twofold meaning, viz., Sacramental Bread and the Bread of the Word of God. Thus, in the first meaning, we pray for our Sacramental Bread which is consecrated daily in the Church, so that we receive it in the Sacrament, and thus it profits us unto salvation: "I am the living bread which came down from heaven."[17] And: "He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself."[18]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Item alius panis est verbum Dei. Matth. IV, 4: <i>non in solo pane vivit homo, sed in omni verbo quod procedit de ore Dei</i> . Petimus ergo ut det nobis panem, idest verbum suum. Ex hoc autem provenit homini beatitudo quae est fames iustitiae. Nam postquam spiritualia habentur, magis desiderantur; et ex hoc desiderio provenit fames, et ex fame satietas vitae aeternae.
          <td>In the second meaning this bread is the Word of God: "Not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God."[19] We pray, therefore, that He give us bread, that is, His Word.[20] From this man derives that happiness which is a hunger for justice. For after spiritual things are considered, they are all the more desired; and this desire arouses a hunger, and from this hunger follows the fullness of life everlasting.

Tunc autem consilium est homini necessarium quando est in tribulatione, sicut consilium medicorum cum aliquis infirmatur. Unde et homo cum spiritualiter infirmetur per peccatum, debet quaerere consilium, ut sanetur. Consilium autem peccatori necessarium ostenditur Dan.

          <td>There are some men of great wisdom and fortitude who, because they trust too much in their own strength, do not wisely carry out what they attempt, and they do not bring to completion that which they have in mind. "Designs are strengthened by counsels."[1] It must be known that the Holy Ghost who gives fortitude also gives counsel. Every good counsel concerning the salvation of man is from the Holy Ghost. Thus, counsel is necessary for man when he is in difficulty, just as is the counsel of physicians when one is ill. When man falls into spiritual illness through sin, he must look for counsel in order to be healed. This necessity for counsel on the part of the sinner is shown in these words: "Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable to thee, and redeem thou thy sins with alms."[2] The best counsel, therefore, against sin is alms and mercy. Hence, the Holy Spirit teaches sinners to seek and to pray: "Forgive us our trespasses."[3]

There have been some, indeed, so presumptuous as to say that man could live in this world and by his own unaided strength avoid sin. But this condition has been given to no one except Christ, who had the Spirit beyond all measure, and to the Blessed Virgin, who was full of grace and in whom there was no sin. "And concerning whom," that is, the Virgin, "when it is a question of sin I wish to make no mention," says St. Augustine.[5] But for all the other Saints, it was never granted them that they should not incur at least venial sin: "If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us."[6] And, moreover, this very petition proves this; for it is evident that all Saints and all men say the "Our Father" in which is contained "Forgive us our trespasses." Hence, all admit and confess that they are sinners or trespassers. If, therefore, you are a sinner, you ought to fear and humble yourself.

          <td>Aliud est quod semper vivamus in spe: quia licet simus peccatores, non debemus desperare, ne desperatio ducat nos ad maiora et diversa peccata, sicut dicit apostolus, Ephes. IV, 19: <i>qui desperantes, semetipsos tradiderunt impudicitiae, in operationem immunditiae omnis</i> . Ergo multum est utile quod semper speremus: quia quantumcumque homo sit peccator, debet sperare quod Deus, si perfecte conteratur et convertatur, dimittet ei. Haec autem spes firmatur in nobis cum petimus: <i>dimitte nobis debita nostra</i> .
          <td>Another reason for this petition is that we should ever live in hope. Although we be sinners, nevertheless we must not give up hope, lest our despair drive us into greater and different kinds of sins. As the Apostle says: "Who despairing, have given themselves up to lasciviousness, unto the working of all uncleanness."[7] It is, therefore, of great help that we be ever hopeful; for in the measure that man is a sinner, he ought to hope that God will forgive him if he be perfectly sorry for sin and be converted. This hope is strengthened in us when we say: "Forgive us our trespasses."

          <td>Sed hanc spem abstulerunt Novatiani, qui dixerunt, quod qui semel peccabant post Baptismum, nunquam consequebantur misericordiam. Hoc autem non est verum, si verum dixit Christus dicendo, Matth. XVIII, 32: <i>omne debitum dimisi tibi, quoniam rogasti me</i> . In quacumque ergo die petes, poteris consequi misericordiam, si roges cum poenitudine peccati. Si igitur ex hac petitione consurgit timor et spes: quia omnes peccatores contriti et confitentes, misericordiam consequuntur. Et ideo necessaria fuit haec petitio.
          <td>The Novatiani destroyed this hope, saying that one who has sinned but once after Baptism can never look for mercy. But this is not true, if Christ spoke truly when He said: "I forgave thee all the debt, because thou besoughtest Me."[8] In whatsoever day, therefore, you ask, you can receive mercy if with sorrow for sin you make your prayer. Both fear and hope arise from this petition. For all sinners who are contrite and confess their guilt, receive mercy. Hence, this petition is necessary.

          <td colspan="2">THE FULFILLMENT OF THIS PETITION
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa secundum sciendum est, quod in peccato sunt duo: scilicet culpa qua offenditur Deus, et poena quae debetur pro culpa. Sed culpa remittitur in contritione, quae est cum proposito confitendi et satisfaciendi. Psal. XXXI, 5: <i>dixi: confitebor adversum me iniustitiam meam domino: et tu remisisti impietatem peccati mei</i> . Non est igitur desperandum, ex quo ad remissionem culpae sufficit contritio cum proposito confitendi.
          <td>Concerning the second consideration of this petition (viz., how it may be fulfilled), it must be known that there are two factors in sin: the fault by which God is offended, and the punishment which is due because of this fault. But the sin is taken away in contrition which goes with the purpose to confess and make satisfaction: "I said: I will confess against myself my injustice to the Lord. And Thou hast forgiven the wickedness of my sin"[9] One has no need to fear then, because for the remission of a fault contrition with a purpose to confess is sufficient.[10]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed forte quis dicet: ex quo dimittitur peccatum contritione, ad quid necessarius est sacerdos? Ad hoc dicendum est, quod Deus in contritione dimittit culpam, et poena aeterna commutatur in temporalem; sed nihilominus manet adhuc obligatus ad poenam temporalem. Unde si decederet sine confessione, non contempta tamen, sed praeventa, iret ad Purgatorium, cuius poena, sicut dicit Augustinus, est maxima. Quando ergo confiteris, sacerdos absolvit te de hac poena in clavium virtute, cui te subieceris in confessione; et ideo dixit Christus apostolis, Ioan. XX, 22-23: <i>accipite spiritum sanctum: quorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur eis; et quorum retinueritis, retenta sunt</i> . Unde quando semel confitetur quis, dimittitur ei aliquid de poena huiusmodi, et similiter quando iterum confitetur: et posset toties confiteri, quod tota sibi dimitteretur.
          <td>But one might say: "If sin is thus taken away when a man is contrite, of what necessity is the priest?" To this it must be said that God does forgive the sin in contrition, and eternal punishment is changed to temporal, but nevertheless the debt of temporal punishment remains. If one should die without confession, not out of contempt for it but prevented from it, one would go to purgatory, where the punishment, as St. Augustine says, is very great. When you confess, the priest absolves you of this punishment in virtue of the keys to which you subject yourself in confession.[11] When, therefore, one has confessed, something of this punishment is taken away; and similarly when he has again confessed, and it could be that after he has confessed many times, all would be remitted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Invenerunt autem successores apostolorum alium modum remissionis huius poenae: scilicet beneficia indulgentiarum quae existenti in caritate tantum valent quantum sonant et quantum pronuntiantur. Quod autem Papa hoc possit, satis patet. Nam multi sancti multa bona fecerunt, et tamen isti non peccaverunt, ad minus mortaliter; et haec bona fecerunt in utilitatem Ecclesiae. Similiter meritum Christi et beatae virginis sunt sicut in thesauro. Unde summus pontifex, et illi quibus ipse committit, possunt huiusmodi merita, ubi necesse est, dispensare. Sic ergo dimittuntur peccata non solum quantum ad culpam in contritione, sed etiam quantum ad poenam in confessione, et per indulgentias.
          <td>The successors of the Apostles found another mode of remission of this punishment, namely, the good use of indulgences, which have their force for one living in the state of grace, to the extent that is claimed for them and as indicated by the grantor. That the Pope can bring this about, is sufficiently evident. Many holy men have accomplished much good, and they have not greatly sinned, at least not mortally; and these good deeds were done for the common use of the Church. Likewise the merits of Christ and the Blessed Virgin are, as it were, in a treasury; and from it the Supreme Pontiff and they who are by him permitted can dispense these merits where it is necessary. Thus, therefore, sins are taken away not only as regards their guilt by contrition,[12] but also as regards punishment for them in confession and through indulgences.[13]

Si ergo non dimittis, non dimittetur tibi.
          <td>Concerning the third consideration of this petition, it must be known that on our part we are required to forgive our neighbor the offenses which he commits against us. Thus, we say: "As we forgive those who trespass against us." Otherwise God would not forgive us: "Man to man reserveth anger: and doth he seek remedy of God?"[14] "Forgive and you shall be forgiven."[15] Therefore, only in this petition is there a condition when it says: "As we forgive those who trespass against us." If you do not forgive, you shall not be forgiven.

          <td>But you may think, "I shall say what goes first in the petition, namely, 'forgive us,' but that 'As we forgive those who trespass against us,' I shall not say." Would you seek to deceive Christ? You certainly do not deceive Him. For Christ who made this prayer remembers it well, and cannot be deceived. If therefore, you say it with the lips, let the heart fulfill it.

Unus est perfectorum, ut scilicet offensus requirat offendentem. Psal. XXXIII, 15: <i>inquire pacem</i> . Alius est communiter omnium, ad quem tenentur omnes, ut scilicet petenti veniam tribuat. Eccli. XXVIII, 2: <i>relinque proximo tuo nocenti te, et tunc deprecanti tibi peccata solventur</i> . Ex hoc sequitur alia beatitudo: <i>beati misericordes</i> : misericordia enim facit nos misereri proximo nostro.
          <td>But one may ask whether he who does not intend to forgive his neighbor ought to say: "As we forgive those who trespass against us." It seems not, for such is a lie. But actually it must be said that he does not lie, because he prays not in his own person, but in that of the Church which is not deceived, and, therefore the petition itself is in the plural number.[16] And it must also be known that forgiveness is twofold. One applies to the perfect, where the one offended seeks out the offender: "Seek after peace."[17] The other is common to all, and to it all are equally bound, that one offended grant pardon to the one who seeks it: "Forgive thy neighbor if he hath hurt thee; and then shall thy sins be forgiven to thee when thou prayest."[18] And from this follows that other beatitude: "Blessed are the merciful." For mercy causes us to have pity on our neighbor.

In the other petitions we asked of God not only eternal and spiritual goods, but also transient and temporal advantages. But now we ask to be liberated from the evils of the soul and of the body. of this life and of the life to come" ("Roman Catechism," "Lord's Prayer," Chapter XIV, 1). 4. Literally, our debts; that is, the difference between what we ought to give God and actually do not give Him. "The type of offense requiring expiation, a sin" (Oxford English Dictionary). What we pray for is that God may deliver us from sin This is the interpretation of St. Luke, who, instead of 'debts,' uses the word 'sins, because through our sins we become guilty before God and incur a debt of punishment which we must pay either by satisfaction or by suffering.... With regard to serious sins, however, this petition cannot procure forgiveness unless it derive that efficacy from the Sacrament of Penance, received, as we have already said, either actually or at least in desire' ( Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 15). 5. "De Natura et gratia," XXXVI. 6. I John, i. 8. 7. Eph., iv. 19. 8. Matt., xviii. 32. 9. Ps. xxxi. 5. 10. See Editor's Note in English Translation of "Summa Theologica Supplement," Q. xviii, art. 1, which says: "St. Thomas here follows the opinion of Peter Lombard.... Later in life he altered his opinion. Cfr. P. III, Q. lxvii, art. I; Q. lxiv, art. I; Q. lxxxvi. art. 6." See footnote below. 11. The effects of the Sacrament of Penance are: (1) sanctifying grace is imparted whereby the guilt of mortal sin is taken away and at the same time the guilt of eternal punishment; (2) the guilt of temporal punishment is more or less remitted according to the dispositions of the penitent "and the disposition can be such that in virtue of contrition the entire punishment is removed," says St. Thomas (IV Sent., Dist. xviii, art. 3, sol. 2, ad. 4). The Council of Trent (Session XIV, cap. 2) teaches that this entire remission of punishment, which is obtained through Baptism, is not obtained through the Sacrament of Penance "without much tears and labors" ("magnis nostris fletibus et laboribus"). For other effects of this Sacrament, such as the bestowal of sacramental grace and the revival of the merits of former good works, see the Manuals of Moral Theology (e.g., Aertnys-Damen, II, lib. VI, tract. v, n. 272). 12. See footnote above. 13. An indulgence is a remission of that temporal punishment which, even after the sin is forgiven, we have yet to undergo either here or in purgatory. Indulgences derive their value and efficacy from the spiritual treasury of the Church. which consists of the superabundant merits of Christ, His Blessed Mother. and the Saints. This treasury is to be considered as the common property of the faithful, committed to the administration of the Church. In virtue of the Communion of Saints, by which we are united as members of one body, the abundance of some supplies for the want of others. The Council of Trent (Session XXV) points out to all the faithful that the use of indulgences is very salutary. 14. Ecclus., xxviii. 3. 15. Luke, vi. 37. 16. "Nor do we say 'forgive me,' but 'forgive us,' because the brotherly relationship and charity which subsist between all men demand of each of us that, being solicitous for the salvation of our neighbor, we pray also for them while offering prayers for ourselves" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 16). 17. Ps. xxxiii. 15. 18. Ecclus., xxviii. 2.

For, on the one hand, they deplore their sins by being sorry for them; and, on the other hand, they sin again and again and have them again to deplore. Thus it is written: "Wash yourselves, be clean.

          <td colspan="2">WHAT IS TEMPTATION?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum sciendum est, quod tentare nihil aliud est quam experiri seu probare: unde tentare hominem est probare virtutem eius. Experitur autem seu probatur virtus hominis dupliciter, secundum quod duo exigit hominis virtus. Unum pertinet ad bene operandum, scilicet quod bene operetur; aliud est quod caveat a malo. Psal. XXXIII, 15: <i>declina a malo, et fac bonum</i> . Probatur ergo virtus hominis quandoque quantum ad hoc quod bene facit, quandoque vero quantum ad hoc quod cesset a malo. Quantum ad primum probatur homo utrum inveniatur promptus ad bonum, ut ad ieiunandum et huiusmodi. Tunc enim est virtus tua magna quando promptus inveniris ad bonum. Et hoc modo Deus probat aliquando hominem; non quod lateat eum virtus hominis, sed ut eam omnes cognoscant, et detur omnibus in exemplum. Sic tentavit Deus Abraham, Gen. XXII, et Iob. Et ideo Deus saepe immittit tribulationes iustis, ut dum patienter sustinent, appareat virtus eorum, et in virtute proficiant. Deut. XIII, 3: <i>tentat vos dominus Deus vester, ut palam fiat utrum diligatis eum, an non</i> . Sic ergo Deus tentat provocando ad bonum.
          <td>Regarding the first, it must be known that to tempt is nothing other than to test or to prove. To tempt a man is to test or try his virtue. This is done in two ways just as a man's virtue requires two things. One requirement is to do good, the other is to avoid evil: "Turn away from evil and do good."[3] Sometimes a man's virtue is tried in doing good, and sometimes it is tested in avoiding evil. Thus, regarding the first, a person is tried in his readiness to do good, for example, to fast and such like. Then is thy virtue great when thou art quick to do good. In this way does God sometimes try one's virtue, not, however, because such virtue is hidden from Him, but in order that all might know it and it would be an example to all. God tempted Abraham in this way, and Job also.[4] For this reason God frequently sends trials to the just, who in sustaining them with all patience make manifest their virtue and themselves increase in virtue: "The Lord your God trieth you, that it may appear whether you love Him with all your heart and with all your soul, or not."[5] Thus does God tempt man by inciting him to good deeds.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quantum ad secundum probatur virtus hominis per inductionem ad malum. Et si bene resistit, et non consentit, tunc virtus hominis magna est; si vero homo succumbit tentationi, tunc virtus hominis nulla est. Hoc autem modo nullus tentatur a Deo: quia, sicut dicitur Iac. I, 13: <i>Deus intentator malorum est: ipse autem neminem tentat</i> .
          <td>As to the second, the virtue of man is tried by solicitation to evil. If he truly resists and does not give his consent, then his virtue is great. If, however, he falls before the temptation, he is devoid of virtue. God tempts no man in this way, for it is written: "God is not a tempter of evils, and He tempteth no man."[6]

          <td colspan="2">HOW IS ONE TEMPTED?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed tentatur homo a propria carne, a Diabolo, et a mundo. A carne dupliciter. Primo quia caro instigat ad malum: caro enim semper quaerit delectationes suas, scilicet carnales, in quibus est saepe peccatum. Qui enim immoratur delectationibus carnalibus, negligit spiritualia. Iac. I, 14: <i>unusquisque vero tentatur a concupiscentia sua</i> .
          <td>The Temptations of the Flesh.—Man is tempted by his own flesh, by the devil and by the world. He is tempted by the flesh in two ways. First, the flesh incites one to evil. It always seeks its own pleasures, namely, carnal pleasures, in which often is sin. He who indulges in carnal pleasures neglects spiritual things: "Every man is tempted by his own concupiscence."[7]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo tentat caro retrahendo a bono. Nam spiritus, quantum est de se, semper delectaretur in spiritualibus bonis; sed caro aggravans impedit spiritum. Sap. IX, 15: <i>corpus quod corrumpitur, aggravat animam</i> . Rom. VII, 22: <i>condelector legi Dei secundum interiorem hominem; video autem aliam legem in membris meis repugnantem legi mentis meae, et captivantem me in lege peccati, quae est in membris meis</i> . Sed haec tentatio, scilicet carnis, est valde gravis, quia inimicus noster, scilicet caro, coniunctus est nobis: et, sicut dicit Boetius, nulla pestis efficacior est ad nocendum quam familiaris inimicus. Et ideo contra eam vigilandum est. Matth. XXVI, 41: <i>vigilate et orate, ne intretis in tentationem</i> .
          <td>Secondly, the flesh tempts man by enticing him away from good. For the spirit on its part would delight always in spiritual things, but the flesh asserting itself puts obstacles in the way of the spirit: "The corruptible body is a load upon the soul."[8] "For I am delighted with the law of God, according to the inward man. But I see another law in my members, fighting against the law of my mind, and captivating me in the law of sin, that is in my members."[9] This temptation which comes from the flesh is most severe, because our enemy, the flesh, is united to us; and as Boethius says: "There is no plague more dangerous than an enemy in the family circle." We must, therefore, be ever on our guard against this enemy: "Watch and pray that ye enter not into temptation."[10]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Diabolus fortissime tentat. Nam postquam conculcatur caro, insurgit alius, scilicet Diabolus, contra quem est nobis magna colluctatio. Apostolus, Ephes. VI, 12: <i>non est nobis colluctatio adversus carnem et sanguinem, sed adversus principes et potestates, adversus mundi rectores tenebrarum harum</i> . Unde et signanter dicitur tentator. I Thess. III, 5: <i>ne forte tentaverit vos is qui tentat</i> .
          <td>The Temptations of the Devil.—The devil tempts us with extreme force. Even when the flesh is subdued, another tempter arises, namely, the devil against whom we have a heavy struggle. Of this the Apostle says: "Our wrestling is not against flesh and blood, but against principalities and powers, against the rulers of the world of this darkness, against the spirits of wickedness in high places."[11] For this reason he is very aptly called the tempter: "Lest perhaps he that tempteth should have tempted you."[12]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>In tentatione autem sua callidissime procedit. Ipse enim, sicut bonus dux exercitus qui obsidet aliquod castrum, considerat infirma eius quem impugnare vult, et ex illa parte unde magis est homo debilis, tentat eum. Et ideo tentat de illis vitiis ad quae homines conculcata carne magis proni sunt, ut de ira, de superbia, et de aliis spiritualibus vitiis. I Petr. V, 8: <i>adversarius vester Diabolus tanquam leo rugiens circuit quaerens quem devoret</i> .
          <td>The devil proceeds most cunningly in tempting us. He operates like a skillful general when about to attack a fortified city. He looks for the weak places in the object of his assault, and in that part where a man is most weak, he tempts him. He tempts man in those sins to which, after subduing his flesh, he is most inclined. Such, for instance, are anger, pride and the other spiritual sins. "Your adversary the devil, as a roaring lion, goeth about seeking whom he may devour."[13]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Facit autem duo Diabolus dum tentat: quia non statim proponit illi quem tentat, malum aliquod apparens, sed aliquid quod habeat speciem boni, ut saltem in ipso principio per illud removeat eum aliquantulum a proposito suo principali, quia postmodum facilius inducit ipsum ad peccandum, quando illum vel modicum avertit. Apostolus, II Cor. XI, 14: <i>ipse Satanas transfigurat se in Angelum lucis</i> . Deinde postquam induxit eum ad peccandum, sic alligat eum ut non permittat eum a peccatis resurgere. Iob XL, 12: <i>nervi testiculorum eius perplexi sunt</i> . Sic ergo duo facit Diabolus: quia decipit, et deceptum detinet in peccato.
          <td>How the Devil Tempts Us.—The devil does two things when he tempts us. Thus, he does not at once suggest something that appears to us as evil, but something that has a semblance of good. Thereby he would, at least in the beginning, turn a man from his chief purpose, and then afterwards it will be easier to induce him to sin, once he has been turned away ever so little. "Satan himself transformeth himself into an angel of light."[14] Then when he has once led man into sin, he so enchains him as to prevent his rising up out of his sin. The devil, therefore, does two things: he deceives a man first, and then after betraying him, enthralls him in his sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed mundus dupliciter tentat. Primo per nimium et immoderatum desiderium rerum temporalium. Apostolus, I Tim. VI, 10: <i>radix omnium malorum est cupiditas</i> . Secundo per persecutores et tyrannos terrendo. Iob XXXVII, 19: <i>nos quoque involvimur tenebris</i> . II Tim. III, 12: <i>omnes qui pie volunt vivere in Christo Iesu, persecutionem patientur</i> . Matth. X, 28: <i>nolite timere eos qui occidunt corpus</i> .
          <td>Temptations of the World.—The world has two ways of tempting man. The first is excessive and intemperate desire for the goods of this life: "The desire of money is the root of all evil."[15] The second way is the fears engendered by persecutors and tyrants: "We are wrapped up in darkness."[16] "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."[17] And again: "Fear not those that slay the body."[18]

          <td>Sic ergo patet quid est tentatio, et qualiter tentatur homo, et a quo. Sequitur videre qualiter homo liberatur. Circa quod sciendum est, quod Christus docet nos rogare non ut non tentemur, sed ut non inducamur in tentationem. Nam si homo vincit tentationem, meretur coronam; et ideo dicitur Iac. I, 2: <i>omne gaudium existimate, fratres cum in tentationes varias incideritis</i> . Eccli. II, 1: <i>fili, accedens ad servitutem Dei (...) praepara animam tuam ad tentationem</i> . Item Iac. I, 12: <i>beatus vir qui suffert tentationem: quoniam cum probatus fuerit, accipiet coronam vitae</i> . Et ideo docet petere ut non inducamur in tentationem per consensum. I Cor. X, 13: <i>tentatio vos non apprehendat nisi humana</i> . Nam tentari humanum est, sed consentire diabolicum est.
          <td>How Is One Freed from Temptation?—Now we have seen what temptation is, and also in what way and by whom one is tempted. But how is one freed from temptation? In this we must notice that Christ teaches us to pray, not that we may not be tempted, but that we may not be led into temptation. For it is when one overcomes temptation that one deserves the reward. Thus it is said: "Count it all joy when you shall fall into divers temptations."[19] And again: "Son, when thou comest to the service of God,... prepare thy soul for temptation."[20] Again: "Blessed is the man that endureth temptation; for when he hath been proved, he shall receive the crown of life."[21] Our Lord, therefore, teaches us to pray that we be not led into temptation, by giving our consent to it: "Let no temptation take hold on you, but such as is human."[22] The reason is that it is human to be tempted, but to give consent is devilish.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed nunquid Deus inducit ad malum, quia dicit: <i>et ne nos inducas in tentationem?</i> Dico, quod Deus dicitur inducere ad malum permittendo, inquantum scilicet propter multa peccata subtrahit homini gratiam suam, qua sublata homo labitur in peccatum: et ideo cantamus in Psalmo LXX, 9: <i>cum defecerit virtus mea, ne derelinquas me domine</i> . Regit autem hominem ne inducatur in tentationem per fervorem caritatis: quia quaelibet caritas quantumcumque parva, potest resistere cuilibet peccato. Cant. VIII, 7: <i>aquae multae non potuerunt extinguere caritatem</i> . Item per lumen intellectus, quo instruit nos de agendis: quia, sicut dicit philosophus, omnis peccans est ignorans. Psal. XXXI, 8: <i>intellectum tibi dabo, et instruam te</i> . Hoc autem petebat David, qui dicebat, Psal. XII, 4-5: <i>illumina oculos meos, ne unquam obdormiam in morte: ne quando dicat inimicus meus, praevalui adversus eum</i> . Hoc autem habemus per donum intellectus. Et quia cum non assentimur tentationi, servamus cor mundum, de quo Matth. V, 8: <i>beati mundo corde, quoniam ipsi Deum videbunt</i> : ideo ex hoc pervenimus ad visionem Dei, ad quam nos perducat.
          <td>But does God lead one to evil, that he should pray: "Lead us not into temptation"? I reply that God is said to lead a person into evil by permitting him to the extent that, because of his many sins, He withdraws His grace from man, and as a result of this withdrawal man does fall into sin. Therefore, we sing in the Psalm: "When my strength shall fail, do not Thou forsake me."[23] God, however, directs man by the fervor of charity that he be not led into temptation. For charity even in its smallest degree is able to resist any kind of sin: "Many waters cannot quench charity."[24] He also guides man by the light of his intellect in which he teaches him what he should do. For as the Philosopher says: "Every one who sins is ignorant."[25] "I will give thee understanding and I will instruct thee."[26] It was for this last that David prayed, saying: "Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death; lest at any time my enemy say: I have prevailed against him."[27] We have this through the gift of understanding. Therefore, when we refuse to consent to temptation, we keep our hearts pure: "Blessed are the clean of heart, for they shall see God."[28] And it follows from this petition that we are led up to the sight of God, and to it may God lead us all!

          <td>Supra docuit nos dominus petere veniam peccatorum, et quomodo possumus vitare tentationes: hic vero docet petere praeservationem a malis. Et haec petitio est generalis contra omnia mala; scilicet peccata, infirmitates et afflictiones, sicut dicit Augustinus. Sed quia de peccato et tentatione dictum est, dicendum est de aliis malis, scilicet adversitatibus et afflictionibus omnibus huius mundi; a quibus Deus liberat quadrupliciter.
          <td>The Lord has already taught us to pray for forgiveness of our sins, and how to avoid temptations. In this petition, He teaches us to pray to be preserved from evil, and indeed from all evil in general, such as sin, illness, affliction and all others, as St. Augustine explains it.[1] But since we have already mentioned sin and temptation, we now must consider other evils, such as adversity and all afflictions of this world. From these God preserves us in a fourfold manner.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Primo ne superveniat afflictio. Sed hoc raro contingit: quoniam sancti in mundo isto affliguntur, quia, ut dicitur II Tim. III, 12: <i>omnes qui pie volunt vivere in Christo Iesu, persecutionem patientur</i> . Sed tamen alicui Deus concedit aliquando ut non affligatur a malo; quando scilicet cognoscit eum impotentem, et non posse resistere; sicut medicus infirmo debili non dat violentas medicinas. Apoc. III, 8: <i>ecce dedi coram te ostium apertum, quod nemo potest claudere, quia modicam habes virtutem</i> . In patria autem erit generale hoc, quia nullus affligetur ibi. Iob V, 19: <i>in sex tribulationibus</i> , scilicet praesentis vitae, quae per sex aetates distinguitur, <i>liberabit te; et in septima non tanget te malum</i> . Apoc. VII, 16: <i>non esurient neque sitient amplius</i> .
          <td>First, He preserves us from affliction itself; but this is very rare because it is the lot of the just in this world to suffer, for it is written: "All that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution."[2] Once in a while, however, God does prevent a man from being afflicted by some evil; this is when He knows such a one to be weak and unable to bear it. Just so a physician does not prescribe violent medicines to a weak patient. "Behold, I have given before thee a door opened, which no man can shut; because thou hast little strength."[3] In heaven this will be a general thing, for there no one shall be afflicted. "In six troubles," those, namely, of this present life which is divided into six periods, "He shall deliver thee, and in the seventh evil shall not touch thee."[4] "They shall no more hunger nor thirst."[5]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo liberat quando in afflictionibus consolatur. Nam nisi Deus consolaretur, non posset homo subsistere. II Cor. I, 8: <i>supra modum gravati sumus supra virtutem nostram</i> ; et ibid. VII, 6: <i>sed qui consolatur humiles, consolatus est nos Deus</i> . Psal. XCIII: <i>secundum multitudinem dolorum meorum in corde meo consolationes tuae laetificaverunt animam meam</i> .
          <td>Second, God delivers us from afflictions when He consoles us in them; for unless He console us, we could not long persevere: "We were pressed out of measure above our strength so that we were weary even of life."[6] "But God, who comforteth the humble, comforted us."[7] "According to the multitude of my sorrows in my heart, Thy comforts have given joy to my soul."[8]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio quia afflictis tot bona facit quot tradunt mala oblivioni. Tob. III, 22: <i>post tempestatem tranquillum facis</i> . Sic ergo afflictiones et tribulationes huius mundi non sunt timendae, quia facile tolerantur et propter consolationem admixtam, et propter brevitatem. Apostolus, II Cor. IV, 17: <i>id quod in praesenti est momentaneum et leve tribulationis nostrae, supra modum in sublimitate aeternum gloriae pondus operatur in nobis</i> : quia ex his pervenitur ad vitam aeternam.
          <td>Third, God bestows so many good things upon those who are afflicted that their evils are forgotten: "After the storm Thou makest a calm."[9] The afflictions and trials of this world, therefore, are not to be feared, both because consolations accompany them and because they are of short duration: "For that which is at present momentary and light of our tribulation, worketh for us above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of glory."[10]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quarto quia tentatio et tribulatio convertitur in bonum: et ideo non dicit, <i>libera nos</i> a tribulatione, sed <i>a malo</i> : quia tribulationes sunt sanctis ad coronam; et inde est quod gloriantur de tribulationibus. Apostolus, Rom. V, 3: <i>non solum autem, sed et gloriamur in tribulationibus, scientes quod tribulatio patientiam operatur</i> . Tob. III, 13: <i>in tempore tribulationis peccata dimittis</i> .
          <td>Fourth, we are preserved from afflictions in this way that all temptations and trials are conducive to our own good. We do not pray, "Deliver us from tribulation," but "from evil." This is because tribulations bring a crown to the just, and for that reason the Saints rejoiced in their sufferings: "We glory also in tribulations, knowing that tribulation worketh patience."[11] "In time of tribulation Thou forgivest sins."[12]

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Liberat ergo Deus hominem a malo et tribulationibus, eas in bonum convertendo; quod est signum maximae sapientiae, quia sapientis est malum ordinare in bonum; et hoc fit per patientiam, quae habetur in tribulationibus. Ceterae vero virtutes bonis utuntur, sed patientia malis; et ideo solum in malis, idest in adversitatibus, est necessaria: Prov. XIX, 11: <i>doctrina viri per patientiam noscitur</i> .
          <td>God, therefore, delivers man from evil and from affliction by converting them to his good. This is a sign of supreme wisdom to divert evil to good. And patience in bearing trials is a result of this. The other virtues operate by good things, but patience operates in evil things, and, indeed, it is very necessary in evil things, namely, in adversity: "The learning of a man is known by his patience."[13]
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo spiritus sanctus per donum sapientiae facit nos petere: et per hoc pervenimus ad beatitudinem ad quam ordinat pax, quia per patientiam pacem habemus et in tempore prospero et adverso: et ideo pacifici dicuntur filii Dei, qui sunt similes Deo, quia sicut Deo nihil nocere potest, ita nec eis, quia nec prospera nec adversa; et ideo <i>beati pacifici, quoniam filii Dei vocabuntur</i> , Matth. V, 9.
          <td>The Holy Spirit through the gift of wisdom has us use this prayer, and by it we arrive at supreme happiness which is the reward of peace. For it is by patience we obtain peace, whether in time of prosperity or of adversity. For this reason the peace-makers are called the children of God, because they are like to God in this, that nothing can hurt God and nothing can hurt them, whether it be prosperity or adversity: "Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of God."[14]

          <td>By way of brief summary, it should be known that the Lord's Prayer contains all that we ought to desire and all that we ought to avoid. Now, of all desirable things, that must be most desired which is most loved, and that is God.

          <td>et ideo primo petis gloriam Dei, cum dicis: <i>sanctificetur nomen tuum</i> . A Deo autem desideranda sunt tria, quae pertinent ad te.

Secundum est quod facias voluntatem Dei et iustitiam; et hoc petis cum dicis: <i>fiat voluntas tua sicut in caelo et in terra</i> . Tertium est ut habeas necessaria ad vitam; et hoc petis cum dicis: <i>panem nostrum quotidianum da nobis hodie</i> . Et de his tribus dicit dominus, Matth. VI, 33: <i>primum quaerite regnum Dei</i> , quantum ad primum; <i>et iustitiam eius</i> quantum ad secundum; <i>et haec omnia adiicientur vobis</i> , quantum ad tertium.
          <td>Therefore, you seek, first of all, the glory of God when you say: "Hallowed be Thy name." You should desire three things from God, and they concern yourself. The first is that you may arrive at eternal life. And you pray for this when you say: "Thy kingdom come." The second is that you will do the will of God and His justice. You pray for this in the words: "Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven." The third is that you may have the necessaries of life. And thus you pray: "Give us this day our daily bread." Concerning all these things the Lord says: "Seek ye first the kingdom of God," which complies with the second, "and all these things shall be added unto you,"[16] as in accord with the third.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Illa autem quae vitanda sunt et fugienda, sunt illa quae contrariantur bono. Bonum autem quod primo desiderabile est, est quadruplex, ut dictum est.

Iob XXXV, 6: <i>si peccaveris, quid ei nocebis (...) si iuste egeris, quid donabis ei?</i> Nam et de malo in quantum punit, et de bono inquantum remunerat, resultat gloria Dei.
          <td>We must avoid and flee from all things which are opposed to the good. For, as we have seen, good is above all things to be desired. This good is fourfold. First, there is the glory of God, and no evil is contrary to this: "If thou sin, what shalt thou hurt Him? And if thou do justly, what shall thou give Him?"[17] Whether it be the evil inasmuch as God punishes it, or whether it be the good in that God rewards it—all redound to His glory.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum bonum est vita aeterna; et huic contrariatur peccatum, quia per peccatum perditur: et ideo ad hoc removendum dicimus: <i>dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris</i> . Tertium bonum est iustitia et bona opera; et huic contrariatur tentatio, quia tentationes impediunt nos a bono operando: et ad hoc removendum petimus: <i>et ne nos inducas in tentationem</i> . Quartum bonum sunt bona necessaria; et huic contrariantur adversitates et tribulationes; et ad hoc removendum petimus: <i>sed libera nos a malo. Amen</i> .
          <td>The second good is eternal life, to which sin is contrary: because eternal life is lost by sin. And so to remove this evil we pray: "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us." The third good is justice and good works, and temptation is contrary to this, because temptation hinders us from doing good. We pray, therefore, to have this evil taken away in the words: "Lead us not into temptation." The fourth good is all the necessaries of life, and opposed to this are troubles and adversities. And we seek to remove them when we pray: "But deliver us from evil. Amen."
