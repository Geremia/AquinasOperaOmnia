                        742. We have dealt then with the primary kind of being
                        and the one to which all the other categories of being
                        are referred, namely, substance. For it is in reference
                        to the concept of substance that the other categories
                        are called beings, i.e., quantity, quality, and others
                        which are spoken of in this way; for all involve the
                        concept of substance, as we have stated in our first
                        discussions (562). And since being is used in one sense
                        of quiddity or quantity or quality, and in another sense
                        of potency and actuality and activity, let us now
                        establish the truth about potency and actuality. And
                        first let us consider potency in the most proper sense
                        of the term, although not the one most useful for our
                        present purpose; for potency and actuality are found in
                        more things than those which are referred merely to
                        motion. But when we have spoken about this sense of
                        potency we shall, in our discussions about actuality,
                        also explain the other senses of potency.

                        743. That the terms potency and can are used in many
                        senses we have made evident elsewhere (467). And all of
                        those senses of potency which are equivocal may be
                        dismissed; for some senses of potency [or power] are
                        merely figurative, as in geometry. And we say that
                        things are possible or impossible because they either
                        are or are not in some particular way. But all those
                        potencies belonging to the same species are principles
                        and are referred to one primary kind of potency, which
                        is the principle of change in some other thing inasmuch
                        as it is other. For one kind is a potency for being
                        acted upon, which is in the patient and is the principle
                        of its being passively moved by another inasmuch as it
                        is other; and another kind of potency is the state of
                        insusceptibility to change for the worse and to
                        corruption by some other thing inasmuch as it is other,
                        i.e., by a principle of change. And the intelligible
                        character of the primary kind of potency is found in all
                        of these terms. Again, these potencies are said to be
                        potencies either just for acting or for being acted
                        upon, or for acting or being acted upon well, so that in
                        these latter kinds of potencies the notes of the prior
                        kind are somehow present.

                        744. It is evident, then, that in one sense the potency
                        for acting and for being acted upon are one; for a thing
                        is potential both because it itself has the potency for
                        being acted upon, and because something else can be
                        acted upon by it. And in another sense these potencies
                        are different; for the one is in the patient, since it
                        is because it has a principle, and because matter is a
                        principle, that the patient is acted upon and changed by
                        something else. For what is oily is capable of being
                        burnt, and what is yielding in some way is capable of
                        being broken (and the supposit is capable of being
                        expressed);’ and the same is true in other cases. And
                        another kind of potency is in the agent, as the potency
                        to heat and the potency to build-the former in the thing
                        capable of heating, and the latter in the person capable
                        of building. Hence, inasmuch as a thing is by nature a
                        unity, it cannot be acted upon by itself; for it is one
                        thing and not also something else.

                        contrary to such potency, so that every potency and
                        incapacity belong to the same subject and refer to the
                        same attribute. And there are various kinds of
                        privation; for there is one kind of privation when a
                        thing does not have some attribute which it is naturally
                        disposed to have, either in general, or when it is
                        naturally disposed to have it. And this is so either in
                        a particular way, for example, completely, or even in
                        any way at all. And in some cases if things are
                        naturally disposed to have some attribute and do not
                        have it as a result of force, we say that they are
                        deprived of it.

              He accordingly points out, first, that he has already discussed
              above the primary kind of being to which all the other categories
              of being are referred, namely,
              <b>substance</b>. And he explains that all the other categories
              are referred to substance as the primary kind of being, because
              all other beings— quantity, quality, and the like—involve the
              concept of substance. For being is said of quantity because it is
              the measure of substance; and of quality because it is a certain
              disposition of substance; and the same thing applies in the case
              of the other categories. This is evident from the fact that all
              accidents involve the concept of substance, since in the
              definition of any accident it is necessary to include its proper
              subject; for example, in the definition of <i>snub</i> it is
              necessary to include nose. This was made clear at the beginning of
              Book VII (1347).

              potency is used
              <b>equivocally</b>, he says that these must be dismissed for the
              present. For the term potency is referred to some things, not
              because of some principle which they have, but in a figurative
              sense, (1) as is done in <b>geometry</b>; for the square of a line
              is called its power (<i>potentia</i>), and a line is said to be
              capable of becoming its square. (2) And similarly in the case of
              <b>numbers</b>
              it can be said that the number three is capable of becoming the
              number nine, which is its square; because when the number three is
              multiplied by itself the number nine results, for three times
              three makes nine; and when a line, which is the root of a square,
              is multiplied by itself, a square results. And the same thing
              applies in the case of numbers. Hence the root of a square bears
              some likeness to the matter from which a thing is made; and for
              this reason the root is said to be capable of becoming its square
              as matter is capable of becoming a thing.

              from which all the others derive their meaning; and this is an
              <b>active</b>
              principle, which is the source of change in some other thing
              inasmuch as it is other. He says this because it is possible for
              an active principle to be at the same time in the mobile or
              patient, as when something moves itself; although it is not mover
              and moved, or agent and patient, in the same respect. Hence the
              principle designated as active potency is said to be a principle
              of change in some other thing
              <b>inasmuch as it is other</b>; because, even though an active
              principle can be found in the same thing as a passive principle,
              this still does not happen insofar as it is the same, but insofar
              as it is other.

              a thing can be said to have a potency for being acted upon, either
              because it has of itself a potency by which it may be acted upon,
              or because it has a potency by which something else may be acted
              upon by it. And in this second sense active potency is the same as
              passive potency; for by reason of the fact that a thing has active
              potency it has a power by which something else may be acted upon
              by it.

              itself; and matter is of this sort. Now passive potency is nothing
              but the principle by which one thing is acted upon by another; for
              example, to be burned is to undergo a change, and the material
              principle by reason of which a thing is capable of being burned is
              the oily or the fat. Hence the potency itself is present as a
              passive principle in the thing capable of being burned. And
              similarly what yields to the thing touching it so that it receives
              an impression from it, as wax or something of this sort, is
              capable of doing so inasmuch as it is impressionable. “And the

              modification resulting in an eunuch. The same is true of other
              things which are acted upon insofar as they have within themselves
              a principle for being acted upon, which is called passive potency.
              But active potency is in the agent, as heat in the thing which
              heats and the art of building in the builder.

              1785. But it must be noted that the term privation is used in many
              senses. For in one sense whatever does not have some attribute can
              be said to be deprived of it, as when we say that a stone is
              deprived of sight because it does not have sight; and in another
              sense a thing is said to be deprived only of what it can have and
              does not have. And this may happen in two ways: in one way when
              the thing does not have it at all, as a dog is said to be deprived
              of sight when it does not have it; and, in another way, if it does
              not have it when it is naturally disposed to have it. Hence a dog
              is not said to be deprived of sight before the ninth day. This
              sense of privation is again divided. For in one sense a thing is
              said to be deprived of some attribute because it does not have it
              in a particular way, namely, completely and well; as when we say
              that someone who does not see well is blind. And in another sense
              a thing is said to be deprived of some attribute when it does not
              have it in any way at all; for example, we say that a person is
              deprived of sight who does not have sight at all. But sometimes
              force is included in the notion of privation, and then we say that
              some things are deprived of certain attributes when those which
              they are naturally disposed to have are removed by force.

                        conception [or rational plan], and the same conception
                        explains both a thing and its privation, though not in

                        thing. Hence it is necessary that such sciences should
                        deal with contraries, but with one directly and with the
                        other indirectly; for the conception applies to one
                        essentially, but to the other in a kind of accidental
                        way, because it explains the contrary by negation and
                        removal. For the contrary is the primary privation, and
                        this is the removal of the other term.

                        subject, and since a science is a potency in a being
                        which possesses a rational plan, and the soul has a
                        principle of motion, it follows that, while what is
                        healthful produces only health, and what is capable of
                        heating produces only heat, and what is capable of
                        cooling produces only cold, one who has a science may be
                        occupied with both contraries. For reason extends to
                        both but not in the same manner, and it exists in a soul
                        which possesses a principle of motion Hence the soul
                        will initiate both by the same principle by joining both
                        to the same rational plan. And for this reason those
                        things whose potency is rational produce effects
                        contrary to those whose potency is irrational; for one
                        principle of contrary determinations is contained in the

              In regard to the first he does three things. First, he shows how
              potencies differ on the basis of a
              <b>difference in their subjects</b>. He says that, since potencies
              are principles both for acting and being acted upon, some of these
              principles are in <b>non-living</b> things and some in living
              ones. And since <b>living</b> things are composed of body and
              soul, and the principles for acting and being acted upon which are
              present in the body of living things do not differ from those in
              non-living ones, he therefore adds “and in the soul,” because the
              principles of action which are present in the soul clearly differ
              from those present in non-living things.

              1787. Again, there are several kinds of souls, and many of these
              do not differ to any great extent both in acting and in being
              acted upon from non-living things which act by natural instinct;
              for the parts of the
              <b>nutritive and sentient</b> soul act by natural impulse. Now
              only the rational part of the soul has dominion over its acts, and
              it is in this respect that it differs from non-living things.
              Therefore, having pointed out the difference between souls, he
              adds “and in the soul having reason,” because those principles of
              living things which are found in the <b>rational</b> part of the
              soul differ specifically from those of non-living things. Hence it
              is evident that some powers of the soul are irrational and others
              rational.

              Then the Philosopher gives the reason for the aforesaid
              difference, and it is as follows: a
              <b>science</b>, which is a rational potency, is a conception of
              the thing known existing in the mind. Now the same conception
              explains both the <b>thing and its privation</b>, although not in
              the same way, because it first makes known the existing thing and
              subsequently its privation; for example, the power of sight itself
              is known properly by means of the notion of sight, and then
              blindness is known, which is nothing but the very lack of sight in
              a thing naturally disposed to have it. Hence, if science is a
              conception of the thing known existing in the mind, the same
              science must deal with contraries—with one primarily and properly,
              and with the other secondarily; for example, the art of medicine
              is cognitive and productive primarily of health and secondarily of
              sickness, because, as has been pointed out, this art has to do
              with the conception of the thing known in the mind, and this
              conception is of one of the contraries directly and of the other
              indirectly.

              Et, quia quod philosophus supra de privatione dixerat, postmodum

              contrario et privatione. Sicut enim per negationem et ablationem
              manifestatur privatio, ut puta ablatio visus manifestat
              caecitatem; ita per negationem et ablationem manifestatur

              1791. And since the remarks which the Philosopher had made above
              about privation he afterwards transferred to
              <b>contraries</b>, he shows that the same conception applies to a
              contrary and to a privation; for just as a privation is explained
              by negation and removal (for example, the removal of sight
              explains blindness), in a similar fashion a contrary is explained
              by negation and removal; because privation, which is merely the
              removal of some attribute, is a sort of first principle among
              contraries.

                        Therefore, if it is impossible to have such arts unless
                        one has at some time learnt and acquired them, and if it
                        is impossible not to have them unless one has at some
                        time lost them (either through forgetfulness or through
                        some change or through the passage of time; for this
                        cannot occur as a result of the object being destroyed,
                        since it always exists), when one will have ceased to
                        use an art he will not have it; and yet he will be able
                        to build forthwith, thus somehow getting it back again.

                        but will not be, because things which cannot possibly be
                        would then disappear. An example would be if someone,
                        thinking that nothing is impossible, were to affirm that
                        it is possible for the diagonal of a square to be

                        impossible that a diagonal be commensurate. For to be

                        Therefore, let A be possible. And if A is possible, then
                        when A is possible, if A is assumed to exist, nothing
                        impossible follows, but B necessarily exists. But this
                        was supposed to be impossible. Therefore, let B be
                        impossible. Then if B must be impossible, A must be so.
                        But the first was supposed to be impossible; therefore
                        so also is the second. Hence, if A is possible, B will
                        be possible also, i.e., if they are so related that,
                        when A exists, B must exist. Therefore, if when A and B
                        are so related, B is not possible, then A and B will not
                        be related in the way supposed. On the other hand, if,
                        when A is possible, B must be possible, then if A
                        exists, B must exist. For to say that B must be possible
                        if A is possible, means that, if A exists both when it
                        exists and in the way in which it is possible for it to
                        exist, then B must also exist and exist in that way.

              Then he adduces arguments against the above opinion, and these
              reduce it to its absurd consequences. The first is as follows: to
              be
              <b>building</b> is to have the power or capability of building.
              Therefore, if no one has the power or capability of acting except
              when he is acting, no one is a builder except when he is building.
              And the same thing will be true of the other arts; for all arts
              are certain capabilities or potencies, as has been pointed out
              (1786). It follows, then, that no one will have an art except when
              he is exercising it.

              it would be impossible for him to have it later unless he had
              learned it or acquired it in some way, i.e., by discovery.

              per oblivionem, aut per aliquam infirmitatem, aut per longitudinem
              temporis, quo aliquis scientia non utitur. Haec enim est causa
              oblivionis. Non autem potest esse quod aliquis amittat artem
              corrupta re, sicut quandoque convenit quod vera cognitio amittitur
              mutata re; ut cum quis opinatur vere Socratem sedere, eo surgente
              perit eius vera opinio: hoc autem non potest dici circa artem. Nam
              ars non est cognitio eius quod est, sed eius quod faciendum est.
              Et ita quamdiu durat materia, ex qua ars potest aliquid facere,
              semper res artis est. Unde non potest ars amitti corrupta re nisi

              1798. The second assumption is that if someone had an
              <b>art</b>
              it would be impossible for him not to have the same art later
              <b>unless he lost it</b>
              in some way, either through forgetfulness or through some illness
              or through the passage of a long time during which the knowledge
              was not exercised; for this is the cause of forgetfulness. Now it
              cannot be that someone should lose an art as a result of the
              destruction of its object, as it sometimes happens that true
              knowledge is lost when a thing is changed; for example, when
              someone makes a true judgment that Socrates is sitting, his true
              judgment is destroyed when Socrates stands up. But this cannot be
              said about an art; for an art is not a knowledge of what exists,
              but of what is to be made; and so long as the matter from which an
              art can produce something continues to exist, the object of that
              art always exists. Hence an art cannot be lost when its object is
              destroyed, except in the ways mentioned.

              1799. Now from these two assumptions the Philosopher argues as
              follows: if a man does not have an art except when he is
              exercising it, then when he begins to exercise it he has it anew.
              Therefore he must either have learned it or acquired it in some
              other way. And similarly when he ceases to exercise an art it
              follows that he lacks that art, and thus he loses the art which he
              previously had either through forgetfulness or through some change
              or through the passage of time. But both of these are clearly
              false; and therefore it is not true that someone has a potency
              only when he is acting.

              Here he gives the second argument, which now has to do with the
              irrational principles present in non-living things, namely, hot

              which are active principles changing the senses and thus are

              non habet potentiam nisi quando agit, sequetur quod quando aliquis
              non agit, impossibile sit ipsum agere. Sed quicumque dicit aliquid
              esse aut futurum esse quod impossibile est fieri, mentitur. Et hoc
              patet ex ipsa significatione huius nominis, impossibile. Nam
              impossibile dicitur falsum quod non potest contingere. Sequitur
              igitur quod id quod non est, nullo modo possit fieri. Et ita ista
              potentia tollet motum et generationem; quia stans semper stabit,
              et sedens semper sedebit. Si enim aliquis sedet, nunquam postea
              stabit; quia dum non stat, non habet potentiam standi. Et ita non
              possibile est eum stare, et per consequens impossibile eum
              surgere. Et similiter quod non est album, impossibile erit esse
              album. Et ita non poterit dealbari. Et similiter in omnibus aliis.

              Here he gives the fourth argument, which is as follows: it is
              impossible for a thing to act which does not have the power to
              act. Therefore, if one has a potency or power only when he is
              acting, it follows that
              <u>when he is not acting it is impossible for him to act</u>. But
              whoever says that something incapable of happening either is or
              will be, is mistaken. This is evident from the meaning of the word
              impossible; for the impossible is said to be false because it
              cannot happen. It follows, then, that something which is not is
              incapable of coming to be in any way. And thus potency so
              understood will do away with motion and generation, because one
              who is standing will always stand, and one who is sitting will
              always sit. For if anyone is sitting, he will never stand
              afterwards, because so long as he is not standing he does not have
              the power to stand. Hence it is impossible for him to stand, and
              consequently it is impossible for him to get up. Similarly what is
              not white will be incapable of being white, and thus could not be
              made white. The same holds true in the case of all other things.

              He draws his intended conclusion, saying that, if the absurdities
              mentioned above cannot be admitted, it is obvious that potency and
              actuality are distinct. But those who hold the foregoing position
              make potency and actuality the same insofar as they say that
              something has potency only when it is in a state of actuality. And
              from this it is evident that they wish to remove from nature
              something of no little importance, for they eliminate motion and
              generation, as has been stated (1802). Hence, since this cannot be
              admitted, it is obvious that something is capable of being which
              yet is not, and that something is capable of not being which yet
              is. And “it is similar in the case of the other categories,” or

              is used in two senses: (1) It is used, first, in contradistinction
              to the
              <b>necessary</b>, as when we call those things possible which are
              capable either of being or not being. And when possible is taken
              in this way, the foregoing remarks do not apply. For nothing
              prevents the antecedent from being capable of being or not being,
              even though the consequent is necessary, as is clear in this
              conditional proposition, “If Socrates laughs, he is a man.”

              philosophus; dicens de possibili, quod necesse est consequens esse

              it is common both to those things which are necessary and to those
              which are capable of being or not being, according as the possible
              is distinguished from the
              <b>impossible</b>. And the Philosopher is speaking of the possible
              in this way here when he says that the consequent must be possible
              if the antecedent was possible.

              true: If A is, then B is; and let it be assumed that the
              antecedent, A, is possible. Then it is necessary that B either be
              possible or not. Now if it is necessary, then the assumption
              follows. But if it is not necessary, nothing prevents the opposite
              from being assumed, namely, that B is not possible. But this
              cannot stand; for A is assumed to be possible, and when it is
              assumed to be possible, it is at the same time assumed that
              nothing impossible follows from it; for the possible was defined
              above as that from which nothing impossible follows. But B follows
              from A, as was assumed, and B was assumed to be impossible; for to
              be impossible is the same as not to be possible. Therefore A will
              not be possible if B, which was held to be impossible, follows
              from it. Therefore let B be assumed to be impossible, and if it is
              impossible and given A, B must exist, then both the first and the
              second, namely, A and B will be impossible.

              then A and B are not related in the way supposed, namely, that B
              follows from A. But it is necessary that when A is possible B must
              be possible, if when A exists it is necessary that B exist.
              Therefore when I say “If A is, B is,” this means that B must be
              possible if A is possible, in the sense that it is possible for B
              to exist at the same time and in the way in which A is possible;
              for it is not possible that it should exist at any time and in any

              actuality the Philosopher now establishes the truth about them;
              and in regard to this he does two things. First, he shows how

              (1816), how potency, when it is prior to actuality, is brought to

              He accordingly says, first, that, since (1) some potencies are
              <b>innate</b> in the things of which they are the potencies, as
              the sensory powers in animals; and (2) some are <b>acquired</b> by
              practice, as the art of flute-playing and other operative arts of
              this kind; and some are acquired by teaching and learning, as

              potencies which we have as a result of practice and the use of
              reason must first be exercised and their acts repeated before they
              are acquired. For example, one becomes a harpist by playing the
              harp, and one becomes a physician by studying medical matters.

              In regard to the first he does three things. First, he lays down
              certain conditions required for the study of the aforesaid
              differences, and (1) one of these is that it is necessary to
              consider several qualifications in the definition of the
              <i>capable or potential</i>. For the capable does not refer to
              just anything at all but to something <b>definite</b>. Hence the
              capable must be capable of something, such as to walk or to sit.
              And similarly what can act or be acted upon cannot act or be acted
              upon at any time whatever; for example, a tree can bear fruit only
              at some definite time.

              quando sit possibile. Et similiter oportet determinare quomodo sit

              autem velociter. Et simile est de aliis circumstantiis quae

              <b>in what way</b> it is capable, for that which is capable can
              neither act nor be acted upon in every way; for example, one can
              walk in this way, namely, slowly, but not rapidly. And the same
              thing is true of the other qualifications which they are

              rational. (b) But some capabilities are <b>irrational</b>, and the

              exist only in living things, whereas irrational potencies can
              exist in both, i.e., in both living and nonliving things. And they
              exist not only in plants and in brute animals, which lack reason,

              both of acting and of being acted upon which are irrational; for

              First, he reveals the principle by which a rational potency is

              only if there is some proper principle which determines that
              common cause to produce one effect rather than the other, it

              it to one of them in order that it may proceed to act. And this
              “is appetite or
              <b>choice</b>,” i.e., the choosing of one of the two, or the
              choice which involves reason; for it is what a man intends that he
              does, although this occurs only if he is in that state in which he
              is capable of acting and the patient is present. Hence, just as an
              irrational potency which is capable of acting must act when its
              passive object comes close to it, in a similar fashion every
              rational potency must act (a) when it desires the object of which
              it has the potency, and (b) in the way in which it has it. And it
              has the power of acting when the patient is present and is so
              disposed that it can be acted upon; otherwise it could not act.

              Second, he answers an implied question. For since he had said that
              everything capable of acting as a result of a rational plan, when
              it desires something of which it is the potency, acts of necessity
              on the patient before it, someone could ask why he did not add
              this qualification, namely, “when nothing external hinders it”;
              for it has been said that it must act if it has sufficient power
              to act. But this does not occur in any and every way, but only
              when the thing having the potency is disposed in some particular
              way; and in this statement external obstacles are excluded. For
              the things which hinder it externally remove some of it desires,
              and assuming that some the qualifications laid down in the common
              definition of the capable or possible, so that it is not capable
              at this time or in this way or the like.

              Third, he instructs us to avoid the absurd conclusions which he
              first said would follow, namely, that a rational potency would
              produce contrary effects at the same time. For if it is necessary
              that a rational potency should do what it should wish either by
              reason or by sense appetite, and granted that it should wish to do
              two different or contrary things at the same time, it does not
              follow for this reason that they will do them. For they do not
              have power over contrary effects in such a way that they may do
              contrary things at the same time; but they act according to the
              way in which they have a potency, as has been explained (1816-20).

              two parts. In the first he establishes what actuality is. In the

              with the kind of potency which is found in mobile things, i.e.,
              the kind which is an active or passive principle of motion, we
              must now explain what actuality is and how it is related to
              potency; because when we will have distinguished the kinds of
              actuality, the truth about potency will become evident from this
              at the same time. For actuality is found not only in mobile things
              but also in immobile ones.

              from this that capability or potency taken in reference to action

              actually. (b) And in the same way we say that any part of a
              continuous whole is in that whole, because any part (for example,
              the middle one) is present potentially inasmuch as it is possible
              for it to be separated from the whole by dividing the whole; but
              after the whole has been divided, that part will now be present
              actually. (c) The same thing is true of one who has a science and
              is not speculating, for he is capable of speculating even though
              he is not actually doing so; but to be speculating or
              contemplating is to be in a state of actuality.

                        which will be healed by the art of medicine or by
                        chance, but there is something which is capable of being
                        healed, and this is what is potentially healthy. And the
                        intelligible expression of what comes to exist actually
                        after existing potentially as a result of intellect is
                        that it is something which when willed comes to be if no
                        external impediment hinders it. And in the other case,
                        namely, in that of the thing which gets well by itself,
                        health exists potentially when nothing within the thing
                        hinders it. The same is true of those things which are
                        potentially a house; for if there is nothing in these
                        things, i.e., in the matter, which prevents them from
                        becoming a house, and if there is nothing which must be
                        added or taken away or changed, this is potentially a
                        house. The same is true of all other things which have
                        an external principle of generation. And in the case of
                        those things which have their principle of change within
                        themselves, a thing will also be potentially any of
                        those things which it will be of itself if nothing
                        external hinders this. For example, seed is not yet
                        such, because it must be present in some other thing and
                        be changed. But when it is already such as a result of
                        its own principle, it is now this thing potentially; but
                        in the other state it needs another principle; for
                        example, earth is not yet a statue potentially, but when
                        changed it becomes bronze.

                        speaking is not a that but a “thaten”; for example, a

                        is always potentially (in an unqualified sense) the
                        thing which follows it, as a chest is not earth or

                        thing. For a universal and a subject differ in this
                        respect that a subject is a particular thing.

              First (1832), he states what he intends to do. He says that it is
              necessary to determine when a thing is in potency and when it is
              not. For it is not at just any time and when disposed in just any
              way that a thing can be said to be in potentiality even to what
              comes from it; for it could never be said that earth is
              potentially a man, since obviously it is not; but it is rather
              said to be potentially a man when the seed has already been
              generated from a preceding matter. And perhaps it never is
              potentially a man, as will be shown below.

              about without art; for while a house is not produced without art,
              health may be produced without the art of medicine through the
              operation of nature alone. And even though what comes to be by
              nature may not be fortuitous or a result of chance, since nature
              is an efficient cause in the proper sense, whereas fortune or
              chance is an efficient cause in an accidental sense, nevertheless,
              because the one who is healed by nature is healed without the
              application of any art, he is said to be healed by chance. For
              nothing prevents an effect which is not fortuitous in itself from
              being said to be fortuitous in relation to someone who does not
              consider the proper cause of such an effect.

              potentially healthy, because he becomes healthy by a single action
              of art. (2) However, in the case of those who are healed by

              but the subject to which music accrues is not called music in the
              abstract, but is called musical derivatively; and man is not
              called whiteness but white. Nor again is man called walking or
              motion in the abstract, but what walks or is moved “as a that-en,”
              i.e., what gets a name [from something else].

              Third, he compares both methods of giving names to things. He says
              that all those names which are predicated derivatively in this
              way, as the accidents mentioned, have substance as the ultimate
              subject which sustains them; but in all those cases in which the
              predicate is not derivative but is a form or a particular thing,
              such as wood or earth, in such predications the ultimate subject
              sustaining the rest is matter or material substance. And it is
              only fitting “that the term ‘that-en’ happens to be predicated”
              derivatively “of matter and the modifying attributes,” i.e.,
              accidents, both of which are indeterminate. For an accident is
              both made determinate and defined by means of its subject, and
              matter by means of that to which it is in potency. Lastly he
              summarizes his remarks, and this part is evident.

                        which the term prior is employed (457), it is evident
                        that actuality is prior to potency. And by potency I
                        mean not only that definite kind which is said to be a
                        principle of change in another thing inasmuch as it is
                        other, but in general every principle of motion or rest.
                        For nature also belongs to the same thing, since it is
                        in the same genus as potency; for it is a principle of
                        motion, although not in another thing but in something
                        inasmuch as it is the same. Therefore actuality is prior
                        to all such potency both in intelligibility and in
                        substance; and in time it is prior in one sense, and in

                        primary sense is potential because it is possible for it
                        to become actual. I mean, for example, that it is what
                        is capable of building that can build, and what is
                        capable of theorizing that can theorize, and what is

                        numerically the same as a potency is prior to it. I mean
                        that the matter and & seed and the thing capable of

                        But prior to these are other actually existing things
                        from which these have been produced; for what is actual
                        is always produced from something potential by means of

                        musician from musician; for there is always some primary
                        mover, and a mover is already something actual. And in
                        our previous discussions (598; 611) concerning substance
                        it was stated that everything which comes to be is
                        produced from something, and this is specifically the

              In regard to the first he does two things. First, he explains his
              aim, saying that, since it has been established above, in Book V
              (936), that the term prior is used in different senses, it is
              evident that actuality is prior to potency in different ways. And
              we are now speaking of potency not only inasmuch as it is a
              principle of motion in some other thing as other, as active
              potency was defined above (1776), but universally of every
              principle, whether it be a principle that causes motion or a
              principle of immobility or rest or a principle of action devoid of
              motion (e.g., understanding), because nature also seems to belong
              to the same thing as potency.

              quod potest videri, et sic est in aliis. Ergo est necessarium,
              quod ratio actus praecedat rationem potentiae, et notitia actus
              notitiam potentiae. Et propter hoc superius Aristoteles
              manifestavit potentiam definiendo per actum; actum autem non
              potuit per aliquod aliud definire, sed solum inductive

              The first is proved as follows: anything that must be used in
              defining something else is prior to it in intelligibility, as
              animal is prior to man and subject to accident. But potency or
              capability can only be defined by means of actuality, because the
              first characteristic of the capable consists in the possibility of
              its acting or being actual. For example, a builder is defined as
              one who can build, and a theorist as one who can theorize, and the
              visible as what can be seen; and the same is true in other cases.
              The concept of actuality must therefore be prior to the concept of
              potency, and the knowledge of actuality prior to the knowledge of
              potency. Hence Aristotle explained above what potency is by
              defining it in reference to actuality, but he could not define
              actuality by means of something else but only made it known
              inductively.

              <b>this man</b>
              who is now actually a man, prior to him in time there was a matter
              which was potentially a man. And similarly seed, which is
              potentially grain, was prior in time to what is actually grain.
              And “the thing capable of seeing,” i.e., having the power of
              sight, was prior in time to the thing actually seeing. And prior
              in time to the things having potential being there were certain
              things having actual being, namely,
              <b>agents</b>, by which the former have been brought to actuality.
              For what exists potentially must always be brought to actuality by
              an agent, which is an actual being. Hence what is potentially a
              man becomes actually a man as a result of the man who generates
              him, who is an
              <b>actual</b>

              actually musical by learning from a teacher who is actually
              musical. And thus in the case of anything potential there is
              always some first thing which moves it, and this mover is actual.

              becomes actually musical as a result of someone who is actually

              going on. Therefore whatever is being moved has already been
              partly moved.

              already partly come to be; for even though the process of
              producing a substance, with reference to the introduction of the
              substantial form, is indivisible, still if we take the preceding
              alteration whose terminus is generation, the process is divisible,
              and the whole process can be called a production. Therefore, since
              what is coming to be has partly come to be, then what is coming to
              be can possess to some degree the activity of the thing in which
              the production is terminated. For example, what is becoming hot
              can heat something to some degree, but not as perfectly as
              something that has already become hot. Hence, since to learn is to
              become scientific, the one learning must already have, as it were,
              some part of a science or an art. It is not absurd, then, if he
              should exercise the action of an art to some degree; for he does
              not do it as perfectly as one who already has the art.

                        effect is the use (as, for example, in the case of sight
                        the ultimate effect is the act of seeing, and no other
                        work besides this results from the power of sight),
                        still from some potencies something else is produced;
                        for example, the art of building produces a house in
                        addition to the act of building. Yet in neither case is
                        the act any less or any more the end of the potency; for
                        the act of building is in the thing being built, and it
                        comes into being and exists simultaneously with the
                        house. Therefore in those cases in which the result is
                        something other than the use, the actuality is in the
                        thing being produced; for example, the act of building
                        is in the thing being built, and the act of weaving in
                        the thing being woven. The same holds true in all other
                        cases. And in general, motion is in the thing being
                        moved. But in the case of those things in which nothing
                        else is produced besides the activity, the activity is
                        present in these, as the act of seeing is in the one
                        seeing, and the act of speculating in the one
                        speculating, and life in the soul. Accordingly,

              in perfection, because the process of generation always goes
              <u>from what is imperfect to what is perfect</u>; for example, in

              internal activity, “or external,” i.e., in reference to its

              potency or power, that one is shown to have a science; because
              activity is the goal of a science, and activity is a kind of
              actuality.

              <b>mere use</b>
              of those potencies, and not in something produced by their
              activity; for example, the ultimate goal of the power of sight is
              the act of seeing, and there is no product resulting from the
              power of sight in addition to this activity. But in the case of
              some active potencies something else is produced in addition to
              the activity; for example, the art of building also produces a
              house in addition to the activity of building.

              goal of potency to a lesser degree in the case of some of these
              potencies and to a greater degree in the case of others; for the
              activity is in the thing produced, as the act of building in the

              as its perfection and does not pass over into something external

              acting, and not of the kind which passes over into something
              external; for happiness is a good of the one who is happy, namely,
              his perfect life. Hence, just as life is in one who lives, in a

              In regard to the first he does two things. First, he proves his
              thesis. This he does by the following argument: eternal things are
              compared to corruptible ones as actuality to potency; for eternal
              things as such are not in potency, whereas corruptible things as
              such are in potency. But eternal things are
              <u>prior to corruptible ones in substance and perfection</u>; for
              this is evident (1856). Hence actuality is prior to potency both
              in substance and perfection. He says that his thesis is proved in
              a more proper way by this argument, because actuality and potency
              are not considered in the same subject but in different ones, and
              this makes the proof more evident.

              Second, he proves one assumption which he made, namely, that
              <u>nothing eternal is in potency</u>; and in regard to this he
              does two things. First, he gives an argument to prove this, and it
              runs as follows: every potency is at one and the same time a
              potency for opposite determinations. Now he does not say this
              about active potency, for it has already been shown (1789) that
              irrational potencies are not potencies for opposite
              determinations; but he is speaking here of <b>passive potency</b>,
              on the basis of which a thing is said to be capable of being and
              not being either absolutely or in a qualified sense.

              quod non est possibile esse, nunquam in aliquo est. Si enim non
              est possibile esse, impossibile est esse, et necesse est non esse.
              Sed id quod possibile est esse, contingit non esse in actu.
              Manifestum est ergo, quod illud quod possibile est esse, contingit
              esse et non esse. Et sic potentia simul contradictionis est, quia

            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              1869. Now the claim which he made he proves by an argument to the
              contrary; because where such potency does not exist, neither of
              the opposite determinations is possible; for what is incapable of
              being never exists in any way. For if a thing is incapable of
              being, it is impossible for it to be, and it is necessary for it
              not to be. But what is capable of being may possibly not be
              actual. Hence it is evident that what is capable of being may
              either be or not be; and thus the potency is at one and the same
              time a potency for opposite determinations, because the same thing
              is in potency both to being and non-being.

              1870. But what is capable of not being may possibly not be, for
              these two statements are equivalent ones. Moreover, what may
              possibly not be is corruptible either absolutely or in a qualified
              sense inasmuch as it is said to be possible for it not to be. For
              example, if it is possible for some body not to be in place, that
              body is corruptible as far as place is concerned; and the same
              applies to quantity and quality. But that is corruptible in an
              absolute sense which is capable of not existing substantially.
              Therefore it follows that everything potential inasmuch as it is

              to that place. For since motion is the actuality of something in
              potency, everything which is being moved must be in potency to the
              goal of that motion, not however as regards motion itself, but as
              regards some place to which it tends by its motion.

              Second, he draws a corollary from the above discussion. For since
              what is being moved by an eternal motion is not in potency to
              motion itself (and the motion of the heavens is eternal according
              to the discussion in Book VIII of the

              stars and the entire heaven are always active, because they are
              always being moved and are acting by means of their motion.

              1878. And for this reason too incorruptible things insofar as they
              are being moved do not tire in their activity, because “the
              potency for opposite determinations” is not found in them, namely,
              the ability to be both moved and not moved, as is found in
              corruptible things, which have these as a result of motion. And
              thus in this way continuous motion becomes laborious for them. For
              corruptible things labor insofar as they are moved; and the reason
              is that they are in a state of potency both for being moved and
              not being moved, and it is not proper to them by reason of their
              substantial nature always to be undergoing motion. Hence we see
              that the more laborious any motion is, the nearer also does the
              nature of the thing come to immobility; for example, in the case
              of animals it is evident that motion in an upward direction is
              more laborious.

              As a result of what has been said he rejects a doctrine of Plato.
              For Plato claimed that there are certain separate Forms, which he
              held to have being in the highest degree; say, a separate science,
              which he called science-in-itself; and he said that this is
              foremost in the class of knowable entities. And similarly he
              maintained that motion-in-itself is foremost in the class of
              mobile things. But according to the points made clear above,
              something else besides science-in-itself will be first in the

              to potency in perfection, and science itself is a kind of potency.
              Hence speculation, which is the activity of science, will be more
              perfect than science is; and the same will apply in the case of
              other things of this kind. Lastly he summarizes his discussion,
              saying that actuality is prior to potency and to every principle
              of motion.

                        evident from the following: all things which are spoken

                        ill, and simultaneously has both capabilities; for it is
                        the same potency that is capable of being well and being
                        ill, and of being at rest and in motion, and of building
                        and demolishing, and of being built and being

                        to belong to the same thing at the same time, for
                        example, being well and ailing. Hence one of these must
                        be good; but the potency may be both alike or neither;

                        constructions are discovered, because they are
                        discovered by dividing. For if they had already been
                        divided, they would be evident; but they are now present
                        potentially. Why, for example, are the angles of a
                        triangle equal to two right angles? Because the angles
                        grouped around one point are equal to two right angles.
                        Hence, if the line next to the one side were extended,
                        the answer would be clear to anyone seeing the
                        construction. Again, why is an angle in a semicircle
                        always a right angle? Because, if its three lines are
                        equal, two of which form the base and the other rests
                        upon the middle point of the base, the answer will be
                        evident to anyone who sees the construction and knows
                        the former proposition. Hence, it is evident that
                        constructions which exist potentially are discovered
                        when they are brought to actuality; and the reason is
                        that the intellectual comprehension of a thing is an
                        actuality. Hence the potency proceeds from an actuality,
                        and it is because people make these constructions that
                        they attain knowledge of them. For in a thing
                        numerically one and the same, actuality is subsequent in
                        the order of generation.

              Primo dicit quod in bonis, actus est melior potentia. Quod quidem
              manifestum est ex hoc, quod id quod est potentia, est idem in
              potentia existens ad contraria. Sicut quod potest convalescere,
              hoc potest infirmari, et simul est in potentia ad utrumque. Et hoc

              laborandi, et quiescendi et movendi et aliorum huiusmodi
              oppositorum. Et ita patet quod aliquid simul potest contraria,
              licet contraria non possint simul esse actu. Contrariorum igitur
              utrumque seorsum, est hoc quidem bonum, ut sanum, aliud vero

              First, he says that in the case of good things actuality is better
              than potency; and this was made clear from the fact that the
              potential is the same as what is capable of contrary
              determinations; for example, what can be well can also be ill and
              is in potency to both at the same time. The reason is that the
              potency for both is the same—for being well and ailing, and for
              being at rest and in motion, and for other opposites of this kind.
              Thus it is evident that a thing can be in potency to contrary
              determinations, although contrary determinations cannot be actual
              at the same time. Therefore, taking each contrary pair separately,
              one is good, as health, and the other evil, as illness. For in the
              case of contraries one of the two always has the character of
              something defective, and this pertains to evil.

              esse in potentia. Habet autem neutrum simpliciter, quod est esse

              1884. Therefore what is actually good is good alone. But the
              potency may be related “to both” alike, i.e., in a qualified
              sense—as being in potency. But it is neither in an absolute
              sense—as being actual. It follows, then, that actuality is better
              than potency; because what is good in an absolute sense is better
              than what is good in a qualified sense and is connected with evil.

              First, he proves his thesis by the argument introduced above; for
              what is evil in an absolute sense and is not disposed to evil in a
              qualified sense is worse than what is evil in a qualified sense
              and is disposed both to evil and to good. Hence, since the potency
              for evil is not yet evil, except in a qualified sense (and the
              same potency is disposed to good, since it is the same potency
              which is related to contrary determinations), it follows that
              actual evil is worse than the potency for evil.

              Second, he concludes from what has been said that evil itself is
              not a nature distinct from other things which are good by nature;
              for evil itself is subsequent in nature to potency, because it is
              worse and is farther removed from perfection. Hence, since a
              potency cannot be something existing apart from a thing, much less
              can evil itself be something apart from a thing.

              ut supra ostensum est, non erit in eis aliquod malum, neque

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Third, he draws another conclusion. For if evil is worse than
              potency, and there is no potency in eternal things, as has been
              shown above (1867), then
              <u

                other corruption</u

              insofar as they are eternal and incorruptible; for nothing
              prevents them from being corrupted as regards place or some other
              accident of this kind.

              He accordingly says, first (805), that “geometrical
              constructions,” i.e., geometrical descriptions, “are discovered,”
              i.e., made known by discovery in the actual drawing of the
              figures. For geometers discover the truth which they seek by
              dividing lines and surfaces. And division brings into actual
              existence the things which exist potentially; for the parts of a
              continuous whole are in the whole potentially before division
              takes place. However, if all had been divided to the extent
              necessary for discovering the truth, the conclusions which are
              being sought would then be evident. But since divisions of this

                    Let ABC be a triangle having its base AC extended
                    continuously and in a straight line. This extended base,
                    then, together with the side BC of the triangle form an
                    angle at point C, and this external angle is equal to the
                    two interior angles opposite to it, i.e., angles ABC and
                    BAC. Now it is evident that the two angles at point C, one
                    exterior to the triangle and the other interior, are equal
                    to two right angles; for it has been shown that, when one
                    straight line falls upon another straight line, it makes two
                    right angles or two angles equal to two right angles. Hence
                    it follows that the interior angle at the point C together

                    exterior angle, i.e., all three angles, are equal to two

                    that it may be demonstrated that a triangle has two right
                    angles, because the two angles which meet at the point C,

                          be an angle subtended by the base AC, which is the
                          diameter of the circle. I say, then, that angle B is a
                          right angle. This is proved as follows: since the line
                          AC is the diameter of the circle, it must pass through
                          the center. Hence it is divided in the middle at the
                          point D, and this is done by the line DB. Therefore
                          the line DB is equal to the line DA, because both are
                          drawn from the center to the circumference. In the
                          triangle DBA, then, angle B and angle A are equal,
                          because in every triangle having two equal sides the
                          angles above the base are equal. Thus the two angles A
                          and B are double the angle B alone. But the angle BDC,
                          since it is exterior to the triangle, is equal to the
                          two separate angles A and B. Therefore angle BDC is
                          double the angle B alone.

                          because the two sides DB and DC are equal since they

                          the exterior angle, ADB, is equal to both. Therefore
                          it is double the angle B alone. Hence the two angles
                          ADB and BDC are double the whole angle ABC. But the

                          The reason for this is that understanding is an

              thesis, saying that in things “this,” i.e., being true or false,
              consists merely in being combined or being separated. Hence one

              their own proper nature has an erroneous opinion—for example, one

              between the combining and separating of what exists in reality.
              Now in reality such difference is found to involve combination and
              separation, because (1) some things are
              <b>always combined</b>
              and it is impossible for them to be separated; for example,
              sentient nature is always united to the rational soul, and it is
              impossible for the latter to be separated from the former in such
              a way that the rational soul may exist without the power of
              sensation, although on the other hand a sentient soul can exist
              without reason. Again, (2) some things are
              <b>separated</b>
              and it is impossible for them to be combined, for example, black
              and white, and the form of an ass and that of a man. Again, (3)
              some things are
              <b>open to contraries</b>, because they can be combined and
              separated, as man and white and also running.

              that in the case of simple substances the thing itself and its
              quiddity are one and the same. Hence, since a simple substance is
              its own quiddity, the judgment about the knowledge of a simple

              thing’s quiddity through his intellect, and then he truly knows

              rational animal, or that a man is not a mortal rational animal,
              both would be false. (2) Second, insofar as a definition is
              composed of
              <b>parts</b>
              which are incompatible with each other; for example, if someone

              definition is said to be false in the first way because it is not
              the definition of this thing; and in the second way it is said to
              be false in itself, as the Philosopher has instructed us above in

              uno modo: scilicet si quis putet ea esse mobilia, et non semper
              esse: tunc enim decipitur in eis, sed non secundum quando. Et ideo
              dicit: si quis putet ea esse immobilia, non decipitur in eis

              Here he introduces a corollary. He says that it is evident from
              what has been said that there is no error about (~) immobile
              things as regards
              <b>time</b>. But in the case of (+) contingent things, which are
              not always so, it is possible to be in error about them as regards
              time; for example, if Socrates is going to sit down and someone
              were to judge this to be so, he could be deceived insofar as he
              might judge that Socrates is going to sit down when he is not. The
              same thing would be true if someone were to think that an eclipse
              will occur when it will not. But in the case of immobile things
              and those which always are, the above can occur only in one way,
              i.e., if someone were to think that these things are mobile and
              that they do not always exist; for he is then in error about them,
              but he would not be in error as regards time. Hence he says that,
              if someone thinks that they are immobile, he will not be deceived
              about them as regards time.

              1918. He says this, then, because, if someone assumes that they
              are immobile, he will not think that they sometimes are and
              sometimes are not, and thus he is not deceived about them as
              regards time. For example, if someone thinks that a triangle is
              unchangeable, he will not be of the opinion that the sum of its
              angles will sometimes equal two right angles and sometimes will
              not, for it would then be both changeable and unchangeable.

              1919. But in the case of immobile things it is possible to
              consider under one common aspect one thing that has such and such
              a property and another that has not; for example, it is possible
              to understand that under triangle some triangles are equilateral
              and others are not. And it is possible to ask whether no even
              number is prime, or whether some are and some are not—a prime
              number being one which the unit alone measures. Hence among even
              numbers only the number two is a prime number, but none of the
              others.

              And regarding what is numerically one, in the case of immobile
              things it is impossible to be in error or to be deceived even in
              this [taking one thing that has and another that has not a certain
              property]. For in the case of something numerically one it is
              impossible for anyone to think that one individual can be so and
              another not be so; for what is numerically one is not divided into
              many. Hence he will have to say what is true or false in an
              unqualified sense, since what is numerically one always exists in
              the same way and is incapable of being diversified either in point
              of time or of subjects. From this it is clear that truth has to do
              with actuality; for immobile things as such are always actual.
