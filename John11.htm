          <td>1471 Above, our Lord shows his life-giving power by word; here he confirms it with a miracle, by raising Lazarus from the dead. First, we see the illness of Lazarus; secondly, his being raised from the dead (v 6); and thirdly, the effect this produced (v 45). The Evangelist does three things concerning the first: first, the illness of Lazarus is mentioned; secondly, his illness is made known (v 3); thirdly, we see the reason for his illness (v 4). Concerning the first he does three things: first, he describes the person who was ill; secondly, where he was living; and thirdly, he mentions one of his relatives.

          <td>Persona aegrota est Lazarus; unde dicit <i>erat quidam languens Lazarus</i> . Per hunc fidelis signatur, qui in Deo sperat, et tamen patitur infirmitatem peccati; de qua dicitur in Ps. VI, 3: <i>miserere mei, domine, quoniam infirmus sum</i> . Lazarus enim interpretatur auxiliatus a domino, unde eum significat qui spem habet divini auxilii; Ps. CXX, 2: <i>auxilium meum a domino</i> .
          <td>1472 The one who was ill was Lazarus; <b>Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus</b> . This presents to us a believer who hopes in God, but still suffers the weakness introduced by sin, of whom we read: "Be gracious to me, O Lord, for I am languishing" (Ps 6:2). For Lazarus means "one who is helped by the Lord"; and so this name signifies one who has confidence in divine help: "My help comes from the Lord" (Ps 121:2).

Et interpretatur domus obedientiae. Per quod datur intelligi, quod si infirmus sit Deo obediens, potest ab eo de facili curari; sicut infirmus obediens medico, facilius ab eo beneficium consequitur sanitatis; IV Reg. V, 13, dixerunt servi Naaman ad eum: <i>pater, etsi rem grandem dixisset tibi propheta, facere debuisses</i> .
          <td>1473 Lazarus was at Bethany, <b>of Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha</b> . The village of Bethany was near Jerusalem, and our Lord was often a guest there, as has been said above many times. It means "a house of obedience," and leads us to understand that if one who is ill obeys God, he can easily be cured by him, just as one who is sick and obeys his doctor gains his health. In 2 Kings (5:13) the servants of Naaman said to him: "My father, if the prophet had commanded you to do some great thing, would you not have done it?"

          <td>Bethany was the home of Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus. Martha and Mary represent two ways of life, the active and the contemplative. And we can understand from the above that it is by obedience that one becomes perfect, both in the active and in the contemplative life.

          <td>Persona coniuncta erat Maria; unde dicit <i>Maria autem erat quae unxit dominum unguento</i> . Quia enim mentionem fecerat de Maria et plures mulieres huius nominis erant, ideo ne erremus ex nomine, notificat eam ex notissima actione, dicens <i>quae unxit dominum unguento, et extersit pedes eius capillis suis</i> . De hac autem Maria diversitas quaedam est inter sanctos. Quidam enim dicunt, ut Hieronymus et Origenes, quod haec Maria soror Lazari non est eadem cum illa quae peccatrix erat, de qua dicitur Lc. VII, 37, quod <i>attulit alabastrum unguenti, et stans retro secus pedes eius, lacrymis coepit rigare pedes eius, et capillis capitis sui tergebat</i> . Unde, sicut dicit Chrysostomus, haec non fuit illa meretrix quae in Luca legitur. Haec enim honesta fuit et studiosa circa susceptionem Christi: nam peccatricis illius nomen tacetur. Potuit autem Maria ista erga Christum tempore suae passionis ex devotione et speciali dilectione simile opus fecisse, quod fecit ei peccatrix illa diligens et compuncta: quod quidem factum hic ab Evangelista propter Mariae nominis magnitudinem per anticipationem recitatur.
          <td>
            1474 His relative was Mary, <b>it was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair</b> . The Evangelist describes this Mary by her most famous action so we can distinguish her from the many other women with the same name. Still, there is some disagreement among the saints about this Mary. Some, like Jerome and Origen, say that this Mary, the sister of Lazarus, is not the same as the sinner mentioned in Luke (7:37): "A woman of the city, who was a sinnerbrought an alabaster flask of ointment, and standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears, and wiped them with the hair of her head." <a href="John11.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> So, as Chrysostom says, she was not the prostitute mentioned in Luke. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> The Mary mentioned by John was an honorable woman, eager to receive Christ, while the name of the woman who was the sinner was kept secret. Furthermore, the Mary mentioned here by John could have done for Christ at the time of his passion because of her special devotion and love something similar to what was done for him by the sinner out of remorse and love. John, in order to praise her, is mentioning here, in anticipation, the action she would perform later [Jn 12:1-8].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quidam alii, sicut Augustinus et Gregorius, dicunt quod haec eadem Maria de qua hic agitur, est illa peccatrix de qua agitur Lc. VII. Et argumentum huius ex hoc verbo Augustinus assumit. Nam hic Evangelista dicit antequam Maria ungeret dominum unguento, quia illud fuit imminente passione; infra XII, 3, ubi dicitur: <i>Maria ergo sumpsit libram unguenti nardi pistici pretiosi, et unxit pedes Iesu</i> . Unde dicit quod hoc quod hic dicit Evangelista de ea factum, recitatur Lc. VII. Ambrosius autem utramque partem tenet. Secundum ergo opinionem Augustini manifestum est quod peccatrix illa de qua dicitur in Luca, est Maria ista. <i>Cuius frater Lazarus infirmabatur</i> , idest, miserandum corpus eius fornaceis febribus alendum edax incendium assumebat.
          <td>
            Others, such as Augustine and Gregory, say that this Mary, mentioned by John, is the same as the sinner mentioned by Luke. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> Augustine bases his reason on this text. For the Evangelist is speaking here of the time before Mary anointed our Lord [for the second time] at the time of the passion; as John says further on: "Mary took a pound of costly ointment of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus." So he says that what the Evangelist has mentioned here is the same event mentioned by Luke (7:37). [Ambrose maintains both sides.] <a href="John11.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title="" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> So, according to the opinion of Augustine, it is clear that the sinner mentioned by Luke is this Mary <b>whose brother Lazarus was ill</b> . [Augustine says] a consuming fever was wasting his wretched body with its furnace—like flames. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

          <td>Hic ponitur infirmitatis denuntiatio a sororibus Lazari, quae languenti aderant, et casu dolentes iuvenis aegrotantis, <i>miserunt ad eum</i> , scilicet Iesum, dicentes: <i>domine, ecce quem amas infirmatur</i> . In qua quidem denuntiatione tria consideranda occurrunt. Unum est, quod amici Dei quandoque corporaliter affliguntur: unde non est signum quod aliquis non sit amicus Dei, si aliquando corporaliter affligatur, sicut Eliphaz contra Iob falso arguit, Iob IV, 7: <i>recordare, obsecro, quis unquam innocens periit, aut quando recti deleti sunt?</i> Et ideo dicunt <i>domine, ecce quem amas infirmatur</i> ; Prov. c. III, 12: <i>quem diligit dominus corripit, et quasi pater in filio complacet sibi</i> .
          <td>1475 The sisters of Lazarus, who were taking care of him, inform Jesus of his illness. Grief-stricken at the misfortune of the ailing youth, <b>the sisters sent to him</b> , Jesus, <b>saying, Lord, he whom you love is ill</b> . This message brings to mind three things for consideration. First, we see that the friends of God are sometimes afflicted with bodily illness; thus, if someone has a bodily illness, this is not a sign that the person is not a friend of God. Eliphaz mistakenly argued against Job that it was: "Think now, who that was innocent every perished? Or where were the upright cut off?" (Job 4:7). Accordingly, they say, <b>Lord, he whom you love is ill</b> : "For the Lord reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights" (Prv 3:12).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum est quod non dicunt domine veni, sana eum sed tantum infirmitatem exponentes, dicunt <i>infirmatur</i> . In quo signatur quod sufficit amico tantum necessitatem exponere, absque alicuius petitionis additamento. Nam amicus cum velit bonum amici sicut bonum suum, sicut sollicitus est ad repellendum malum suum, ita et ad repellendum malum amici sui. Et hoc maxime verum est de eo qui verissime diligit; Ps. CXLIV, v. 20: <i>custodit dominus diligentes se</i> .
          <td>The second thing to note is that his sisters do not say, "Lord, come and heal him," but simply to mention his sickness, he <b>is ill</b> . This indicates that it is enough merely to state one's need to a friend, without adding a request. For a friend, since he wills the good of his friend as his own good, is just as interested in warding off harm from his friends as he is in warding it off from himself. And this is especially true of the one who most truly loves: "The Lord preserves all who love him" (Ps 145:20).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium est quod istae duae sorores desiderantes curationem fratris languidi, non venerunt personaliter ad Christum, sicut paralyticus, Lc. V, 18, et centurio, Matth. VIII, v. 5: et hoc propter confidentiam quam habebant ad Christum ex speciali dilectione et familiaritate quam Christus erga eas ostenderat: et forte a luctu detinebantur, ut Chrysostomus dicit; Eccli. VI, 11: <i>amicus si permanserit fixus, erit tibi coaequalis, et in domesticis tuis fiducialiter aget</i> .
          <td>The third thing to consider is that these two sisters, who wanted the cure of their sick brother, did not come in person to Christ, as did the paralytic (Lk 5:18), and the centurion (Matt 8:5). This was because of the confidence they had in Christ due to the special love and friendship which he had shown for them; or, perhaps it was their grief that kept them away: "A friend, if he is steadfast, will be to you as yourself" [Sir 6:11].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur praemissorum ratio, et primo ratio ipsius infirmitatis; secundo quare sorores eius non venerunt ad Christum, secundum Augustinum, ibi <i>diligebat autem Iesus Martham, et sororem eius Mariam, et Lazarum</i> .
          <td>
            1476 Now we have the reasons for the foregoing: first, the illness of Lazarus; secondly, the reason why, according to Augustine, his sisters did not come in person to Christ (v 5). <a href="John11.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title="" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ratio autem infirmitatis est glorificatio filii Dei; unde dicit <i>dixit eis Iesus: infirmitas haec non est ad mortem, sed pro gloria Dei</i> . Ubi sciendum est, quod infirmitatum corporalium quaedam sunt ad mortem, quaedam autem non. Illae autem sunt ad mortem quae ad aliquod aliud non ordinantur. Nam omnia mala poenae ex divina providentia infliguntur; Amos III, 6: <i>si est malum in civitate quod dominus non faciat</i> . Mali vero culpae Deus ultor est, non tamen auctor. Omnia autem quae a Deo sunt, ordinata sunt; et ideo omnia mala poenae ad aliquid ordinantur: quaedam ad mortem, quaedam ad aliquid aliud. Haec autem infirmitas non est ordinata ad mortem, sed ad gloriam Dei.
          <td>1477 The reason for the illness of Lazarus is the glorification of the Son of God; thus the Evangelist says, <b>when Jesus heard it he said, This illness is not unto death; it is for the glory of God</b> . Here we should note that some physical illness is unto death and some is not. Those are unto death which are not ordained to something else. Further, every evil of punishment is inflicted by divine providence: "Does evil befall a city, unless the Lord has done it?" (Amos 3:6). But as for the evil of fault, God is not the author, but the punisher. Now all things that are from God are ordered. Consequently, every evil of punishment is ordered to something: some to death, and some to something else. This illness was not ordered to death, but to the glory of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed numquid non fuit mortuus Lazarus ex hac infirmitate? Videtur quod sic. Alias non foeteret quatriduanus in monumento, nec resuscitatio fuisset miraculosa. Responsio. Dicendum quod infirmitas haec non fuit ordinata ad mortem ut ad finem ultimum, sed propter aliud, ut dictum est: ut scilicet ipse qui resuscitatus fuit, quasi castigatus, iuste viveret ad Dei gloriam, et populus Iudaeus videns miraculum, converteretur ad fidem; Ps. CXVII, 18: <i>castigans castigavit me dominus, et morti non tradidit me</i> . Unde sequitur <i>sed pro gloria Dei, ut glorificetur filius Dei per eam</i> .
          <td>1478 But Lazarus did die! Yes, otherwise he would not have had the odor of one four days in the tomb, nor would his raising have been a miracle. I answer that his illness was not ordained to death as a final end, but to something else, as has been said, that is, that he who was raised, chastened as it were, might live a holy life for the glory of God, and that the Jewish people who saw this miracle might be converted to the faith: "The Lord has chastened me sorely but he has not given me over to death" (Ps 118:18). Thus he adds, <b>it is for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it.</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ubi, secundum Chrysostomum, ly <i>pro</i> et ly <i>ut</i> non tenentur causaliter, sed consecutive. Non enim ideo infirmatus est ut ex hoc Deus glorificaretur; sed aliunde quidem infirmitas haec venit, et ex ea consecutum est hoc, ut glorificaretur filius Dei, inquantum eum resuscitando usus est ea ad gloriam Dei.
          <td>
            In this passage, according to Chrysostom, the words "for" and "that" do not indicate the reason for the events, but their sequence. For Lazarus was not made ill so that from it God might be glorified; rather, his illness came from some other cause, and from it the fact followed that the Son of God would be glorified insofar as Christ used it for the glory of God by raising Lazarus. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hoc autem uno quidem modo veritatem habet, sed alio modo non. Potest enim infirmitatis Lazari duplex causa considerari. Una naturalis; et secundum hanc verificatur dictum Chrysostomi, quia infirmitas Lazari secundum causam naturalem non ordinabatur ad resuscitationem. Alia causa potest considerari divina providentia; et tunc non habet veritatem dictum Chrysostomi, nam ex divina providentia huiusmodi infirmitas ordinabatur ad gloriam Dei. Et secundum hoc ly <i>pro</i> et ly <i>ut</i> tenentur causaliter; quasi dicat <i>sed pro gloria Dei</i> : quia, licet ad hoc non ordinaretur ex intentione causae naturalis, ordinabatur tamen ex intentione divinae providentiae ad gloriam Dei, inquantum facto miraculo crederent homines in Christum, et vitarent veram mortem. Unde dicit <i>ut glorificetur filius Dei per eam</i> .
          <td>This is true in one way, but not in another. It is possible to consider two reasons for Lazarus' illness. One is the natural cause, and from this point of view the statement of Chrysostom is true, because Lazarus' illness, considering its natural causes, was not ordained to his rising from the dead. But we can consider another reason, and this is divine providence; and then Chrysostom's statement is not true. For under divine providence an illness of this kind was ordained to the glory of God. And so according to this, the "for" and the "that" do indicate the reason. It is the same as saying: <b>it is for the glory of God</b> , because although it was not ordained to this from the intent of its natural cause, yet from the intent of divine providence it was ordained to the glory of God, insofar as, once the miracle had been performed, people would believe in Christ and escape real death. So he says, <b>so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it</b> .
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic manifeste dominus filium Dei se nominat: nam ipse glorificandus erat in resuscitatione Lazari, quia ipse est verus Deus; I Io. ult., 20: <i>ut simus in vero filio eius</i> ; supra IX, 3: <i>neque hic peccavit neque parentes eius; sed ut manifestentur opera Dei in illo</i> .
          <td>Here our Lord clearly calls himself the Son of God: for he was to be glorified in the resurrection of Lazarus because he is true God: "that we may be in his true Son" [1 Jn 5:20]; "It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be made manifest in him" (9:3).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic, secundum Augustinum, Evangelista assignat rationem quare duae sorores non venerunt ad Christum: quae scilicet sumitur ex confidentia specialis dilectionis, unde dicit <i>diligebat autem Iesus Martham, et Mariam sororem eius, et Lazarum</i> . Quippe qui tristium consolator erat, sorores tristes diligebat; et qui languentium salvator erat, languidum et mortuum Lazarum diligebat; Deut. XXXIII, 3: <i>dilexit populos: omnes sancti in manu illius sunt</i> .
          <td>
            1479 Here, according to Augustine, the Evangelist gives the reason why Lazarus' two sisters did not come to Christ, and it was due to their confidence in him because of the special love he had for them; so the Evangelist remarks, <b>now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus</b> . <a href="John11.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Indeed, he who is the Consoler of the sorrowful loved the sorrowing sisters, and he who was the Savior of the weary loved the weary and dead Lazarus: "Yea, he loved his people; all those consecrated to him were in his hand" (Deut 33:3).

First, we see that Christ desired to do this; and secondly, the sequence of events surrounding the raising are given (v 17). We see three things related to the first. First, our Lord allows the death; secondly, he states his intention to go to the place where Lazarus died (v 7); and thirdly, he reveals his intention to raise him (v 11).

Dedit autem locum morti per tot dies, propter duo. Primo quidem ne ex praesentia eius mors Lazari impedita fuisset: nam ubi vita praesens est, mors locum non habet.

          <td>1481 Christ allowed this death by prolonging his stay beyond the Jordan: <b>so when he heard that he was ill, he stayed two days longer in the place where he was</b> . One may infer from this that Lazarus died on the very day that Jesus received the message from his sisters: for when Christ went to the place where he died, it was already the fourth day. After receiving the message, Christ then remained two days in the same place, and on the day after these two days, he went to Judea. He delayed these few days for two reasons. First, so that the death of Lazarus would not be prevented by his presence; for where life is present, death has no entry. In the second place, in order to make the miracle more credible, and so that people would not say that Christ revived Lazarus, not from death, but only from a coma.

            1483 With respect to the first the Evangelist says, <b>Then after this</b> , the prolonged delay, <b>he said</b> , Jesus did, <b>to the disciples, Let us go into Judea again</b> . One might ask here why Christ made a point of mentioning to the apostles that he was about to go into Judea again, since he had not done this on other occasions. The reason for this was that the Jews had just recently persecuted Christ in Judea and had almost stoned him; indeed, that is why he had left. So it was to be expected that when Christ wanted to go there again, the disciples would become fearful. And because "Darts that are foreseen do not strike and foreseen evils are more easily borne," <a href="John11.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> as Gregory says, our Lord mentioned his planned journey to them to calm their fears. As to the mystical sense, we can understand by the fact that Christ is returning once again to Judea, that he will return again at the end of the world to the Jews, who will be converted to Christ: "A hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles come in" (Rom 11:25).

Yet their fear was unreasonable, because the disciples had God with them as their protector, and one who is with God should not fear: "Let us stand up together. Who is my adversary?"

So, although they would have stoned me before, they would not want to do this at another hour: "For everything there is a season" (Eccl 3:1); "Every matter has its time and way" (Eccl 8:6). <a href="John11.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>

Similiter si loquitur de die artificiali, falsum est quod dicit: quia hoc non est verum nisi in aequinoctiali, quia non omnes dies artificiales habent duodecim horas. Sed ad hoc dicendum, quod intelligendum est de die artificiali: quia omnes dies artificiales habent duodecim horas. Nam horae huiusmodi dierum distinguuntur dupliciter. Quaedam enim sunt aequales, et quaedam sunt inaequales. Aequales autem distinguuntur secundum circulum aequinoctialis: et secundum hoc non omnes dies habent duodecim horas sed aliqui plures, aliqui pauciores; nisi tantum in aequinoctio. Inaequales autem distinguuntur secundum ascensiones zodiaci propter eius obliquitatem: quia non aequaliter ascendit zodiacus in omnibus partibus suis; aequinoctialis autem aequaliter: et de istis horis inaequalibus quilibet dies artificialis habet duodecim horas; quia quolibet die ascendunt sex signa de die, et sex de nocte; sed illa quae ascendunt in aestate, sunt tardioris motus quam illa quae ascendunt in hieme; ascensus autem cuiuslibet signi facit duas horas.
          <td>1487 A literal question arises because he is speaking here either of the natural or of the artificial day. If he is speaking of the natural day, then what he says is false: because the natural day does not have twelve but twenty-four hours. Again, if he is speaking of the artificial day, his statement is false: because it is true only at the equinox, for not all artificial days have twelve hours. I answer that we should understand this to refer to the artificial day, because all artificial days have twelve hours. For the hours of such days are distinguished in two ways. Some are equal in length and some are not. Those equal in length are distinguished according to the circle of the equator: and according to this not all days have twelve hours, but some have more and some less, except at the equator. The hour not equal in length are more distinguished according to the ascensions of the zodiac on account of its obliquity: because the zodiac does not ascend equally in all its parts, but at the equator equally. Now each artificial day has twelve of these unequal hours, because every day has six signs which ascend during the day, and six at night; but those which ascend in summer have a slower motion than those which ascend in winter, and of course the ascent of each sign makes up two hours.

Thus, when the Jews wanted to arrest Christ, he said to the crowd: "If you seek me, let these men go. This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken, 'Of those whom you gavest me I lost not one'" (18:8). <b>But if any one walks in the night</b> , that is, in the time after the passion, you should be afraid to go into Judea, because you will suffer persecution from the Jews: "Strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered."

          <td>
            1491 Augustine explains it another way, so that the "day" indicates Christ: "We must work the works of him who sent me, while it is day" (9:4), and "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world" (9:5). <a href="John11.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> The twelve hours of this day are the twelve apostles: "Did I not choose you, the twelve?" (6:71). But what should we say of what follows: "And one of you is a devil?" Judas, therefore, was not an hour of this day because he gave no light. We should say that our Lord spoke these words [about the twelve] not in reference to Judas, but to his successor, who was Matthias. Thus, the sense of <b>Are there not twelve hours in the day?</b> is as though he were saying: You are the hours, I am the day. Just as the hours follow the day, so you must follow me. So, if I wish to go to Judea you ought not to precede me or change my will, but you should follow me. He said something similar to Peter: "Get behind me, Satan!" (Matt 16:23), i.e., do not go ahead of me, but follow me by imitating my will. <b>If any one walks in the day</b> is the same as saying: You should not fear any danger, because you are going with me who am the day. So just as one who walks in the day does not run into anything, that is, <b>does not stumble</b> , so also you who walk with me: "If God is for us, who is against us?" (Rom 8:31). And this is <b>because he sees the light of this world</b> in me. <b>But if any one walks in the night</b> , in the darkness of ignorance and sin, then <b>he stumbles</b> ; and this is <b>because the</b> spiritual <b>light is not in him</b> , not because of a defect in the light, but because of his own rebellion: "There are those who rebel against the light" (Job 24:13).

Sometimes it refers to a natural sleep: "So Samuel went and lay down [slept] in his place" (1 Sam 3:9); and "You shall sleep securely" [Job 11:18]. Sometimes it indicates the sleep of death: "We would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope" (1 Thess 4:13). Sometimes it is understood as some kind of negligence: "Behold, he who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep" (Ps 121:4). And sometimes it means the sleep of sin: "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead" (Eph 5:14). Again, it can mean the repose of contemplation: "I slept, but my heart was awake" (Song 5:2). It can also signify the rest of future glory: "In peace I will both lie down and sleep" (Ps 4:8).

          <td>Uno modo sic.

IV, 13: <i>omnia nuda et aperta sunt oculis eius</i> . Nec mirum, quia ipse est omnibus praesens; Ier. c. XXIII, 24: <i>caelum et terram ego impleo.

          <td>The first way is this. We have heard that Lazarus was sick. And although I was not there I have told you that he has died <b>and for your sake I am glad</b> , i.e., because it is for your benefit, so that you may experience my divinity, because even though I was not there I saw all this: "All are open and laid bare to the eyes of him with whom we have do to" (Heb 4:13). This is not surprising, because the divinity is present to all things: "Do I not fill heaven and earth?" (Jer 23:24). So that you may believe not as though they were to believe for the first time, but in order that they might believe more firmly and more strongly, in the sense of "I believe; help my unbelief" (Mk 9:23).

          <td>Hic ponitur discipulorum affectus: quod potest quidem dupliciter exponi. Uno modo ut importet affectum dubitantis; alio modo ut importet affectum diligentis. Et primo modo exponitur a Chrysostomo. Nam, ut supra dictum est, omnes discipuli timebant Iudaeos, et super alios Thomas. Nam ante passionem infirmior erat aliis, et infidelior; qui tamen postea fortior factus est, et irreprehensibilis, qui solus orbem terrarum percurrit. Unde ex hac dubietate dicit ad condiscipulos <i>eamus et nos, et moriamur cum illo</i> , quasi dicat: iste non timet mortem, penitus vult ire, se et nos volens tradere morti.
          <td>
            1504 Now the attitude of the disciples is given, and this can be interpreted in two ways; in one way as indicating a lack of confidence; and in the other as indicating love. Chrysostom interprets it in the first way. As was mentioned above, all the disciples feared the Jews, but especially Thomas. Indeed, before the passion he was weaker than the others and had less faith, but after he became stronger and was beyond reproach, traveling the whole world alone. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> So, because of this lack of confidence he says to his fellow disciples, <b>Let us also go, that we may die with him</b> . This was like saying: He does not fear death; he fully wants to go, willing to deliver both himself and us over to death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo modo exponit Augustinus. Thomas enim et alii discipuli ita Christum amabant ut vel cum eo praesente vivere, vel cum eo mori vellent, ne post mortem deserti iterum inconsolati remanerent. Unde ex hoc affectu Thomas dicit ad condiscipulos <i>eamus et nos, et moriamur cum eo</i> , quasi dicat: ire vult, periculum mortis ei imminet: numquid et nos remanebimus ut vivamus? Absit. Sed <i>eamus, et moriamur cum illo</i> ; Rom. VIII, 17: <i>si compatimur, et conregnabimus</i> ; II Cor. V, v. 14: <i>si unus pro omnibus mortuus est, ergo omnes mortui sunt</i> .
          <td>
            Augustine interprets it in the second way. For Thomas and the other disciples loved Christ so much that they wanted either to live with him while he was here, or die with him, so that they would not find themselves again without consolation if he left them alone by dying. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a> It was with this feeling that Thomas said to his fellow disciples, <b>Let us also go, that we may die with him</b> . He was saying: He wants to go, and is in danger of death. Shall we stay here to live? No. <b>Let us also go, that we may die with him</b> : "If we suffer with him, we shall reign with him" [Rom 8:17]; "One has died for all; therefore all have died" (2 Cor 5:14).

The other three days refer to death by actual sin: for every mortal sin is called a death: "Evil shall slay the wicked" (Ps 34:21). These days are differentiated according to which law is transgressed.

          <td>Thus the second day indicates the transgression of the law of nature: "They have transgressed the lawsbroken the everlasting covenant," that is, the law of nature (Is 24:5). The third day signifies the transgression of the written law: "Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you keeps the law" (7:19). The fourth day represents the transgression of the Law of the Gospel and of grace; and this is more serious than the others: "A man who has violated the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. How much worse punishment do you think will be deserved by the man who has spurned the Son of God, and profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and outraged the Spirit of grace?"

Their presence was facilitated due to the fact that the deceased was near Jerusalem; the Evangelist says, <b>Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles [fifteen stadia] off</b> .

Thus we may understand that those who are in the state of obedience are near the peace of eternal life: "My sheep hear my voiceand I give them eternal life" (10:27). He says <b>fifteen stadia</b> , because anyone who wishes to go from Bethany, i.e., the state of obedience, to the heavenly Jerusalem, must pass through fifteen stadia. The first seven belong to the observance of the Old Law, for the number seven pertains to the Old Law, which keeps the seventh day holy. The other eight belong to the fulfilling of the New Testament, for the number eight refers to the New Testament because of the octave of the resurrection.

Ratio autem quare Martha primo audivit, et sola occurrit, est quia Martha sollicita erat; unde dominus dicit, Lc. X, 41: <i>Martha, Martha, sollicita es, et turbaris erga plurima</i> : et ideo occupata circa dispositionem negotiorum discurrebat per domum, et nuntianti facilius occurrit.

            1510 We are told that Martha immediately went to meet Jesus, <b>when Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him</b> without delay. The Evangelist says, <b>was coming</b> , perhaps because when Christ was drawing near someone went ahead and told Martha that Jesus was on his way; and when she heard this, she at once ran to meet him. The reason why Martha was the first to hear about this and hurry out alone was due to her anxiety; thus our Lord says in Luke (10:41), "Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things." And so, since she was occupied with every detail, she was constantly coming and going and was more likely to meet the messengers. But Mary sat with those who had come from Jerusalem, and the news would not have reached her as soon. Chrysostom thinks that Martha did not tell Mary about this at once because Mary was with the Jews, and Martha knew that they were persecuting Christ and had already planned his death. So, she was afraid that if she told her, and Mary also came to meet Christ, they too would have come with her. For this reason she preferred not to tell her. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a>

            But if the Jews were conspiring against Christ, why were they there with Lazarus and his sisters, who were intimate friends of Christ, and like his disciples?

Ad praeteritum quidem respicit quod dicit <i>domine, si fuisses hic, frater meus non fuisset mortuus</i> : credebat enim quod praesente Christo mors locum non haberet, cum vidisset mulierem ad solum tactum fimbriae Iesu sanatam, Matth. IX, 20. Et quidem rationabiliter movebatur, nam vita contrariatur morti; Christus autem vita est, et lignum vitae; Prov. III, 18: <i>lignum vitae est his qui apprehenderint eam</i> .

Nihilominus tamen imperfectam habebat fidem, aestimans Christum minus posse absentem quam praesentem; unde dicebat <i>domine, si fuisses hic, frater meus non fuisset mortuus</i> : quod quidem de virtute limitata et creata dici potest; sed de virtute infinita et increata, quae Deus est, non est dicendum, quia aequaliter se habet ad praesentia et absentia, immo sibi omnia sunt praesentia; Ier. XXIII, 23: <i>putasne Deus e vicino ego sum?</i> et cetera.
          <td>1511 Martha is shown to have an extraordinary devotion; <b>Martha said to Jesus, Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died</b> . Here she reverently mentions two things to Christ: one of these look to the past, and the other to the future. She looks to the past when she says, <b>Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died</b> : for she believed that there would be no place for death when the Lord was present, since she had seen the woman healed by merely touching the fringe of Jesus' garment (Matt 9:20). This was reasonable, for life is contrary to death; but Christ is life and the tree of life: "She [wisdom] is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her" (Prv 3:18). So if the tree of life could preserve one from death, much more could Christ. However, her faith was as yet imperfect, for she thought that Christ had less power when he was absent than when he was present. Thus she said, <b>Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died</b> . Of course, this can be said of a limited and created power, but it should not be said of the infinite and uncreated power which is God, because God is equally related to things both present and absent; indeed, all things are present to him: "Am I a God at hand, says the Lord, and not a God afar off?" (Jer 23:23).

          <td>She looks to the future when she adds, <b>and even now I know that whatever you ask from God, God will give you</b> . In saying this she spoke the partial truth - for it belonged to Christ as having a human nature to petition God; thus we read that he often prayed, and above it is said, "If any one is a worshipper of God and does his will, God listens to him" (9:31). Yet it was less than the whole truth; for by saying this she seemed to be thinking of Christ as a saintly man who could by his prayer revive one already dead, just as Elisha by his prayer raised one who was dead.

First, he foretells the resurrection of her brother; secondly, he shows that he has the power to resurrect (v 25). Concerning the first, he does two things. First, he foretells the coming miracle; secondly, we see Martha's understanding of the resurrection (v 24).

VII, v. 12 s., et Lazarum quatuor dies habentem in monumento. Sed puellam quidem in domo, iuvenem extra portam, Lazarum in monumento. Item puellam paucis arbitris secum habens, patrem videlicet, et matrem puellae, et tres ex discipulis suis, Petrum scilicet, Iacobum et Ioannem; iuvenem vero magna turba praesente; sed Lazarum assistente multitudine, et cum gemitu. Nam per hos tres suscitatos tria genera peccatorum intelliguntur. Quidam enim peccant per consensum peccati mortalis in corde; et isti signantur per puellam mortuam in domo. Alii vero sunt qui per exteriora signa et actus peccant; et signantur per mortuum qui effertur extra portam. Sed quando per consuetudinem in peccato firmantur, tunc clauduntur in monumento. Et tamen dominus omnes resuscitat. Sed illi qui per consensum solum peccant, et mortaliter peccando moriuntur, facilius suscitantur. Et quia secretum est, ideo secreta emendatione curatur. Quando autem peccatum procedit extra, tunc publico indiget remedio.
          <td>1513 The miracle our Lord foretold is the raising of Lazarus; thus he says, <b>Your brother will rise again</b> : "Thy dead shall live, their bodies shall rise" (Is 26:19). We should note here that Christ raised three persons from death: the daughter of the ruler of the synagogue (Matt 9:25); the widow's son, who was being carried outside the gate of the city (Lk 7:12); and Lazarus, who had been four days in the tomb. The girl was still in her home, the youth was outside the gate, and Lazarus was in the tomb. He raised the girl in the presence of only a few witnesses: the girl's father and mother, and the three disciples, Peter, James, and John. He raised the young man in the presence of a large group. And Lazarus was raised with a number of people standing by, and when Christ was deeply affected. These three persons represent three kinds or genera of sins. Some sin by consenting in their hearts to mortal sin; and these are signified by the girl who was dead in her own home. Others sin by outside signs and acts, and these are signified by the dead youth who was being carried outside the city gate. Finally, those who are firmly habituated to sin are buried in the tomb. Yet, our Lord raises all of them. But those who sin only by consent, and die by sinning mortally, are more easily raised. And because their sin is private, it is healed with a private corrective. When sin advances without, it needs public remedy.

He is saying: The entire fact that everyone will rise in their souls and in their bodies will be due to me: "For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead" (1 Cor 15:21).

Referring to this he says, <b>he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live</b> . The reason for this is that I am the cause of the resurrection, and the effect of this cause is obtained by believing in me. He says, <b>he who believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live</b> , because by believing he has me within himself - "that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith" (Eph 3:17). And one who has me, has the cause of the resurrection. <b>Therefore, he who believes in me shall live.</b> We saw before (5:25) that some will rise through faith: "the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live," with a spiritual life, by rising from the death of sin, and they will also live with a natural life by rising from the penalty of [physical] death.

But they will have eternal life: "For this is the will of my Father, that every one who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life" (6:40). This should not be understood to mean that one will not physically die; he will die, but he will be raised up in a soul to a never-ending life, and his flesh will rise and he will never die again.

Inunguntur autem reges et sacerdotes: est ergo Christus rex et sacerdos. Unde Angelus Lc. II, 11: <i>natus est nobis hodie salvator, qui est Christus dominus</i> . Et vere ipse est singulariter Christus, quia alii unguntur oleo visibili, iste vero oleo invisibili, scilicet spiritu sancto, et ceteris aliis abundantius; Ps. c.

She professes his dignity, both royal and priestly, when she says, <b>you are the Christ</b> . Now "Christ" means "anointed." And kings and priests are anointed. Consequently, Christ is king and priest. So the angel said: "To you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is Christ the Lord" (Lk 2:11). Furthermore, he is a "Christ" in a unique way, for others are anointed with a visible oil, but he is anointed with an invisible oil, that is, with the Holy Spirit, and more abundantly than others: "God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness above your fellows" (Ps 45:7). Indeed, he was anointed above his fellows "for it is not by measure that he gives the Spirit" (3:34).

          <td>1522 Mary was called by Martha, who had been consoled and instructed by Christ, as she did not want her sister to miss such consolation. <b>When she had said this</b> , the previous words, to the Lord, <b>she went and called her sister Mary, saying quietly, The Teacher is here and is calling for you</b> . She called her sister quietly: "The words of the wise heard in quiet" (Eccl 9:17). She did this because a number of Jews were with her sister, as has been said; and perhaps there were some among them who did not like Jesus, or would have left, or who, if they had heard what Martha said, would not have followed her. As for the mystical sense, we may understand that one more efficaciously calls upon Christ in quiet or in private: "In quietness and in trust shall be your strength" (Is 30:15).

It is clear from this that Martha would not have arrived before Mary if Mary had been immediately told of Jesus' coming. Further, this furnishes us with the example that we are not to delay when called to Christ: "Do not delay to turn to the Lord, nor postpone it from day to day" (Sir 5:7); "I will hear him as a teacher" [Is 50:4].

The Evangelist mentions this so that we do not think that Mary's trip was unnecessary, for Christ could have reached her village just as quickly as Martha did. But Christ remained where he was so as not to appear to be thrusting himself into a miracle. Yet once he is asked and prompted, he does perform a miracle, once they realize that Lazarus is dead, and so the miracle cannot be denied. We can also understand from this that when we wish to have the advantage of Christ we should go to meet him, and not wait until he accommodates himself to us; rather, we should accommodate ourselves to him: "They shall turn to you, but you shall not turn to them" (Jer 15:19).

They thought that her action was inspired by her grief, since they had not heard what Martha had said to her. This was a commendable thing for the Jews to do, for as Sirach (7:34) says: "Do not fail those who weep." Still, that they did follow Mary was an effect of divine providence, and it was, as Augustine says, so that with all these present when Lazarus was raised, this great miracle of raising one who had been dead for four days would have many witnesses. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a>

And so in his actions we find almost everywhere that the divine is mingled with the human, and the human with the divine. And if at times something human is mentioned about Christ, something divine is immediately added. Indeed, we read of no weakness of Christ greater than his passion; yet as he hangs on the cross divine events are manifested: the sun is obscured, rocks are rent, the bodies of the saints that had been asleep arise. Even at his birth, as he lay in the manger, a star shines in the heavens, the angels sing his praises, and the Magi and kings offer gifts. We have a similar situation here: for Christ experiences a certain weakness in his human affections, becoming disturbed over the death of Lazarus. We read, <b>he was deeply moved in spirit and troubled himself</b> .

Thus the Evangelist says that <b>he was deeply moved in spirit</b> , that is, observing the judgment of reason. In the Scriptures the spirit is also called the mind or reason, as in Ephesians (4:23): "Be renewed in the spirit of your minds." Sometimes these emotions of the sensitive part are neither evoked by the spirit, nor preserve the moderation of reason; rather, they go against it. But this did not happen in Christ because he was deeply moved in spirit.

Duo autem hic suberant: unum de quo Christus turbabatur, quod erat mors homini inflicta propter peccatum; aliud autem de quo indignabatur, erat saevitia mortis et Diaboli. Unde, sicut quando aliquis vult repellere hostem, dolet de malis illatis ab ipso, et indignatur ad animadvertendum in eum, ita et Christus doluit et indignatus est.
          <td>But what does it indicate to say that he was deeply moved in spirit ( <i>fremuit spiritu</i> )? It seems that it indicates anger: "A king's wrath is like the growling ( <i>fremitus</i> ) of a lion" (Prv 19:12). It also seems to indicate indignation or resentment, according to Psalm 112 (v 10): "He gnashes ( <i>fremet</i> ) his teeth and melts away." I answer that Christ's being deeply moved indicates a certain anger and resentment of the heart. For all anger and resentment are caused by some kind of pain and sadness. Now there are two things involved here: the one about which Christ was troubled was death, which was inflicted upon the human race on account of sin; the other, which he resented, was the cruelty of death and of the devil. Thus, just as when one wants to repel an enemy he is saddened by the evils inflicted by him, and indignant at the very though of him, so too Christ was saddened and indignant.

Aliquando insurgunt ex aliqua causa bona, non tamen ratione moderantur: et propter hoc dicit <i>infremuit spiritu</i> .

          <td>1535 There was power here because Christ troubled himself by his own command. Sometimes such emotions arise for an inappropriate reason, as when a person rejoices over something evil, or is saddened over what is good: like they "who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil" (Prv 2:14). But this was not the case with Christ; thus he says, <b>When Jesus saw her weepinghe troubled himself</b> . And sometimes such emotions arise for a good reason, but are not moderated by reason. So he says, <b>he was deeply moved in spirit</b> . Further, although these emotions are moderated, they sometimes spring up before the judgment of reason, as when they are sudden. This was not the case with Christ either, because every movement of his sensitive appetite was according to the control and command of reason.

Secundo ut dum tristatur et cohibet seipsum, doceat modum servandum esse in tristitiis. Stoici enim dixerunt quod nullus sapiens tristatur. Sed valde inhumanum esse videtur quod aliquis de morte alicuius non tristetur. Aliqui autem sunt qui in tristitiis de malo amicorum, nimis excedunt. Sed dominus tristari voluit, ut significet tibi quod aliquando debeas contristari, quod est contra Stoicos: et modum in tristitia tenuit, quod est contra secundos. Unde apostolus I Thess. IV, 12: <i>nolumus vos ignorare de dormientibus, ut non contristemini sicut ceteri qui spem non habent</i> ; Eccli. XXII, 10: <i>super mortuum plora, quia deficit lux eius</i> , et postea subdit: <i>modicum plora supra mortuum, quoniam requievit</i> . Tertia ratio est ut insinuet quod nos pro mortuis corporaliter tristari et plorare debemus: secundum illud Ps. XXXVII, 9: <i>afflictus sum, et humiliatus sum nimis</i> .
          <td>
            But how does this agree with the statement of Isaiah [42:4]: "He will not be sad nor troubled"? I answer that this refers to a sadness which precedes the judgment of reason and is immoderate. Christ willed to be troubled and to feel sadness for three reasons. First, to show the condition and the truth of his human nature. Secondly, so that by controlling his own sadness, he might teach us to moderate our own sadness. The Stoics had taught that a wise man is never sad. But it seems very inhuman not to be sad at the death of another. However, there are some who become excessively sad over the evils which afflict their friends. Now our Lord willed to be sad in order to teach us that there are times when we should be sad, which is contrary to the opinion of the Stoics; and he preserved a certain moderation in his sadness, which is contrary to the excessively sad type. Thus the Apostle says: "But we would not have you ignorant, brethren, concerning those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope" (1 Thess 4:13). "Weep for the dead, for he lacks the light" (Si 22:11), and then it continues, "Weep less bitterly for the dead, for he has attained rest." The third reason is to tell us that we should be sad and weep for those who physically die: "I am utterly spent and crushed" (Ps 38:8). <a href="John11.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a>

It seems not, for just as in his absence he knew, because of his divinity, of Lazarus' death, so in the same way he knew where his tomb was. Why did he ask about something he already knew? I answer that he did not ask as though he did not know, but upon being shown the tomb by the people, he wanted them to admit that Lazarus had died and was buried. In this way he could prevent the miracle from being doubted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sunt ad hoc etiam duae rationes mysticae. Una est, quia qui interrogat, videtur nescire ea de quibus interrogat. Per Lazarum autem in monumento, signantur mortui in peccatis. Ostendit ergo dominus se ignorare locum Lazari, dans per hoc intelligere quod quasi nesciat peccatores, secundum illud Matth. c. VII, 23: <i>non novi vos</i> , et Gen. III, 9: <i>Adam, ubi es?</i> Alia ratio est, quia quod aliqui a peccato resurgant ad statum iustitiae divinae, est ex profundo praedestinationis divinae: quod quidem profundum homines ignorant; Rom. XI, 34: <i>quis cognovit sensum domini, aut quis consiliarius eius fuit?</i> Et Ier. XXIII, 18: <i>quis enim affuit in consilio domini, et vidit, et audivit sermonem eius?</i> Et ideo dominus hoc innuens, ad modum nescientis se habuit, cum et ipsi hoc nesciamus. Sic ergo ponitur domini interrogatio, et sequitur populi responsio; unde dicit <i>dicunt ei: domine, veni et vide. Veni</i> miserando, <i>vide</i> , considerando; Ps. XXIV, 18: <i>vide humilitatem meam et laborem meum, et dimitte universa delicta mea</i> .
          <td>There are also two mystical reasons for this. One is that a person who asks a question does not seem to know the things he asks about. Now, Lazarus in his tomb signifies those who are dead in their sins. And so our Lord presents himself as ignorant of where Lazarus is to have us understand that he does not, in a way, know sinners, according to: "I never knew you" (Matt 7:23); and in Genesis God said to Adam, "Where are you?" (3:9). The other reason is that if anyone rises from sin to the state of divine righteousness, it is due to the depths of divine predestination, the depths of which we are ignorant: "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?" (Rom 11:34); "For who among them has stood in the council of the Lord to perceive and hear his word" (Jer 23:18). And so our Lord, implying this, acts as one who does not know, since we also do not know this. Thus our Lord's question is given, and the answer of the people, when the Evangelist says, <b>They said to him, Lord, come and see</b> . <b>Come</b> , by showing mercy; <b>and see</b> , by giving your attention: "Consider my affliction and my trouble, and forgive all my sins" (Ps 25:18).

          <td>Consequenter dominus affectum suum lacrymis demonstrat; unde subditur <i>et lacrymatus est Iesus</i> : quae quidem lacrymae non erant ex necessitate, sed ex pietate et causa.

          <td>1537 Next, our Lord reveals his emotion with tears; the Evangelist says, <b>he wept</b> . Now his tears did not flow from necessity, but out of compassion and for a purpose. Christ was a well-spring of compassion, and he wept in order to show us that it is not blameworthy to weep out of compassion: "My son, let your tears fall for the dead" (Sir 38:16). He wept with a purpose, which was to teach us that we should weep because of sin: "I am weary with my moaning; every night I flood my bed with tears" (Ps 6:6).

Mystice autem per hoc datur intelligi quod Deus homines etiam in peccatis amat, nisi enim eos amasset, non utique diceret: <i>non veni vocare iustos, sed peccatores ad poenitentiam</i> : Matth. IX, 13. Unde Ier. XXXI, 3: <i>in caritate perpetua dilexi te, ideo attraxi te miserans</i> .
          <td>The Evangelist infers that some sympathize with Christ's affection when he says, <b>So the Jews said</b> , after Christ showed his affections by his words and tears, <b>See how he loved him!</b> : for love is especially manifested when people are afflicted: "A brother is born for adversity" (Prv 17:17). As for the mystical sense, we understand by this that God loves us even when we are sinners, for if he did not love us he would not have said: "For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners" (Matt 9:13). So we read in Jeremiah (31:3): "I have loved you with an everlasting love; therefore I have continued my faithfulness to you."

Si ergo eo nolente mortuus est, videtur quod non potuit mortem impedire; multo magis videtur quod non potuerit aperire oculos caeci nati. Vel, dicendum quod hoc dixerunt admirando, eo modo loquendi quo Eliseus dixit IV Reg. II, 14: <i>ubi est Deus Eliae etiam nunc?</i> Et David in Ps. LXXXVIII, 50: <i>ubi sunt misericordiae tuae antiquae, domine?</i>
          <td>1539 Those who doubted his previous miracle were from the group which envied Christ. The Evangelist says, <b>But some of them</b> , the Jews, <b>said, Could not he who opened the eyes of the blind man have kept this man from dying?</b> It was the same as saying: If he loved him so much that he now weeps over his death, it seems that he did not want him to die, for sadness concerns things that we do not want. So, if he died against Christ's wishes, it seems that Christ was not able to prevent his death; and all the more it seems that he could not open the eyes of the man born blind. Or, one could say that the Jews were speaking out of wonder or astonishment, as Elisha spoke when he said, "Where is the Lord, the God of Elijah?" (2 Kings 2:14); and David in "Lord, where is thy steadfast love of old?" (Ps 89:49).

Et ideo dicitur hic, quod <i>lapis erat superpositus ei</i> , scilicet ostio speluncae. Simile habetur Gen. XXIII, 1-20, ubi Abraham emit agrum et speluncam ad sepeliendum Saram uxorem suam.

Note that in those regions they had certain cavities in the form of caves that were used as human burial places, and in them they could bury many bodies over the course of time. So they have an entrance which they could close and open with a stone when necessary. Thus we read, <b>a stone lay upon it</b> , i.e., over the entrance to the cave. We read the same in Genesis (c 23) when Abraham purchased a field and a cave for the burial of his wife Sarah.

          <td>In the mystical sense, the cave signifies the depths of sin, which it is said: "I have come into deep waters, and the flood sweeps over me" (Ps 69:2). The stone laid upon the cave signifies the Law, which was written on stone, and which did not take away sin, but held them in sin, because they sinned more gravely in acting against the Law. Thus we read in Galatians (3:22): "The scripture consigned all things to sin" (Gal 3:22).

            1544 Then when he says, <b>Jesus said, Take away the stone</b> , he gives Christ's order to remove the stone. One might ask: Since it is a greater thing to raise the dead than to remove a stone, why did not Christ also use his power to remove the stone? Chrysostom says that this was done in order to secure greater certitude about this miracle, that is, to make them such witnesses to the miracle that they could not, like they did in the case of the blind man, say and maintain that this was not the same person. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a>

Et Petrus dicit eodem: <i>cur tentatis imponere iugum super cervices discipulorum, quod neque patres nostri, neque nos portare potuimus?</i> De hoc ergo dicit dominus, <i>tollite lapidem</i> , idest legis pondus, et gratiam praedicate.
          <td>
            As for the mystical sense, according to Augustine, the removing of the stone signifies the removal of the weight of the legal observances from Christ's faithful who came into the Church from the Gentiles, for some wanted to impose these observances on them. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> Thus St. James says: "For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things" (Acts 15:28); and Peter says in the same work: "Why do you make trial of God by putting a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear" (Acts 15:10). Concerning this our Lord says, <b>Take away the stone</b> , i.e., the burden of the Law, and preach peace.

Mystice autem de illo qui peccare consuevit <i>iam foetet</i> , scilicet per pessimam famam, cuius odor deterrimus per peccatum consurgit. Nam sicut ex bonis operibus fragrat odor bonus, secundum quod dicit apostolus II Cor. II, 15: <i>Christi bonus odor sumus Deo</i> , ita ex malis operibus foetor et malus odor evaporat: qui etiam recte quatriduanus dicitur, quasi pressus pondere terrenorum peccatorum et cupiditatum carnalium, terra enim est ultimum de quatuor elementis; Ioel. c. II, 20: <i>ascendet foetor eius, et ascendet putredo eius, quia superbe egit</i> .

As for the literal sense, this happened in order to show the truth of the miracle, as his members were already beginning to corrupt and dissolve. As for the mystical sense, one who habitually sins is said to smell, that is, the foul odor of his reputation is spread abroad by his sins. For just as good works spread a good odor, as the Apostle says - "We are the aroma of Christ to God" (2 Cor 2:15) - so from evil works there arises an evil odor and a stench. Such a person is aptly described in terms of "four days," for he is pressed by the weight of earthly sins and sensual desires, and earth is the last of the four elements: "The stench and foul smell of him will rise" (Joel 2:20).

Licet enim aliquos recenter mortuos suscitasset, impossibile tamen hoc de fratre credebat ob dierum diuturnitatem.

For Martha was not certain that Christ could raise a person who had been dead four days. Although Christ had recently raised certain dead persons, this seemed impossible to believe of her brother because of the long time he had been dead. And so our Lord said, <b>Did not I tell you that if you would believe you would see the glory of God?</b> that is, the raising of your brother, by which God will be glorified.

Et hoc ideo, quia eadem est gloria patris et filii et spiritus sancti. Ideo autem non expressit hic gloriam filii, ne turbaret astantes Iudaeos, ad contradictionem promptos.
          <td>Although our Lord had said to his apostles before that this miracle would be for his glory, saying, "so that the Son of God may be glorified by means of it" (11:4), that is, by means of this death, he now says to Martha that this miracle will be for the glory of God. The reason for this is that the glory of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit is the same. However, he did not mention the glory of the Son here so as not to excite the Jews who were present and ready to dispute him.

XIII, 2: <i>si habuero fidem, ita ut montes transferam</i> . Et Mc. ult., 20, dicitur: <i>illi autem praedicaverunt ubique, domino cooperante, et sermonem confirmante, sequentibus signis</i> . Quae quidem miraculorum operatio est ad gloriam Dei: et ideo dicit <i>si credideris, videbis gloriam Dei</i> .
          <td>1548 These words of our Lord suggest two fruits of our faith. The first is the performing of miracles, which is due to faith: "If you have faith as a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move hence to yonder place,' and it will move; and nothing will be impossible to you" (Matt 17:19). The Apostle also says: "If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains." (1 Cor 13:2); and in Mark (16:20) we read: "And they went forth and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by the signs that attended it." Now this working of miracles is for the glory of God; thus he says, <b>if you would believe you would see the glory of God.</b>

          <td>The second fruit is the vision of eternal glory, which is due as a reward to faith; thus he says, <b>you would see the glory of God</b> : "If you do not believe, you will not understand," as we read in Isaiah [7:9], in an alternate version; and in 1 Corinthians it is said: "For now we see in a mirror dimly," by faith, "but then face to face."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Impletionem mandati ponit inferens <i>tulerunt ergo lapidem</i> . Ubi considerandum est, secundum Origenem, quod mora tollendi lapidem adiacentem, ex sorore defuncti causata est. Et ideo, tamdiu resuscitatio fratris dilata est quamdiu Christum per verba detinuit, sed statim cum Christi mandatum obediendo exequitur, frater resuscitatur. Ut per hoc discamus nihil interponere inter iussa Iesu et ipsorum executionem, si cupimus quod statim salutis sequatur effectus; Ps. XVII, 45: <i>in auditu auris obedivit mihi</i> .
          <td>
            1549 Next, the Evangelist mentions that the command was carried out, saying, <b>So they took away the stone</b> . We may consider here, according to Origen, that the delay in removing the stone was caused by the sister of the deceased. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> Consequently, the raising of her brother was delayed as long as she detained Christ with her talk; but as soon as the command of Christ was obediently carried out, her brother was raised. And we can learn from this not to interpose anything between the commands of Christ and their execution if we desire the effect of salvation to follow at once: "As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me" (Ps 18:44).

          <td>1550 Then he considers the prayer of Christ, in which he gives thanks. The Evangelist mentions four things in this regard. First, he mentions his way of praying; secondly, the efficacy of his prayer; thirdly, he excludes Christ's need to pray; and fourthly he mentions the usefulness of his prayer.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Modum autem orandi ponit congruentem <i>quia elevatis sursum oculis</i> ; idest, intelligentiam suam erexit, adducens illam per orationem ad excelsum patrem. Nobis autem, si ad exemplum orationis Christi orare volumus, necesse est levare oculos mentis nostrae ad eum, removendo illos a praesentibus rebus, memoria, cogitationibus et intentionibus. Levamus etiam oculos ad Deum quando non confidentes de meritis nostris, de sola misericordia speramus, secundum illud Ps. CXXII, 1: <i>ad te levavi oculos meos qui habitas in caelis</i> , et: <i>sicut oculi ancillae in manibus dominae suae, ita oculi ad dominum Deum nostrum, donec misereatur nostri</i> ; Thren. III, 41: <i>levemus corda nostra cum manibus ad dominum in caelis</i> .
          <td>1551 Christ's way of praying is appropriate, because <b>Jesus lifted up his eyes</b> , that is, he lifted up his understanding, directing it in prayer to the Father above. As for us, if we wish to pray according to the example of Christ's prayer, we have to raise the eyes of our mind to him by turning them from the memories, thoughts and desires of present things. We also lift our eyes to God when we do not rely on our own merits, but hope in his mercy alone: "To thee I lift up my eyes, O thou who art enthroned in the heavens! Behold, as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their master, as the eyes of a maid to the hand of her mistress, so our eyes look to the Lord our God, till he have mercy upon us" (Ps 123:1); and "Let us lift up our hearts and hands to God in heaven" (Lam 3:41).

          <td>Orationis autem efficaciam ponit, cum dicit <i>pater, gratias ago tibi, quoniam audisti me</i> . In quo argumentum habemus, quod Deus facilis est ad largiendum, secundum illud Ps. X, 17: <i>desiderium pauperum exaudivit dominus</i> , ut sic desiderium, etiam antequam proferat verba, exaudiat; Is. c. XXX, 19: <i>ad vocem clamoris tui statim ut audierit, respondebit tibi</i> ; et LXV, 24: <i>adhuc illis loquentibus, dicam, ecce adsum</i> . Multo ergo magis expedit arbitrari de domino salvatore, quod Deus pater praeveniens eius orationem, eum exaudierit: nam lacrymae quas Christus pro morte Lazari fuderat, vicem orationis habuerunt.
          <td>1552 He mentions the efficacy of this prayer when he says, <b>Father, I thank thee that thou hast heard me</b> . Here we have a sign that God is quick to give, as we read: "Lord, thou wilt hear the desire of the meek" (Ps 10:17), so that he hears our desires even before they are put into words: "He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry; when he hears it, he will answer you" (Is 30:19); and again in the same book: "While they are yet speaking I will hear" (65:24). Therefore, with much more reason we can think that God the Father, anticipating the prayer of our Lord, the Savior, would have heard him: for the tears which Christ shed at the death of Lazarus acted as a prayer.

            1553 If the phrase, <b>that thou hast heard me</b> , is interpreted as applying to Christ insofar as he is human, there is no difficulty: for as having a human nature Christ is less than the Father and, accordingly, it is appropriate for him to pray to the Father and be heard by him. But if, as Chrysostom wants, it is applied to Christ as God, then there is a problem: for as God, it is not fitting that he pray or be heard, but rather that he hear the prayers of others. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a> Consequently, it should be said that one is heard when his will is fulfilled. Now the will of the Father is always fulfilled, because "He does whatever he pleases" (Ps 115:3). Therefore, since the will of the Father is the same as the will of the Son, whenever the Father fulfills his own will, he fulfills the will of the Son. Thus, the Son says, as Word, <b>that thou hast heard me</b> , i.e., that you have done those things which were in your Word to be done. For he spoke and they were done.

And so he added, <b>that they may believe that thou didst send me</b> : "And this is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent" (17:3); "God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law" (Gal 4:4).

Further, this loud voice represents that loud voice which will sound at the general resurrection and by which all will be roused from their graves: "At midnight there was a cry" (Matt 25:6).

For Christ's mission was already being anticipated, as it was stated above: "The hour is coming, and now is, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear will live" (5:25).

LII, v. 2: <i>solve vincula colli tui, captiva filia Sion</i> . Sic ergo apparet unus modus spiritualiter prodeundi, qui ponitur ab Augustino, libro LXXXIII quaestionum.
          <td>
            1560 Augustine gives a mystical explanation to this entire verse beginning at <b>The dead man came out</b> . He does this in two ways, depending on two ways of coming out. The sinner comes out when by repenting he passes from the practice of sin to the state of righteousness: "Come out from them, and be separate from them" (2 Cor 6:17). However, his hands are bound with bandages, i.e., with carnal desires, because, although he is rising from his sins, he cannot escape such annoyances as long as he lives in the body. Thus the Apostle says: "I of myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin" (Rom 7:25). His face being wrapped with a cloth signifies that in this life we cannot have full knowledge of God: "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face" (1 Cor 12:12). Christ commands them to unbind him and let him go because after this life all the veils are lifted from those who rise from sin, so that they may contemplate God "face to face" (1 Cor 12:12). Then we will be unbound from the corruptibility of the flesh which is like a chain binding and weighing down the soul and keeping it from full and clear contemplation: "Loose the bonds from your neck, O captive daughter of Zion" (Is 52:2). This is one way to come out in a spiritual manner, and is given by Augustine in his work, <i>The Book of Eighty-Three Questions</i> . <a href="John11.htm#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34"><b>[34]</b></a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Alius modus prodeundi est per confessionem, de quo dicitur Prov. XXVIII, 13: <i>qui abscondit scelera sua, non dirigetur; qui autem confessus fuerit, et reliquerit ea, misericordiam consequetur</i> . Sic enim prodire est ab occultis exeundo, per confessionem manifestari; sed ut confitearis, Deus facit voce, idest gratia, magna vocando. Mortuus autem procedens adhuc ligatus, est confitens adhuc reus. Ut autem solvantur peccata eius, ministris mandatur ut solvant eum, et sinant abire. Nam quem Christus per seipsum interius vivificat, discipuli solvunt, quia ministerio sacerdotum vivificati absolvuntur; Matth. XVI, 19: <i>quodcumque solveris super terram, erit solutum et in caelis</i> .
          <td>Another way to come out is by confession, about which it is said: "He who conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy" (Prv 28:13). One comes out in this way by leaving his secret sins by disclosing them in confession. Now that one confesses is due to God calling him with a loud voice, that is, by grace. And the one who confesses, as still guilty, is the dead person still wrapped in bandages. In order for his sins to be loosed, the ministers are commanded to loose him and let him go. For the disciples loose those whom Christ by himself vivifies inwardly, because they are absolved, being vivified by the ministry of the priests: "Whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven" (Matt 16:19).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicunt autem quidam hoc mysterium prosequentes, quod sicut Christus Lazarum per seipsum vivificavit, vivificatum a discipulis absolvendum mandavit; ita Deus interius vivificat animam per gratiam, remittendo culpam, et absolvendo a reatu poenae aeternae, sed sacerdotes virtute clavium absolvunt a parte poenae temporalis. Sed haec positio nimis parum attribuit Ecclesiae clavibus. Hoc est enim proprium sacramentorum novae legis quod in eis gratia conferatur. Sacramenta autem in dispensatione ministrorum consistunt, unde in sacramento poenitentiae contritio et confessio se tenent materialiter, ex parte suscipientis sacramentum; vis autem causativa sacramenti est in absolutione sacerdotis, ex virtute clavium, per quas effectum dominicae passionis quodammodo applicat ad eum quem absolvit, ut remissionem consequatur. Si ergo sacerdos non absolveret nisi solum a poena, sacramentum poenitentiae non esset gratiae collativum, per quam culpa remittitur; et per consequens non esset sacramentum novae legis. Est ergo dicendum, quod sicut in sacramento Baptismi sacerdos verba proferens et exterius abluens, ministerium Baptismi exhibet, Christo interius baptizante, ita sacerdos exterius virtute clavium ministerium absolutionis impendit, Christo per gratiam culpam remittente.
          <td>
            1561 Some who consider this mystery say that just as Christ by himself vivified Lazarus, and once he was vivified he was ordered to be loosed by the disciples, so God vivifies a soul from within by grace by remitting its guilt and absolving it from the debt of eternal punishment; but priests, by the power of the keys, absolve in regard to the temporal punishment. But this position attributes too little to the keys of the Church. For it is proper to the sacraments of the New Law that in them grace is conferred. But the sacraments exist in the administration of the ministers. Thus, in the sacrament of penance, contrition and confession behave materially on the part of the one receiving the sacrament; but the causative power of the sacrament lies in the absolution of the priest, by the power of the keys, through which he somehow applies the effect of our Lord's passion to the one he absolves so that he obtains remission. Therefore, if the priest only absolved the punishment, the sacrament of penance would not confer a grace by which guilt is remitted; and consequently it would not be a sacrament of the New Law. Therefore, one must say that just as in the sacrament of baptism, the priest, by pronouncing the words and washing outwardly, exercises the ministry of baptism, while Christ baptizes inwardly, so the priest, by the power of the keys, outwardly administers the ministry of absolution, while Christ remits the guilt by grace. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a>

          <td>1562 Yet a difficulty arises from the fact that those who usually come for baptism are children who have not been justified before baptism, but obtain the grace of remission in baptism, whereas those who come for absolution are adults, who usually have obtained the remission of their sins beforehand by contribution; consequently, the absolution that follows seem to contribute nothing to the remission of sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed si quis diligenter consideret, ex utraque parte adultos accipiens, invenietur omnimoda similitudo. Contingit enim aliquos adultos, antequam actu sacramentum Baptismi consequantur, habentes illud in voto, remissionem peccatorum consequi, Baptismo flaminis baptizari; et tamen Baptismus sequens, quantum est de se, remissionem peccatorum operatur, licet in isto cui iam sunt remissa, hoc locum non habeat, sed solum augmentum gratiae consequatur. Si quis autem adultus ante Baptismum non perfecte fuisset dispositus ad consequendum remissionem peccatorum, in ipso actu dum baptizatur remissionem consequitur virtute Baptismi, nisi ponat per fictionem obstaculum spiritui sancto. Et similiter est dicendum in poenitentia. Si quis enim ante absolutionem sacerdotis plene contritus fuerit, consequitur remissionem peccatorum, eo quod habet in voto ut subiiciat se Ecclesiae clavibus, sine quo vera contritio non esset. Si autem antea non plena fuisset contritio sufficiens ad remissionem, in ipsa absolutione remissionem culpae consequitur, nisi ponat obstaculum spiritui sancto. Et similiter est in Eucharistia et extrema unctione, et in aliis sacramentis.
          <td>If this matter is carefully considered as affecting adults, in both cases it will be seen that there is a perfect parallel. For it happens that certain adults having a desire to be baptized obtain the remission of their sins by the baptism of desire before they actually receive the sacrament of baptism; and yet the baptism which follows, so far as what it is of itself is concerned, effects the remission of sins, although it does not so function in a person whose sins are already remitted, but he obtains only an increase of grace. However, if an adult was not perfectly disposed before baptism to obtain the remission of his sins, still in the very act of being baptized he obtains their remission by the power of baptism, unless he places some obstacle to the Holy Spirit by his insincerity. The same must be said of penance. For if a person was fully contrite before the absolution of the priest, he obtains the remission of his sins by having the desire to subject himself to the keys of the Church, without which there would not be true contrition. But if there was not beforehand a full contrition sufficient for remission, he obtains the remission of his guilt in the absolution, unless he puts an obstacle to the Holy Spirit. And the same is true in the Eucharist and in the Anointing of the Sick, and in the other sacraments.

Similiter etiam dominus dicit, miraculum istud se facturum propter populum qui circumstabat, ut scilicet credant in eum: et ideo verbum istud non ivit incassum, sed ex miraculo viso multi crediderunt. I Cor. c. I, 22: <i>Iudaei signa quaerunt</i> .
          <td>1564 He does two things concerning the first. First, he says that certain ones among them believed, <b>Many of the Jews therefore, who had come to Mary and Martha</b> to console them, <b>and had seen what he did, believed in him</b> . And no wonder, because such a miracle had not been heard of from the beginning of time, that is, that one dead four days in the tomb should be raised to life. Also, our Lord had said that he would perform this miracle for those standing by, so that they might believe in him. And so his words were not empty, but many believed because of the miracle they saw: "Jews demand signs" (1 Cor 1:22).

          <td>Secundo inducit quosdam denuntiantes, dicens <i>quidam autem ex ipsis venerunt ad Pharisaeos</i> et cetera. Quod quidem potest dupliciter intelligi. Uno modo quod dixerunt ea quae Iesus fecit principibus sacerdotum, ut mitigarent eos adversus Iesum, et ut confutarent eos de hoc quod adversus Iesum, qui tam mira faciebat, machinarentur. Alio modo, et melius, quia hoc dixerunt ut concitarent eos contra Christum. Nam infideles erant, et de miraculo scandalizabantur. Et hoc patet ex ipso modo loquendi. Nam cum dixerat <i>multi ergo ex Iudaeis (...) crediderunt in eum</i> . Subiungit quasi adversantem, dicens <i>quidam autem ex ipsis abierunt ad Pharisaeos</i> et cetera. Hi sunt de quibus dicitur infra XII, 37, quod <i>cum tanta signa fecisset Iesus coram eis, non crediderunt in eum (...) dilexerunt enim gloriam hominum magis quam gloriam Dei</i> .
          <td>1565 Secondly, he mentions that some were spreading news of the miracle, saying, <b>but some of them went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done</b> . This can be understood in two ways. In one way, they told the chief priests what Jesus had done in order to soften them towards Christ and to reproach them for conspiring against Jesus, who had worked such marvels. In another way, and this is better, they told them these things in order to incite them against Christ: for they were unbelievers and were scandalized at the miracle. This is clear from the way the Evangelist describes it, for after saying that <b>many of the Jewsbelieved in him</b> , he adds in contrast, <b>but some of them went to the Pharisees</b> . These are the ones of whom we read: "Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did not believe in himFor they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God" (12:37, 43).

          <td>1566 Next (v 47), the Evangelist mentions the effect of the miracle on the leaders. First, we have their evil conspiracy against Christ; secondly, we see how Christ escaped it (v 54). He does three things concerning the first. First, he mentions the gathering of the council; secondly, the problem that confronted them (v 47); and thirdly, their solution of this problem (v 49).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ostenditur autem circa primum pontificum nequitia ex tribus. Primo ex personarum conditione, quia non plebei, sed pontifices et Pharisaei. Pontifices autem, quia erant principes sacrorum; Pharisaei vero, quia speciem religionis habebant, ut sic impleatur quod dicitur Gen. penult., 5: <i>Simeon et levi fratres, vasa bellantia iniquitatis</i> . Nam de Simeone fuerunt adinventores sectae Pharisaeorum. Pontifices autem manifestum est de tribu levi fuisse; I Esd. IX, 2: <i>manus principum prima erat in transgressione hac</i> .
          <td>1567 In regard to the first, three things are mentions about the wickedness of the chief priests. First of all, their status: for they were not the common people, but <b>the chief priests and the Pharisees</b> . Chief priests, because they were in charge of sacred matters; and they were Pharisees because they had the appearance of religion. Thus was fulfilled what was stated in Genesis (49:5): "Simeon and Levi are brothers; weapons of violence are their swords": for the founders of the sect of the Pharisees were descended from Simeon, and the chief priests were clearly from the tribe of Levi.

          <td>Secondly, we see that their wickedness was deliberate; thus he says, they <b>gathered the council</b> in order to make their plans: "O my soul, come not into their council" (Gen 49:6); "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked" (Ps 1:1). But we also read: "No counsel can avail against the Lord" (Prv 21:30).

They were blind, for they still called him a man after such a great demonstration of his divinity. As he himself said: "The works which the Father has granted me to accomplish, these very works which I am doing, bear me witness" (5:35). In truth, they were no less foolish than the blind because they wondered what they should do, whereas there was nothing for them to do but believe: "What signs do you do, that we may see, and believe you?" (6:30). See how many signs he did work! Even they said, <b>this man performs many signs</b> : "Their wickedness blinded them" (Wis 2:21).

Primo amissionem principatus spiritualis; et quantum ad hoc dicit <i>si dimittimus eum sic, omnes credent in eum</i> : quod quidem secundum rei veritatem optabile erat omnibus, nam fides quae est ad Christum, salvat et ad vitam aeternam perducit; infra XX, v. 31: <i>haec scripta sunt ut credatis (...) et ut credentes vitam habeatis in nomine eius</i> . Sed quantum ad eorum pravam intentionem eis horrendum videbatur, cum crederent, nullum eorum qui crederent in Christum, eis obedire. Unde ex eorum ambitione seipsos et alios retrahunt a salute. Unde dicitur in III Canon. Io.: <i>is quis amat primatum gerere in eis, Diotrephes, non recipit nos</i> .
          <td>1570 The root of their problem was that they feared the losses that would follow. The Evangelist mentions two things referring to this. First, their loss of spiritual leadership. He says about this, <b>If we let him go on thus, every one will believe in him</b> . This, of course, would be the best for all concerned, because it is faith in Christ that saves and leads to eternal life: "But these are written that you may believeand that believing you may have life in his name" (20:31). But in relation to their wicked intention this was terrifying to them, for they believed that no one who believed in Christ would obey them. And so, because of their ambition, they backed away from salvation and took others with themselves: "But Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first does not acknowledge my authority" (3 Jn 1:9).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ponit ambitionem possessionis temporalis, cum dicit <i>et venient Romani, et tollent nostrum locum, et gentem</i> : quod videtur ex hoc sequi, secundum Augustinum: quia si omnes in Christum crederent, nemo remaneret qui adversus Romanos templum Dei defenderet, quia desererent sanctum templum et suas paternas leges, contra quas doctrinam Christi esse sentiebant. Sed hoc non videtur multum ad propositum pertinere, cum adhuc servirent Romanis, nec excogitassent contra eos movere bellum. Et ideo melius videtur dicendum, secundum Chrysostomum, quod ideo hoc dicebant quia videbant Christum honorari a populo tamquam rex. Et quia mandatum Romanorum erat ut nullus nisi per eos rex nominaretur, ideo timebant quod si hoc audirent Romani, quod Christum haberent tamquam regem, reputarent ipsos Iudaeos rebelles et venientes contra eos, destruerent civitatem et gentem; infra XIX, 12: <i>omnis qui se regem facit, contradicit Caesari</i> .
          <td>
            1571 Secondly, he mentions their ambition for temporal possessions when he says, <b>and the Romans will come and destroy both our place and our nation</b> . This seems to follow from the other, as Augustine says, for if all believed in Christ, there would be no one left to defend the temple of God against the Romans, because they would have abandoned the holy temple and the laws of their fathers, as they thought the teaching of Christ was directed against these. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn37" name="_ftnref37" id="_ftnref37">[37]</a> But this does not really seem to have much bearing on the issue, since they would still be subject to the Romans and would not be planning to war against them. Thus, it seems better to say, with Chrysostom, that they said this because they observed that Christ was being honored by the people as a king. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a> And because the Romans had ordered that no one could be king unless they had appointed him, they were afraid that if the Romans heard that they were regarding Christ as a king, they would look upon the Jews as rebels. Then they would move against them and destroy their city and nation: "Every one who makes himself a king sets himself against Caesar" (19:12).

This name was appropriate to his wickedness for it means, first of all, "investigator," and it attests to his presumption: "He who is a searcher of majesty shall be overwhelmed by glory" [Prv 25:27]. For he was presumptuous when he said, "I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God" (Matt 26:63). Secondly, it means "sagacious," which testifies to his cunning, because he strove to procure the death of Christ. Thirdly, it means "vomiting," which attests to his foolishness: "Like a dog that returns to his vomit" (Prv 26:11).

Postmodum autem, crescente ambitione et contentione inter Iudaeos, constitutum est ut plures essent pontifices, et ad omnes vicissim huiusmodi dignitas proveniret, et per annos singulos vicibus ministrarent.

Here we should note, as stated in Leviticus (c 8), that the Lord appointed one high priest, at whose death another was to succeed and was to exercise the office of high priest throughout his life. But later, as ambition and quarrels grew among the Jews, it was agreed that there should be a number of high priests, and that all who had attained to this office would exercise it in turn, year by year. (And sometimes they obtained this office by money; as Josephus says.) And to indicate this situation he says of the time, <b>that year</b> .

          <td>These words have one meaning according to the intention of Caiaphas, and another according to the explanation of the Evangelist. In order to explain them according to the evil intention of Caiaphas, we should note that, as mentioned in Deuteronomy (13:1), the Lord had commanded: "If a prophet arises among you, or a dreamer of dreamsand if he says, 'Let us go after other gods,'that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death." And so, according to this law, Caiaphas believed that Christ would turn the people from the worship of God: "We found this man perverting our nation" (Lk 23:2). Thus he says, <b>You know nothing at all</b> , that is, the Law. <b>You do not understand that it is expedient for you that one man</b> , this man, <b>should die</b> , so that the whole nation is not deceived. This is like saying: The welfare of one man must be ignored for the public good. Thus Deuteronomy (13:5) continues: "So you shall purge the evil from the midst of you." "Drive out the wicked person from among you" (1 Cor 5:13).

          <td>1576 But the Evangelist explains this another way, saying, <b>He did not say this of his own accord</b> . He mentions three things: first, the author of these words; secondly, their correct meaning (v 51b); and thirdly, the Evangelist adds to the words of Caiaphas (v 52).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum sciendum est, quod quia posset aliquis credere Caipham instinctu proprio verba dicta protulisse, Evangelista hoc excludens dicit <i>hoc autem a semetipso non dixit</i> . In quo datur intelligi, quod aliquis aliquando a semetipso loquitur. Homo enim est illud quod principale est in ipso, hoc autem est intellectus et ratio: unde homo id quod est, per rationem est. Quando ergo homo loquitur ex propria ratione, tunc loquitur a semetipso, sed quando loquitur ab aliquo superiori et exteriori instinctu, non loquitur a semetipso. Dupliciter tamen hoc contingit. Quandoque ut motus a spiritu divino, secundum illud Matth. X, v. 20: <i>non enim vos estis qui loquimini, sed spiritus patris vestri qui loquitur in vobis</i> . Quandoque autem ut motus a spiritu maligno, sicut arreptitii: et utique aliquando dicuntur prophetare. Quod quidem moti a spiritu divino prophetent, dicitur II Petr. I, 21: <i>non enim voluntate humana allata est aliquando prophetia, sed a spiritu sancto inspirati, locuti sunt sancti Dei homines</i> . Quod autem moti a spiritu maligno prophetent, habetur Ier. XXIX, 26: <i>dedit te dominus sacerdotem pro Ioiada sacerdote, ut sis dux in domo domini super omnem virum arreptitium et prophetantem</i> .
          <td>1577 In regard to the first we should note that because one might suppose that Caiaphas spoke these words by his own impulse, the Evangelist rejects this, saying, <b>He did not say this of his own accord</b> . By this he lets us understand that at times a person does speak of his own accord. For a human being is what is the chief thing in him; but this is the intellect and reason. Thus a human being is what he is because of reason. Therefore, when a human being speaks from his own reason, he speaks of his own accord. But when he speaks under a higher and external impulse he does not speak of his own accord. Now this happens in two ways. Sometimes one is moved by the divine Spirit: "It is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you" (Matt 10:20). But sometimes one is moved by a wicked spirit, as those who rave. And both of these are sometimes said to prophesy. That those who are moved by the Holy Spirit prophesy is asserted in 2 Peter (1:21): "No prophecy ever came by the impulse of man, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." Again, that those moved by a wicked spirit prophesy is found in Jeremiah (29:26): "The Lord has made you a priest instead of Jehoiada the priest, to have charge in the house of the Lord over every madman [one who raves] who prophesies."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sciendum est etiam, quod aliquando loquitur aliquis instinctu spiritus sancti vel spiritus maligni, qui tamen amittit usum rationis, et arripitur. Aliquando autem manet ei liber usus rationis, nec arripitur. Nam quando superabundant vires sensitivae ex superiori impressione, ligatur ratio, et movetur, et arreptus est. Quia vero Daemon habet potestatem imprimendi in phantasiam, cum sit potentia affixa organo, potest in eam aliquando sic imprimere quod ex impressionis abundantia ratio efficiatur quasi ligata, non tamen quod cogatur ad consensum; et tunc homo arripitur a spiritu maligno.
          <td>Note also that at times some may speak by an impulse of the Holy Spirit or of an evil spirit in such a way that they lose the use of reason and are somehow seized. At other times, the use of reason can remain and they are not seized. When the sense powers are overflowing due to a higher impression, the reason is hindered, and disturbed and seized. An evil spirit has the power of affecting the imagination, since it is a power united to a physical organ. And such an evil spirit can so affect the imagination by a strong impression that as a result the reason is hindered; yet it is not forced to consent. This is the condition of those seized by an evil spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Restat ergo quaestio an Caiphas verba ista instinctu spiritus sancti dixerit, vel maligni. Et videtur quod non dixerit instinctu spiritus sancti: nam spiritus sanctus est spiritus veritatis, ut dicitur Ier. c. XV. Spiritus autem malignus est spiritus mendacii; III Reg. ult., 22: <i>egrediar, et ero spiritus mendax in ore omnium prophetarum</i> . Constat autem quod Caiphas locutus fuerit mendacium, dicens <i>expedit vobis ut unus moriatur</i> . Non ergo locutus est instinctu spiritus sancti, ut videtur, sed prophetavit instinctu spiritus maligni arreptitii.
          <td>1578 We have to decide, therefore, whether Caiaphas spoke these words by the impulse of the Holy Spirit or of an evil spirit. It seems that he did not speak by the impulse of the Holy Spirit, for the Holy Spirit is the spirit of truth (cf. Jer 15), and the wicked spirit is the spirit of lying: "I will go forth, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets" (1 Kgs 22:22). But it is obvious that Caiaphas spoke a lie, saying, <b>it is expedient for you that one man should die</b> . Therefore, he did not speak by an impulse of the Holy Spirit, as it seems, but he prophesied by the impulse of a raving wicked spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hoc autem non videtur consonare dictis Evangelistae: nam si ita esset, Ioannes non addidisset <i>cum esset pontifex anni illius</i> . Ideo ergo Caiphae dignitatem addidit, ut insinuaret eum instinctu spiritus sancti fuisse locutum. Ex quo datur nobis intelligi quod etiam malos in dignitate constitutos spiritus sanctus movet ad loquendum aliqua vera et futura pro utilitate dumtaxat subditorum. Ad illud ergo quod in contrarium dicitur, scilicet falsum esse quod dixit <i>expedit vobis ut unus moriatur homo pro populo</i> , dupliciter responderi potest. Uno modo, quod mors Christi quantum est de se, expediens fuit omnibus, etiam his qui eum occiderunt; I Tim. IV, 10: <i>qui est salvator omnium hominum, maxime fidelium</i> : Hebr. II, 9: <i>ut gratia Dei pro omnibus gustaret mortem</i> . Alio modo ut dicatur <i>expedit vobis</i> , idest populo. Unde Evangelista, ubi Caiphas dicit <i>ut moriatur pro vobis</i> , ponit <i>pro gente</i> .
          <td>However, this does not seem to agree with the words of the Evangelist, for if it were such John would not have added, <b>who was high priest that year</b> . He mentions the dignity of Caiaphas in order to suggest that he spoke by an impulse of the Holy Spirit to speak truths about the future for the precise benefit of their subjects. Apropos of what is said in opposition to this, namely, that the statement, <b>it is expedient for you that one man should die for the people</b> , is false, this can be answered this way. The death of Christ considered in itself was expedient for all, even for those who killed him: "who is the savior of all men, especially of those who believe" (1 Tim 4:10); "So that by the grace of God he might taste death for every one" (Heb 2:9). In another way, one can take <b>it is expedient for you</b> as meaning "for the people." Hence the Evangelist, where Caiaphas says <b>that one man should die for the people</b> , uses below the words <b>for the nation</b> .

Sed, secundum Origenem, non sequitur quod quicumque prophetat sit propheta: sed si propheta est, utique prophetat; nam alicui quandoque conceditur actus alicuius rei, cuius tamen conditio ei non conceditur; sicut non quicumque facit aliquid iustum, est iustus, sed qui iustus est, iusta facit.
          <td>
            1579 The words of the Evangelist seem to indicate that he was a prophet, since he says, <b>he prophesied</b> ; for if a person prophesies, it follows that he is a prophet. According to Origen, however, it does not follow that every one who prophesies is a prophet; but if one is a prophet, he does prophesy. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a> For sometimes an act is granted to a person, but not the state to which it is appropriate: for example, not every one who does something just is just, but one who is just does just things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Notandum est autem, quod duplex actus concurrit ad hoc quod aliquis prophetet: scilicet videre; I Reg. IX, 9: <i>qui nunc dicitur propheta, olim vocabatur videns</i> . Item annuntiare: I Cor. XIV, 3: <i>propheta omnibus loquitur ad aedificationem</i> . Contingit autem quandoque quod utrumque aliquis habet, non tamen proprie dicitur propheta: nam quandoque aliquis habet propheticam visionem, sicut Nabuchodonosor et Pharao; et similiter ipsam visionem aliis nuntiaverunt; non tamen prophetae dici possunt, quia defuit eis aliquid, scilicet intelligentia visionis, qua opus est in visione, ut dicitur Dan. X, 1. Caiphas autem licet visionem propheticam non habuerit, habuit tamen denuntiationem rei propheticae, inquantum scilicet denuntiavit utilitatem mortis Christi. Quandoque namque spiritus sanctus movet ad totum quod pertinet ad prophetiam, quandoque autem ad aliquid tantum. Caiphae autem nec mentem illuminavit, nec imaginationem; et ideo eius mens et imaginatio ad malum intenta mansit: movit tamen linguam eius, ut proferret modum quo salus populi impleretur. Unde non dicitur propheta nisi inquantum habuit propheticum actum in denuntiatione, imaginatione et ratione eius ad contrarium existente. Ex quo patet quod non magis potest dici propheta quam asina Balaam.
          <td>Furthermore, it should be noted that two acts concur in order that someone prophesy: namely, seeing - "He who is now called a prophet was formerly called a seer" (1 Sam 9:9) - and announcing - "He who prophesies speaks to men for their upbuilding and encouragement" (1 Cor 14:3). Now it sometimes happens that a person has both, and yet is not properly speaking a prophet: for sometimes a person has a prophetic vision, as Nebuchadnezaar and Pharaoh, and similarly announces the vision to others; yet they cannot be called prophets because they lack something, namely, an understanding of the vision, which is necessary in a vision, as stated in Daniel [10:1]: "A word was revealed to Danieland he understood the word: for there is need of understanding a vision." Caiaphas, however, although he did not have a prophetic vision, did announce a prophetic matter insofar as he announced the benefit of Christ's death. For sometimes the Holy Spirit moves one to all that pertains to prophecy, and sometimes to something only. In the case of Caiaphas, he enlightened neither his mind nor his imagination. Consequently, his mind and imagination remained intent on evil; yet he moved his tongue to tell the manner in which the salvation of the people would be accomplished. Thus, he is not called a prophet except insofar as he performed a prophetic act in announcing, his imagination and reason remaining fixed in the contrary. It is clear from this that he was no more a prophet than was Balaam's donkey.

          <td>Ubi cavenda est haeresis Manichaeorum dicentium, animas aliquas esse de substantia divina, et vocari filios Dei; et ad has congregandas in unum dicunt Deum venisse. Sed hoc est erroneum; quia, ut dicitur Ez. c. XVIII, 4: <i>omnes animae meae sunt</i> , scilicet creatione. Et ideo quod dicit <i>ut filios Dei qui erant dispersi, congregaret in unum</i> , non est intelligendum quod tunc iam accepissent adoptionis spiritum: quia, ut Gregorius dicit, nec oves eius neque filii Dei adhuc erant per adoptionem. Sed est intelligendum secundum praedestinationem, ut dicatur <i>ut filios Dei</i> , scilicet ab aeterno praedestinatos, Rom. c. VIII, 29: <i>quos praescivit conformes fieri imagini filii eius, ut sit ipse primogenitus in multis fratribus, qui erant dispersi, per</i> diversos ritus et gentes, <i>congregaret in unum</i> , scilicet in unitatem fidei; supra X, 16: <i>alias oves habeo, quae non sunt ex hoc ovili, et illas oportet me adducere (...) et fiet unum ovile et unus pastor</i> ; Ps.

          <td>
            Here one must guard against the error of the Manichees, who said that certain souls are the divine substance and are called the children of God, and that God came to gather together these children into one. This is erroneous because it is stated in Ezekiel (18:4): "All souls are mine," that is, by creation. Consequently, the statement, <b>to gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad</b> , does not mean that they have already received the spirit of adoption, because, as Gregory says, they were as yet neither his sheep nor children of God by adoption. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn40" name="_ftnref40" id="_ftnref40">[40]</a> Rather it should be taken according to predestination. It is as though he were saying: <b>to gather into one</b> , namely, into the unity of the faith - "And I have other sheep, that are not of this fold; I must bring them alsoso there shall be one flock, one shepherd" (10:16); "The Lord builds up Jerusalem; he gathers the outcasts [the dispersed] of Israel" (Ps 147:2) - <b>the children of God</b> , predestined from eternity - "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first-born of many brethren" (Rom 8:29), the brethren, that is, <b>who are scattered abroad</b> in diverse ceremonies and nations.

Dicendum quod ante habuerunt quidem instinctum ad eum occidendum; sed <i>ab illo die</i> , concitati ad iram ex verbis Caiphae, tractaverunt firmo proposito eum occidere. Prov.

          <td>1581 Then when he says, <b>So from that day on they took counsel how to put him to death</b> , the Evangelist sets down the agreement among the Jews on the death of Christ. But did they not previously think of putting him to death? It seems so, because before in many places it is stated that the Jews sought to kill him. I answer that they previously did have some desire to kill him, but <b>from that day on</b> , incited to anger by the words of Caiaphas, they ended with a firm proposal to kill him "For their feet run to evil" (Prv 1:16).

          <td>Modus autem declinationis fuit per occultationem, et recessum Christi a Iudaeis.

He did not do this because he did not have the power, but as an example for the disciples. This shows that it is not a sin if his faithful withdraw from the sight of their persecutors, choosing rather to evade the fury of the wicked by hiding, than kindle it more by showing themselves: "When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next" (Matt 10:23).

            Moreover, Origen says that no one should place himself in danger; but when dangers are immediately threatening, it is very praiseworthy not to run from professing Christ or not to refuse to suffer death for the sake of the truth. <a href="John11.htm#_ftn41" name="_ftnref41" title="" id="_ftnref41">[41]</a> No one should place himself in danger for two reason. First, because it is very presumptuous to place oneself in danger, both on account of a lack of experience of one's own virtue, which is sometimes found to be fragile, and on account of the uncertainty about the outcome; "Let any one who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall" (1 Cor 10:12). Secondly, lest by presenting ourselves to our persecutors, we give them the occasion to be more wicked and culpable: "Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God" (1 Cor 10:32).

          <td>Occasio autem quaerendi et admirandi ponitur duplex.

XII, 11: <i>est enim phase, idest transitus domini</i> . Addit autem <i>Iudaeorum</i> , quia ipsum Pascha Iudaei male et indebite celebrabant: nam quando devote Pascha celebramus, tunc dicitur Pascha Dei, Is. I, 13: <i>solemnitates vestras non feram</i> .
          <td>1586 Two occasions for their questioning and wondering are mentioned. The first was the nature of the time, because the <b>Passover of the Jews was at hand</b> , when the flight of the Hebrews out of Egypt was recalled: "It is the Lord's Passover" (Ex 12:11). He adds, <b>of the Jews</b> , because they celebrated their Passover in an unholy and unbecoming way: for when one celebrates the Passover in a devout way it is called the Passover of God: "Your assemblies I will not abide," as we read in Isaiah (1:13).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secunda vero ex concursu populi, quia <i>ascenderunt multi Ierosolymam de regione</i> : nam, ut legitur Ex. XXIII, tribus temporibus in anno, seu festivitatibus, filii Israel se debebant domino praesentare, inter quae primum erat Pascha, et ideo magna multitudo ascendebat Ierosolymam, ubi erat templum. Sed quia nondum erat tempus Paschae, quo debebant ascendere, ideo Evangelista consequenter causam ascensus assignat, subdens <i>ut sanctificarent seipsos</i> : nullus enim audebat comedere agnum nisi mundus, et ideo praeveniebant tempus Paschae, ut interim purificantes seipsos, possent in Pascha agnum rite comedere. In quo datur nobis exemplum, ut tempore quadragesimali ieiuniis et bonis operibus nos purificemus, ut in Pascha rite sumamus corpus domini nostri.
          <td>The second occasion was gathering of the people, <b>and many went up from the country to Jerusalem</b> . For as we see from Exodus (c 23), the children of Israel were to present themselves to the Lord three times a year on the three festivals, and the foremost of these was the Passover. And so a great number traveled to Jerusalem, where the temple was located. But because it was not yet actually the Paschal time, when they were obliged to go, the Evangelist tells why they went then, adding, <b>before the Passover, to purify themselves</b> . For no one dared to eat the lamb if he was unclean, and so they went before the Passover so that, by purifying themselves in the meantime, they could fittingly eat the lamb on the Passover. This gives us an example that we should purify ourselves during Lent by fasts and good works, so that on the Passover we might receive the body of our Lord in a fitting manner.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Admiratio autem ponitur ex causa absentiae domini: et hoc est quod dicit <i>quaerebant ergo Iesum</i> , non quidem ad honorandum, sed ad occidendum, <i>et colloquebantur adinvicem in templo stantes: quid putatis, quia non venit ad diem festum istum?</i> Sed notandum, quod quando dies festus agitur sancte, semper dominus est in die festo; Matth. c. XVIII, 20: <i>ubicumque fuerint duo vel tres congregati in nomine meo, ibi sum in medio eorum</i> . Et ideo nos congregati in domo Dei, quaeramus Iesum, mutuo nos consolando et exorando ut veniat ad diem festum nostrum. Quando vero non sancte agitur festum, tunc non venit Iesus; Is. I, 14: <i>Kalendas vestras et solemnitates vestras odivit anima mea</i> .
          <td>1587 The reason for their questioning is mentioned as due to Christ's absence: <b>they were looking for Jesus</b> , not to honor him, but to tell him, <b>and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, what do you think? That he will not come to the feast?</b> But note that when a festival day is celebrated in a holy manner, Christ is always present: "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (Matt 18:20). And so let us, when we gather together in the house of God, seek Jesus by consoling each other and by praying that he come to our festival day. But Jesus does not come when a feast is not celebrated in a holy manner: "Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hates" (Is 1:4).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

"You will seek me and die in your sin" (8:21).
