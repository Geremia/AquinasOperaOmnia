            with them?" But fasting pertains to mourning. However, the
            bridegroom of the Church, Christ, is spiritually with the just -
            Ephesians 3:17 "That Christ may dwell in your hearts by faith."

            >I respond to the 1st. question (sub-article 1) saying that through
            the precepts of the positive law (as was said), some things are
            denied which are not of themselves and always evil. Hence, in some
            situation they can be good and necessary which sort are prohibited
            by precepts. Thus, it was not the intention of the legislator that
            his precept always be observed, except in those situations in which
            the good of virtue can be preserved. Thus it is to be said to the
            first question concerning natural and positive law, that the
            positive law is said to proceed from the natural law insofar as the
            way of observing the natural law is determined through the postive
            law, since the intention of any legislator is to lead men to virtue,
            as is said in Book II of the
            <i>Nicomachean Ethics,</i>
            which pertains to the natural law. However, the mode of observing
            these things which are of the natural law cannot be uniform in all
            situations because of the differences which are found among the
            particulars, just as the same mode of cure cannot be employed for
            all of those suffering the same illness. Therefore, the legislator
            cannot impose a precept which does not allow, in some cases, to be
            put aside. Nevertheless, considering what occurs for the most part,
            he determines a law, and in those situations in which the mode
            determined by law is not appropriate, he reserves judgment to those
            to whom it belong to determine this; and this is the dispensation
            that is given out by prelates with respect to the fast instituted by
            the Church, and with respect to other such precepts.</font

            since it is borne in the bitterness of sins or the presence of
            miseries. The fasting of exultation (is so called) since it
            withdraws one from carnal things because of the enjoyment of
            spiritual matters. For having tasted of the spirit, the (desire for
            the) flesh is insipid in every way to the just. Therefore, the
            bridegroom is always present, spiritually in
            <i>habitus,</i>
            but not always actually. Sometimes, on the other hand, he is present
            to them as a judge when they consider their sins which they have
            committed or into which they can fall, unless they restrain their
            flesh. And then to these belongs the fasting of mourning. Sometime,
            however, he is actually present to them, as a bridegroom, when they

            >I respond to the 3rd question (sub-article 3) saying that children
            stand in need of much food in that food is required by them not only
            for the activity of the nutritive power, but also of the
            augmentative. For from whatever remains over and above (what is
            required for) nutrition, an increase of growth arises. And since the
            natural power has not yet grown strong in them, they are not able to
            take much of food at one sitting, since the natural power is not
            able to convert it (into the quantities required for their health
            and growth). And thus, they stand in need of the frequent taking of
            food. Because of this, fasting is not appropriate to them while they
            are in their stage of growth. For the time of growth, according to
            the Philosopher, is up to the end of their 21st year for many, since
            natural affairs do not always proceed in the same way, but only for
            the most part. Thus, before that time, children are not bound to
            every obligatory fast of the Church. But as they approach the
            aforesaid limit, so much more is the natural power made stronger,
            and growth proceeds more slowly, since the child arrives at the
            mid-point of his entire growth in the first five years, as the
            Philosopher states. Thus, the more they approach the aforesaid
            limit, the more are they made suitable to fasting.</font

            preservation of life and in a state of health sufficient for the
            work which one has to do. Not by any means does he, by his precept,
            exact from a man the whole of what he is capable. For he does not

            intentions for this man) if (he exacted from him) the performance of
            the whole of what he is capable. And therefore, during impending
            illness, the suffering of life, or of any such like thing, one is
            not bound by the precept to fast, when the aforesaid status (of the
            preservation of life and a state of health sufficient for one's
            work) cannot be preserved together with the fast. In accordance with
            the dispensation from one's superior, as was said previously, the

            precept is not to exclude other pious and more necessary causes.

            for the families whose care is incumbent upon them (or because the
            others are rich; or they are able to acquire, through less work,
