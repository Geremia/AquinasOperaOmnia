            <td>We seek then to consider and understand, first, its nature and essence, then whatever qualities belong to it. Of these, some seem to be proper to the soul alone, others to be shared in common’ and to exist in animate beings on account of it. §8

            <td>To ascertain, however, anything reliable about it is one of the most difficult of undertakings. Such an enquiry being Common to many topics—I mean, an enquiry into the essence, and what each thing is—it might seem to some that one definite procedure were available for all things of which we wished to know the essence; as there is demonstration for the accidental properties of things. So we should have to discover what is this one method. But if there is no one method for determining what an essence is, our enquiry becomes decidedly more difficult, and we shall have to find a procedure for each case in particular. If, on the other hand, it is clear that either demonstration, or division, or some such process is to be employed, there are still many queries and uncertainties to which answers must be found. For the principles in different subject matters are different, for instance in the case of numbers and surfaces.
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>δ' ἴσως ἀναγκαῖον διελεῖν ἐν τίνι τῶν γενῶν καὶ τί ἐστι, λέγω δὲ πότερον τόδε τι καὶ οὐσία ἢ ποιὸν ἢ ποσόν, ἢ καί τις ἄλλη τῶν διαιρεθεισῶν κατηγοριῶν, ἔτι δὲ πότερον τῶν ἐν δυνάμει ὄντων ἢ μᾶλλον ἐντελέχειά τις· διαφέρει γὰρ οὔ τι 402b μικρόν. σκεπτέον δὲ καὶ εἰ μεριστὴ ἢ ἀμερής, καὶ πότερον ὁμοειδὴς ἅπασα ψυχὴ ἢ οὔ· εἰ δὲ μὴ ὁμοειδής, πότερον εἴδει διαφέρουσα ἢ γένει. νῦν μὲν γὰρ οἱ λέγοντες καὶ ζητοῦντες περὶ ψυχῆς περὶ τῆς ἀνθρωπίνης μόνης ἐοίκασιν ἐπισκοπεῖν· εὐλαβητέον δ' ὅπως μὴ λανθάνῃ πότερον εἷς ὁ λόγος αὐτῆς ἐστι, καθάπερ ζῴου, ἢ καθ' ἕκαστον ἕτερος, οἷον ἵππου, κυνός, ἀνθρώπου, θεοῦ, τὸ δὲ ζῷον τὸ καθόλου ἤτοι οὐθέν ἐστιν ἢ ὕστερον, ὁμοίως δὲ κἂν εἴ τι κοινὸν ἄλλο κατηγοροῖτο·
            <td>Perhaps the first thing needed is to divide off the genus of the subject and to say what sort of thing it is,—I mean, whether it be a particular thing or substance, or a quality, or quantity, or any other of the different categories. Further, whether it is among things in potency or is an actuality—no insignificant distinction. Again, whether it is divisible or indivisible, and whether every soul is of the same sort or no: and if not, whether they differ specifically or generically. Indeed those who at present talk of and discuss the soul seem to deal only with the human soul. One must be careful not to leave unexplored the question whether there is a single definition of it, as of ‘animal’ in general, or a different one for each [of its kinds]: as, say, for horse, dog, man or god. Now ‘animal’ as a universal is nothing real, or is secondary; and we must say the same of any other general predicate. §§ 9-13

            <td>ἔτι δέ, εἰ μὴ πολλαὶ ψυχαὶ ἀλλὰ μόρια, πότερον δεῖ ζητεῖν πρότερον τὴν ὅλην ψυχὴν ἢ τὰ μόρια. χαλεπὸν δὲ καὶ τούτων διορίσαι ποῖα πέφυκεν ἕτερα ἀλλήλων, καὶ πότερον τὰ μόρια χρὴ ζητεῖν πρότερον ἢ τὰ ἔργα αὐτῶν, οἷον τὸ νοεῖν ἢ τὸν νοῦν, καὶ τὸ αἰσθάνεσθαι ἢ τὸ αἰσθητικόν· ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ἐπὶ τῶν ἄλλων. εἰ δὲ τὰ ἔργα πρότερον, πάλιν ἄν τις ἀπορήσειεν εἰ τὰ ἀντικείμενα πρότερον τούτων ζητητέον, οἷον τὸ αἰσθητὸν τοῦ αἰσθητικοῦ, καὶ τὸ νοητὸν τοῦ νοῦ.
            <td>Further, if there are not many souls, but only many parts of a single one, we must ask whether one ought to look first at the whole or the parts. It is difficult to see what parts are by nature diverse from one another, and whether one ought to look first at the parts or their functions, for instance at the act of understanding or at the intellective power, at the act of sensing or at the sensitive faculty; and likewise in other in stances. But if one is to examine first the operations, it might be asked whether one should not first enquire about their objects, as, in the sensitive function, the thing sensed; and in the intellectual, the thing intelligible. § 14

            <td>Now, it seems that not only does knowledge of the essence help one to understand the causes of the accidents of any substance (as in Mathematics to know what is the straight and the curved, and what is a line and what a plane enables one to discover the number of right angles to which those of a triangle are equal) but, conversely, accidental qualities contribute much to knowing, what a thing essentially is. When we can give an account of such qualities (some or all) according to appearances, then we shall have material for dealing as well as possible with the essence. The principle of every demonstration is what a thing is. Hence, whatsoever definitions do not afford us a knowledge of accidents, or even a fair conjecture about them, are obviously vain and sophistical. § 15

          LECTIO 1</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sicut docet philosophus in undecimo de animalibus, in quolibet genere rerum necesse est prius considerare communia et seorsum, et postea propria unicuique illius generis: quem quidem modum Aristoteles servat in philosophia prima. In metaphysicae enim primo tractat et considerat communia entis inquantum ens, postea vero considerat propria unicuique enti. Cuius ratio est, quia nisi hoc fieret, idem diceretur frequenter.
          <td>1. in studying any class of things, it is first of all necessary, as the Philosopher says in the <i>De Animalibus</i> [I, 5], to consider separately what is common to the class as a whole, and afterwards what is proper to particular members of the class. Such is Aristotle’s method in First Philosophy; for at the beginning of the <i>Metaphysics</i> he investigates the common properties of being as such, and only then does he go on to the particular kinds of being. The reason for this procedure is that it saves frequent repetition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Rerum autem animatarum omnium quoddam genus est; et ideo in consideratione rerum animatarum oportet prius considerare ea quae sunt communia omnibus animatis, postmodum vero illa quae sunt propria cuilibet rei animatae. Commune autem omnibus rebus animatis est anima: in hoc enim omnia animata conveniunt. Ad tradendum igitur de rebus animatis scientiam, necessarium fuit primo tradere scientiam de anima tamquam communem eis. Aristoteles ergo volens tradere scientiam de ipsis rebus animatis, primo tradit scientiam de anima, postmodum vero determinat de propriis singulis animatis in sequentibus libris.
          <td>Now living beings taken all together form a certain class of being; hence in studying them the first thing to do is to consider what living things have in common, and afterwards what each has peculiar to itself. What they have in common is a life-principle or soul; in this they are all alike. In conveying knowledge, therefore, about living things one must first convey it about the soul as that which is common to them all. Thus when Aristotle sets out to treat of living things, he begins with the soul; after which, in subsequent books, he defines the properties of particular living beings.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In tractatu autem de anima, quem habemus prae manibus, primo ponit prooemium, in quo facit tria quae necessaria sunt in quolibet prooemio. Qui enim facit prooemium tria intendit. Primo enim ut auditorem reddat benevolum. Secundo ut reddat docilem. Tertio ut reddat attentum. Benevolum quidem reddit, ostendendo utilitatem scientiae: docilem, praemittendo ordinem et distinctionem tractatus: attentum attestando difficultatem tractatus. Quae quidem tria Aristoteles facit in prooemio huius tractatus. Primo enim ostendit dignitatem huius scientiae. Secundo vero ordinem huius tractatus, quis sit, scilicet, et qualiter sit tractandum de anima, ibi, inquirimus autem. Tertio vero ostendit difficultatem huius scientiae, ibi, omnino autem et penitus, et difficillimorum et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo enim ostendit dignitatem huius scientiae. Secundo utilitatem eius, ibi, videtur autem et ad veritatem, et cetera.
          <td>2. In the present treatise on the soul we find, first, an Introduction: in which the author does the three things that should be done in any Introduction. For in writing an Introduction one has three objects in view: first, to gain the reader’s good will; secondly, to dispose him to learn; thirdly, to win his attention. The first object one achieves by showing the reader the value of the knowledge in question; the second by explaining the plan and divisions of the treatise; the third by warning him of its difficulties. And all this Aristotle does here. First, he points out the high value of the science he is introducing. Secondly, at ‘We seek then,’ he explains the plan of the treatise. Thirdly, at ‘To ascertain anything reliable’ he warns of its difficulty. Under the first point he explains, first the dignity of this science, and then, at ‘Indeed, an acquaintance,’ its utility.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum sciendum est, quod omnis scientia bona est: et non solum bona, verum etiam honorabilis. Nihilominus tamen una scientia in hoc superexcellit aliam. Quod autem omnis scientia sit bona, patet; quia bonum rei est illud, secundum quod res habet esse perfectum: hoc enim unaquaeque res quaerit et desiderat. Cum igitur scientia sit perfectio hominis, inquantum homo, scientia est bonum hominis. Inter bona autem quaedam sunt laudabilia, illa scilicet quae sunt utilia in ordine ad finem aliquem: laudamus enim bonum equum, quia bene currit; quaedam vero sunt etiam honorabilia, illa scilicet quae sunt propter seipsa; honoramus enim fines. In scientiis autem quaedam sunt practicae, et quaedam speculativae: et hae differunt, quia practicae sunt propter opus, speculativae autem propter seipsas. Et ideo scientiarum, speculativae, et bonae sunt et honorabiles, practicae vero laudabiles tantum. Omnis ergo scientia speculativa bona est et honorabilis.
          <td>3. As regards, then, the said dignity we should note that, while all knowledge is good and even honourable, one science can surpass another in this respect. All knowledge is obviously good because the good of anything is that which belongs to the fulness of being which all things seek after and desire; and man as man reaches fulness of being through knowledge. Now of good things some are just valuable, namely, those which are useful in view of some end—as we value a good horse because it runs well; whilst other good things are also honourable: namely, those that exist for their own sake; for we give honour to ends, not means. Of the sciences some are practical, others speculative; the difference being that the former are for the sake of some work to be done, while the latter arc for their own sake. The speculative sciences are therefore honourable as well as good, but the practical are only valuable. Every speculative science is both good and honourable.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed et in ipsis scientiis speculativis invenitur gradus quantum ad bonitatem et honorabilitatem. Scientia namque omnis ex actu laudatur: omnis autem actus laudatur ex duobus: ex obiecto et qualitate seu modo: sicut aedificare est melius quam facere lectum, quia obiectum aedificationis est melius lecto. In eodem autem, respectu eiusdem rei, ipsa qualitas gradum quemdam facit; quia quanto modus aedificii est melior, tanto melius est aedificium. Sic ergo, si consideretur scientia, seu actus eius, ex obiecto, patet, quod illa scientia est nobilior, quae est meliorum et honorabiliorum. Si vero consideretur ex qualitate seu modo, sic scientia illa est nobilior, quae est certior. Sic ergo dicitur una scientia magis nobilis altera, aut quia est meliorum et honorabiliorum, aut quia est magis certa.
          <td>4. Yet even among the speculative sciences there are degrees of goodness and honourableness. Every science is valued first of all as a kind of activity, and the worth of any activity is reckoned in two ways: from its object and from its mode or quality. Thus building is a better activity than bed-making because its object is better. But where the activities are the same in kind, and result in the same thing, the quality ‘alone makes a difference; if a building is better built it will be a better building. Considering then science, or its activity, from the point of view of the object, that science is nobler which is concerned with better and nobler things; but from the point of view of mode or quality, the nobler science is that which is more certain. One science, then, is reckoned nobler than another, either because it concerns better and nobler objects or because it is more certain.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc est in quibusdam scientiis diversum: quia aliquae sunt magis certae aliis, et tamen sunt de rebus minus honorabilibus: aliae vero sunt de rebus magis honorabilibus et melioribus, et tamen sunt minus certae. Nihilominus tamen illa est melior quae de rebus melioribus et honorabilioribus est. Cuius ratio est, quia sicut dicit philosophus in Lib. undecimo de animalibus, magis concupiscimus scire modicum de rebus honorabilibus et altissimis, etiam si topice et probabiliter illud sciamus, quam scire multum, et per certitudinem, de rebus minus nobilibus. Hoc enim habet nobilitatem ex se et ex sua substantia, illud vero ex modo et ex qualitate.
          <td>5. Now there is this difference between sciences, that some excel in certainty and yet are concerned with inferior objects, while others with higher and better objects are nevertheless less certain. All the same, that science is the better which is about things; because, as the Philosopher observes in Book XI of the <i>De Animalibus</i> , we have a greater desire for even a little knowledge of noble and exalted things—even for a conjectural and probable sort of knowledge—than for a great and certain knowledge of inferior things. For the former is noble in itself and essential, but the latter only through its quality or mode.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Haec autem scientia, scilicet de anima, utrumque habet: quia et certa est, hoc enim quilibet experitur in seipso, quod scilicet habeat animam, et quod anima vivificet. Et quia est nobilior: anima enim est nobilior inter inferiores creaturas. Et hoc est quod dicit, nos opinantes notitiam, idest scientiam speculativam omnium esse bonorum, id est de numero bonorum, et honorabilium. Sed altera scientia est magis bona et honorabilis altera dupliciter. Aut quia est magis certa, ut dictum est: unde dicit secundum certitudinem, aut ex eo quod meliorum, illorum scilicet quae sunt in sua natura bona, et mirabiliorum, idest illorum quorum causa ignoratur, propter utraque, idest propter haec duo animae historiam. Et dicit historiam, quia in quadam summa tractat de anima, non perveniendo ad finalem inquisitionem omnium quae pertinent ad ipsam animam, in hoc tractatu. Hoc enim est de ratione historiae. In primis hoc si accipiatur quantum ad totam scientiam naturalem, non dicit ordinem, sed dignitatem. Si vero ad scientiam de rebus animatis tantum, sic in primis dicit ordinem.
          <td>6. Now this science of the soul has both merits. It has certainty; for everyone knows by experience that he has a soul which is his life-principle. Also it has a high degree of nobility; for among lower things the soul has a special nobility. This is what Aristotle means here when he says, ‘Holding as we do that knowledge’, i.e. speculative science, ‘is good and honourable.’ And one science is better and nobler than another in two ways: either, as we have seen, because it is more certain—hence he says ‘more certain’,—or because it is about ‘more excellent’ things, i.e. things that are good in themselves, and ‘more wonderful things’, i.e. things whose cause is unknown. ‘For both these reasons’, he goes on to say, ‘we give a primary place to an enquiry about the soul’. He uses the term ‘enquiry’ because he is going to discuss the soul in a general way, without attempting, in this treatise, a thorough examination of all its properties. As to the words ‘a primary place’, if they are taken as applying to the whole of Natural Science, then they refer to superiority in dignity and not to priority in order; but if they refer to the science of living things only, they mean priority of order.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit videtur autem reddit auditorem benevolum ex utilitate huius scientiae: dicens, quod cognitio de anima videtur multum proficere ad omnem veritatem, quae traditur in aliis scientiis. Ad omnes enim partes philosophiae insignes dat occasiones. Quia si ad philosophiam primam attendamus, non possumus devenire in cognitionem divinarum et altissimarum causarum, nisi per ea quae ex virtute intellectus possibilis acquirimus. Si enim natura intellectus possibilis esset nobis ignota, non possemus scire ordinem substantiarum separatarum, sicut dicit Commentator super undecimo metaphysicae. Si vero attendatur quantum ad moralem, non possumus perfecte ad scientiam moralem pervenire, nisi sciamus potentias animae. Et inde est, quod philosophus in Ethicis attribuit quaslibet virtutes diversis potentiis animae. Ad naturalem vero utilis est, quia magna pars naturalium est habens animam, et ipsa anima est fons et principium omnis motus in rebus animatis. Est enim anima tamquam principium animalium. Ly tamquam non ponitur similitudinarie, sed expressive.
          <td>7. Then, with ‘Indeed an acquaintance etc.,’ he gains the reader’s good will by showing the utility of this science. Some knowledge of the soul he says, would seem to be very useful in all the other sciences. it can be of considerable service to philosophy in general. In First Philosophy it is impossible to attain knowledge of the divine and highest causes except through what we can acquire by actualising our intellectual power; and if we knew nothing about the nature of this power we should know nothing about the immaterial substances, as the Commentator remarks à propos of Book XI of the <i>Metaphysics</i> . Again, as regards Moral Philosophy. We cannot master the science of morals unless we know the powers of the soul; thus in the <i>Ethics</i> the Philosopher assigns the virtues to the different powers. So, too, it is useful for the Natural Scientist, because many of the things he studies are animate things, all of whose movements originate in the soul: ‘for it is,’ says Aristotle, ‘as it were, the principle of living things’: the phrase ‘as it were’ does not express a comparison; it is descriptive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit inquirimus autem ostendit ordinem huius tractatus: dicens, quod intendimus considerare per signa scilicet, et cognoscere per demonstrationem scilicet, quid sit anima, seu naturam ipsius et substantiam, et postea quaecumque accidunt circa ipsam, idest passiones eius. Et in hoc est quaedam diversitas: quia quaedam videntur passiones animae tantum, sicut intelligentia et speculatio: quaedam vero per ipsam animam inesse videntur communiter animalibus, sicut delectatio et tristitia, sensus et phantasia.
          <td>8. Next, at ‘We seek then’, he states the plan of his treatise, saying that we are ‘to consider’, i.e. by way of outward symptoms, and ‘to understand’, i.e. by way of demonstration, what the soul really is in its nature and essence; and then whatever qualities belong to it or affect it. But in the latter a diversity appears: for while some of the soul’s modifications, such as understanding and speculative knowledge, seem to belong to the soul of and in itself, others, such as pleasure and pain, the senses and imagination, though they depend on some soul or other, seem to be common to all animals.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit omnino autem ostendit difficultatem huius tractatus. Et hoc quantum ad duo. Primo quantum ad cognoscendum substantiam animae. Secundo quantum ad cognoscendum accidentia, seu proprias passiones, ibi, dubitationem autem, et cetera. Quantum autem ad primum, ostendit duplicem difficultatem. Et primo quantum ad modum definiendi ipsam. Secundo quantum ad ea quae intrant definitionem, ibi, primum autem fortassis, et cetera.
          <td>9. Then at ‘To ascertain’, he introduces the difficulty of this study; and this from two points of view. It is hard, first, to know the essence of the soul, and secondly to know its accidents or characteristic qualities. As to the essence, there is a double difficulty: first, as to how it ought to be defined, and then as to the elements of the definition (this point comes at ‘Perhaps the first thing needed’).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo: quamvis sit utilis scientia de anima, tamen difficile est scire de anima quid est: et haec est difficultas in qualibet re, cum sit una communis quaestio animae et multis aliis, circa substantiam eorum, et circa quod quid est. Est ergo prima difficultas, quia nos nescimus per quam viam procedendum sit ad definitionem: quia quidam dicunt, quod demonstrando: quidam, quod dividendo: quidam vero, quod componendo. Aristoteles autem voluit, quod componendo.
          <td>He remarks, therefore, that while knowledge of the soul would be valuable, it is not easy to know just what the soul is. Now this is a difficulty in studying anything; for the question about substance and essence is common to the study of soul and of many other things; the first difficulty being that we do not know what method to use; for some say we should use deductive demonstration, others the method of elimination, others one of comparison. Aristotle himself preferred the method of comparison.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda difficultas est de his quae ponuntur in definitione. Definitio enim notificat essentiam rei, quae non potest sciri nisi sciantur principia: sed diversorum sunt diversa principia: et ideo difficile est scire, ex quibus sumantur principia. Illa ergo quae ingerunt difficultatem ponentibus et inquirentibus definitionem, reducuntur ad tria, quorum primum est circa substantiam animae; secundum circa partes eius; tertium circa adiutorium, quod necessarium est in definitionibus ex accidentibus animae.
          <td>10. The second difficulty concerns the elements of the definition. A definition manifests a thing’s essence; and this cannot be grasped apart from the principles on which it depends. But different things have different principles, and it is hard to see which principle is involved in any particular thing. Hence, in formulating or seeking for a definition of soul we encounter three main difficulties: (a) concerning its essence; (b) concerning its parts; (c) concerning that necessary contribution to a definition which comes from knowing the soul’s accidental qualities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa substantiam est dubitatio de genere. Hoc enim primo quaerimus in definitione cuiuslibet rei, ut scilicet sciamus genus. Et ideo quaerendum est in quo genere sit ponenda anima; utrum scilicet in genere substantiae, vel in quanto, vel in quali. Et non solum est accipere genus supremum, sed propinquum. Neque enim quando hominem definimus, substantiam accipimus, sed animal. Et si anima invenitur in genere substantiae, adhuc, cum unumquodque genus dicatur dupliciter, hoc quidem potentia, hoc autem actu, quaerendum erit utrum sit potentia, vel actus. Item quia substantiarum quaedam sunt compositae, quaedam simplices, quaerendum erit, utrum anima sit composita, aut simplex; et utrum partibilis vel impartibilis. Est etiam quaestio utrum sit unius speciei omnis anima ad omnem animam, aut non. Et si non sit unius speciei, adhuc est quaestio utrum differant etiam genere, vel non. Item adhuc dubitatio est circa ea quae participant definitione. Quaedam enim definiuntur ut genus, quaedam vero ut species. Et ideo videtur esse quaestio, utrum definitio animae sit sicut generis, aut sicut speciei specialissimae.
          <td>11. As regards the essence of soul, there is a doubt about that which is the first thing to be looked for in defining anything, i.e. the genus to which it belongs. What is the genus of soul? Is it a substance or a quantity or a quality? And not only must we decide upon the ultimate genus, but also on the proximate one; thus we do not define man as a substance, but as an animal. And if soul is found to belong to the genus of substance we shall still have to decide whether it is actual or potential substance, since every genus can be regarded both as potential and as actual. Also, since substances are either composite or simple, we shall have to ask which is one or the other and whether it is divisible or indivisible. There is also the question whether all souls are of the same species or not; and if they are not, whether they are generically different or not. Again there is uncertainty as to what is to be included in the definition, some things being defined in terms of genus, some as species; hence the question whether we should define soul in terms of genus or as the specification of a species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nam aliqui quaerentes de anima videntur intendere solum de anima humana. Et quia apud antiquos philosophos erat duplex opinio de anima. Platonici enim, qui ponebant universalia separata, scilicet quod essent formae et ideae, et erant causae rebus particularibus cognitionis et esse, volebant quod esset quaedam anima separata per se, quae esset causa et idea animabus particularibus; et quod quicquid invenitur in eis, derivetur ab illa. Naturales autem philosophi volebant, quod non essent substantiae universales nisi particulares tantum, et quod universalia nihil sint in rerum natura. Et propter hoc est quaestio, utrum sit quaerenda solum una communis ratio animae, sicut dicebant Platonici: vel huius vel illius animae, sicut dicebant naturales, scilicet ut animae equi, vel hominis, aut Dei. Et dicit Dei quia credebant corpora caelestia esse deos, et dicebant ea esse animata.
          <td>12. For some enquirers seem to have in view only the human soul. Among the earlier philosophers there were two opinions about soul. The Platonists, holding that universals existed separately as the Forms or Ideas that caused knowledge and being in individual things, maintained that there was a Soul-in-Itself which was the cause and ‘idea’ of particular souls and from which all that we find in these drew its origin. On the other hand were the Natural Philosophers who maintained that no universal substances existed in the real world, that the only real things were individuals. And this raises the question for us, whether we, like the Platonists, ought to look for one common idea of Soul; or rather, as the Natural Philosophers said, study this or that particular soul, e.g. of horse or man, or god. He says ‘or god’ because at that time men believed that the heavenly bodies were gods, and that they were alive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aristoteles autem vult quod quaeratur ratio utriusque: et communis animae, et cuiuslibet speciei. Quod autem circa hoc dicit animal autem universale, aut nihil est, aut posterius: sciendum est, quod de animali universali possumus loqui dupliciter: quia aut secundum quod est universale, quod scilicet est unum in multis aut de multis: aut secundum quod est animal: et hoc, vel secundum quod in rerum natura, vel secundum quod est in intellectu. Secundum autem quod est in rerum natura, Plato voluit animal universale aliquid esse, et esse prius particulari; quia, ut dictum est, posuit universalia separata et ideas. Aristoteles autem vult quod ut sic, nihil est in rerum natura. Et si aliquid est, dixit illud esse posterius. Si autem accipiamus naturam animalis non secundum quod subiacet intentioni universalitatis, sic aliquid est, et prius, sicut quod est in potentia, prius est, quam id quod est actu.
          <td>13. However, Aristotle chose to seek a definition of both—of Soul in general and of each kind of soul. But when he says, on this point, that ‘animal as universal is nothing real, or is secondary’, we must understand that one can speak of a ‘universal animal’ in two ways: either as universal, i.e. as one nature existing in, or predicated of, many individuals; or as animal. And both these aspects can be regarded either in relation to existence in the real world or as existing in the mind. As regards existence in the real, world, Plato held that the universal animal did so exist and existed prior to particular animals; because, as has been said, he thought that there were universals and ideas with an independent existence. Aristotle, however, said that the universal as such had no real existence, and that if it was anything at all it came after the individual thing. But if we regard the nature of animals from a different point of view, i.e. not as a universal, then it is indeed something real, and it precedes the individual animal as the potential precedes the actual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit amplius autem tangit difficultates, quae emergunt circa potentias animae. In anima enim sunt partes potentiales, scilicet intellectivum, sensitivum et vegetativum. Est ergo quaestio, utrum hae sint diversae animae, sicut Platonici volebant, et etiam ponebant: an sint partes potentiales animae. Et si sint partes potentiales animae, quaeritur etiam, utrum primo debeamus quaerere potentias ipsas quam actus, aut primo actus quam potentias, ut intelligere ante intellectum, et sentire, quod est actus, ante sensitivum quod est potentia, et similiter in aliis potentiis et actibus. Et si primo debemus quaerere actus quam potentias, adhuc erit quaestio utrum sint prius quaerenda obiecta horum actuum quam potentiae, ut puta prius debeat quaeri sensibile quam sensitivum, aut intelligibile quam intellectivum.
          <td>14. Then, at ‘Further, if there are not many’, Aristotle touches on the difficulties that arise concerning the soul’s potentialities. For, in, the soul are ‘parts’ that exist as potencies: the intellectual and sensitive and vegetative ‘parts’. The question is whether these are different souls, as the Platonists liked to think (and even maintained), or are only potencies in the soul. And if they are potencies, we must further decide whether to enquire first into the potencies themselves, and then into their acts, or into the acts first and then the potencies—e.g. into the act of understanding before the intellect. And if we take the acts first, there is still the question whether the objects of these acts should be studied before the faculties, e.g. the sense-object before the sense-faculty or the thing understood before the understanding.

Sed quia principia essentialia rerum sunt nobis ignota, ideo oportet quod utamur differentiis accidentalibus in designatione essentialium: bipes enim non est essentiale, sed ponitur in designatione essentialis. Et per eas, scilicet per differentias accidentales, devenimus in cognitionem essentialium. Et ideo difficile est, quia oportet nos prius cognoscere quod quid est animae, ad cognoscendum facilius accidentia animae: sicut in mathematicis valde utile est praeaccipere quodquid erat esse recti et curvi et plani ad cognoscendum quod rectis trianguli anguli sint aequales. E converso etiam accidentia, si praeaccipiantur, multum conferunt ad cognoscendum quod quid erat esse, ut dictum est. Si quis ergo assignet definitionem, per quam non deveniatur in cognitionem accidentium rei definitae, illa definitio non est realis, sed remota et dialectica. Sed illa definitio per quam devenitur in cognitionem accidentium, est realis, et ex propriis, et essentialibus rei.
          <td>15. Next, at ‘Now it seems’, he states the difficulties that arise with regard to those accidental qualities which contribute to a definition of the soul. These are relevant here because a definition ought to reveal a thing’s accidental qualities, as well as its essential principles. If indeed the latter could be known and correctly defined there would be no need, to define the former; but since the essential principles of things are hidden from us we are compelled to make use of accidental differences as indications of what is essential. Thus to be two-footed is not of the essence of anything, yet it helps to indicate an essence. By such accidental differences we are led towards knowledge of the essential ones. It would indeed be easier to grasp even What is accidental to the soul if we could only first understand its essence, just, as in mathematics, it is a great help towards understanding that the angles of a triangle are equal to (two) right angles to know first what is meant by straight, curved and plane. Hence the difficulty of our present position. On the other hand a prior examination of the accidental factors is a considerable help towards knowing the essence, as has been said. if, therefore, one were to propose a definition from which no knowledge of the accidental attributes of the defined thing could be derived, such a definition would not be real, but abstract and hypothetical. But one from which a knowledge of the accidents flows is a real definition, based on what is proper and essential to the thing.

            <td>It is necessary indeed, but not easy, to deal with this problem. For in most cases there is, apparently, no action or being acted on without the body; as in anger, desire, confidence, and sensation in general. Understanding however would seem especially proper to the soul. Yet if this too is a sort of imagination, or never occurs without it, not even this exists, in fact, apart from the body. § 17-20

If, however, there is nothing thus proper to it, then it is not separable, but is like a straight line, which has, as such, many properties—such as being able to touch a bronze sphere at a given point; but straightness separated does not touch it; not being in fact separable, since it is always with a bodily subject. § 21

            <td>Now all the soul’s modifications do seem to involve the body—anger, meekness, fear, compassion, and joy and love and hate. For along with these the body also is to some degree affected. An indication of this is that sometimes violent and unmistakable occurrences arouse no excitement or alarm; while at other times one is moved by slight and trifling matters, when the physical system is stimulated to the condition appropriate to anger. This is still more evident fearful being present, feelings occur as in one when, nothing who is frightened. If this is the case, it is evident that the passions are material principles; hence such terms as ‘becoming angry’ mean a motion of such and such a body, or of a part or power proceeding from and existing for the body. § 22

          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit difficultatem, quae est in scientia de anima ex parte substantiae, et quod quid est animae: hic consequenter ostendit difficultatem, quae est ex parte passionum et accidentium animae. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo movet dubitationem circa passiones animae, et solvit eam. Secundo ex huiusmodi solutione ostendit, quod cognitio de anima pertinet ad philosophum naturalem, seu ad physicum, ibi, et propter hoc igitur iam physici, et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod dubitatio est circa passiones animae, et operationes, utrum scilicet essent animae propriae sine communicatione corporis, ut Platoni videbatur: vel nulla sit propria animae, sed omnes sint communes corporis et compositi.
          <td>16. Having stated the difficulty of this science in respect of the problem of the soul’s substance and essence, the Philosopher proceeds to the problem of its modifications and accidental qualities. And here he does two things: he states, first, and solves a difficulty concerning the soul’s modifications; and then, using this solution, ‘he shows that knowledge of the soul pertains to natural science or ‘physics’, where he says, ‘For this reason, therefore, the natural scientist’. As to the first point, he says it is a problem whether the soul’s modifications and activities belong to it independently of the body, as Plato thought, or are none of them peculiar to the soul, being all shared by soul and body together.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit hoc enim circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim ostendit difficultatem huiusmodi quaestionis. Secundo vero necessitatem, ibi, si quidem igitur est aliquid. Dicit ergo primo, quod accipere hoc, scilicet utrum passiones et operationes animae sint communes vel propriae, est necessarium, et non est leve, sed valde difficile. Et quod sit difficile, ostendit dicens: quod causa difficultatis est, quia in apparenti videtur, quod multae passiones sint communes, et non sit pati sine corpore, ut puta irasci et sentire et huiusmodi, quorum nihil patitur anima sine corpore. Sed si aliqua operatio esset propria animae, appareret hoc de operatione intellectus. Intelligere enim, quae est operatio intellectus, maxime videtur proprium esse animae.
          <td>17. Going on at ‘It is necessary,’ he again does two things. First he shows the difficulty of the question, and then, at ‘But if the Soul,’ the necessity of putting it. He begins then by observing that we cannot avoid the question whether the soul’s modes and activities are proper to it or shared by the body, and that this is not an easy question but a very difficult one. The difficulty, as he explains, arises from the fact that many activities seem to be common to soul and body and to require the body, for instance, getting angry and having sensations and so on; which all involve body as well as soul. If there is anything peculiar to the soul it would appear to be the intellectual activity or understanding; this seems to belong to the soul in a special way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si quis tamen recte consideret, non videtur proprium animae intelligere. Cum enim intelligere, vel sit phantasia, ut Platonici ponebant, aut non sit sine phantasia: (fuerunt enim quidam sicut antiqui naturales qui dicebant, quod intellectus non differebat a sensu, et si hoc esset, tunc intellectus in nullo differret a phantasia; et ideo Platonici moti sunt ad ponendum intellectum esse phantasiam). Cum ergo phantasia indigeat corpore, dicebant quod intelligere non est proprium animae, sed commune animae et corpori. Si autem detur, quod intellectus non sit phantasia, nihilominus tamen non est intelligere sine phantasia. Restat igitur quod intelligere non est proprium animae, cum phantasia indigeat corpore. Non ergo contingit hoc, scilicet intelligere, esse sine corpore.
          <td>18. And yet, on closer consideration, even understanding would not seem to pertain to the soul alone. For either it is the same as imagination, as the Platonists thought, or it does not occur without the use of imagination (for there used to be men, such as the early natural philosophers, who said that intellect in no way differed from the senses, which would imply that it does not differ from the imagination; as indeed the Platonists were led to say). As, then, imagination presupposes the body and depends on it, they said that understanding was common to soul and body together, rather than the work of the soul alone. And even granted that intellect and imagination are not identical, still the one cannot function without the other. It would follow that understanding is not of the soul alone, since imagining presupposes the body. Understanding then, it seems, does not occur where there is no body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quamvis autem hoc Aristoteles scilicet aperte manifestet in tertio huius, nihilominus tamen quantum ad hoc aliquid exponemus. Nam intelligere quodammodo est proprium animae, quodammodo est coniuncti. Sciendum est igitur, quod aliqua operatio animae aut passio est, quae indiget corpore sicut instrumento et sicut obiecto. Sicut videre indiget corpore, sicut obiecto, quia color, qui est obiectum visus, est in corpore. Item sicut instrumento; quia visio, etsi sit ab anima, non est tamen nisi per organum visus, scilicet pupillam, quae est ut instrumentum; et sic videre non est animae tantum, sed est organi. Aliqua autem operatio est, quae indiget corpore, non tamen sicut instrumento, sed sicut obiecto tantum. Intelligere enim non est per organum corporale, sed indiget obiecto corporali. Sicut enim philosophus dicit in tertio huius, hoc modo phantasmata se habent ad intellectum, sicut colores ad visum. Colores autem se habent ad visum, sicut obiecta: phantasmata ergo se habent ad intellectum sicut obiecta. Cum autem phantasmata non sint sine corpore, videtur quod intelligere non est sine corpore: ita tamen quod sit sicut obiectum et non sicut instrumentum.
          <td>19. Now although Aristotle clears up this problem in Book III, we shall say something about it here. Understanding, then, is in one sense, proper to the soul alone, and in another sense common to both soul and body. For it should be realised that certain activities or modifications of the soul depend on the body both as an instrument and as an object. Sight, for instance, needs a body as object—because its object is colour, which is only found in bodies;—and also as an instrument—because, while the act of seeing involves the soul, it cannot occur except through the instrumentality of a visual organ, the pupil of the eye. Sight then is the act of the organ as well as of the soul. But there is one activity which only depends on the body to provide its object, not its instrument; for understanding is not accomplished with a bodily organ, though it does bear on a bodily object; because, as will be shown later, in Book III, the phantasms in the imagination are to the intellect as colours to sight: as colours provide sight with its object, so do the phantasms serve the intellect. Since then there cannot be phantasms without a body, it seems that understanding presupposes a body-not, however, as its instrument, but simply as its object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hoc duo sequuntur. Unum est, quod intelligere est propria operatio animae, et non indiget corpore nisi ut obiecto tantum, ut dictum est: videre autem et aliae operationes et passiones non sunt animae tantum, sed coniuncti. Aliud est, quod illud, quod habet operationem per se, habet etiam esse et subsistentiam per se; et illud, quod non habet operationem per se, non habet esse per se. Et ideo intellectus est forma subsistens, aliae potentiae sunt formae in materia. Et in hoc erat difficultas huiusmodi quaestionis, quia scilicet omnes passiones animae secundum apparentiam videntur esse coniuncti.
          <td>20. Two things follow from this. (1) Understanding is an act proper to the soul alone, needing the body, as was said above, only to provide its object; whereas seeing and various other functions involve the compound of soul and body together. (2) Whatever operates of itself independently, has also an independent being and subsistence of its own; which is not the case where the operation is not independent. Intellect then is a self-subsistent actuality, whereas the other faculties are actualities existing in matter. And the difficulty in dealing with this type of question arises simply from the fact that all functions of the soul seem at first sight to be also functions of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit si quidem assignat causam necessitatis huius quaestionis, quia scilicet ex hoc habetur unum quod omnes maxime scire desiderant circa animam, utrum scilicet contingat animam separari: dicens, quod si contingat aliquam propriam operationem aut passionem animae esse, utique continget ipsam animam separari a corpore; quia, ut dictum est, quod habet operationem per se, habet etiam esse et subsistentiam per se. Si vero non esset aliqua propria operatio seu passio animae, eadem ratione non contingeret ipsam animam separari a corpore, sed erit de anima sicut de recto. Licet enim multa accidant recto inquantum rectum, scilicet tangere aeneam sphaeram secundum punctum, non tamen accidit ei nisi in materia: non enim tangit rectum in puncto aeneam sphaeram nisi in materia. Sic erit de anima, si non habet propriam operationem, quod licet ei multa accidant, non tamen accidunt ei nisi in materia.
          <td>21. After this, when Aristotle says ‘But if the soul’, he states a reason for putting this question, namely, that on its answer depends the answer to a question that everyone asks very eagerly about the soul: whether it can be separated from the body. So he says that if the soul has any function proper to itself it can certainly be separated, because, as was pointed out above, whatever can operate on ,its own can exist on its own. Conversely, if the soul had no such proper function it would not be separable from the body; it would be in the same case as a straight line—for though many things can happen to a straight line qua straight line, such as touching a brass sphere at a certain point, still they can only come about in a material way: a straight line cannot touch a brass sphere at any point except materially. So also with the soul; if it has no activity proper to itself, then, however many things affect it, they win do so only in a material way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit videntur autem manifestat illud quod supra supposuerat, quod scilicet quaedam passiones animae sunt coniuncti, et non animae tantum. Manifestat autem hoc ex uno, quod consistit ex duobus. Cuius ratio talis est. Omne ad quod operatur complexio corporis non est animae tantum, sed etiam corporis: sed complexio corporis operatur ad omnes passiones animae, ut puta ad iram, mansuetudinem, timorem, confidentiam, misericordiam et huiusmodi: videntur ergo animae passiones omnes esse cum corpore. Et quod ad huiusmodi passiones operetur complexio corporis, probat dupliciter. Primo sic. Quia nos videmus quod aliquando superveniunt durae et manifestae passiones, et homo non provocatur, neque timet; sed si accendatur ex furore, seu ex complexione, corpus a valde parvis et debilibus movetur, et sic se habet sicut cum irascitur. Secundo probat dicens adhuc fit magis manifestum quod ad huiusmodi passiones operetur complexio corporis. Videmus enim quod etiam si nullum immineat periculum, fiunt in aliquibus passiones similes his passionibus quae sunt circa animam, ut puta melancholicis frequenter, si nullum periculum immineat, ex ipsa complexione inordinata fiunt timentes. Ergo, quia sic se habet, scilicet quod complexio operetur ad passiones huiusmodi, manifestum est quod huiusmodi passiones sunt rationes in materia, idest habentes esse in materia. Et propter hoc termini tales, idest definitiones harum passionum, non assignantur sine materia: sicut si definiatur ira, dicetur quod est motus talis corporis sive cordis, aut partis, aut potentiae: et hoc dicit quantum ad substantiam seu causam materialem: ab hoc quantum ad causam efficientem: gratia huius quantum ad causam finalem.
          <td>22. Next, when he says ‘Now all the soul’s,’ he draws out what had been presupposed above, namely that certain modifications affect soul and body together, not the soul alone. And this he shows by one argument in two parts; which runs as follows. Whenever the physical constitution of the body contributes to a vital activity, the latter pertains to the body as well as the soul; but this happens in the case of all the ‘modifications’ of the soul, such as anger, meekness, fear, confidence, pity and so forth, hence all these ‘modifications’ would seem to belong partly to the body. And to show that the physical constitution plays a part in them he uses two arguments. (1) We sometimes see a man beset by obvious and severe afflictions without being provoked or frightened, whereas when he is already excited by violent passions arising from his bodily disposition, he is disturbed by mere trifles and behaves as though he were really angry. (2) At ‘This is still more evident:’ what makes this point even clearer is that we see in some people, even when there is no danger present, passions arising that resemble one such ‘modification’ of the soul; for instance melancholy people, simply as a result of their physical state, are often timid when there is no real cause to be. Obviously then, if the bodily constitution has this effect on the passions, the latter must be ‘material principles’, i.e. must exist in matter. This is why ‘such terms,’ i.e. the definitions of these passions, are not to be predicated without reference to matter; so that if anger is being defined, let it be called a movement ‘of some body’ such as the heart, or ‘of some part or power’ of the body. Saying this he refers to the subject or material cause of the passion; whereas ‘proceeding from’ refers to the efficient cause; and ‘existing for’ to the final cause.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit et propter concludit ex his, quae dicta sunt, quod consideratio de anima pertinet ad naturalem. Et hoc ex modo definiendi concludit. Et ideo hic duo facit. Primo probat propositum. Secundo insistit circa definitiones, ibi, differenter autem definiet et cetera. Probat autem propositum hoc modo. Operationes animae et passiones sunt operationes corporis et passiones, ut ostensum est. Omnis autem passio, cum definitur, oportet quod habeat in sui definitione illud cuius est passio; nam subiectum semper cadit in definitione passionis. Si ergo passiones huiusmodi non sunt tantum animae, sed etiam corporis; de necessitate oportet quod in definitione ipsarum ponatur corpus: sed omne, in quo est corpus, seu materia, pertinet ad naturalem: ergo et passiones huiusmodi pertinent ad naturalem. Sed cuius est considerare passiones, eius est considerare subiectum ipsarum. Et ideo iam physici est considerare de anima aut omni simpliciter aut huiusmodi scilicet de ea quae est affixa corpori. Et hoc dicit, quia reliquerat sub dubio utrum intellectus sit potentia affixa corpori.
          <td>23. Then at ‘For this reason,’ he concludes from the foregoing that the study of the soul pertains to natural science—a conclusion following from the way the soul is defined. So he does two things here: (1) he proves his statement; (2) he pursues his discussion of definitions, where he says ‘the natural scientist and the dialectician’. The proof of his statement runs thus. Activities and dispositions of the soul are also activities and dispositions of the body, as has been shown. But the definition of any disposition must include that which is disposed; for its subject always falls within the definition of a disposition. If, then, dispositions of this kind are in the body as well as in the soul, the former must be included in their definition. And since everything bodily or material falls within the scope of natural science, so also must the dispositions of which we speak. Moreover, since the subject of any dispositions enters into the study of them, it must be the task of the natural scientist to study the soul—either absolutely ‘all’ souls, or ‘of this kind’, i.e. the soul that is joined to a body. He adds this because he has left it uncertain whether intellect is joined to the body.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit differenter autem insistit circa definitiones. Quia enim ostendit, quod in definitionibus passionum animae, aliquae sunt, in quibus ponitur materia et corpus, aliquae vero in quibus non ponitur materia, sed forma tantum, ostendit quod huiusmodi definitiones sunt insufficientes. Et circa hoc investigat differentiam, quae invenitur in istis definitionibus. Aliquando enim datur aliqua definitio, in qua nihil est ex parte corporis, sicut quod ira est appetitus vindictae; aliquando assignatur aliqua definitio, in qua est aliquid ex parte corporis seu materiae, sicut quod ira est accensio sanguinis circa cor. Prima est dialectica. Secunda vero est physica, cum ponatur ibi aliquid ex parte materiae; et ideo pertinet ad naturalem. Hic enim, scilicet physicus, assignat materiam, cum dicit, quod est accensio sanguinis circa cor. Alius vero, scilicet dialecticus, ponit speciem et rationem. Hoc enim, scilicet appetitus vindictae, est ratio irae.
          <td>24. Where he says ‘The natural scientist and the dialectician,’ he continues his discussion of definitions. Explaining that, while some definitions of the dispositions of the soul include matter and the body, others exclude matter and refer only to the form, he shows that the latter kind of definition is inadequate. This leads him to go into the difference between these types of definition. Sometimes the body is omitted, as when anger is defined as a desire of revenge; and sometimes the bodily or material factor is included, as when anger is called a heating of blood round the heart. The former is a logical definition, but the latter is physical, since it includes a material factor, and so pertains to the natural scientist. The natural scientist points to the material factor when he says that anger is a heating of blood round the heart; whereas the dialectician points to the species or formal principle; since to call anger a desire of revenge is to state its formal principle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem definitio prima sit insufficiens, manifeste apparet. Nam omnis forma, quae est in materia determinata, nisi in sua definitione ponatur materia, illa definitio est insufficiens: sed haec forma, scilicet appetitus vindictae est forma in materia determinata: unde cum non ponatur in eius definitione materia, constat quod ipsa definitio est insufficiens. Et ideo necesse est ad definitionem, quod in definitione ponatur hoc, scilicet forma, esse in materia huiusmodi, scilicet determinata.
          <td>25. Now the first type of definition is obviously inadequate. The definition of any form existing in a particular matter must take account of the matter. This form, ‘the desire for retaliation’, exists in a definite matter, and if the matter is not included, the definition is clearly inadequate. The definition, then, must state that this thing, i.e. the form, has being in this particular sort of matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sic habemus tres definitiones, quia una assignat speciem et speciei rationem, et est formalis tantum, sicut si definiatur domus quod sit operimentum prohibens a ventis et imbribus et caumatibus. Alia autem assignat materiam, sicut si dicatur quod domus est operimentum quoddam ex lapidibus, lateribus et lignis. Alia vero assignat idest in definitione ponit utrumque, materiam scilicet et formam; dicens, quod domus est operimentum tale constans ex talibus, et propter talia, scilicet ut prohibeat ventos etc. et ideo dicit quod alia definitio scilicet, tria ponit in his scilicet lignis lapidibus quae sunt ex parte materiae speciem idest formam propter ista scilicet ut prohibeat ventos. Et sic complectitur materiam cum dicit in his et formam cum dicit speciem et causam finalem cum dicit propter ista: quae tria requiruntur ad perfectam definitionem.
          <td>26. Thus we have three kinds of definition. The first states the species and specific principle of a thing, and is purely formal—as if one were to define a house as a shelter from wind, rain and heat. The second kind indicates the matter, as when a house is called a shelter made of stones and beams and wood. But the third kind includes in the definition ‘both’, namely matter and form, calling a house a particular kind of shelter, built of particular materials, for a particular purpose—to keep out the wind, etc. So he says that ‘another’ definition has three elements: the material, ‘in these’, i.e. beams and stones; the formal, ‘the form’; and the final, ‘for those reasons’, i.e. to keep out the wind. So matter is included when he says ‘in these’. form when he says ‘form’. and the final cause when he says ‘for those reasons’. All three are needed for a perfect definition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed si quaeratur quae istarum definitionum sit naturalis, et quae non: dicendum, quod illa, quae considerat formam tantum, non est naturalis, sed logica. Illa autem, quae est circa materiam, ignorat autem formam, nullius est nisi naturalis. Nullus enim habet considerare materiam nisi naturalis. Nihilominus tamen illa quae ex utrisque est, scilicet ex materia et forma, est magis naturalis. Et duae harum definitionum pertinent ad naturalem: sed una est imperfecta, scilicet illa quae ponit materiam tantum: alia vero perfecta, scilicet illa quae est ex utrisque. Non enim est aliquis qui consideret passiones materiae non separabiles, nisi physicus.
          <td>27. To the question which of these types of definition pertains to the natural scientist, I answer that the purely formal one is not physical but logical. That which includes matter but omits the form pertains to no one but the natural scientist, because only he is concerned with matter. Yet that which includes both factors is also in a special way the natural scientist’s. Thus two of these definitions pertain to natural science, but of the two the merely material one is imperfect, while the other, that includes the form also, is perfect. For only the natural scientist studies the inseparable dispositions of matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia sunt aliqui, qui aliter considerant passiones materiae, ideo ostendit qui sint, et qualiter considerent: et dicit quod sunt tres. Unum genus est quod differt a naturali quantum ad principium, licet consideret passiones prout sunt in materia; sicut artifex, qui considerat formam in materia, sed differunt, quia huiusmodi principium est ars, physici vero principium est natura. Aliud genus est quod quidem considerat ea quae habent esse in materia sensibili, sed non recipit in definitione materiam sensibilem; sicut curvum, rectum et huiusmodi, licet habeant esse in materia, et sint de numero non separabilium, quantum ad esse, tamen mathematicus non determinat sibi materiam sensibilem. Cuius ratio est, quia res aliquae sunt sensibiles per qualitatem, quantitates autem praeexistunt qualitatibus, unde mathematicus concernit solum id quod quantitatis est absolute, non determinans hanc vel illam materiam. Aliud genus est quod quidem considerat illa quorum esse vel non est in materia omnino, vel quorum esse potest esse sine materia; et hic est philosophus primus.
          <td>28. But there are various ways of studying the dispositions of matter, as Aristotle now proceeds to show. He divides the students of these dispositions into three classes. One class consists of those who, while they study material dispositions, differ from the natural scientist in their point of view; thus the craftsman differs from the scientist in that he starts from the point of view of art, but the natural scientist from that of real nature. Another class consists of those who, though they consider forms that exist in sense-perceptible matter, do not include such matter in their definitions. The forms referred to are such as curved, straight, and so on, which, though they exist in matter and are, in fact, inseparable from it, are not, by the mathematician, regarded under their sense-perceptible aspect. The reason is that if it is through its quality that a thing is sense-perceptible, quality presupposes quantity; hence the mathematician abstracts from this or that particular material factor in order to attend exclusively to the purely quantitative. Finally, the third class studies things whose existence is either completely independent of matter or can be found without matter. This is First Philosophy.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et notandum quod tota ratio divisionis philosophiae sumitur secundum definitionem et modum definiendi. Cuius ratio est, quia definitio est principium demonstrationis rerum, res autem definiuntur per essentialia. Unde diversae definitiones rerum diversa principia essentialia demonstrant, ex quibus una scientia differt ab alia.
          <td>29. Note that this division of Philosophy is entirely based on definition and the method of defining. The reason is that definition is the principle of demonstration. Since things are defined by their essential principles, diverse definitions reveal a diversity of essential principles; and this implies a diversity of sciences.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit sed redeundum quia videbatur fecisse quasdam digressiones ex hoc quod institit ad inquisitionem definitionum, reducit se ad materiam propriam, dicens quod redeundum est ad materiam propriam, unde est sermo habitus, scilicet quod passiones animae, ut amor, timor et huiusmodi, non sunt separabiles a physica materia animalium, inquantum tales existunt, scilicet inquantum passiones quae non sunt sine corpore, et non sunt sicut linea et planum, idest superficies, quae ratione possunt separari a materia naturali. Si ergo ita est, ad naturalem spectat consideratio earum, et etiam animae, sicut supra dictum est.
          <td>30. Then at ‘To return,” he comes back to the matter in hand after the apparent digression about definitions. The point under discussion was that such modifications of the soul as love, fear and so forth are inseparable from physical animal matter inasmuch as they have this sort of existence, i.e. as passions in the body; in which they differ from lines, plane-surfaces and so on, which can be considered by the mind apart from the matter that they naturally imply. If this is the case then the study of such dispositions, and even of the soul itself, becomes, as has been said, the affair of the natural scientist.

          <td>And ‘concerning this’ i.e. the soul, we must, at our present stage, take account of the opinions of the ancients no matter who they were, provided they had anything to say about it.

            <td>Hence Democritus, said it was a kind of fire or heat. There exist an infinite number of shapes and atoms, and those of the spherical kind are, he said, fire and soul: like the dust-motes in the air called ‘atomies’ seen in the rays of the sun in doorways; and of all the seeds of these, he said, are the elements of all Nature. Leucippus had a similar opinion. Those round in shape make the soul, because they are most able to penetrate everywhere, and since they move of themselves, they have also the power to move everything else. The soul, they maintained, is what causes movement in living things: and accordingly breathing is coterminous with living. That which envelops all bodies expels by compression the atoms [within], thus causing movement in animals, for these [atoms] are never at rest. A reinforcement must come therefore [he said] from without; in that other atoms enter by respiration, preventing from dispersal those that are within the animate body, and which simultaneously resist the constraining and compressing environment; and that animals live so long as they can do this. § 34-5

          <td>Supra posuit philosophus prooemium, in quo intentionem suam, quid agendum, et difficultatem huius operis ostendit: hic vero prosequitur tractatum secundum ordinem promissum. Dividitur autem tractatus iste in duas partes. Primo enim tractat de natura animae secundum opinionem aliorum philosophorum. Secundo vero secundum veritatem; et hoc in secundo libro. Prima pars dividitur in duas partes. Primo enim narrat opiniones aliorum philosophorum de anima. Secundo vero inquirit de opinionibus illis, ibi, considerandum est autem et cetera. Prima pars dividitur in duas. Primo enim ostendit ex quibus philosophi habuerunt viam ad investigandum de anima.

          <td>31. So much by way of Introduction. The Philosopher has stated his aim in general and the difficulty of the undertaking; which he now proceeds to carry out in the order already indicated. The whole treatise divides into two parts. In the first the soul’s nature is discussed as other philosophers have regarded it; but in the second as it is in reality. The latter section begins at Book II. The first part itself has two parts. The former simply relates the opinions of other philosophers; the second, beginning at ‘The first thing to be considered,’ examines them. The former part itself divides into two parts, in the first of which Aristotle distinguishes between the starting points of the other philosophers, while in the second, starting at ‘For some say’, he shows how they severally came to hold their different opinions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod principium nostrae quaestionis, idest inquisitionis, est apponere omnia quae secundum naturam videntur inesse animae. Circa quod sciendum est, quod quando invenimus aliqua differre secundum aliquid manifestum, et secundum aliud immanifestum, certum est quod per id quod est manifestum, venimus in notitiam illius quod est immanifestum. Et hunc modum tenuerunt philosophi ad inveniendum naturam de anima. Animata enim ab inanimatis differunt, per hoc quod animata habent animam, inanimata vero non. Sed quia natura animae erat immanifesta, et non poterat investigari nisi per aliqua manifesta, in quibus differunt animata ab inanimatis, invenerunt illa, et secundum illa conati sunt devenire in cognitionem naturae animae. Illa autem manifesta in quibus animata differunt ab inanimatis, sunt duo, scilicet sentire et moveri. Nam animata videntur differre ab inanimatis maxime motu, ut scilicet moveant seipsa, et sensu seu cognitione. Unde credebant quod quando scirent principia istorum duorum, scirent quid est anima. Unde laboraverunt causam motus et sensus scire, ut per hoc scirent naturam animae: et credebant quod id quod est causa motus et sensus, esset anima: et in hoc omnes antiqui philosophi conveniebant. Sed ex hoc antiqui in diversas opiniones divisi sunt. Nam aliqui conati sunt devenire in cognitionem animae per motum, aliqui vero per sensum.
          <td>32. First of all then he says that one ought to start by gathering together everything that would seem to belong to the soul by nature. As to this, we should note that when we find things differing both by clear and understandable differences and by differences that are still obscure, we must assuredly take the former as a means to arrive at knowledge of the latter. This was the method used by the philosophers in their study of the soul. Living things differ from non-living in having ‘souls’; but because the nature of the soul was not evident and could not be investigated except by way of certain more obvious notes which differentiate animate from inanimate things, the philosophers first took these more evident characteristics and tried, through them, to come to knowledge of the soul’s nature. These evident notes are two: sensation and movement. Animate things seem to be characterised chiefly by movement, in that they move themselves, and by having sense awareness or perception. So the ancients thought that if they could discover the principle of these two factors they would know the soul; hence their efforts to discern the cause of movement and sensation. They all agreed in identifying the soul with the cause of movement and sense-perception. But just at this point also their differences began; for some tried to arrive at the soul by way of movement, and others by way of sense-perception.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo cum dicit dicunt enim ostendit horum diversitatem. Et primo de illis, qui inquirebant naturam animae a motu. Secundo de illis, qui inquirebant eam a cognitione seu sensu, ibi, quicumque autem ad cognoscere et sentire. Tertio eorum qui inquirebant naturam eius ex utroque, ibi, quoniam autem et motivum. Circa primum sciendum est, quod illis, qui inquisierunt animae naturam a motu, erat unum commune, scilicet quod si moventur animata, quod anima sit movens et mota. Et huius ratio est, quia existimabant quod id quod non movetur, non contingit movere alterum, idest quod nihil movet nisi moveatur. Si ergo anima movet animata, et nihil movet alterum nisi moveatur ipsum, manifestum est, quod anima maxime movetur. Et hoc est, propter quod antiqui naturales arbitrati sunt animam esse eorum, quae moventur. Sed ex hoc etiam diversae opiniones provenerunt.
          <td>33. Hence at ‘For some say’ he states these differences: taking those of his predecessors first who started their enquiry from movement; and then, at ‘All who have considered’, those who started from knowledge; and thirdly, at ‘But since the soul’, those who started from both. With regard to the first group we should note that it had one principle in common, namely, that if living things are moving things, the soul must be both moving and moved. They assumed this because they, thought that one thing could only move another if it were itself already moved; that is, only what is moved moves. So if living things are moved, by the soul, then clearly the soul itself, and preeminently, must be moved. It was this that led the early students of Nature to class the soul among things that are moved. But about this also different opinions arose.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo cum dicit unde Democritus ponit primo opinionem Democriti, de anima, dicens, unde Democritus, quidam scilicet antiquus philosophus, qui excogitans illud, quod maxime movetur, esse naturam animae: et quia illud quod maxime movetur, videtur esse de natura ignis: ideo dicit ipsam animam esse ignem quemdam aut calorem. Et opinio sua fuit talis. Ipse enim nihil ponebat esse in rerum natura nisi sensibile et corporale: et volebat quod principia omnium rerum sint corpora indivisibilia, et infinita, quae vocabat atomos. Quae quidem dixit esse unius naturae, sed differre ab invicem figura, positione, et ordine: licet hic tantum ponat de figura, quia haec sola differentia, quae est secundum figuram, necessaria est. Et ista differentia, quae est secundum figuram, est quod quaedam erant rotunda, quaedam quadrata, quaedam pyramidalia et huiusmodi. Ponebat etiam haec esse mobilia, et nunquam quiescentia, et ex concursu ipsorum atomorum casu esse mundum factum aiebat. Et quod haec indivisibilia corpora sint mobilia, dabat exemplum de decisionibus, quae moventur in aere, etiam si nulla tempestas sit, sicut apparet per portas in radiis solis. Unde, cum ista sint multo minora, quia sunt indivisibilia, illae vero quae apparent in radiis decisiones, sunt divisibiles, manifeste apparet, quod sint maxime mobilia. Et quia inter alias figuras, figura rotunda est magis apta ad motum, cum non habeat angulos, quibus impediatur a motu; et quia credebant animam maxime moveri, ex eo, quod arbitrati sunt animam efficere motum animalibus, ideo inter ista infinita corpora, illa quae erant inter illa rotunda corpora, dicebat esse animam.
          <td>34. When therefore he says, ‘Hence Democritus’, Aristotle states first of all the view of Democritus, one of the early philosophers, who, thinking that the soul by nature was in a state of maximum movement, which state seems natural to fire, maintained that the soul ‘was a kind of fire or heat’. Such was his view. For he did not admit the existence of anything in Nature except what is sense-perceptible and corporeal; and the first principles, he said, of all things are indivisible bodies, infinite in number, which he called atoms. These atoms, he said, are all the same by nature, differing from each other only in shape, position and arrangement (though here only the difference of shape is alluded to, as being the only necessary one. This consists in some being round, some square, some pyramids, and so on). He also maintained that the atoms were mobile and never ceased moving, and that the world had come into being through their fortuitous coming together. And to illustrate the mobility of these bodies he took the example of the particles that move in the air even when no wind blows, as we can see when a sunbeam shines through a doorway. Since the atoms, being indivisible, are much smaller than such particles, they must obviously be extremely mobile. And because the spherical is, of all shapes, the one best suited for movement—having no angles to impede it,—and since the soul, as the cause of movement in living was thought to have maximum mobility, Democritus concluded that among these infinitely numerous bodies the spherical ones were the soul.

          <td>Huius etiam opinionis fuit Leucippus, qui fuit socius eius. Et ad hoc habebat unum signum: quia voluit Democritus terminum vitae, idest rationem consistere in respiratione, licet insufficienter, quia non omnia viva respirant: quae quidem respiratio necessaria erat secundum eum, quia corpora rotunda implent corpus, cum sint causa motus in corpore animalis secundum eum, et sunt in continuo motu, et eo quod continet, idest corpora nostra aere constringente, et extrudente idest exterius mittente illas, quae sunt de numero figurarum, quae sunt praebentes animalibus motum, ex eo quod nullo modo quiescunt; ne forte eis omnino expulsis a corporibus nostris deficerent corpora, ideo necessaria est respiratio, per quam et intromittantur alia corpora, et ea quae sunt intus ab istis, quae per respirationem intrant, impediantur ab exitu. Et tamdiu dixit vivere animalia, quamdiu possunt hoc facere, scilicet respirare. Et vis huiusmodi signi est, quia cum respiratio ex hoc dicatur esse ratio vitae, quod continet ipsa corpora rotunda in corporibus animalium, et immittit etiam ea intus, ne propter exeuntia corpora, quae continue moventur, deficiat corpus animalis; manifestum est, quod ipsa corpora sint anima: quae quidem corpora voluit Democritus esse de natura ignis, et ex eis causari calorem.
          <td>135. Leucippus, a companion of Democritus, held the same opinion. And Democritus thought the following was a sign of its truth. He maintained that ‘coterminous with’, or essential to, life is respiration (a short-sighted view since not all living things breathe), and that respiration is necessary because the body is full of small ever-moving spherical particles (the cause, as he thought, of all movement in animal bodies) and that the surrounding air compresses what it ‘envelops’, i.e. our bodies, and ‘expels’, i.e. thrusts out of them, those particles which are so shaped as to impart movement to animals, being never at rest themselves. Lest, therefore, our bodies should decay with the loss of all these particles, he said that respiration is necessary whereby fresh particles may be brought in, and those already within prevented from leaving by those that inhaling brings in. And he said that animals can live as long as they can do this, i.e. as long as they can breathe. The point of the argument is that if breathing is called the cause of life because it keeps the spherical particles inside the animal body, and also introduces fresh ones lest the body should decay through loss of particles by movement, then it is clearly implied that the particles ate the soul itself. They are indeed the same particles that Democritus said were fiery by nature and the cause of heat.

          <td>Secundo cum dicit videtur autem ponit opinionem quorumdam Pythagoricorum, quae similis erat opinioni Democriti: nam illud quod Pythagorici dicunt de anima, eamdem habet intelligentiam cum eo quod dicit ipse Democritus, licet Pythagorici in eamdem sententiam non conveniant. Nam quidam ipsorum convenientes cum Democrito dixerunt animam esse decisiones, quae sunt in aere, idest corpora indivisibilia et infinita, sicut Democritus dicebat. Alii vero ex ipsis philosophis non dixerunt ipsa corpora indivisibilia, et mobilia esse animam, sed illam virtutem quae movet ea corpora, animam dicebant. Et huius opinionis fuit quidam Archelaus philosophus magister Socratis, ut Augustinus narrat in libro de civitate Dei. Et ratio horum, scilicet quare dicebant huiusmodi corpora esse animam, dicta est: quia sicut iam patet, volebant quod illud quod maxime movetur est anima: unde propter hoc quod haec corpora continue moveri videbantur, sicut apparet in aere, in quo moventur, etiam si sit tranquillitas, dicebant ista corpora esse animam.
          <td>36. Next, at ‘The teaching of the Pythagoreans,’ Aristotle mentions a view of certain Pythagoreans which resembles that of Democritus; for their statement and his seem to mean the same’ although the Pythagoreans themselves do not all agree. Some of them, agreeing with Democritus, said that motes in the air, i.e. indivisible, infinitely numerous particles, were the soul. Others, however, of the same school, said that the soul was rather the force that moved those particles. Of this opinion was a certain Archelaus, the master of Socrates, as Augustine remarks in the <i>De Civitate Dei</i> [VIII, 2]. The reason why the soul has been thus identified with these particles has been already given—namely, that as the soul was regarded as being especially mobile, and as those particles seem to be always moving (even when the air is calm) they identified the one with the other.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit in idem reducit in quamdam summam opinionem plurium philosophorum de anima ad has opiniones; dicens, quod omnes illi, qui definientes animam a motu, dixerunt ipsam esse illud quod seipsum movet, feruntur in idem id est in eamdem intelligentiam cum praedictis. Omnes enim concordant in hoc et conveniunt, quod videntur existimasse motum maxime et praecipue esse proprium animae, et quicquid movetur, movetur ab anima, ipsam vero animam moveri a seipsa. Et ratio horum, sicut iam tactum est, erat, quia communiter opinati sunt quod nihil movet alterum nisi moveatur et ipsum. Unde, cum anima moveat alia, credebant animam maxime et praecipue moveri.
          <td>37. Then, at ‘All who say,’ he summarises the views of a number of philosophers, saying that all who have defined the soul in terms of movement and called it that which moves itself, ‘tend in the same direction’, i.e. the same as those mentioned already. All these, it seems, agreed -in thinking that the soul’s first and chief characteristic was movement; all things being moved by soul, and soul by itself. The reason for this was, as has been noted, that they all thought that only what was itself in motion could move other things. Since the soul moves other things, they thought the soul especially and principally was in motion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio cum dicit similiter autem ponit opinionem Anaxagorae de natura animae. Et primo ponit in quo Anaxagoras concordabat cum superioribus, dicens, quod Anaxagoras et quicumque alius dixit quod intellectus movet omnia, dicit animam esse moventem omnia, sicut et illi dicunt. Sed in hoc differt, quia noluit quod omne quod movet alterum, moveatur et ipsum: immo dixit esse unum intellectum separatum et immixtum qui alia moveat, eo non moto: et de natura huiusmodi dicit esse animam. Unde ex hoc insurrexit error quorumdam, qui dicerent animam esse de natura divina. Sic ergo patet in quo concordabat cum superioribus, in hoc scilicet quod dixit animam esse moventem. Sed differebat in hoc, quod dixit animam non moveri, cuius contrarium illi dicebant. Differebat etiam a Democrito in acceptione intellectus.
          <td>38. In the third place, at ‘Anaxagoras likewise’, he states the view of Anaxagoras. He first shows how this philosopher agrees with those already mentioned, saying that he, and anyone else who held that Intellect moved all things, really agreed with them that the source of all movement was a soul. Anaxagoras, however, differed in this that he denied that every mover was itself in motion, and maintained the existence of a pure and transcendent Intellect which, motionless itself, moved all other things; and that the soul was of this nature too. (This view led some into the error of divinising the soul.) Thus Anaxagoras agreed with the other philosophers in calling the soul a principle of movement, but disagreed with them in saying that it was not itself moved (for they said the contrary). And he also differed from Democritus in what he understood by intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo cum dicit ille quidem ponit hanc differentiam. Et primo opinionem Democriti: dicens, quod ille scilicet Democritus dixit simpliciter idest ubique et universaliter intellectum et animam esse idem. Cuius ratio est, quia Democritus credebat quod nihil esset in mundo nisi sensibilia: et sicut nihil erat in mundo nisi sensibilia, ita dicebat, quod nulla vis apprehensiva erat in anima, nisi sensitiva. Unde fuit huius opinionis, quod nulla veritas determinate haberetur de rebus, et quod nihil determinate cognoscitur, sed quicquid apparet, verum esset; et non magis illud quod cogitat unus de re aliqua, quam illud quod cogitat alius de eadem re, eodem tempore, verum esse: et ex hoc sequebatur, quod poneret contradictoria simul esse vera. Cuius ratio est, quia ipse, ut dictum est, non utebatur intellectu, qui est circa veritatem, idest virtute intellectiva, per quam anima intelligit intelligibilia, sed solum vi sensitiva; et quod nihil cognosceretur nisi sensibile, cum nihil poneret in rerum natura nisi sensibile. Unde, cum sensibilia sint in continuo motu et fluxu, opinatus est nullam veritatem determinatam esse in rebus. Et quia non pervenit ad hoc quod cognosceret intellectum esse potentiam quamdam quae est circa veritatem idest cuius obiectum est verum, et excedit omnes alias potentias animae, sed accepit tantum potentias animae sensitivas; ideo communiter et indifferenter idem dicit animam et intellectum, quem quidem intellectum dicit transmutari secundum hominis transmutationem. Et propter hoc commendat Homerum, qui dixit, quod Hector iacet aliud sapiens idest quod secundum sui mutationem, mutatus est intellectus eius, dum aliud saperet victus, et aliud invictus.
          <td>39. When Aristotle therefore says ‘He (i.e. Democritus) asserts’, he states this last difference, first stating Democritus’ opinion that intellect and soul were ‘absolutely’, i.e. everywhere and in all respects, the same. Democritus said this because he held that only sense-perceptible things existed in the real world, and that no cognitive faculty existed in the soul except sensitivity. From this he inferred that no definite truth about things was attainable, that nothing could be definitely known with certainty: truth being simply what appears to be true; and what one man thought about anything being never any nearer the truth than what another man thought about the same thing at the same time. in consequence he maintained that contradictories were both true at the same time; and this because, as we have said, he took intellect to be, not the faculty for knowing truth and understanding intelligible objects, but a mere sense-faculty. Only the sensible, he thought, could be known, since only the sensible existed. And because the latter is continually changing there could be no certain truth about anything. Never attaining to an understanding of the intellect as the supreme faculty ‘concerned with truth’, i.e. which bears on true being, and admitting only the faculties of sense, he completely ‘identifies soul and intellect’. The intellect changed, he said, as the whole man changed. Hence his approval of Homer’s Phrase ‘Hector lies other-minded’, i.e. Hector’s mind was altered by Hector’s condition; for he thought one thing as conqueror, another as conquered.

          <td>Secundo cum dicit Anaxagoras autem ostendit in quo differebat Anaxagoras a Democrito. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit opinionem Anaxagorae. Secundo reprobat eam, ibi, non videtur autem et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod Anaxagoras loquitur de anima magis dubie, et minus certificat de ipsa. Nam ipse Anaxagoras multoties dicit in intellectu esse causam eius, quod est bonum operari, idest bonae operationis. Alibi vero, idest in aliis locis, dicit hunc intellectum, scilicet qui est causa bonae operationis, et animam esse idem; et hoc apparet, quia constat quod anima inest omnibus animalibus tam vilibus quam honorabilibus, et tam magnis quam parvis. Unde, cum in omnibus his dicat intellectum esse, manifestum est, quod idem dicit animam et intellectum.
          <td>40. Next, at ‘Anaxagoras is less definite’, he shows how Anaxagoras differed from Democritus, first stating the former’s opinion and then, at ‘it does not seem’, criticising it. First then he observes that Anaxagoras spoke with less certainty and less conclusively about the soul. He often said that intelligence was the cause of right actions, whilst elsewhere he also identifies intelligence with the soul; for it is agreed that a soul is found in all animals, the lower as well as the higher, the smaller as well as the larger; and Anaxagoras said that intelligence was in all of them. Clearly then he identifies soul and intelligence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo cum dicit non videtur ostendit contrarietatem esse in huiusmodi acceptione intellectus secundum Anaxagoram, scilicet aliquando hoc, quod dicit intellectum non esse idem cum anima, aliquando vero dicit ipsum et animam esse idem: quae sunt contradictoria, et non possunt simul stare. Et hoc probat tali ratione. Constat quod bene operari est proprium intellectus secundum prudentiam perfecti, quia bene operari pertinet ad prudentiam. Si ergo idem esset intellectus, qui est causa bonae operationis, cum anima, sequeretur quod intellectus prudens idem esset cum anima. Sed hoc est falsum, quia anima inest omnibus animalibus. Intellectus autem secundum prudentiam dictus, non videtur inesse, non solum omnibus animalibus, sed nec omnibus hominibus: ergo non est idem quod anima.
          <td>41. Secondly, at ‘It does not seem’, he shows the inconsistency of Anaxagoras’ use of the term intellect. For sometimes Anaxagoras distinguishes between soul and intellect, but sometimes also he identifies them. These are contradictory statements which cannot both be true; as Aristotle proceeds to show. Right action, he says, admittedly derives from intellect perfected by prudence. If then the intellect that causes right action is the same thing as the soul, it follows that intellect perfected by prudence is the same as the soul. But this is false; because, while all animals have souls, not all—not even all men—are prudent. Therefore the soul is something else.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit quicumque quidem ostendit, quod omnes illi, qui consideraverunt animata secundum motum, idest secundum id quod est moveri a seipsis, opinati sunt animam esse illud quod maxime est motivum, sicut patet in opinionibus iam dictis.
          <td>42. Lastly, at ‘All those therefore,’ he states that all who have regarded animate beings from the standpoint of movement, i.e. as self-movers, thought that the chief mover in them was the soul, as the above-mentioned opinions show.

          <td>43. Having shown how some have approached a knowledge of soul through movement, the Philosopher now turns to those who came to it by way of sensation or knowledge. He does this in. two stages. First he shows where the latter were in agreement; and secondly, at ‘Empedocles, for instance,’ where they disagreed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primo enim ostendit, in quo convenerunt philosophi, qui consideraverunt animam ex sensu. Secundo vero in quo differunt, ibi, sicut Empedocles quidem, et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod omnes quicumque venerunt in cognitionem animae quantum ad cognoscere et sentire, idest per cognitionem et sensum, in hoc conveniebant, quia dicebant animam esse ex principiis: quae quidem principia alii faciebant, idest ponebant, esse plura, alii vero unum tantum. Ad ponendum autem animam esse ex principiis constitutam movebantur, quia ipsi antiqui philosophi quasi ab ipsa veritate coacti, somniabant quodammodo veritatem. Veritas autem est, quod cognitio fit per similitudinem rei cognitae in cognoscente: oportet enim quod res cognita aliquo modo sit in cognoscente. Antiqui vero philosophi arbitrati sunt, quod oportet similitudinem rei cognitae esse in cognoscente secundum esse naturale, hoc est secundum idem esse quod habet in seipsa: dicebant enim quod oportebat simile simili cognosci; unde si anima cognoscat omnia, oportet, quod habeat similitudinem omnium in se secundum esse naturale, sicut ipsi ponebant. Nescierunt enim distinguere illum modum, quo res est in intellectu, seu in oculo, vel imaginatione, et quo res est in seipsa: unde quia illa, quae sunt de essentia rei, sunt principia illius rei, et qui cognoscit principia huiusmodi cognoscit ipsam rem, posuerunt quod ex quo anima cognoscit omnia, esset ex principiis rerum. Et hoc erat omnibus commune.
          <td>He begins then by saying that all who studied the soul in or through its knowing and sensing agreed in holding that the soul was composed of the principles of things; but some ‘made’, i.e. posited, many such principles, while others posited only one. Even the earliest philosophers assumed these principles to be in the soul, as though compelled by the force of truth itself; they dreamed, as it were, of the truth. The truth, in fact, is that knowledge is caused by the knower containing a likeness of the thing known; for the latter must be in the knower somehow. The early philosophers, however, thought that it existed in the knower in its own natural being, i.e. with the being that it has in itself. Like, they said, must be known by like. If then the soul is to know all things it must contain a likeness of all things according to their natural mode of being. They could not distinguish between the mode of existence that a thing has in the mind or the eye or the imagination from that which it has in itself. Therefore, since whatever is of a thing’s essence is a constituent principle of the thing, and to know its constituent principles is to know the thing itself, these philosophers maintained that the reason why the soul can know all things is that it is made up of the principles of all things. This theory was common to them all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed diversificati sunt secundum quod differebant in principiis quae ponebant. Non enim omnes ponebant eadem principia, sed unus plura, alius unum, unus hoc, alius illud: et secundum hoc differunt in ponendo principia, ex quibus principiis anima constituatur.
          <td>44. But they differed about these principles. They did not all admit the same; one admitted many, another only one, and one this and another that. Hence they disagreed also about the constituents of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo consequenter cum dicit sicut Empedocles ponit quomodo differunt. Et primo ponit opinionem Empedoclis, dicens quod antiqui philosophi, qui per sensum consideraverunt animam, dicunt ipsam constare ex elementis. Et illi quidem, qui unum faciunt principium, illud unum dicunt esse animam. Et qui plura, ex illis eam componi: sicut Empedocles dicit animam esse ex omnibus elementis, et unumquodque horum dicit animam. Circa quod sciendum est, quod Empedocles posuit sex principia: quatuor materialia, scilicet terram, aquam, aerem et ignem: et duo activa et passiva, scilicet litem et amicitiam. Et ideo, ex quo ponebat animam omnia cognoscere, dixit animam esse ex huiusmodi principiis, quae ponebat. Secundum enim quod ex terra, terram cognoscimus; et secundum quod ex aethere, idest ex aere aerem, et ex aqua aquam: sed et ignem ex igne manifestum esse: et per concordiam cognoscimus concordiam: et ex tristi discordia cognoscimus discordiam: et ponit ibi, tristi quia Empedocles metrice composuit libros suos.
          <td>45. So, at ‘Empedocles, for instance,’ Aristotle states these differences. He gives first the opinion of Empedocles, saying that the early philosophers who studied the soul by way of its sense-perceptions thought it was composed of the elements. Those who admitted only one principle said that this precisely was the soul; and those who admitted many said that the soul was made up of many; thus Empedocles held that the soul was constituted by all the elements, and that each of these was itself a soul. Note that Empedocles admitted six principles: four material, namely earth, water, fire and air; and two active and passive principles, namely strife and friendship. And since he assumed that the soul knew all things, he said it, was composed of all these principles. Thus as earthy we know earth; as ethereal or airy we know air; as aequous we know water; and as fiery, of course, we know fire. Through love we know love, and through ‘sad hate’ we know hatred. ‘Sad’ comes in here because Empedocles wrote in verse.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo cum dicit eodem autem ponit opinionem Platonis, dicens quod Plato etiam facit animam ex elementis, idest dicit animam ex principiis constitutam esse. Et quod hoc sit verum, scilicet quod Plato dicat animam compositam ex principiis rerum, probat per triplex dictum Platonis. Primum est, quod ipse dicit in Timaeo. Ibi enim dicit duo esse elementa seu principia rerum, scilicet idem et diversum. Quaedam enim natura est, quae semper eodem modo se habet, et est simplex, sicut sunt immaterialia; et hanc naturam vocat idem. Quaedam vero natura est, quae non semper eodem modo se habet, sed transmutationem suscipit et divisionem, sicut sunt materialia, et hanc vocat diversum. Et ex istis duobus, scilicet ex eodem et diverso, animam dicit esse compositam: non quod sint ista duo in anima ut partes, sed quod sunt quasi media, et quod natura rationalis animae superioribus et omnino immaterialibus sit inferior et deterior, et materialibus et inferioribus sit nobilior et superior.
          <td>46. Next, when he says ‘In the same way Plato’ Aristotle states the opinion of Plato who also, he says, made the soul consist of elements, i.e. be constituted by the, principles of things. And as evidence for this statement he takes three passages from Plato. The first is from the <i>Timaeus</i> , where Plato says that there are two elements or first principles, Identity and Difference. For there is a certain kind of nature that is simple and unchanging, as are immaterial things; and this nature he calls Identity. And there is another kind which does not stay the same, but undergoes change and division, as do material things; and this nature he calls Difference. And it is of these two principles, of Identity and Difference, that the soul, he says, is composed; not that the two are in the soul as its parts; but rather as in the mean between extremes; for the rational soul is by nature lower and less noble than the higher and purely immaterial substances, but it is higher and nobler than inferior material things.

          <td>Et ratio huius erat, sicut dictum est, simile cognoscitur simili: unde si anima cognosceret omnia, et idem et diversum sunt principia, ponebat animam esse ex istis duobus compositam eo modo quo dictum est, ut inquantum habet de natura identitatis, cognosceret ea quae ponit idem; inquantum vero de natura eorum quae vocat diversum, cognosceret diversum, scilicet materialia. Unde et hac cognitione utitur. Nam quando colligit genera et species, tunc dicit eam repraesentare idem, seu identitatem. Quando vero differentias et accidentia assumit, alteritatem adinvenit. Sic ergo patet quomodo Plato in Timaeo dicit animam ex principio componi.
          <td>47. Now this opinion rests on the principle already mentioned, that like is known by like. For it seemed to Plato that if the soul knew all things, and if Identity and Difference were fundamental principles, then the soul itself must be constituted of Identity and Difference; in so far as it participated in ‘Identity’ the soul, he thought, knew the ‘identical’, while so far as it participated in ‘Difference’ it knew the ‘different’, i.e. material things. Hence the actual process of the soul in knowing things. For when it gathers things together under genera and species, then, said Plato, it manifests Sameness or Identity, but when it attends to accidents and differentiations he finds in it Difference. That is how Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> understood the soul as made up of principles.

          <td>Secundum dictum Platonis, per quod ostenditur, quod dixit animam ex principiis esse, ponitur cum dicit similiter autem ubi ostendit animam esse ex principiis similiter. Circa quod sciendum est quod Plato posuit, quod intelligibilia essent per se substantia et separata, et essent semper in actu, et essent causa cognitionis et esse rebus sensibilibus. Quod Aristoteles tamquam inconveniens volens evitare, coactus est ponere intellectum agentem. Unde sequebatur ex positione Platonis, quod secundum quod aliqua sunt abstracta per intellectum, sic essent aliqua, quae essent per se subsistentia et in actu. Habemus autem duplicem modum abstractionis per intellectum: unum qui est a particularibus ad universalia; alium per quem abstrahimus mathematica a sensibilibus. Et sic cogebatur ex hoc ponere tria subsistentia, scilicet sensibilia, mathematica et universalia, quae essent causa, ex quorum participatione, res etiam sensibiles et mathematicae essent.
          <td>48. The second passage, showing that this was Plato’s theory, Aristotle refers to when he says ‘In the lectures “On Philosophy”.’ Here too the soul is represented as constituted from principles. Note, in this connection, that Plato took the objects known by the intellect to be things in themselves, existing apart from matter in perpetual actuality, and the causes of knowledge and of being in things of sense. For Aristotle this view involved so many difficulties that he was compelled to excogitate the theory of the ‘agent intellect’. But from Plato’s position it followed that to what could be thought of in the abstract corresponded subsistent and actual realities. We can, however, form abstractions in two ways: one is by proceeding from particulars to universals; and the other is that by which mathematical objects are abstracted from objects of sense. So Plato found himself obliged to posit three types of subsistent being: the objects of sense-perception; mathematical objects; and universal ideas-these last being the cause, by participation, of the other two types.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item ponebat Plato numeros esse causam rerum: et hoc faciebat, quia nescivit distinguere inter unum quod convertitur cum ente, et unum quod est principium numeri, prout est species quantitatis. Ex quo sequebatur, quod cum universale separatum poneret causam rerum, et numeros esse substantiam rerum, quod huiusmodi universalia essent ex numeris. Dicebat enim quod principia omnium entium essent species et numerus specificus, quem vocabat specificum tamquam compositum ex speciebus. Nam et ipsum numerum reducebat, tamquam in principia et elementa, in unum et dualitatem. Nam cum ex uno nihil procederet, ideo necessaria fuit ipsi uni aliqua subiecta natura, a qua multitudo produceretur: et hanc vocavit dualitatem.
          <td>49. Plato also held that numbers were causes of real things, being unaware of the distinction between unity as identical with being, and unity as the principle of the number that is a kind of quantity. Hence he inferred that universals were of the nature of number; for the universal existing separately is the cause of things whose substance is numerical. He said indeed that the constituent principles of all beings were ‘species’ and ‘specific number’, which he called specific in the sense of being constituted from ‘species’. And he reduced number itself to unity and duality as to its fundamental elements; for, as nothing can proceed from one alone, there must, he thought, be some nature, subordinate to unity, whence multiplicity might proceed; and this nature he called duality.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et secundum ordinem materialitatis ordinabat illa tria. Quia enim sensibilia sunt magis materialia quam mathematica, et universalia immaterialiora mathematicis: ideo primo posuit sensibilia, supra quae posuit mathematica, et supra haec, universalia separata et ideas: quae differunt a mathematicis: quia in mathematicis in una specie sunt aliqua quae differunt secundum numerum, sed in ideis et substantiis separatis non inveniuntur aliqua unius speciei quae differant numero: unius enim speciei unam posuit ideam. Quas ideas dicit esse ex numeris, et secundum numeros in eis esse rationes rerum sensibilium, quae quidem constant ex longitudine, latitudine et profunditate. Et ideo dixit ideam longitudinis esse primam dualitatem, longitudo enim est ab uno ad unum, scilicet de puncto ad punctum. Latitudinis autem primam Trinitatem, nam figura triangularis est prima superficialium figurarum. Profunditatis autem quae continet longitudinem et latitudinem, ideam dixit esse primam quaternitatem: prima enim figura corporum est pyramis, quae quatuor angulis consistit: unde, cum Plato poneret animam sensibilem, posuit animam separatam, quae esset causa eius; et hanc, sicut alia separata et ideas, dixit esse ex numeris, scilicet ex unitate et dualitate quae ponebat principia rerum.
          <td>50. Thus Plato envisaged three classes of beings, graded according to their connection with matter. As sensible objects are more material than the objects considered in mathematics, and the latter more so than the universal ideas, he placed sense-objects on the lowest level, and above them mathematical objects, and above these the separately existing universals and ideas. Universals differ from mathematical objects in this that the latter include numerical differences Within the same species, whereas ideas and separated substances exhibit no numerical differences in the one species; there is but ore idea for each species. These ideas, he said, are numerical in nature, and from them are derived such numerical qualities of sensible things as length, breadth and depth. Hence he said that the idea of length was the primary duality, for length is from unit to unit, from point to point; and that of breadth was the first trinity, for the triangle is the first of plane figures; and that of depth, which includes both length and breadth, was the first quaternity, for the first solid figure is the pyramid which is constructed of four angles. So too the sensitive soul, in Plato’s system, implied a Soul existing separately as its cause, and constituted, like the other ‘separate’ things and ideas, by number, that is, by the unity and duality which for him were fundamental in things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio cum dicit adhuc autem ponit tertium dictum Platonis, per quod apparet quod ipse dixerat animam compositam ex principiis. Plato enim posuit numeros, sicut dictum est, species et principia rerum: unde, cum loqueretur de anima, posuit eam secundum hoc venire in cognitionem entium, quod erat composita ex principiis, scilicet ex numeris, et omnes operationes eius ab eis procedere. Invenimus enim in anima diversas potentias ad apprehensionem entium; scilicet intellectum, scientiam, opinionem et sensum. Dicit ergo animam habere intellectum et eius operationem ex idea unius, quia scilicet est in una natura unitatis; intellectus enim una apprehensione apprehendit unum. Item scientiam ex prima dualitate; scientia enim est ab uno ad unum, scilicet de principiis ad conclusionem. Opinionem vero ex prima Trinitate: opinio enim est de uno ad duo, est enim de principiis ad conclusionem cum formidine alterius; et sic sunt ibi tria; principium, et duae conclusiones, una conclusa et alia formidata. Sensum autem habet anima a prima quaternitate: est enim quaternitas prima, idea corporis, quod consistit ex quatuor angulis, ut dictum est: sensus autem corporum est. Cum ergo res omnes cognoscantur istis quatuor, scilicet intellectu, scientia, opinione et sensu, et has potentias dicit habere animam secundum quod participat naturam unitatis, dualitatis, ternarii et quaternarii, manifestum est, quod dixit animam separatam, quam posuit ideam huius animae, compositam ex numeris, qui sunt principia et elementa rerum. Et sic patet, quod Plato dixit animam esse compositam ex principiis.
          <td>51. Then at ‘Again, rather differently,’ Aristotle alludes to the third text adduced to show that for Plato the soul was made up of elements or principles. As we have said, it was Plato’s view that the specific forms and, principles of things were numbers; so when he came to treat of the soul he based its knowledge of things on its fundamentally numerical composition; all of its activities, he maintained, sprang from this source. Take for instance the diverse apprehensive functionings of the soul: simple understanding, science, opinion and sensation. Simple understanding Plato connected with the idea of One; it has the nature of Unity; for in one act it apprehends a unity. Again, science for him relates to Duality since it proceeds from one to one, i.e. from principles to conclusions. And opinion relates to the first Trinity, proceeding from one to two, i.e. from principles to a conclusion which is accompanied by the fear that a different conclusion may be true; so forming a triad out of one principle and one admitted and one feared conclusion. Finally, sensation derives from the first Quaternity, i.e. from the notion of a solid body constructed (as we have said) from four angles; for bodies are the object of sensation. Since then all knowing is contained in these four, i.e. in simple understanding, science, opinion and sensation, all of which, said Plato, are in the soul in virtue of its participating in the nature of Unity, Duality, Trinity and Quaternity, it obviously follows that for Plato the separated Soul, the ‘idea’, as he called it, of particular souls, was constituted by numbers, which are the elements or principles of reality. So much to show that Plato regarded the soul as made up of principles.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit quoniam autem ponit quod quidam philosophi definierunt et venerunt in cognitionem animae ex motu et sensu simul, seu cognitione, dicens: quia anima videbatur eis esse motiva per se et cognoscitiva, complexi sunt ista duo, et definierunt animam ex utrisque, scilicet motu et cognitione, dicentes, quod anima est numerus movens seipsum. Per numerum quidem insinuantes potentiam cognoscitivam, quia secundum quod suprapositum est, ex hoc dicebant habere animam vim cognoscitivam rerum, quod participabat naturam numeri specifici, quod erat de opinione Platonis: per movere autem seipsam, insinuantes potentiam motivam in anima.
          <td>52. Next at ‘But since the soul seems,’ Aristotle observes that some philosophers defined the soul, and came to know something about it, through both movement and sensation or knowledge. He says that, as the soul seemed to them to be both self-moving and cognitive, they joined the two aspects in their definition and called it a ‘self-moving number’. ‘Number’ refers to the cognitive power because they thought, in accordance with what has been said already, that the soul was able to know in virtue of its participating in the nature of specific number (Plato’s opinion). ‘Self-moving’ refers to the soul’s motive power.

In the preceding chapters Aristotle has shown the old philosophers agreeing in their analysis of the soul, in that they all regarded it as the origin of movement and knowledge. in the section beginning now he shows how they variously interpreted that common presupposition. This section falls into three parts: in the first he shows the root of the divergence of these philosophers in their teaching on the soul; the second enumerates the various points of difference (beginning at ‘Hence some’); the third summarises all that we have to consider in these differences (at ‘All, taken together’). The root of the divergence of the philosophers in their teaching on the soul is to be looked for in the way they analysed it into its ultimate elements; as they disagreed about these elements so did they differ about the soul. They all agreed that the soul was made up of ultimate elements, but they could not agree that it was made up of the same elements; and, differing as to the elements, they differed in their theories of the soul.

          <td>54. They differ in two ways about the ultimate elements: first, as to their essential nature, i.e. ‘what’ they are; secondly, as to their number, ‘how many’ they are. As regards their essential nature, some said these principles were corporeal (fire or water or air) while others said they were incorporeal and immaterial, such as those who spoke of numbers and ideas; and there were others, like the Platonists, who blended both views and allowed that there existed both sensibly perceptible and separate immaterial principles. As to their number or multiplication, there were some who admitted only one principle. Heraclitus, for instance, said it was air; and someone else, fire; while others said there were many principles—Empedocles for instance, who maintained the theory of the four elements. And their theories of the soul in respect of the elements followed these various hypotheses concerning ultimate elements. Those who held to a theory of material first principles, like Empedocles, said the soul was composed of such; and those, like Plato, who held to immaterial principles, said that the soul was composed of these. But one and all considered the soul to be the chief source of movement.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit unde quibusdam enumerat diversitatem philosophorum in speciali. Sciendum autem est, quod inter illos qui ponebant unum corporum esse principium rerum, nullus dignatus est ponere solam terram; sed alii posuerunt ignem primum principium: alii aerem, alii aquam, terram vero nullus posuit nisi qui posuit omnia elementa quatuor esse primum principium. Et ratio huius est, quia terra propter suam grossitiem, magis videbatur esse composita ex principiis, quam ipsa esset principium. Et ideo circa hanc partem tria facit. Primo enim ponit opiniones illorum, qui posuerunt primum principium et animam esse ignem. Secundo vero ponit opinionem illorum, qui posuerunt primum principium et animam esse aerem, ibi, Diogenes autem et cetera. Tertio vero ponit opinionem illorum qui posuerunt aquam esse primum principium et animam, ibi, magis autem rudium.
          <td>55. Next, at ‘Hence some’, he proceeds to run through the more particular differences between the philosophers. it should be noted that of those who thought that a corporeal thing was the first principle, not one deigned to identify this with mere earth. Some said it was fire, others air, others water, but nobody said it was earth, except those who thought that all the four elements together were the first principle. (The reason being that, with its density, earth seemed always to presuppose some more ultimate principle). Aristotle, then, does three things here. He gives first the views of those who identified the first principle and the soul itself with fire; secondly, of those who held that they were air (at ‘Now Diogenes’); and thirdly, the opinion of those who held that water was both the first principle and the soul (beginning at: ‘Some cruder thinkers’).4
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum sciendum est, quod propter hoc quod animae attribuitur motivum et cognoscitivum, visum est quibusdam animam esse illud quod est maxime motivum et cognoscitivum; et quia illud quod est maxime subtile videbatur eis esse maxime motivum et cognoscitivum, ideo dixerunt animam esse ignem, qui est inter corpora magis subtilis et activus. Et licet plures essent huius opinionis, et sic opinarentur animam esse ignem, Democritus tamen subtilius et rationabilius dixit hoc enuncians propter quid utrumque eorum idest rationem motus et cognitionis magis expressit. Volebat enim, sicut dictum est, quod omnia essent composita ex atomis. Et licet secundum eum huiusmodi atomi essent principium omnium rerum, nihilominus tamen volebat, quod atomi, qui sunt figurae rotundae, essent de natura ignis: et ideo dicebat animam componi ex illis, qui sunt figurae sphaericae. Et haec, inquantum sunt prima principia, dicebant habere rationem cognoscendi; inquantum vero rotunda, rationem movendi; et ideo inquantum anima erat composita ex huiusmodi corporibus indivisibilibus rotundis, dicebat eam cognoscere et movere omnia. Unde ponens illa corpora rotunda de natura ignis, concordabat cum istis quod omnia essent de natura ignis.
          <td>56. As to the first of these groups, we should note that since movement and knowledge were ascribed to the soul, it appeared to some that the soul possessed these properties in the highest degree; and as movement and knowledge seemed to connote what is lightest and most rarified, they concluded that the soul was fire, which is the lightest and most rarified of bodies. And. while many were of this opinion and thought the soul was fire, Democritus more subtly and rationally explained ‘the reason for either fact’, that is, he expressed more clearly the nature of movement and of knowledge. He held, as we have seen,, that all things are made of atoms; and though for him these atoms were primary he maintained, nevertheless, that the round ones were of the nature of fire, so that the soul, he said, was composed of spherical atoms. Considered as first principles, these atoms were by nature cognitive, but considered as spherical they were mobile; hence he said that the soul knows and moves all things precisely because it is made up of these round, indivisible bodies. And in assuming that they were of the nature of fire, he agreed with those who thought that everything was fiery.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit Anaxagoras autem ponit Anaxagorae opinionem: qui in hoc concordabat cum praecedentibus, quod eidem, scilicet animae, attribuit rationem cognoscendi et movendi. Hic autem aliquando videtur alterum dicere esse animam et intellectum, sicut dictum est superius sed aliquando utitur utrisque, scilicet anima et intellectu, sicut una natura. Ipse enim dicebat animam esse motivam et cognoscitivam: unde, cum ipse poneret intellectum moventem omnia et cognoscentem, pro eodem accipiebat animam et intellectum. Sed in hoc differebat ab aliis: quia Democritus ponebat animam esse naturae corporeae, utpote ex materialibus principiis compositam: Anaxagoras vero dicit intellectum esse simplicem ut excludat diversitatem in essentia, immixtum ut excludat componi cum alio, et purum ut excludat additionem ab alio. Sed movere et cognoscere assignat eidem principio, scilicet intellectui: nam intellectus ex natura sua habet quod sit cognoscens: motum autem habet, quia ipse, sicut dictum est, dicit intellectum omnia movere.
          <td>57. Then at ‘Anaxagoras, however’, Aristotle gives the view of Anaxagoras who agreed with the others already mentioned in ascribing knowledge and motion to the soul. Anaxagoras, as we saw, sometimes appears to distinguish between soul and intellect, but sometimes he uses both terms as though they meant the same thing. He ascribes to the soul motive power and knowledge, but he also says that intellect knows and moves all things, thus identifying the soul and the intellect. But he differed from the others in this, that whereas Democritus held that the soul was corporeal by nature, being composed of material elements, Anaxagoras said that intellect was ‘simple’, excluding intrinsic division from its essence, and ‘unmixed’, excluding composition with anything else, and ‘pure’, excluding any addition to it from outside. But he ascribed movement and knowledge to one and the same principle, i.e. the intellect; for intellect of its nature knows; and movement pertains to it, so he said, because it moves everything else.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit videtur autem ponit opinionem cuiusdam philosophi, scilicet Thaletis; qui in hoc solum concordat cum superioribus, quia illud dicit esse animam, quod habet virtutem motivam. Hic enim, scilicet Thales, fuit unus de septem sapientibus. Et cum omnes alii studerent circa moralia, hic solus dedit se inquisitioni rerum naturalium, et est primus naturalis philosophus. Et ideo dicit, ex quibus reminiscuntur, scilicet qui volunt quod aqua esset principium omnium rerum. Hic enim secundum considerationem principii in rebus animatis opinabatur esse principium omnium rerum. Unde, cum principia seu semina omnium animatorum sint humida, voluit quod illud esset principium omnium rerum quod est maxime humidum; et quia huiusmodi est aqua, dixit aquam esse principium omnium rerum. Sed tamen non consequitur opinionem suam in hoc quod diceret animam esse aquam; sed illud dixit animam, quod habet virtutem motivam. Unde, cum lapis quidam, scilicet magnes, moveat ferrum, dixit illum habere animam. Ponantur ergo Anaxagoras et Thales cum istis; non quod dicant animam esse ignem; sed quia dicunt illud esse animam, quod habet rationem sensus et cognitionis, sicut dixit Anaxagoras: seu motus, sicut dixit Thales.
          <td>58. Next, at ‘It seems that Thales’, he states the opinion of a philosopher called Thales who had only this in common with the others mentioned above, that he identified soul with a motive force. This Thales was one of the Seven Wise Men; but while the others studied moral questions, Thales devoted himself to the world of nature and was the first natural philosopher. Hence Aristotle remarks ‘from what they recollect etc.’, referring to those who said that water was the basic principle of things. For Thales thought that the way to find the principle of all things was by searching into the principle of living things, and since all the principles or seeds of living things are moist, he thought that the absolutely first principle must be the most moist of things; and this being water, he said water was that principle. Yet he did not follow his theory to the point of saying that soul was water; rather, he defined it as that which has motive force. Hence he asserted that a certain stone, the magnet, had a soul because it moved iron. Anaxagoras and Thales, then, are included in the present list; not for identifying the soul with fire, but because the former said that the soul was the source of knowledge and sensation, and the latter that it was at the ,origin of movement.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit Diogenes autem ponit opiniones illorum, qui dicunt aerem esse primum principium et animam. Et ii quidem sunt tres.

Unde et animam dixit esse aerem, et ex hoc habere virtutem cognoscendi et movendi. Virtutem quidem cognoscendi habet, quia aer, secundum eum, est principium omnium. Cum enim cognitio fiat per simile, sicut dictum est, oportebat quod si anima cognosceret omnia, esset composita ex principiis omnium rerum. Virtutem vero movendi habet, quia aer est subtilissimum omnium corporum, et ideo maxime mobilis.
          <td>59. Where he says, ‘Now Diogenes’, Aristotle alludes to those who thought that air was the first principle and the soul. There were three of these. First there was Diogenes who held that air was the first principle and also the finest-grained of all bodies, and that the soul therefore was air,—hence its power to know and move. The knowing power was due to the fact that air was (as he said) the first principle; for as knowledge is through likeness, as we have seen, the soul could not know all things unless it included the principles of all. And the moving power was due, he said, to the fact that air was the finest-grained of bodies and therefore the most mobile.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo cum dicit Heraclitus autem ponit opinionem Heracliti; qui non dicebat simpliciter aerem esse principium rerum, sed aliquod coniunctum aeri, scilicet vaporem, qui est medius inter aerem et aquam. Hic enim non posuit aquam, seu ignem vel aerem principium rerum, sed aliud medium, quia non posuit nisi materialia tantum: unde illud voluit esse principium rerum, quod esset magis remotum a contrarietate. Et hoc videbatur ei quod esset vapor: et ideo secundum hoc voluit, quod anima esset vapor, quia ex hoc dicebat animam maxime cognoscitivam et motivam esse. Ipse enim fuit huius opinionis, quod omnia essent in continuo fluxu, et quod nihil vel ad horam quiesceret, nec poterat aliqua oratio determinate dici. Unde cum vapor esset inter alia maxime fluxibilis, dixit illum esse omnium rerum principium. Et hunc dicit esse animam. Et dixit quod naturam cognoscitivam habet ex hoc quod est principium: motivam vero ex hoc quod est incorporalissimum et fluxibile.
          <td>60. Then at ‘Heraclitus, however’ he states the second opinion, that of Heraclitus who thought that not mere air but vapour, the blend of air and water, was the first principle. He could not allow that this was either water by itself, or fire, or air; it had to be something betwixt and between, because, being a materialist, he was concerned to find a principle midway between the opposite extremes of material quality. Thinking that vapour answered this requirement most precisely, he said that the soul was vapour; which explained its extraordinary capacity to know and to move. His view was, indeed, that everything was in continual flux, that nothing stayed the same even for one hour, and that no definite statement could be made about anything. And it was just because vapour is so unstable that he identified it with the first principle of all things; which, he said, was a soul. As the first principle, soul has the power to know, whilst as the least material and most fluid of things it has movement.

          <td>Tertio vero cum dicit similiter autem ponit opinionem Alchmaeonis, qui concordabat cum istis quantum ad motum tantum, qui dicebat animam esse quid mobilissimum. Unde quia semper movetur, assimilatur immortalibus, scilicet corporibus caelestibus: et ideo dicit eam immortalem, sicut corpora caelestia, et sic esse de natura caelesti et divina, quae semper movetur, ut luna, et sol, et huiusmodi, quae semper moventur et immortalia sunt. Nam secundum eum, sicut motus causat in eis immortalitatem, ita et in anima quae naturae mobilissimae est.
          <td>61. Thirdly, at ‘Alcmaeon seems,’ he gives the third opinion, Alcmaeon’s, which agrees with the others only as regards movement. This man said that the soul was pre-eminently a thing in motion, resembling in this the immortal heavenly bodies with their heavenly and divine nature. For he thought that the perpetual movement of the sun and moon and the rest, was the cause of their being immortal; and that the same inference was valid in the case of the soul.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit magis autem hic ponit opinionem illorum qui posuerunt aquam primum principium omnium rerum. Fuerunt enim quidam rudes discipuli, et sequaces Thaletis, qui, sicut dictum est, voluerunt comparare principium unius rei ad principium totius naturae: et isti videbant, quod principium omnium viventium sit humidum: unde opinabantur, quod eodem modo principium omnium rerum sit humidum. Cum igitur aqua sit humidius elementum inter cetera, dixerunt ipsam esse principium omnium rerum: et usque ad hoc secuti sunt magistrum suum, scilicet Thaletem. Sed in hoc differunt: quia Thales, licet poneret aquam esse omnium principium, non tamen dixit animam esse aquam, sed virtutem moventem, sicut dictum est. Isti vero de numero rudium dixerunt animam esse aquam, ut Hippo. Hic namque arguebat quosdam qui dicebant, animam esse sanguinem, ex hoc quod sanguis non est genitura seu semen rerum animatarum, quam dicebant esse primam animam: et hoc attribuebant aquae propter humiditatem.
          <td>62. Then at ‘Some cruder thinkers’, Aristotle states an opinion of some who made water the first principle. For there were certain rather crude followers of Thales who tried to make the principle of one particular thing an analogy of the first principle of Nature as a whole. Observing that moisture was fundamental to living things they concluded that it must be the first principle of an things; in short, that the latter was water. So far indeed they followed their master, Thales; but whereas he, though admitting water to be the first principle, would not, as we have seen, allow that the soul was water, but rather a motive force, his cruder disciples (such as Hippo) asserted that it was water. Hippo tried to refute those who said the soul was blood with the argument that blood is not the generating seed (which they called ‘the inchoate soul’) of animate things. He identified this with water on account of its humidity.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit alii autem ponit opinionem cuiusdam philosophi, qui magis considerans animam quantum ad cognitionem, adhuc grossius locutus est de ipsa: dicens ipsam esse sanguinem.

Et hoc dixit Critias.
          <td>63. Next, at ‘Others, such as Critias’ he alludes to a philosopher who was more interested in the soul’s knowledge. He was still cruder in his expressions, saying that the soul itself was blood. His reason was that sense-perception only takes place in animals through the medium of blood: for the bloodless organs, such as bones, nails and teeth are without sensation (he forgot the nerves which are extremely sensitive and yet bloodless). If then, he said, the soul is the root of knowledge, the soul must be blood. it was Critias who said this.

          <td>64. In case anyone should wonder why he has not mentioned earth along with the other elements, Aristotle, at, ‘Opinions have etc.,’ explains that his predecessors’ views on the soul followed on what they thought about the first principles; and as nobody judged earth to be a first principle, nobody said it was the soul; unless we count those—such as Democritus and Empedocles—who said that soul was, or was composed of, all the principles.

          <td>65. Then, at ‘All, taken together,’ he summarises, concluding this part of the enquiry; and first with reference to the elements or principles themselves, and then with regard to the contrarieties that are found in them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quantum vero ad ipsa principia: quia ipsi tria attribuebant animae: scilicet quod sit quid subtilissimum, quod sit quid cognoscitivum, et quod sit quid motivum: et haec tria, scilicet sensus, motus et incorporeum, reducuntur in principium. Illud enim dicunt esse principium, quod est simplex. Item principium ex se habet, quod sit cognoscitivum, quia sicut dictum est, simile simili cognoscitur: unde et dicebant animam componi ex elementis, aut esse elementa, quia dicebant, quod simile simili cognoscitur, praeter Anaxagoram qui ponebat intellectum immixtum. Item, quia principium est subtilissimum, dicebant illud maxime motivum; et quia anima cognoscit omnia, dicunt ipsam componi ex omnibus principiis. Et hoc dicunt omnes: quia secundum quod ponunt principia, ita ponunt animam. Unde quicumque ponunt unam aliquam causam seu principium et elementum unum, isti dicunt animam esse illud unum, sicut iam patet: ut ignem, aut aerem, seu aquam. Item illi, qui dicunt plura principia esse, isti similiter aiunt animam esse plura illa, sive ex his componi.
          <td>First, then, he notes that the soul has been described by all-in terms of these three notes: fineness of grain or texture (incorporeality); knowledge; movement; and that each of these notes has been also traced back to a first principle. For that is called a principle which is simple. Also a principle, it is said, is essentially cognitive (for, to recall what, was said above, I since like is known by like, they said that the soul was composed of, or even was, the elements of all things. Anaxagoras, to be sure, is an exception with his pure unmixed Intellect). Again, they identified the chief motive-force in things with a ‘principle’ since a principle is what is least corporeal. And the soul’s knowledge of all things proves, they said, that it was composed of all the principles or elements. All their theories turn on this correspondence between the soul and the first principles. Whoever posited some one cause or principle or element, such as fire, air or water, identified just that one with the soul. So, too, whoever upheld many principles either identified them with the soul. or with its component elements.

Sed qualiter cognoscit intellectus, neque Anaxagoras dixit, neque est manifestum ex his quae dicta sunt.
          <td>66. Having excepted Anaxagoras, touching the theory of the soul’s composition, he goes on, at ‘But Anaxagoras’ to show how this man differed from the others. He alone, says Aristotle, denied the passivity of the intellect, its share in the nature of the things that it knows. But how intellect knows, Anaxagoras does not say; nor can one infer anything certain from what he does say.

Dans enim elementis caliditatem, frigiditatem, humiditatem et siccitatem, dat et animae inesse contrarietates has. Dixit enim, quod terra terram intuemur, aquam autem aqua, et cetera. Quidam vero posuerunt principium omnium esse unum elementorum, et illius qualitatem apposuerunt animae: ii quidem ignis caliditatem, qui dixerunt principium omnium esse ignem: illi vero qui dicunt primum principium aquam, apponunt animae frigiditatem. Unde secundum qualitates principiorum, quae ponunt, dicunt similiter esse animam, ut de natura caloris, aut frigoris, et huiusmodi. Et hoc etiam ostendunt ex nominibus, quibus nominant ipsam animam; quia illi, qui dicebant animam esse de natura caloris, denominabant eam a zaein vel zooein, idest vivere, quod denominatum est a zeein, quod est fervere. Illi vero, qui dicebant animam de natura frigoris, nominabant eam psychron, quod est frigidum, unde et ab hoc venit Psychi, idest anima propter refrigerationem, quae salvat animal ex respiratione. Sic ergo patet, quod alii nominabant animam a vita, scilicet illi qui dicebant ipsam de natura caloris. Alii autem respirationem, scilicet illi qui dicebant, quod erat de natura frigoris. Ex his omnibus concludit dicens, quod haec sunt, quae tradita sunt de anima, et propter quas causas sic dicunt de ipsa.
          <td>67. To end this section, Aristotle summarises what he has to say touching the contrariety of the above-mentioned principles to one another. Some, he says, arrange the first principles of things in pairs of opposites; and the soul also they regard as a synthesis of contraries. Thus Empedocles thought that the heat and cold, the moisture and dryness which he found ‘in the elements were intrinsic to the soul also. As earthy, he said, we know earth, as watery water, and so on. Others found their first principle in only one element, whose particular quality they then attributed to the soul. If it was fire, then the soul, they said, was hot; if water, then the soul was cold. According to the principle assumed so was the quality attributed to the soul, as though it shared in the nature of heat or cold etc. This is clear from the names they gave to the soul. Those who said it was hot gave it names derived from <i>zaein</i> or <i>zooein</i> , meaning to live, which itself comes from <i>zeein</i> , meaning to boil; while others who said it was cold called it <i>psychron</i> , meaning cold, whence comes <i>psyche</i> , a term applied to the soul because the coolness caused by breathing preserves animal life. Those who thought the soul by nature hot, named it from life; those who thought it by nature cold, from respiration. And Aristotle concludes by saying that the foregoing are the opinions handed down about the soul, together with the grounds on which they are maintained.

            <td>The first thing to be considered is movement. For perhaps it is not only false to say that this is the essence of the soul, as some mean when they say the soul is self-moving, or is able to move itself, but that there should be movement in it at all is an impossibility. It has already been stated that it is not necessary that everything that causes motion be itself moving. For everything moves in one of two ways: either by another, or of itself. We say, ‘by another’, of anything that moves through being in that which moves, like sailors; for these are not in motion in the same way as the ship. The latter moves of itself, but they through being in what moves. This is evident if we consider their parts. Walking is the proper motion of the feet—and also of men—; but for the time being the sailors do not walk. Movement being thus predicated in two ways, we now turn to the soul, asking whether it moves of itself and participates in motion. §§ 68-74

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td width="50%">Supra posuit philosophus opiniones aliorum philosophorum de anima: hic consequenter disputat contra eas. Sunt autem tria, quae dicti philosophi attribuebant animae: scilicet quod sit principium motus, quod sit principium cognitionis, et quod sit incorporalissimum. Inter quae duo ex eis, quae sunt quasi principalia, quae primo et per se animae attribuebant; scilicet quod sit principium motus, et quod sit principium cognitionis. Tertium autem, quod attribuebant animae, scilicet quod sit subtilissimum quantum ad aliquid bene dicitur, quantum ad aliquid male. Si enim subtilissimum accipiatur simpliciter dictum de anima, sic bene dicitur, quia sine dubio anima incorporalissima et subtilissima est. Si autem non accipiatur simpliciter, sed cum corpore, ut dicatur anima subtilissimum corpus, sic male dicitur. Et ideo philosophus non utitur nisi duobus tantum, scilicet motu et cognitione.
          <td>68. The Philosopher now begins to criticise the theories he has been recounting. These theories amount to three statements about the soul: that it is the source of movement and of knowledge, and that it is in a special way incorporeal. The two former attributions, the principal ones, have been predicated of the soul in an absolute sense, as referring directly to its essence. The third is, however, true in one sense and false in another. For if immateriality is taken as predicated simply and absolutely of the soul, then the statement is true; for soul is certainly the least material and most rarified of things. But if it is predicated only in relation to the body, as if to say that soul is the least material of bodies, then the statement is not true. Hence the Philosopher sets to work only with the two former attributions, of movement and of knowledge.

          <td>69. This part of the treatise falls into three divisions. Aristotle first argues against the philosophers who had made the soul the source of movement; then at ‘There are then three ways’ against those who regarded it as the seat of knowledge; and thirdly, at ‘Since knowledge pertains’ he raises the question whether movement, feeling and knowing ought to be attributed to the soul as to one principle or several. The first of these divisions is again divided. He first adduces objections against simply identifying the soul itself with a source of movement; and then against an opinion, proceeding from this identification, according to which the soul was also a self-moving number. (This comes at ‘Much the most unreasonable’. ) The former argument again subdivides into, first a criticism of the way in which these philosophers had predicated movement of the soul, and secondly, at ‘One might with more reason,’ a query whether this predication might have been made differently. Then the criticism is divided into, first, a general argument against all who said that the soul was the source of movement; and secondly, at ‘Some say that a soul moves’ a series of particular discussions of special points. Finally, the general argument is subdivided. First, he says what he intends to do; secondly, he argues ‘in support of his own opinion. The latter begins at ‘Since there are four kinds of movement’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod sicut ex superioribus habetur, philosophi ex duobus venerunt in cognitionem animae, scilicet motu et sensu. Et inter haec primo considerandum est de motu. Omnes autem philosophi, qui venerunt in cognitionem animae ex motu, hoc principium habebant commune, scilicet quod omne quod movet, movetur: unde quia naturale est animae quod moveret, credebant quod ei sit connaturale quod moveretur; et hoc habere animam ex substantia sua: unde et ponebant in eius definitione motum, dicentes animam esse quid movens seipsum.
          <td>70. He begins then by remarking that philosophers have studied the soul from two points of view, from motion and from knowledge. This is clear from what has been said. And Aristotle says that he will start from motion. Now all the others who started from this point of view had one notion in common, that everything that produces movement is itself moving. They thought therefore that if soul is by nature a cause of movement, it must be by its nature a moving essence. So they put movement into its definition, calling it something that moves itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est ergo hic contra duo disputandum: scilicet contra rationem positionis, et contra ipsam positionem. Utrumque enim est falsum. Nam et ratio positionis istorum falsa erat, et eorum positio. Hoc enim quod supponebant tamquam per se verum, scilicet quod omne quod movet movetur, falsum est, sicut satis probatur in octavo physicorum: ubi ostenditur, quod est quoddam movens immobile. Et quantum ad hoc pertinet, breviter potest ostendi, quod si aliquid movet, non oportet quod moveatur. Constat enim quod secundum quod movet, est in actu, secundum quod movetur, est in potentia; et sic idem et secundum idem esset in actu et potentia: quod est inconveniens.
          <td>71. Now here there are two disputable points; the theory itself is disputable, and so is the principle upon which it rests. The principle presupposed as a self-evident truth, namely that every active mover is itself in movement, is in fact not true, as is clearly enough shown in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i> , where Aristotle proves the existence of an unmoved mover. And as to this, we may give here a short proof that if a thing produces movement it does not have to be in movement itself. It is clear that in so far as a thing produces movement it is in act, and in so far as it is caused to move, it is in potency. (if then as causing movement it were moved), the same thing would be in act and potency in the same respect; which hardly makes sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc praetermisso, disputemus ad positionem eorum, utrum scilicet anima moveatur. Dicebant autem isti, duo: scilicet quod anima movetur, et quod motus esset de substantia animae. Aristoteles autem utrumque negat, dicens, quod fortassis. Hoc dicit, quia nondum probaverat hoc quod dicit, non solum falsum est, quod motus sit de substantia animae, secundum quod dicunt definientes ipsam, dicentes animam esse quod est seipsum movens, aut possibile movere; sed totaliter impossibile est ipsi animae convenire, quod moveatur.
          <td>72. But even setting this difficulty aside, the theory that the soul is in movement is disputable. Its upholders indeed added the further proposition, that movement was of the soul’s essence; but Aristotle denies both parts of this theory where he says, ‘For perhaps’, etc. He puts it like this because he has not yet proved his assertion, namely that not only is it false to say that movement is of the essence of the soul (which is what they imply when they define the soul as an actual or potential self-mover) but that it is also quite impossible that the soul should move at all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc prius dictum est, scilicet in octavo physicorum, videlicet quod non sit necesse omne movens moveri. In movente etiam seipsum duo sunt: unum movens, et aliud motum: et impossibile est, quod illud quod est movens, moveatur per se. In animalibus autem licet non moveatur per se pars movens, movetur tamen per accidens. Omne enim quod movetur, movetur dupliciter: quia vel secundum se, vel secundum alterum, seu per accidens. Secundum se, quando res ipsa movetur, ut navis: per accidens, vel secundum alterum, quando non movetur ipsum, sed illud in quo est: sicut nauta in navi movetur, non quia ipse moveatur, sed quia navis movetur. Unde haec est vera, scilicet navis movetur secundum se, nauta vero secundum accidens. Et quod non movetur nauta per se, patet: quia quando aliquis movetur per se, movetur secundum partes suas; sicut in ambulatione prius est pedum ambulatio, et hoc, cum est nauta in navi, non inest ei. Sic ergo patet, quod moveri dicitur dupliciter: secundum se et secundum accidens. Sed isti attribuebant animae moveri secundum se. Et ideo praetermisso ad praesens utrum anima moveatur per accidens, intendamus de anima si movetur secundum se et participat motu, sicut isti dicebant.
          <td>73. That not everything which causes movement need itself be moved was shown in an earlier work, Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i> . Now in any self-mover there are two things to be considered, the thing moving, and the thing moved; and the former cannot as such be the same as the latter. In living things, however, though the moving part is not moved in itself, absolutely speaking, yet it is moved indirectly. For there are two kinds of movement, direct and indirect: direct, when a thing itself is moving, e.g. a ship; indirect when a thing itself is at rest, but moved with the movement of something else which contains it, as the sailor on board ship moves with the ship’s movement, not his own. So the ship moves directly and in itself, but the sailor only in an accidental way or relatively. This is clear if we consider that when anything moves in itself, its parts are moving, as in walking the feet make the first movement; but once the sailor is on board this does not happen. Movement then can be taken in either of these two senses; but since the philosophers we are discussing said that the soul is moved in itself, directly, we can forgo at present the question whether it is moved indirectly, and consider only whether it is directly affected by movement, as they maintained.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod non movetur per se, probat Aristoteles sex rationibus. Circa quas rationes considerandum est, quod licet rationes Aristotelis parum videantur valere, nihilominus sunt efficaces, quia sunt ad positionem: aliter enim argumentandum est ad eum qui simpliciter intendit veritatem, quia ex veris oportet procedere: sed qui arguit ad positionem, procedit ex datis: et ideo frequenter Aristoteles, et quando argumentatur ad positiones, videtur quod inducat rationes parum efficaces, quia procedit ex datis ad interimendum positionem.
          <td>74. To show that the soul does not move in itself, Aristotle uses six arguments, with regard to which we should note that, while they may not appear very cogent, still they are effective in relation to the theory he is criticising. For it is one thing to argue out the simple truth of a question, and another to reason against a particular theory; in the former case you have to make sure that your premises are true, but in the latter you proceed from what your adversary concedes or asserts. Hence it is that when Aristotle criticises the views of others, he often seems to use rather weak arguments. In each case he is, in fact, destroying his adversary’s position by drawing out its logical consequences.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic ergo primam rationem ponit ibi quatuor autem quae talis est. Si anima movetur, aut movetur per se, aut per accidens. Si per accidens, tunc motus non erit substantia animae: quod est contra eos; sed movetur sicut album et tricubitum, quae moventur secundum accidens, et ideo non exigitur ad hoc locus ipsis. Si vero movetur per se, ergo movetur aliqua specie motus. Species autem motus sunt quatuor: scilicet secundum locum, augmenti et decrementi, et alterationis. Generatio enim et corruptio non sunt proprie motus, sed mutationes; quia motus sunt successivi, sed generatio et corruptio sunt mutationes instantaneae. Ergo anima movebitur aliqua specie istorum motuum: vel secundum locum, vel secundum augmentum, vel secundum decrementum, vel secundum alterationem. Si ergo movetur aliquo istorum, et omnes hi motus sunt in loco: ergo anima erit in loco.
          <td>75. The first argument begins at ‘Since there are four kinds’, and may be stated as follows. If the soul moves, its movement is either direct (in the sense explained) or indirect. if indirect, then it is not of the essence of the soul (which is against their opinion), and the soul moves in the same way as whiteness or 3 inches, which are accidental qualities moving only with the thing that is white or 3 inches long, and not themselves, as such, requiring a position in space. But if the soul moves in itself, it moves in one of the four kinds of movement: change of place, growth, decrease or alteration. Coming-to-be and passing-away are not movements, strictly speaking, but changes, because they are instantaneous, whilst movements are successive. Hence the soul will have to move in one of these four ways—from place to place; by increase or decrease in size; or by qualitative alteration. But if all these movements involve position in space, the soul will then be localised in space.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In hac autem ratione videntur esse duo dubia. Unum de hoc, quod quidem de locali et de motu augmenti et decrementi manifestum est: sed de alteratione videtur difficile. Quod quidem sic intelligitur ab aliquibus: quia enim omne quod alteratur est corpus, et corpus est in loco, ideo alteratio dicitur fieri in loco. Sed hoc non salvat literam Aristotelis; quia Aristoteles dicit quod huiusmodi motus sunt in loco et non sunt secundum locum. Et ideo dicendum quod sine dubio alteratio est in loco. Aliud enim est motus in loco, et aliud motum esse secundum locum. Alteratio non est secundum locum, sed in loco. Nam in alteratione oportet quod sit appropinquatio alterantis ad alteratum, et sine hoc nihil alteratur. Unde cum appropinquatio fiat per motum localem, oportet quod sit ibi motus localis ut causa.
          <td>76. There seem to be two doubtful points in this argument. The first is that, while it is clear enough as regards locomotion, growth and decrease, it suggests a difficulty about alteration. Some meet this difficulty by saying that as only bodies are subject to alteration, and all bodies are in place, alteration itself may be said to occur in place. But this does not keep to the letter of the argument: Aristotle says that this kind of movement is in place and not merely according to place. Movement in place is quite different from movement according to place; and, following Aristotle, I maintain that alteration certainly occurs in place. Of itself, and not simply because of its localised subject, it is in place; for, when any alteration occurs, the agent producing it must draw near to the thing altered; otherwise nothing would ever be altered. And since drawing near is a local movement, it follows that here and now the cause of a given alteration is a change in place.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum dubium est, quia secundum istos non erit inconveniens si anima esset in loco, cum ponerent eam moveri per se; et ideo non videtur valere sua ratio. Ad hoc autem potest responderi dupliciter. Uno modo, quod istud inconveniens deducitur per sequentes rationes. Alio modo, quia propter hoc est inconveniens, quia si anima esset in loco, oporteret quod assignaretur sibi locus proprius in corpore separatus, et sic non esset forma totius corporis.
          <td>77. The second difficulty is that these philosophers do not in fact see anything unreasonable in the soul’s being in place, since they maintain that it moves in itself, absolutely. So Aristotle’s objection seems to misfire. To this two answers might be given, (a) that the objection to the soul’s being in place will become clearer as we proceed, and (b) that if the soul were in place, it would have to be assigned a definite position in the body and thus would not be the form of the whole body. This reinforces the objection to the soul’s being in place.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Si anima movetur per se secundum locum, movetur naturaliter: omne autem quod movetur naturaliter, movetur violenter: sed si movetur naturaliter quiescit naturaliter, et si quiescit naturaliter quiescit violenter; ergo anima movetur violenter, et quiescit violenter. Sed hoc est impossibile, scilicet quod moveatur violenter et quiescat violenter, quia motus animae et quies sunt voluntarii.
          <td>78. The second argument, at ‘Further, if it moves’, is this. If the soul moves ‘absolutely’ from place to place, the movement must be natural to it. But anything that can be moved naturally can be moved violently.’ Now its natural movement implies a natural ceasing to move; and therefore also its enforced, violent movement implies an enforced ceasing to move. Hence the soul may both move and stop moving under compulsion; which is impossible if by nature both its movement and ceasing to move are spontaneous.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In hac autem ratione videtur dubium esse: scilicet quod id quod movetur naturaliter, non tamen violenter. Ad hoc dicendum est, quod illa propositio secundum veritatem falsa est, sed secundum positionem vera; quia isti nullum corpus ponebant naturaliter motum, nisi quatuor elementa, in quibus videmus motus et quietes naturaliter et violenter fieri; et secundum hoc procedit ratio.
          <td>79. A difficulty here seems to be that what moves naturally does not in fact move under compulsion. I answer that what Aristotle says is false absolutely speaking, but true relative to the theory under discussion. For these philosophers maintained that the only bodies that moved with a natural movement were the four elements; in which we do observe both natural and enforced movement and ceasing to move. This opinion is presupposed by the argument.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius si quidem quae talis est. Illi dicunt quod anima movetur, et ex hoc movet corpus: et hunc motum dicunt habere ab aliquo elementorum: aut ergo sequitur motum ignis, aut terrae, aut aliorum elementorum. Si ergo participat motum ignis, movebitur solum sursum: si terrae, deorsum. Sed hoc est falsum, quia anima movet ad omnem partem. Et haec ratio procedit ex suppositione.
          <td>80. The third argument, at ‘Again, if,’ runs as follows: these men who ascribe movement primarily to the soul, and to the body only as derived from the soul, also say that this movement is due to one or other of the elements, fire or earth or one of the others. But if the soul moved with the nature of fire it would only rise; if with the nature of earth it would only sink; whereas in fact it moves in all directions. This argument also is ad hominem.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit cum dicit quoniam autem quae talis est. Vos dicitis animam ex hoc moveri, quod movet corpus; ergo rationabile est dicere, quod illis motibus movet corpus, quibus ipsa movetur: et e converso, verum erit dicere, quod illis motibus movetur, quibus movet corpus. Sed corpus movetur secundum loci mutationem: ergo anima movetur secundum locum. Sed si moveri animam secundum locum est mutare corpus, contingit ipsam animam exeuntem iterum intrare corpus. Et quia animam ingredi corpus est vivificare corpus: sequitur ad hoc, mortua de numero animalium, secundum naturam resurgere, quod est impossibile.
          <td>81. The fourth argument comes at ‘Since it seems’. It is this. You say that it is in moving the body that the soul moves. Logically, then, it follows that it moves the body by its own movements; and conversely that it is moved by the same movements which move the body. But the body moves by changing position in space; so also then the soul. But if the soul’s local movements affect the body, the soul might, after leaving the body, enter it once more. And since it is the soul’s presence that gives life to the body, it follows that dead animals might, even naturally, come back to life: which is impossible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Contra hanc rationem aliqui obiiciunt, dicentes, quod hoc scilicet quod anima moveat eisdem motibus quibus movetur, non est verum, quia anima non movetur nisi secundum appetitum et voluntatem, movet autem corpus aliis motibus. Ad quod dicendum, quod appetere, et velle, et huiusmodi, non sunt motus animae, sed operationes. Motus autem et operatio differunt, quia motus est actus imperfecti, operatio vero est actus perfecti. Nihilominus tamen vera est illa propositio secundum positionem; quia illi dicebant animam non aliter mobilem, nisi secundum quod movet corpus.
          <td>82. Against this argument some have objected that it ignores the difference between the movements which affect the soul itself and those by which it moves other things, including the body. The former are movements of desire and will; not so the latter. But in reply one may say that desires and volitions and so on are not properly ‘movements’ of the. soul but ‘operations’. ‘Movements’ and ‘operations’ are different: a movement is an act of something that is incomplete, whereas an operation is an act of a subject already possessing full actuality. Still, what Aristotle says is true relative to the theory under discussion; for this had identified all the movements of the soul with those by which it moved the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed numquid sequitur illud inconveniens, quod resurgant corpora animalium, si anima movetur secundum locum? Dicendum, quod quidam dixerunt quod anima est commixta toti corpori, et unita secundum quamdam proportionem, et quod non separatur nisi solvatur illa proportio: unde quantum ad istos non sequitur. Sed quantum ad illos qui dicunt animam esse in corpore ut in loco seu in vase, et intrare et egredi aliquando, sequitur illud inconveniens Aristotelis.
          <td>83. But is it true that if the soul had local movement dead animals would come to life again? Well, some philosophers have maintained that the soul pervades the whole body, forming a unity with it through some kind of proportion, and that the two cannot be separated without this proportion being destroyed; so that, so far as this view is concerned, the conclusion would not follow. But it does follow from—and is a valid objection against—the opinion of those who say the soul is located in the body as in a vessel which it sometimes enters and sometimes leaves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quintam rationem ponit cum dicit movet autem quae talis est. Constat, quod illud quod secundum se inest alicui rei, non est necesse quod insit ei secundum aliud, nisi forte per accidens. Si ergo inest animae quod moveatur secundum se et secundum naturam suam, necessarium est quod anima sit mobilis secundum se; ergo non indiget quod moveatur per aliud et ab alio. Sed nos videmus, quod movetur a sensibilibus in sentiendo, et ab appetibilibus in appetendo; non ergo anima per se movetur.
          <td>84. The fifth argument comes at ‘If it does move’, and runs as follows. It is clear that when anything is of the essence of a given subject its presence in the latter does not need, except incidentally, to be explained by anything else. If then the soul is essentially moving, it is mobile of its own nature; it does not need to be moved through or by anything else. But we know that it is in fact moved by sensible objects when it senses, and by things desirable when it desires; therefore it does not move of itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad hoc obviant Platonici, dicentes, quod anima non movetur a sensibilibus, sed occurrunt motui animae, inquantum anima discurrit per ea. Sed hoc est falsum; quia sicut Aristoteles probat, intellectus possibilis reducitur per ipsa, scilicet per species rerum sensibilium, in actum; et ideo oportet quod moveatur ab eis hoc modo.
          <td>85. The Platonists meet this argument by denying that the soul is moved by sensible objects; these, they say, are merely involved in the soul’s own movement when it passes from one object to another. But this is untrue. As Aristotle has proved, the intellectual potency is brought into act precisely by means of the sensible objects as apprehended; so that it is moved by them in this way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit cum dicit at vero quae talis est. Si anima movet seipsam, constat quod ipsa movebitur secundum suam substantiam: sed omne quod movetur, distat vel exit ab eo a quo et secundum quod movetur; sicut si aliquid movetur a quantitate, exit et distat ab ipsa quantitate qua movetur. Si ergo anima movetur a substantia sua et a seipsa, sicut illi dicunt; et distabit et exibit a substantia sua; et sic motus erit sibi causa corruptionis: quod est contrarium illis, qui dicebant animam propter motum ipsum assimilari divinis et immortalem esse, ut superius patet. Et haec ratio procedit quantum ad eos, qui non distinguebant inter operationem et motum. Operatio enim non facit distare, sed perficit operantem: sed in motu oportet quod sit exitus.
          <td>86. The sixth argument begins at ‘But if it moves itself’. Clearly, if the soul is self-moving, its own essence governs its movement. But in every movement the moving thing comes away or proceeds from that which moves it and governs its movement; for instance, if anything is moved by a quantity, it departs and proceeds from the latter. If then the soul is moved by its own essence (as they say) it must depart or proceed from its own essence; which is as much as to say that it causes its own destruction. How then could it be through movement that the soul becomes god-like and immortal, as some philosophers whom we have mentioned supposed?, This argument bears against those who did not distinguish between movement proper and operation. For movement implies that what is moved comes away from the cause of movement; but operation is a perfection intrinsic to the operating agent itself

          <td>Supra posuit philosophus rationes in communi contra eos qui posuerunt animam secundum se moveri: hic vero ponit rationes in speciali contra quosdam qui aliquid specialis difficultatis videntur dixisse circa opinionem eorum de motu animae.

          <td>87. Having argued in a general way against the view that movement pertains essentially to the soul, the Philosopher now brings forward arguments against particular philosophers whose theories of the movement of the soul seem to give rise to some special difficulty. These arguments fall into three groups. First, he opposes an opinion of Democritus; then, at ‘In the same way’, one of Plato; and thirdly, at ‘There is another opinion’ another theory.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primo enim ponit opinionem Democriti de motu animae, et exponit eam. Secundo vero obiicit in contrarium, ibi, nos autem interrogabimus.
          <td>He begins, then, by stating the view of Democritus on the soul’s movement; and then brings objections against it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum sciendum est quod in praecedentibus ponitur in una ratione, scilicet in quarta Aristotelis contra illos, qui ponunt animam moveri secundum se et ex hoc movet corpus. Quod si anima movet corpus, necesse est, quod illis motibus moveat, quibus ipsa movetur. Et hoc concedebant quidam, qui dicunt animam movere corpus in quo est, sicut ipsa movetur, idest illis motibus movere, quibus ipsa movetur. Et hic fuit Democritus. Et inducebat ad hoc similitudinem: quia erat quidam magister comoediarum nomine Philippus. Hic recitavit in libris suis, quod quidam nomine Daedalus fecit statuam ligneam deae Veneris, et haec statua erat mobilis ex eo, quod erat intus argentum fusile, idest vivum, et movebatur motu ipsius argenti vivi. Simile ergo huic dicit Democritus in opinione sua de motu animae. Dicit enim quod anima est composita ex indivisibilibus sphaeris, ut superius patet. Et quia huiusmodi indivisibiles sphaerae, idest atomi, sunt figurae rotundae, continue moventur, et ex eo quod numquam quiescunt, contrahunt et movent totum corpus secundum quod ipsae moventur.
          <td>88. This theory has already been referred to by Aristotle in his fourth objection to the view that the soul moves in itself and by this movement makes the body move. If the soul moves the body, he has said, it must do so in virtue of its own movement. This was admitted by those who said that each soul moved its own body in a manner corresponding to the movement in itself; among whom was Democritus who made use of the following illustration. There was a certain comic dramatist called Philip who tells somewhere of one Daedalus, that he made a wooden statue of the goddess Venus, and that this statue, being filled with quicksilver, was able to move. It moved as the quicksilver moved. And what Democritus said of the soul’s movement was rather similar. The soul, he said, (as has been noted above) was composed of indivisible spheres or atoms which, being round in shape, were always moving about, and by their incessant movement made the whole body cohere and move accordingly.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit nos autem obiicit Aristoteles contra hanc opinionem Democriti, duabus rationibus. Prima ratio talis est. Constat, quod anima non solum est causa motus in animali, sed quietis. Sed secundum opinionem Democriti, anima non est causa quietis, licet sit causa motus in animali: quia difficile aut impossibile est dicere, quod illa corpora sphaerica indivisibilia quiescant, cum nunquam immota permaneant, ut dictum est.
          <td>89. Then, at ‘Now, what we, etc.’, Aristotle puts two objections to this. First, it is agreed that in animals the soul is the cause of resting, as well as the cause of movement. But according to Democritus the soul is never the cause of rest, though it is the cause of animal movements. For he could hardly maintain that those spherical atoms ever rested if they never cease to move.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit omnino autem quae talis est. Constat quod motus, quem argentum vivum causat in statua, non est motus voluntarius, sed violentus. Sed motus animae non est violentus, sed voluntarius, quia movet per voluntatem et intellectum, et ideo nulla, ut videtur est positio Democriti.
          <td>90. Again, at ‘The soul seems’ he puts a second objection. The movement caused by quicksilver in the statue is obviously not spontaneous; it is a compelled movement. On the contrary, that of the soul is spontaneous, proceeding from mind and will. Hence the view of Democritus seems worthless.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit eodem autem ponit opinionem Platonis. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim ponit opinionem Platonis. Secundo reprobat eam, ibi, primum quidem igitur et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit similitudinem opinionis Platonicae ad opinionem Democriti. Secundo explicat opinionem Platonis de anima, ibi, constitutam autem ex elementis et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod sicut Democritus posuit corpus moveri ab anima inquantum anima coniuncta ipsi movetur, ita et Timaeus qui introducitur a Platone loquens, assignat rationem qualiter anima movet corpus. Dicit enim, quod anima movet corpus inquantum ipsa movetur, propter hoc quod anima coniuncta est corpori per modum cuiusdam colligationis.
          <td>91. Then at ‘In the same way’ he first states the opinion of Plato, which, at ‘Now in the first place,’ he will reject. But before explaining what Plato said about the soul he shows its similarity to the theory of Democritus. As Democritus had supposed that the soul’s movements moved the body to which it was joined, so also did Timaeus, a speaker introduced by Plato. For he said that soul moves body in so far as soul itself moves; because the two are, as it were, bound up together.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit constitutam autem explicat opinionem Platonis. Et primo exprimit constitutionem substantiae ipsius. Secundo exponit quomodo ex ea procedit motus, ibi, aspectum rectum in circulum reflexit. Circa primum sciendum est, quod Plato haec verba, quae hic ponuntur, in Timaeo prosequitur loquens de anima mundi, quam imitantur, secundum ipsum, inferiores animae. Et ideo per hoc quod hic tangitur de natura animae mundi, tangitur quodammodo natura omnis animae. Sciendum est igitur, quod sicut supra dictum est, Plato posuit substantiam omnium rerum esse numerum, ratione superius dicta. Elementa autem numeri ponebat unum quasi formale, et duo quasi materiale. Ex uno enim et duobus omnes numeri constituuntur. Et quia impar numerus quodammodo retinet aliquid de indivisione unitatis, posuit duo elementa numeri, par et impar; et impari attribuit identitatem et finitatem, pari autem attribuit alteritatem et infinitatem.
          <td>92. With ‘Being compounded, etc.’ Aristotle makes Plato’s view explicit; first as to what constitutes the essence of the soul, at ‘God bent, etc.,’ as to how movement proceeds from it. Regarding the former question, note that the words quoted here are used by Plato in the <i>Timaeus</i> and refer to the Soul of the world which, according to him, is imitated by inferior souls. So when he touches, as here, on the nature of the World-Soul, he refers also, in a way, to any soul. Now Plato, for the reason already given, maintained that the essence of all things was numerical; and that in number the formal element, so to say, was one and the material element two—all numbers being made up of one and two. And as odd numbers retain something of the indivision of one, he laid down two elements of number, the even and the odd, attributing to the odd identity and finitude, but to the even difference and infinity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius signum tangitur in tertio physicorum; quia si supra unitatem impares numeri per ordinem adduntur, semper producitur eadem figura numeralis. Puta, si supra unum addantur tria, qui est primus impar consurgunt ipsum quatuor, qui est numerus quadratus: quibus rursus si addatur secundus impar, scilicet quinarius, consurgit novenarius, qui item est numerus quadratus, et sic semper in infinitum. Sed in numeris paribus semper surgit alia et alia figura. Si enim unitati addatur binarius, qui est primus par, consurgit ternarius, qui est numerus triangularis; quibus si rursus addatur quaternarius, qui est secundus par, consurgit septenarius, qui est septangulae figurae, et sic in infinitum. Sic ergo Plato ponebat idem et diversum esse elementa omnium rerum, quorum unum attribuebat numero impari, aliud vero numero pari.
          <td>93. Some explanation of this theory may be found in the <i>Physics</i> , Book III. If odd numbers are added to unity in sequence the same type of number 2 always results; e.g. if 3, the first odd number, is added to 1, you get the square number 4; if to 4 You add the second odd number, 5, you get 9, Which is also a square number; and so on to infinity. But with even numbers the result is always a different type of number. Add 2, the first even number, to 1, the result is the ‘triangular’ number 3; to which if you add 4 the second even number, you get 7 which is ‘septangular’; and so on to infinity. Hence Plato made Identity and Difference the first elements of all things, attributing the former to odd numbers, the latter to even.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia vero substantiam animae ponebat mediam inter substantias superiores, quae semper eodem modo se habent, et substantias corporeas in quibus alteritas et motus invenitur: posuit animam constare ex his elementis, scilicet ex eodem et diverso, et ex numeris paribus et imparibus. Medium enim debet esse affine utrique extremorum. Et ideo dicit, quod posuit eam constitutam ex elementis.
          <td>94. And because he placed the soul mid-way between the higher substances, which never change, and corporeal substances, which change and move, he thought that the soul was constituted of the elements of Identity and Difference, and so of odd and even numbers. For the mean must participate in both extremes. This is why Aristotle says that Plato held the soul to be constituted by these elements.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item sciendum est, quod in numeris sunt diversae proportiones, et infinitae; quarum aliquae sunt harmonicae, idest consonantiarum causa. Nam dupla proportio est causa consonantiae, quae dicitur diapason; sesquialtera proportio causat consonantiam, quae dicitur Diatessaron; sesquioctava proportio causat tonum; et aliae consonantiae, quibusdam aliis proportionibus causantur. Puta, ea quae est composita ex diapason et diapente, causatur ex tripla: ea quae sub diapason causatur ex quadrupla, quam quidem Pythagoras deprehendit, ut Boetius refert in musica, ex percussione quatuor malleorum, qui consonantes sonos reddebant secundum praedictas proportiones. Puta si unus martellus ponderaret duodecim uncias, alius novem, alius octo, alius sex, ille qui esset duodecim haberet duplam proportionem ad eum qui sex, et redderetur cum eo consonantia diapason. Ille autem qui est duodecim ad eum qui octo sub sesquialtera proportione, et consonat secundum diapente; et similiter qui novem ad eum qui sex. Item qui duodecim ad eum qui novem est in sesquitertia proportione, et consonat cum eo Diatessaron; et similiter qui octo ad eum qui sex. Qui autem novem ad eum qui octo, cum sit in sesquioctava proportione, consonat secundum totum.
          <td>95. Again, we should note that in numbers there are different proportions and infinities, of which some are harmonic, i.e. the cause of harmony. The double proportion causes the harmony called a whole octave; that of 3 to 2 causes the harmony called a fifth; (that of 4 to 3 causes the harmony called a fourth); that of 9 to 8 causes a tone; and the other harmonies are caused by other proportions: for example the harmony composed of an octave and a fifth is caused by the triple proportion; that of the double octaves is caused by the quadruple proportion which was discovered by Pythagoras, as Boethius [ <i>De Musica</i> , I, 10] relates, from the striking of four hammers which sounded in harmony according to the aforesaid proportions. Thus if one hammer weighed twelve ounces, one nine, one eight and one six, the one that weighed twelve ounces would be in the proportion of two to one to the one weighing six, and the two together would render the harmony of the octave. Again, the one weighing twelve ounces would be as three to two to the one that weighed eight, and the harmony produced would be that of a fifth; similarly in the case of those that weighed nine ounces and six ounces. Again, the one weighing twelve ounces is in the proportion of from four to three to the one weighing nine, and makes with it the harmony of a fourth; so also does the one that weighs eight with that weighing six; while the one weighing, nine is proportioned to the one that weighs eight, and produces with it the harmony called a tone.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Licet autem Plato posuerit res omnes ex numeris constitui, non tamen ex numeris habentibus proportiones harmonicas: sed animam posuit esse constitutam secundum numeros habentes huiusmodi proportiones. Et ideo dicit, quod posuit eam dispartitam, idest quasi dispensatam, secundum harmonicos numeros, idest secundum numeros proportionatos adinvicem secundum musicam proportionem. Posuit enim ex his numeris animam constitutam, scilicet ex uno, duobus, tribus, quatuor, octo, novem, vigintiseptem, in quibus huiusmodi proportiones inveniuntur.
          <td>96. But if Plato reduced everything to numbers, these were not harmonic numbers, except in the case of the soul. Hence Aristotle gives it as Plato’s view that the soul was ‘divided’. or, as it were, weighed out, ‘according to harmonic numbers’, i.e. to numbers related to each other in musical proportions. He said that the soul was constituted of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9 and 27; in which these harmonic proportions are found.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Duplici autem ex causa animam posuit constitutam ex numeris harmonicis. Una est, quia unumquodque delectatur in eo quod est sibi simile et connaturale. Videmus autem quod anima delectatur in omnibus harmonizatis, et offenditur ex his quae sunt praeter debitam harmoniam, tam in sonis quam in coloribus, quam etiam in quibuscumque sensibilibus: unde videtur harmonia de natura animae esse. Et hoc est quod dicit anima habet sensum, idest cognitionem connaturalem harmoniae.
          <td>97. And he had two reasons for thinking this. One was the fact that similarity and connaturality are always a cause of pleasure. We find the soul taking pleasure in all harmonies and disliking whatever is unharmonious in sounds and colours and indeed in any sensible quality. So harmony seems to be natural to the soul. This is what he means by saying that the soul has ‘a connatural sense (i.e. knowledge) of harmony’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alia ratio est, quia Pythagorici et Platonici posuerunt ex motibus caelorum provenire sonos optime harmonizatos; et quia motus caelestes ponebant esse ab anima mundi, posuerunt animam esse ex numeris harmonicis, ut posset causare motus harmonizatos. Et hoc est quod dicit: et ut omne, idest universum feratur secundum consonantes motus.
          <td>98. The second reason is that the Pythagoreans and Platonists thought that beautifully harmonious sounds resulted from the movements of the heavenly bodies; and since they supposed these movements to be caused by the World-Soul they naturally concluded that the soul was made up of harmonic numbers. Hence Aristotle says ‘that the whole (i.e. Universe) be borne along with well-attuned motions’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit aspectum rectum docet quomodo ex anima procedat motus caelestis. Ubi considerandum est, quod omnes numeri secundum naturalem ordinem accepti, linealiter dispositi sunt secundum rectitudinem, prout unus addit super alterum. Sed ex naturali serie numerorum potest aliquis accipere plures series: puta si accipiat homo quasi in una rectitudine totam seriem duplorum, et in alia totam seriem triplorum, et in alia totam seriem quadruplorum, et sic de aliis. Quia igitur homo sua cognitione potest circa numeros operari: hoc et Deus facit constituendo substantias rerum ex numeris. Unde in constituendo substantiam animae ex numeris supradictis, qui omnes naturali ordine sunt in una rectitudine, quasi duas lineas divisit: unam duplorum, et alteram triplorum; hae enim proportiones omnes harmonicas continent. Nam dupla proportio dividitur in sesquialteram et sesquitertiam. Et tripla in duplam et sesquialteram. Igitur in praedictis numeris accipitur series duplorum usque ad numerum cubicum: ut puta unum, duo, quatuor, octo; et alia series triplorum eodem modo, ut puta unum, tria, novem, vigintiseptem: quae quidem duae series in unitate coniunguntur ac si essent duae lineae rectae angulum continentes.
          <td>99. Next, when he says ‘God bent, etc.” Aristotle explains how the World-Soul is the cause of heavenly movements. Taking all numbers ‘in their natural order, we must think of them as laid in a straight line, each one adding to the preceding one. Now the natural numerical series can give rise to several other series; for example, one might take the geometrical series whose common ratios are 2 or 3 or 4, and so on for other ratios. As then man, by thought, can manipulate numbers, so does God in building up the substances of things from numbers. In constructing the soul’s substance out of the aforesaid numbers, namely all those placed in a straight line series according to their natural order, he divides them into two series: one, the geometrical series whose common ratio is 2; the other, the geometrical series whose common ratio is 3; because these two embrace all the harmonic proportions. For the double proportion is divided into the ratios 3:2 and 4:3; the triple into 2:1 and 3:2. Therefore the above-mentioned numbers are taken, in the geometrical series with common ratio 2, up to the first cube number, e.g. 1,2,4 up to 8; so also with the series with common ratio 3, e.g., 1,3,9,27. These two series meet at unity like two straight lines containing an angle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Rursus, si unitati coniungantur quae sunt in linea triplorum, resultabunt numeri qui sunt in linea duplorum: puta si unitati addatur trinarius, fient quatuor; et e converso, si unitati addatur binarius fient tria. Et sic constituentur quasi duae lineae sese invicem intersecantes, secundum modum literae Graecae quae vocatur XI.
          <td>100. Moreover, if the numbers in the series whose common ratio is three are joined to unity we get as a result the numbers of the series whose common ratio is 2; e.g. if to 1 is added 3 the result is 4. Conversely, if to 1 is added 2 the result is 3. Thus it is as if two lines were drawn intersecting each other like the Greek letter X.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem procedatur ulterius, redibitur ad eosdem numeros. Nam a quatuor proceditur ad octo, et a tribus redibitur ad vigintiseptem, et sic utrobique concluditur: quasi quidam circulus.
          <td>101. if we proceed further we return to the same numbers. For from 4 we go on to 8 and from 3 to 27; both series concluding with the same type of number, as though we were going round in a circle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum autem est, quod Plato ea quae inveniebantur in natura magis composita, dicebat provenire ex proprietate naturae magis simplicis, sicut consonantias sonorum ex proportionibus numerorum. Substantiam autem animae ponebat mediam inter numeros, qui sunt maxime abstracti, et inter substantiam sensibilem; et ideo proprietates animae deducebat ex proprietatibus praedictis numerorum. Nam in anima est considerare primo aspectum rectum, secundum quod aspicit directe ad suum obiectum; et postea reditur in circulum inquantum intellectus reflectit se supra seipsum. Invenitur etiam in anima intellectiva quasi circulus parium et imparium, inquantum cognoscit ea quae sunt eiusdem, et quae sunt diversae naturae; et hoc ulterius protenditur usque ad substantiam sensibilem caeli, quam anima movet.
          <td>102. We must realise that for Plato the more complex things found in nature are composed of simpler natures, just as the harmonies of sounds arise from the proportions between numbers. He put the essence of the soul mid-way between numbers, which are eminently abstract, and sensible substances; and so deduced the soul’s properties from the said numbers. Thus in the soul we find, first, a direct knowing, in that it looks directly at its object; and then the circular return by which the intellect reflects upon itself. So too the intellectual soul moves in a sort of circle with respect to the even and the odd in knowing things both like and unlike itself. And this principle is extended to the substance of the visible heavens moved by the World-Soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nam in caelo consideratur duplex motus circularis: unus simplex et uniformis, secundum quem caelum movetur seu revolvitur motu diurno ab oriente in occidentem, qui quidem fit secundum circulum aequinoctialem. Alius autem motus est planetarum, qui est ab occidente in orientem secundum circulum zodiacum, qui intersecat aequinoctialem in duobus solstitialibus punctis, scilicet in principio cancri, et Capricorni.
          <td>103. For in the heavens we find two circular movements. One is simple and uniform by which the heavens move or revolve daily from east to west according to the equinoctial circle. The other is that of the planets, which is from west to east according to the circle of the zodiac, intersecting the equinoctial circle at the two points of solstice, i.e. at the beginning of Cancer and of Capricorn.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia motus primus est uniformis, ideo non dividitur in plures motus, et assimilatur circulo imparium, et propter hoc etiam circulus primus maior est. Nam impares numeri superius positi maiores sunt.
          <td>104. And since the former motion is uniform, it is not divided into several motions; and in this it resembles the circle of the odd numbers; which is also why it is the greatest circle; for the odd numbers referred to are greater than the even.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundus autem motus facit multam diversitatem; et ideo videtur pertinere ad circulum parium; et dividitur in septem circulos secundum sex interstitia duplorum et triplorum numerorum, ut dicitur in Timaeo. Ubi enim sunt sex divisiones, necesse est esse septem divisa. Unde et isti circuli minores sunt, et continentur a supremo circulo qui est imparium. Sic ergo legenda est litera: ut omne, idest universum, feratur secundum consonantes motus, idest ut ex harmonia animae deriventur motus caelestes harmonizati aspectum rectum. Deus reflexit in circulum eo modo quo est expositum, et secundum proprietatem numeri, et secundum proprietatem animae, et dividens ex uno, propter unam naturalem seriem numeri, et unam vim intellectivam animae, in duos circulos, scilicet parium et imparium quantum ad numeros, intelligentiam mobilium et immobilium quantum ad animam, motum secundum aequinoctialem et zodiacum quantum ad caelum.
          <td>105. The second motion, however, is very much diversified, and seems therefore to answer to the circle of even numbers. It divides into seven circles according to the intervals between the numbers in the two series of multiples of 2 and of 3, as is said in the <i>Timaeus</i> . Where there are six points of division there must be seven parts divided off. Hence these circles are smaller and are contained by the highest circle which is that of the odd numbers. So the text is to be interpreted thus: ‘As the whole’, i.e. the Universe, is ‘borne along with well-attuned motions’, that is to say, as the harmonised movements of the heavens are due to the harmony of the World-Soul, God ‘bent the straight line into a circle’ in the manner described, according to the properties of number and of the soul; and dividing this one circle—one by the unity of the natural series of numbers, or by that of the intellectual power of the soul—into two, he forms the pair of numerical circles, the odd and the even, ,and the pair of circles in the soul, the understanding of moving and of motionless objects, and the pair of heavenly circles, the equinoctial and zodiacal motions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Addit autem dupliciter coordinatos, quia duo circuli se intersecantes tangunt se in duobus punctis. Iterum unum, scilicet inferiorem, divisit in septem circulos quasi planetarum, tamquam caeli motus essent animae motus, idest ac si caelum moveretur per motum animae.
          <td>106. He adds, however, ‘adjusted at two points’, because any two intersecting circles touch each other at two points. And ‘again one’, i.e. the inferior one,’ he divided into seven circles’, as if of the planets, ‘as though the heavenly motions were the soul’s motions, i.e. as if the heavens moved by the movement of the World-Soul.

Now mind is one and continuous, as is the act of understanding, which in turn consists of thoughts. But these have unity by succession, like number, not like extension. Therefore neither is mind thus continuous; but it is either indivisible, or not continuous in the way that anything extended is. §§ 107-11

If by an extended part, it will understand the same thing many times over, even to infinity. Yet it seems to do so once for all. But if it is sufficient that it make contact with any one of its parts, why should it move in a circle or have any magnitude at all?

Practical thoughts, however, have limits, each being for the sake of something else; while speculative thinking likewise is limited by ideas and every idea is either a definition or a demonstration. But demonstrations begin from principles, and have as their term a conclusion or an inference. Even if they do not reach a conclusion, they do not come round again to their starting-point; they always take a new middle term and conclusion, and proceed straight forward. But revolving returns again to the beginning. Definitions too are all finite. §§ 118-21

Still less is the body the cause, but rather the soul a cause for the body. Nor is this alleged as for the best; yet the reason why God made the soul revolve must have been because it is more worthy for it to move than to remain stationary, and to move in this way rather than in any other.

            <td>Another absurdity arises in this argument and in many others dealing with the soul. They conjoin body and soul, placing the soul in the body without stating anything definite as to the cause of this, or how the body is disposed. Yet this explanation is surely necessary, for it is in virtue of something in common that one is an agent, the other acted upon, one moves and the other is moved. No such correlations are to be found at random. These thinkers only endeavour to state what the soul is, without determining anything about the body which receives it, as if it happened that any soul entered any body, as in the fables of the Pythagoreans. For each body seems to have its own proper form and species. It is like saying that carpentry enters into flutes; for each art must use its tools, and the soul its body. §§ 130-1

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Posita opinione Platonis, hic Aristoteles reprobat eam. Ubi notandum est, quod plerumque quando reprobat opiniones Platonis, non reprobat eas quantum ad intentionem Platonis, sed quantum ad sonum verborum eius. Quod ideo facit, quia Plato habuit malum modum docendi. Omnia enim figurate dicit, et per symbola docet: intendens aliud per verba, quam sonent ipsa verba; sicut quod dixit animam esse circulum. Et ideo ne aliquis propter ipsa verba incidat in errorem, Aristoteles disputat contra eum quantum ad id quod verba eius sonant.
          <td>107. Having stated Plato’s opinion, Aristotle now proceeds to its refutation. Here we should note that often, in criticising Plato, it is not precisely Plato’s own meaning that Aristotle criticises, but the obvious sense of his words. He has to do this because Plato’s method of teaching was faulty; he constantly used figures of speech, teaching by symbols and giving his words a meaning quite other than their literal sense; as when he calls the soul a circle. So lest anyone should be led astray by this literal sense, Aristotle sometimes argues precisely against it, in criticising Plato.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ponit autem Aristoteles rationes decem ad destruendum suprapositam opinionem: quarum quaedam sunt contra eum, et quaedam contra verba eius. Non enim Plato voluit, quod secundum veritatem intellectus esset magnitudo quantitativa, seu circulus, et motus circularis; sed metaphorice hoc attribuit intellectui. Nihilominus tamen Aristoteles, ne aliquis ex hoc erret, disputat contra eum secundum quod verba sonant.
          <td>108. Against the above-mentioned opinion, then, he brings ten arguments, some of which bear on Plato’s own view, and some on the literal sense of his words. Plato did not really mean that the intellect was anything quantitative or circular; he was talking metaphorically. Still, lest there should be any mistake about this, Aristotle argues on a literal interpretation of the words.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primo ergo Aristoteles circa primam rationem, manifestat de qua anima Plato intellexit, scilicet de anima universi. Et hanc scilicet animam, quae est omnis, idest universi, vult esse intellectivam tantum. Non enim est vegetabilis, quia non indiget nutrimento: nec est sensibilis, quia caret organo: nec est desiderativa, quia desiderativa consequitur sensitivam. Et dixit ideo animam universi non esse sensibilem neque desiderativam, quia ipse voluit quod motus animae universi esset circularis. Unde cum motus harum, scilicet sensibilis et desiderativae, non sit circularis (non enim sensus reflectitur super seipsum, intellectus vero reflectitur super seipsum, homo enim intelligit se intelligere); ideo dicit illam animam intellectivam tantum esse; et ideo dicit intellectum esse magnitudinem quamdam et circulum.
          <td>109. In the first argument, then, he explains what ‘soul’ Plato had in mind, that it was the Soul of the Universe, and that ‘that’ (soul) which is ‘of the whole’, i.e. of the Universe, is exclusively intellectual, according to Plato. It is not vegetative, since it needs no nourishment; nor sensitive since it has no organs of sense; nor appetitive since appetite follows sensitivity. Indeed it could not in any sense be sensitive or appetitive, granted that the movement of the Universal Soul is circular; because neither sense nor appetite moves in a circle (for sense does not reflect upon itself) but. only the intellect (which does reflect upon itself, as when a man knows that he knows). So Plato concluded that the World-Soul was only intellectual, and said that intellect itself was a sort of spatial magnitude and a circle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc Aristoteles reprobat dicens, quod Plato non bene dixit animam esse magnitudinem. Et quod locutus est de ea sicut de magnitudine circulari, dividens eam in duos circulos, male fecit.
          <td>110. Aristotle denies this, saying that Plato was wrong in representing the soul as a spatial magnitude circular in shape, and in dividing it into two circles.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod male fecerit ostendit. In natura enim animae hoc est, ut iudicium de aliqua potentia animae sumatur ex actu seu operatione ipsius potentiae, iudicium vero operationis ex obiecto: potentiae enim cognoscuntur per actus, actus vero per obiecta: et inde est, quod in definitione potentiae ponitur eius actus et in definitione actus ponitur obiectum. Constat autem quod res ab eo a quo habet esse et speciem, ab eo etiam habet unitatem. Si ergo intellectus sit et sortiatur speciem ab intelligibili, cum sit eius obiectum (dico intellectum in actu, cum nihil sit ante intelligere), manifestum est, quod si sit unus et continuus sicut Plato posuit, quod eodem modo intellectus erit unus et continuus, quo intelligibilia sunt unum et continuum; intellectus enim non est unus nisi sicut intelligentia, idest operatio eius quae est intelligere, nec actus est unus nisi sicut obiectum eius est unum, quia actus distinguuntur penes obiecta. Unde, cum obiectum intellectus sint intelligibilia, haec autem, scilicet intelligibilia, non sunt unum ut magnitudo seu continuum, sed sicut numerus, eo quod consequenter se habeant, manifestum est, quod intellectus non est magnitudo, sicut Plato dicebat. Sed aut est impartibilis, sicut se habet ratio primorum terminorum, aut non est continuus sicut aliqua magnitudo, sed sicut numerus, inquantum unum post aliud intelligimus, et saepe plures terminantur in unum, sicut in syllogismis terminantur proportiones in conclusionem.
          <td>111. And he points out where Plato went astray. In this matter of the nature of the soul we have to base our judgement concerning any of its faculties upon the act or operation of that faculty, and our judgement concerning the act or operation upon the object of this act or operation; for faculties are known by their acts, and acts by their objects. Thus in the definition of a faculty is included its act, and in the definition of an act its object. Now it is clear that a thing gets its unity from whatever gives it being and specific nature. If then the intellect gets its being and specific nature from the intelligible which is its object (I speak of the intellect in act, which as such is nothing before the act of understanding occurs), it is clear that if it is one and continuous, as Plato held, it will be so in the same way as intelligible objects are one and continuous. For the intellect is one only in the same way as its operation (understanding) is one; and its operation is one only in the same way as its object is one; since acts are differentiated according to their objects. Since then the intellect’s object is intelligibles, and intelligibles compose a unity, not like a magnitude or a continuum, but like numbers which follow in a series, it is clear that the intellect is not, as Plato thought, a magnitude. It is either indivisible, as it is the nature of first principles to be, or, if it is continuous, it is so not as a magnitude but as number is; for as one number leads to another, so do we understand one object after another. And frequently several numbers terminate in one, as the premises in a syllogism terminate in one conclusion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi qualiter autem quae talis est. Posset aliquis dicere, quod Plato non posuit magnitudinem in intellectu propter multa intelligibilia; sed oportet quod sit in intellectu magnitudo etiam propter unumquodque intelligibilium.
          <td>112. The second argument comes at ‘How would it understand’. For it might be answered that Plato’s reason for attributing magnitude to the intellect was not that there are many intelligibles, but that each intelligible by itself shows it to be a magnitude.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Contra. Hoc non potest esse. Plato enim ponit, et opinatus est, quod intelligere non fiat per acceptionem specierum in intellectu, sed quod intellectus intelligat per quemdam contactum, inquantum scilicet occurrit et obviat speciebus intelligibilibus; et istum contactum attribuit circulo, sicut supra dictum est. Quaero ergo a te, si intellectus est magnitudo, et intelligit secundum contactum, qualiter intelligat. Aut enim hoc quod intelligit, tangit secundum totum, aut secundum partem eius: si secundum totum contingens intelligit totum, tunc partes non erunt necessariae, sed erunt frustra; et sic non est necesse, quod sit intellectus magnitudo et circulus. Si vero secundum partes contingens, intelligit partes, aut hoc erit secundum plures partes, aut secundum unam tantum: si secundum unam tantum, sic idem quod prius, quia aliae erunt superfluae, et sic non erit necessarium ponere intellectum habere partes. Si vero contingens secundum omnes partes, intelliget, aut hoc erit secundum partes punctales, aut secundum partes quantitativas: si secundum partes punctales, tunc, cum in qualibet magnitudine sint infinita puncta, oportet quod infinities tangat antequam intelligat; et sic nunquam intelliget, cum non sit infinita pertransire.
          <td>113. But this will not do. For Plato maintained that the act of understanding was not a reception of intelligible forms into the mind, but a sort of contact (as of a circle, we have seen) due to the mind’s going out to meet intelligible forms. But I ask you, how precisely does the mind understand by contact, if it is a magnitude? it must touch its object either with the whole of itself or with a part. But if with the. whole of itself, then its parts are not needed and there is no necessity for supposing that the intellect is a magnitude or a circle. If, on the other hand, it touches with some of its parts, and thus understands in part, then either several of its parts are involved or only one. If only one, then again the other parts are superfluous and we need not suppose that the intellect has parts. But if it understands by touching with all its parts, these must be either points or quantities; and if points, then, since the number of points in any magnitude is infinite, the intellect would have to touch its object an infinity of times before it understood the latter at all; and thus it never would understand, since infinity cannot be traversed.

          <td>Dicit autem partes punctuales, non quod velit magnitudinem in partes punctales dividi, sed disputat ad rationem Platonis, qui fuit huius opinionis, quod corpus componeretur ex superficiebus, et superficies ex lineis, et linea ex punctis. Quod ipse improbat in sexto (in principio) physicorum, ubi ostendit quod punctum additum puncto nihil addit.
          <td>114. Aristotle says ‘points’ not because he thought that a magnitude could be partitioned into points, but as disputing with Plato who regarded bodies as composed of planes, planes of lines, and lines of points; an opinion refuted by Aristotle in the <i>Physics</i> , Book VI, where it is shown that a point added to a point makes no difference.

          <td>Si vero intelligit contingens secundum partes quantitativas, tunc, cum quaelibet pars dividatur in multas partes, sequitur, quod multoties intelligat, idem.

Videtur ergo quod non contingat nisi semel; et sic nullo modo debet attribui intellectui magnitudo, neque quantum ad multa intelligibilia, neque quantum ad unum.
          <td>115. But if the mind understands by touching with quantitative parts, then, as each part is divisible into many, it must understand the same object many times over. Again, since any quantity is infinitely divisible into parts that are proportionately, not quantitatively, the same, it would follow that the mind understands the same thing an infinite number of times,—which raises difficulties. it would seem then that it touches its object once only, and that it cannot be called a magnitude, either with respect to many intelligibles or to only one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et notandum, quod hic Aristoteles occulte ostendit, quod intellectus de natura sua non est partibilis, sed quid impartibile. Intelligibile enim in unaquaque re est quidditas, et natura rei est tota in qualibet parte, sicut natura speciei est tota in quolibet individuo: tota enim natura hominis est in quolibet individuo, et hoc est indivisibile: unde illud quod est intelligibile in qualibet re, est indivisibile, et per consequens intellectus.
          <td>116. Notice that Aristotle is implying here that intellect is indivisible of its nature. What is intelligible in any thing is its essence or nature; which is present wholly in every part of it, as the specific nature is wholly present in each individual of the species; the whole nature of man in each individual man; and the individual as such is indivisible. Hence what is intelligible in anything is indivisible; and therefore so is the intellect.

          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius quomodo quae talis est. Constat quod si nos ponimus intellectum impartibilem, de facili patebit ratio, quomodo intelligat impartibile et partibile: quia impartibile intelliget secundum proprietatem suae naturae, eo quod impartibilis est, ut dictum est; partibile vero intelliget abstrahendo a partibili. Sed si intellectus ponatur partibilis secundum quod Plato vult, impossibile erit invenire rationem quomodo intelligit impartibile. Et sic videtur, quod inconvenienter Plato ponat intellectum esse magnitudinem seu partibilem.
          <td>117. The third argument comes at ‘Again, how’. Granted that the mind is indivisible, we can easily see how it can understand both the indivisible and the divisible. It understands the indivisible in virtue of its own nature which is indivisible; and the divisible by abstracting from divisibility. But once allow, with Plato, that mind is divisible, it becomes impossible to understand how it can think of the indivisible. ‘Hence the difficulty of admitting Plato’s theory.

          <td>Quartam rationem ponit cum dicit necessarium autem quae talis est. Tu dicis intellectum esse circulum, et dicis intellectum moveri: sed motus circuli est circulatio, motus vero intellectus est intelligentia, hoc est intelligere: ergo si intellectus est circulus, de necessitate intelligentia erit circulatio. Sed hoc est falsum; quia cum in circulatione non sit invenire actu principium neque finem, ut probatur in octavo physicorum, sequitur etiam quod intelligentia seu operatio ipsius intellectus, quae est intelligere, nunquam terminatur. Sed hoc est falsum: quia intelligentia habet actu et principium et finem: ergo intelligentia et circulatio non sunt idem, et per consequens nec intellectus est circulus.
          <td>118. The fourth argument begins at ‘It is necessary’. It runs thus. You say that intellect is circular and in movement. Now the movement of circles is a circling and that of the intellect is understanding; hence if intellect is a circle, understanding must be a circling. But this is false; for, since circular movement has no actual beginning or end, as is shown in the <i>Physics</i> , Book VIII, it would follow that understanding, the proper act of the intellect, never reached a term. But understanding has an actual beginning and end: hence it is not the same as circular movement, and therefore the intellect is not a circle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem intelligentia habeat principium et finem actu, probatur: quia omnis intelligentia aut est practica, aut speculativa: sed constat quod practicarum intelligentiarum termini sunt, idest fines. Nam omnes sunt alterius causa, scilicet operis, et ad opus terminantur. Speculativae etiam intelligentiae finem habent, scilicet rationes, omnes enim terminantur ad aliquas rationes: quae quidem rationes, aut sunt definitio, scilicet in simplici intelligentia, aut demonstratio, scilicet cum componit et dividit. Sed demonstrationes primae ex principiis certis sunt, et habent quodammodo finem syllogismum aut conclusionem.
          <td>119. That understanding has an actual beginning and end can be proved in this way. All thinking is either practical or speculative. Clearly all practical thinking reaches a term or end; for it is all for the sake of something else, namely a work to be done, and in this work it terminates. And speculative thinking too has its proper end, namely ideas; for it always comes to rest in some idea: either, in a definition, when the mind simply apprehends something, or in demonstrations, when it combines and distinguishes things. But the first demonstrations begin from absolute first principles and terminate, in their turn, in the conclusions of syllogisms.

          <td>Et si dicatur, quod ex una conclusione sequitur alia, et sic non terminatur; nihilominus tamen potest dici, quod conclusiones non sunt circulares, quia non est circulo demonstrare, ut probatur in primo posteriorum, sed tendunt in rectum; et impossibile est in rectum invenire motum infinitum seu processum.
          <td>120. If it be objected that one conclusion follows another, and thus there is no definite end, I answer that conclusions are nevertheless not circular. For, as is shown in the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> , Book I, demonstration cannot go in a circle; it always goes in a straight line; and an infinite movement or progression in a straight line is impossible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>121. Definitions too have a beginning and an end, for you cannot go on to infinity in the enumeration of genera; the most general genus has to be taken as the first one. Similarly in enumerating species; you cannot particularise to infinity, but must stop at the most particular species. Hence the most general genus is the beginning, and the most particular species is the term or end, in definitions. Clearly, then, every act of the mind has an actual starting point and term.

          <td>Quintam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae pendet quodammodo ex praecedenti, et est quasi quoddam membrum eius. Supra enim probatum est, quod si intellectus est circulus, sicut Plato posuit, intelligentia erit circulatio; et probavit superiori ratione, quod intelligentia non est circulatio: et hoc idem probat hic tali ratione. Videmus quod haec differentia est inter circulationem et alios motus, quia impossibile est in aliis motibus, unum et eumdem motum reiterari super eamdem quantitatem multoties. Et hoc apparet deducendo per singulas species motus. In alteratione enim impossibile est eumdem motum super idem reiterari: non enim idem secundum idem de albo fit nigrum, et de nigro album. In motu etiam augmenti impossibile est unum et idem secundum idem augmentari et diminui. In motu etiam locali impossibile est eumdem motum secundum idem reiterari, quia in motu locali secundum rectum semper sunt duo termini, scilicet actu. Unde si reiteraretur, oportet termino ad quem uti bis, quia ut fine et principio, et de necessitate interveniret ibi quies, et sic non esset idem motus numero. In circulatione vero solum hoc contingit, quod unus et idem motus secundum eamdem quantitatem multoties reiteraretur. Cuius ratio est, quia in circulatione non sunt aliqui termini actu; et ideo, quantumcumque reiteretur, non intervenit quies, nec variatur motus.
          <td>122. The fifth argument begins at ‘Further, if’. In a sense this argument depends on the previous one and is a part of it. It has been shown that if the intellect were a circle, as Plato thought, understanding would be a circling; and in the preceding argument Aristotle has shown that understanding is not a circling; which he now proves once more in the following way. The difference between a circular motion and any other motion lies in this, that the latter can never be repeated on the same quantity. This becomes clear if we think of the different kinds of movement in particular. Thus the movement of ‘alteration’ cannot be repeated in the same subject in the same respect; for the same thing is not in the same respect changed from white to black and black to white. So too in the movement of growth, the same thing cannot in the same respect both increase and diminish. So also in local movement; if this goes in a straight line it must have two actual terms; and if it is to be repeated, the term at the end of the movement must be used twice, once as end and once as beginning, and, since there must intervene a moment of rest at that term, it is not exactly the same movement. In circular motion alone can one and the same movement be many times repeated according to the same quantity; the reason being that in circular motion there are no actual terms; hence, no matter how often it is repeated, no interval of rest intervenes nor does the motion vary in any way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hoc ergo sic arguit: tu dicis, quod intellectus est circulus: ergo et intelligentia sic circulatio est: sed hoc est inconveniens, scilicet quod intelligentia sit circulatio: ergo et primum.
          <td>123. This being granted, Aristotle argues as follows. If you say that the intellect is a circle, then the act of thinking must be a circular motion. But this consequence is not admissible; therefore neither is the premise.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod sit inconveniens ostendit.

          <td>124. He then shows that the consequence is not admissible. Granted, he says, that the same circular movement is multiplied, that is, repeated, in the same respect. If thinking, then, is a circular movement, as you say, it will be repeated again and again as one and the same movement bearing upon one and the same object; and so the mind will think the same thing many times over. For the mind, in moving, touches and by this touching it thinks, as they say. If then its motion is circular it touches and thinks the same thing over and over again; which gives rise to difficulties.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit cum dicit adhuc autem quae talis est. Si intelligentia circulatio est, ut tu dicis, debet assimilari motui: sed nos videmus totum contrarium, quia intelligentia magis assimilatur quieti, quam motui: ergo intelligentia non est circulatio. Quod autem magis assimiletur quieti quam motui, patet, quia, sicut ipse dicit in septimo physicorum, non potest fieri aliquis sapiens, quando motus eius non resident nec quiescunt. Unde in pueris, et in omnibus in quibus motus non quiescunt, non de facili invenitur sapientia. Sed tunc aliquis sapientiam acquirit, quando quiescit: unde dicit, quod in quiescendo et sedendo, anima fit sapiens et prudens.
          <td>125. The sixth argument, at ‘Moreover, intelligence’ is as follows. if thinking is, as you say, a circular motion, it should be associated with movement, but in fact the contrary is true; thinking is associated rather with repose. This Aristotle himself teaches in Book VII of the <i>Physics</i> , where he says that if a man is to become wise he must first achieve an inward tranquillity; which is why the young and the restless are not, as a rule, wise. Wisdom and prudence are acquired, says Aristotle, by one who is content to sit down and be quiet.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia posset dici, quod hoc verum est de simplici intelligentia, sed non de syllogismo, ideo Aristoteles dicit quod eodem modo et syllogismus assimilatur magis quieti quam motui. Et hoc patet. Ante enim quam sit syllogizatum de aliqua re, intellectus et mens hominis fluctuat ad unam et ad aliam partem, et non quiescit in aliqua. Sed quando iam est syllogizatum, determinate inhaeret uni parti, et quiescit in illa.
          <td>126. But lest it be said that, while this is true of simple apprehension, it is not true of syllogistic reasoning, he adds that reasoning also is more like a repose than a movement. Because, of course, before the syllogism is complete the mind and intellect are swaying from one conclusion to another and resting in neither; but when it is finished the mind holds on to one conclusion and rests in it.

          <td>Septimam rationem ponit cum dicit at vero quae talis est. Constat quod beatitudo animae est in intelligendo: sed beatitudo non potest esse in eo quod est violentum et praeter naturam, cum sit perfectio et finis ultimus animae: ergo, cum motus non sit secundum naturam et secundum substantiam animae, sed praeter naturam eius, impossibile est quod intelligere, quod est operatio animae et in quo est beatitudo animae, sit motus, ut Plato dicebat. Quod autem motus sit praeter naturam animae, patet ex positione Platonis. Ipse enim dixit animam componi ex numeris, et postea dixit eam dispartitam in duos circulos, et reflexit in septimo: et ex hoc sequitur motus: ex quo apparet, quod motus non inest ei naturaliter, sed per accidens.
          <td>127. The seventh argument, at ‘Again, that, etc.’, runs as follows. Let us agree that thinking makes the soul happy. Now happiness cannot reside in anything violent or coercive, since it is the soul’s perfection and last end. As then movement is not of the soul’s essential nature, but is indeed alien to it, that operation in which the soul finds its happiness, namely, understanding, cannot be a movement, as Plato maintained. But that movement is not of the soul’s nature is implied by Plato’s own theory, for he said that the soul was first constituted by numbers, and then that it divide into two circles and was reflected into seven, from which followed movement. According to this view, then, movement is in the soul not naturally but accidentally.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Octavam rationem ponit cum dicit laboriosum autem quae talis est: videtur quod secundum opinionem Platonis, anima de sua natura non sit unita corpori. Nam ipse posuit eam primo compositam ex elementis, et postea complexam et adunatam corpori, et inde non posse recedere cum vult. Inde sic. Quandocumque est aliquid unitum contra naturam suam alicui, et non potest inde cum vult recedere, ei est poenale: et quandocumque aliquid in unione ad aliud deterioratur, est fugiendum et nocivum. Sed anima unitur corpori contra naturam suam, ut dictum est, nec potest inde recedere cum vult, nec non et deterioratur in unione ad corpus, sicut consuetum est dici a Platonicis et multis ex eis. Videtur ergo quod animae poenale est et fugiendum, esse cum corpore. Non ergo conveniens est dictum Platonis, scilicet quod anima composita ex elementis, primo commisceatur corpori.
          <td>128. The eighth argument, at ‘It must be burdensome’, goes as follows. It seems to have been Plato’s view that it was not of the nature of the soul to be joined to the body; for he said that it was first constituted of the elements and then compacted with the body, so that it cannot leave the body at will. Well then; whenever one thing is united against its nature to another, and cannot leave it at will, the resulting state is painful; and whenever a thing deteriorates through its union with another thing the union is harmful and to be avoided. But <i>ex hypothesi</i> the union of soul and body is contrary to the soul’s nature; nor can the soul break away at will; and the result is bad for the Soul, as the Platonists are always saying. Apparently, then, union with the body is a painful and fearful thing for the soul; which hardly squares with Plato’s own theory that the soul is composed of elements and compacted with its body from the beginning.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nonam rationem ponit cum dicit immanifesta autem quae talis est. Plato loquitur de anima universi, et dicit eam moveri circulariter: sed secundum opinionem suam causa quare caelum movetur circulariter est immanifesta, idest non assignatur. Si enim caelum movetur circulariter, aut ergo hoc erit propter principia naturaliter, aut propter finem. Si dicatur quod naturaliter propter principia, aut erit propter naturam animae, aut propter naturam corporis caelestis. Sed non est propter naturam animae, quia moveri circulariter non inest animae secundum substantiam suam, sed per accidens, quia, ut dictum est, anima movetur per se et secundum suam substantiam motu recto, et deinde aspectum rectum reflexit in circulos. Nec etiam propter naturam ipsius corporis caelestis, quia corpus non est causa motus animae, sed anima est magis corpori causa quod moveatur. Si autem dicatur quod propter finem, non potest assignari aliquis finis determinatus secundum eum, cum quaeritur quare sic movetur, et non alio motu, nisi quod sic Deus voluerit eum moveri. Sed Deus propter aliquam causam dignatus est caelum potius moveri quam manere, et moveri sic, idest circulariter, quam alio motu, quam causam Plato non assignat. Sed quia hanc assignare est magis proprium aliis rationibus, idest in alio tractatu, scilicet in libro de caelo, ideo dimittamus ipsam ad praesens.
          <td>129. The ninth argument, at ‘It is not clear’, is as follows. Plato speaks of the Soul of the Universe and says it moves round in a circle. But this provides no explanation of the circular movement of the heavens; that is to say, it does not define the cause of it. For if the heavens move in a circle, this must be due either to intrinsic principles or to some extrinsic purpose. If intrinsic principles are the cause, the ‘nature’ in question will be either that of the soul or of the heavenly bodies. But it cannot be the soul’s nature, for circular movement is not of the essence of the soul, but is accidental to it; for, as we have said, the nature of the soul is to move in a straight line, which is then ‘bent into circles’. Nor can the cause be the nature of the heavenly bodies, for body as such is not the cause of the soul’s movements, but rather the soul of the body’s. But, if the cause is an extrinsic purpose, one cannot, on Plato’s principles, point to any definite end in answer to the question why the heavens move in a circle rather than in any other way; unless one brings in the will of God. God has indeed, for some reason, chosen to move the heavens rather than leave them motionless, and to move them in a circular way. But why he does this Plato cannot tell. However, as this matter belongs rather to ‘other contexts’, i.e. to another treatise (the <i>De Coelo</i> ). We can leave it aside for the present.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Decimam rationem ponit cum dicit illud autem quae non solum est contra Platonem, sed etiam contra multos alios; et ducens est ad inconvenientia, et ostendens eorum positiones deficientes. Quae talis est. Constat quod inter movens et motum est aliqua proportio, et inter agens et patiens, et inter formam et materiam. Non similiter enim quaelibet forma cuilibet corpori convenit et unitur, neque omne agens agit in omne patiens. Neque quodlibet movens movet quodlibet motum, sed oportet quod sit inter ea aliqua communicatio et proportio, ex qua hoc sit aptum natum movere, illud vero moveri. Patet autem quod isti philosophi posuerunt animam esse in corpore, et movere corpus: cum ergo loquantur de ipsa natura animae, videtur etiam necessarium, quod aliquid dixissent de natura corporis, propter quam causam uniatur corpori, et quomodo se habeat corpus ad eam, et quomodo comparatur corpus ad animam. Non ergo sufficienter determinant de anima dum conantur dicere solum quale quid sit anima, et negligunt ostendere quale quid sit corpus suscipiens ipsam.
          <td>130. The tenth argument starts at ‘Another absurdity’. It is effective not only against Plato, but against many others also. It runs thus. It is dear that there must always be some proportion between mover and moved, agent and patient, form and matter. Not every form suits every body in the same way, nor does every agent act upon every patient. Nor, again, does every principle of movement move everything capable of receiving movement. There must be some correlation and proportion between them by which the one is naturally the mover, the other the moved in each case. Now obviously these philosophers admitted that the soul was in the body and moved it. Since then they spoke of the nature of the soul, it seems that they should also have had something to say about the nature of the body; about why the soul is joined to the body and how the body is related to and contrasts with the soul. Their study of the soul was inadequate so long as they discussed it alone and neglected to explain the nature of the body that receives it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo convenit eis illud quod in fabulis Pythagoricis habetur, quod quaelibet anima in quodlibet corpus ingrediatur, puta si casu contingat in corpus elephantis intrare animam muscae.

Sic ergo Plato et alii philosophi loquentes tantum de animae natura, insufficienter dixerunt, non determinantes quod sit corpus conveniens cuilibet animae, et qualiter et quale existens uniatur sibi.
          <td>131. Indeed, we may associate their thesis (Aristotle goes on to say) with the Pythagorean fable that any soul can enter any body; the soul of a fly for instance might perchance enter the body of an elephant. This cannot in fact happen; for the body of each particular thing, and especially of living things, has its own form and species and type of movement: hence there are great differences between the bodies of a worm, a dog, an elephant and a gnat. When they say that any soul can enter any body, it is as if one were to say that the art of weaving could enter flutes, or that the art of the coppersmith could enter a weaver’s loom. If it was in the power of these arts to enter bodies or instruments they would not do so indiscriminately, but the art of playing the flute would enter flutes, and not lyres, while the art of playing stringed instruments would enter stringed instruments and not flutes. In the same way, if there is a body for every soul, any soul does not enter any body; rather the soul shapes the body fit for itself; it does not enter a ready-made body. Plato and the others who speak only about the soul are too superficial; they fail to define which body answers to which soul, and the precise mode of existence of each in union with the other.

Of what and how can one suppose the mind to be a composition? Or sensation? Or appetite? It is no less absurd to account the soul the ratio of a composition. The synthesis of elements for bone is not the same as that for flesh. There would have to be many souls [in one body]; and indeed [a soul] for every body, if each is a mixture of elements, and the ratio of the mixture a harmony and a soul. §§ 138-40

          <td>Postquam philosophus reprobavit opinionem Platonis, hic consequenter reprobat quamdam aliam opinionem conformem opinioni Platonis quantum ad aliquid. Fuerunt enim quidam, qui dixerunt quod anima erat harmonia: et isti concordaverunt cum Platone in hoc, quod Plato dixit quod anima erat composita ex numeris harmonicis, hi vero quod erat harmonia. Sed differebant in hoc, quod Plato dixit quod anima erat harmonia numerorum, hi vero dixerunt, quod harmonia tam compositorum quam mixtorum, vel contrariorum, erat anima. Circa hoc autem tria facit. Primo enim ponit opinionem istorum et rationem opinionis. Secundo disputat contra dictam opinionem, ibi, et quidem harmonia, et cetera. Tertio ostendit quomodo haec opinio est multum probabilis, ibi, si vero alterum anima est, et cetera.
          <td>132. After rejecting Plato’s theory the Philosopher goes on to dispose of another opinion rather similar to Plato’s. For certain philosophers thought the soul was a harmony; agreeing so far with Plato’s view that the soul was composed of harmonic numbers; yet differing from him in that, while he spoke only of a numerical harmony, they extended the principle to include harmonies of compounds, mixtures and contrary qualities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit. Primo enim ponit dictam opinionem de anima; dicens, quod quaedam opinio tradita est ab antiquis de anima, quae videbatur habere rectas rationes, et non solum in speciali de anima, sed etiam quantum ad id quod commune est ad omnia principia. Et dicit quantum ad id quod commune est, quia antiqui philosophi nihil tractaverunt de causa formali, sed tantum de materiali. Et inter omnes, illi qui magis visi sunt appropinquare ad causam formalem fuerunt Democritus et Empedocles: qui, scilicet Empedocles, dixit quod omnia constabant ex sex principiis: quorum quatuor posuit materialia, scilicet quatuor elementa: et duo formalia partim activa, et partim materialia, scilicet amicitiam et litem. Et dicebant quod haec principia materialia habebant inter se quamdam proportionem, quae resultabat ex eis, ita quod conveniebant in aliquo uno, quia sine hoc non possent esse simul. Et hanc dicebant formam rerum et harmoniam quamdam esse. Unde sicut de aliis formis, sic dicebant de anima, quod erat harmonia quaedam.
          <td>133. First then he tells us, of a tradition handed down from the early philosophers concerning the soul, which seemed to contain some truth, not only about the soul, but about something common to all the principles of things. He says ‘something common’ because the early philosophers said nothing about formal causes treating only of material causes. Democritus and Empedocles were the two who seem to have come nearest to treating of the formal cause. The latter reduced everything to six principles, of which four—the elements—were material and two were formal, namely the part-active and part-passive principles, Concord and Strife. And the material elements were, they said, linked together by a certain proportion, whence they had a certain unity without which they could not exist together. And this proportion they called the form and harmony of things; whence it followed that, the soul was a harmony like other forms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo cum dicit etenim harmoniam ponit rationem huiusmodi opinionis; dicens, quod harmonia est complexio et proportio et temperamentum contrariorum in compositis et mixtis. Et haec proportio, quae est inter ista contraria, dicitur harmonia, et forma illius compositi. Unde, cum anima sit quaedam forma, dicebant ipsam esse harmoniam. Dicitur autem haec opinio fuisse cuiusdam Dynarchi et Simiatis et Empedoclis.
          <td>134. Then, at ‘And they say that harmony,’ he states the ground of this opinion: harmony is the combination and mixing in due proportion of contraries in compounds and mixtures. The proportion itself is called harmony and is the form of the compound; and because the soul is a kind of form it was reckoned a harmony. Such was apparently the view of Dynarchus, Simiates and Empedocles.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit et quidem disputat contra opinionem praedictam. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim disputat generaliter ad positionem dictorum philosophorum. Secundo vero in speciali ad ponentem, scilicet contra Empedoclem, ibi, investigabit autem hoc et cetera.
          <td>135. Next, at ‘Yet a harmony’, he begins to criticise it: first in a general way, and then, at ‘One might, etc.,’ with particular reference to Empedocles who formulated it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad positionem autem obiicit quatuor rationibus: quarum prima talis est. Constat quod harmonia proprie dicta est consonantia in sonis: sed isti transumpserunt istud nomen ad omnem debitam proportionem, tam in rebus compositis ex diversis partibus quam in commixtis ex contrariis. Secundum hoc ergo harmonia duo potest dicere: quia vel ipsam compositionem aut commixtionem, vel proportionem illius compositionis seu commixtionis. Sed constat quod neutrum istorum est anima; ergo anima non est harmonia. Quod autem anima non sit compositio sive proportio compositionis, patet. Isti enim accipiunt animam, ut substantiam quamdam; sed illa duo sunt accidentia; non ergo idem sunt.
          <td>The general theory is attacked with four arguments. The first is as follows. Harmony, strictly speaking, pertains to sounds, but is transferred by these philosophers to mean any due proportion, either in things composed of different parts or in mixtures of contrary elements. On this view, then, harmony is one of two things: either the compound or mixture itself, or the proportion existing in it. But the soul is clearly neither of these; therefore it is not a harmony. The reason why the soul cannot be, for these philosophers, either a compound or the proportion in a compound is that these are both accidental factors, whilst the soul, according to them, is a substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Constat quod omnes philosophi dicunt quod anima movet: sed harmonia non movet, immo relinquitur ex movente, et sequitur: sicut ex motu chordarum, qui est per musicam, relinquitur harmonia quaedam in sono. Et ex applicatione et contemperatione partium a componente relinquitur proportio quaedam in composito. Ergo si anima est harmonia, et haec relinquitur ex harmonizatore, oportebit ponere aliam animam, quae harmonizet.
          <td>136. The second argument begins at ‘Further, movement’. All philosophers agree that the soul moves something. But harmony does not move anything; rather it is a result and trace of movement, just as in music the movement of strings leaves its trace in harmonious sound. Similarly, the putting together and coadaptation of parts by some composing agent results in a certain proportional composition. If then the soul were a harmony resulting from some producer of harmony, we should have to posit another soul in the producer.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit congruit autem quae talis est. Philosophus dicit in quarto physicorum. Quicumque assignat definitionem seu naturam rei, oportet quod illa assignatio, si sufficiens est, conveniat operationibus et passionibus illius rei: tunc enim definitur optime quid est res, quoniam non solum cognoscimus substantiam et naturam ipsius rei, sed etiam passiones et accidentia eius. Si ergo anima est harmonia quaedam, oportet quod per cognitionem harmoniae deveniamus in cognitionem et operationum, et accidentium animae. Sed hoc est valde difficile, ut puta si velimus operationes animae in harmoniam referre. Cuius enim harmoniae erit sentire, et cuius amare aut odire, et intelligere? Sed per cognitionem harmoniae magis congruit venire in cognitionem accidentium corporum; ut si velimus cognoscere sanitatem, dicemus quod est complexio adaequata et contemperata humorum et qualitatum in corpore: et sic de aliis corporeis virtutibus. Et sic harmonia magis esse attribuenda corpori quam animae.
          <td>137. The third argument comes at ‘It would be more appropriate’. In the <i>Physics</i> , Book IV, Aristotle had said that, if the definition of anything is to be adequate, it must answer to all that the given thing can do of itself or receive from other things; for the best definition states not only the substance and nature of a thing, but also its accidental qualities and capacities. If then the soul were a harmony, we ought to be able to work out its capacities and accidental qualities from our knowledge of this harmony. But this is extremely difficult; if, for example, we want to derive the operations of the soul from harmony, to what harmony does feeling or love, hating or understanding belong? It would be easier indeed to know the body through harmony. Thus we certainly can define good health as the duly proportioned and equally balanced commingling of the body’s humours; and likewise with other bodily qualities. Thus harmony belongs apparently to the body rather than to the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Harmonia invenitur aliquando in compositis et habentibus compositionem et motum; quia quando haec sic invicem simul ponuntur et ordinantur, ut nullum congeneum praetermittatur idest ut nullus defectus eiusdem generis ibi sit, tunc illae partes dicuntur bene harmonizatae, et compositio ipsarum vocatur harmonia, sicut ligna et lapides, et alia corpora naturalia. Sic etiam et chordae, quando bene ordinatae sunt, vel fistulae, ut ex inde consonantia sonorum resultet, dicuntur bene harmonizatae; et huius consonantia dicitur harmonia, et hoc modo proprie dicitur harmonia. Aliquando invenitur in corporibus mixtis ex contrariis. Quando enim aliqua contraria sunt complexa et commixta in aliquo, ita ut nulla repugnantia seu excessus alicuius contrarii sit ibi, utputa calidi aut frigidi, aut humidi aut sicci, tunc illa dicuntur bene harmonizata, et horum ratio idest proportio dicitur harmonia. Si ergo anima est harmonia, secundum aliquem istorum modorum diceretur. Sed constat quod neutro istorum modorum rationabile est animam dici harmoniam; ergo male dicunt animam harmoniam esse.
          <td>138. The fourth argument starts at ‘Further, we speak’. Harmony is sometimes found in things composed together and moving, when, that is, such things are so coapted and arranged that ‘nothing becoming to them is missing’, i.e. no defect occurs within the nature of the thing in question. The parts then are said to be well harmonised and the whole composition is called a harmony, e.g. of wood or stones or other natural bodies. In the same way when stringed. instruments or flutes are well-tuned, so that agreeable sounds result, they are said to be well harmonised. This is the proper meaning of the word. Sometimes, again, ‘harmony’ is found in mixtures of contraries; as, when contrary elements are so combined and mixed that no incompatibility remains, nor any excess of any one of them, e.g. of heat or cold or moisture or dryness; then they are said to be harmonised well and their ratio or proportion is called a harmony. So, if the soul is called a harmony it must be in one of these ways. But in fact it cannot rationally be so called in either of these ways. Those philosophers therefore spoke amiss.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod neutro istorum modorum anima dicatur harmonia, patet. Non enim anima potest dici harmonia, secundum quod invenitur in rebus compositis et habentibus compositionem; quod patet. Nam ordo partium compositarum in corpore est valde manifestus: facile enim est scire ordinem ossium ad ossa, et nervorum ad nervos, et brachii ad manum, et carnis ad ossa. Sed ratio ordinis partium animae est nobis immanifesta. Non enim per hoc possumus scire ordinem qui est inter intellectum et sensum et appetitum et huiusmodi.
          <td>139. Clearly, the soul should not be called a harmony precisely in the sense in which compounds and compositions are harmonious. For in the body the interrelation of the various parts is quite evident; we can easily tell how the bones or the nerves are interrelated, what the arm is to the hand and the flesh to. the bone. On the other hand the principle according to which the parts of the soul are interrelated is obscure; nor does the correlation of parts in the body reveal to us how the parts of the soul, the understanding, and the senses, and desire, and so forth, are related to each other.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nec etiam potest dici harmonia secundum proportionem corporum commixtorum ex contrariis. Et hoc duplici ratione. Una ratio est, quia diversa proportio invenitur in diversis partibus corporis: nam commixtio elementorum non habet eamdem rationem, idest proportionem, secundum quam est caro, et secundum quam est os: ergo in diversis partibus erunt diversae animae secundum diversam proportionem et multiplicationem partium animalis. Alia ratio est, quia omnia corpora sunt commixta ex elementis et contrariis: si ergo proportio commixtionis in quolibet corpore est harmonia, et harmonia est anima; ergo in quolibet corpore erit anima: quod est inconveniens. Et sic patet, quod inconvenienter dicunt animam esse harmoniam.
          <td>140. Nor can the soul be called a harmony in the same way as the proportion in bodies compounded of a mixture of contrary qualities; and this for two reasons. One reason is that a different proportion is to be found in different parts of the living body; for the elements do not mix in the same ratio or proportion to form flesh as to form bone; and consequently there would be different souls for the different parts of the same living body, according to the proportional diversity and multiplication of its parts. The other reason is that all bodies are compounded of elements and contrary qualities; hence if the proportion of each compound is a harmony, and each harmony is a soul, there will be no body without a soul; which is an awkward thesis to maintain. It is not therefore of much use to call the soul a harmony.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit investigabit autem disputat contra Empedoclem: et ponit contra eum tres rationes quas non deducit. Quarum prima talis est: ipsi ponunt quodlibet corpus consistere ratione, idest proportione quadam, quam dicunt harmoniam, et hanc dicunt animam: quaero ergo, utrum anima sit ipsa ratio, idest proportio commixtionis, aut aliquid aliud a proportione? Si tu dicis quod est ipsa proportio, tunc, cum in uno corpore sint diversae proportiones secundum diversas partes, sequuntur duo inconvenientia: scilicet quod multae animae sunt in uno corpore secundum diversas partes, et quod in quolibet mixto sit anima. Si dicas quod est aliud quam proportio, tunc, cum proportio sit harmonia, anima non erit harmonia.
          <td>141. Next, at ‘One might at this point’, Aristotle attacks Empedocles by drawing three unforeseen consequences from his account of the matter. The first is this. If you maintain that every body has a certain ratio or proportion, which you call harmony and identify with the soul, I put the question to you whether the soul itself is this ratio or proportion, or something else. If you answer that it is the proportion itself, then, since in the same body there are different proportions for the different parts, two difficulties arise; there will be many souls in the same body; and there will be a soul for every compound. But if you answer that the soul is not the proportion itself, then, since harmony is proportion, the soul will not be a harmony.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Empedocles ponebat quod amicitia esset causa congregationis in rebus, et lis causa disgregationis: sed in congregatione fit aliqua proportio: quaero ergo, utrum amicitia sit causa cuiuslibet congregationis, aut tantum congregationis harmonizatae? Si tu dicas, quod amicitia est causa cuiuslibet congregationis, tunc oportebit ponere aliquid aliud ab amicitia, quod causet huiusmodi proportionem et harmoniam in congregationibus harmonizatis: vel erit dicere, quod huiusmodi harmonizatio est a casu. Si tu dicas, quod est causa solum congregationis harmonizatae, tunc amicitia non erit causa omnis congregationis: quod est contra eum.
          <td>142. The second argument begins at ‘Or further’. Empedocles had asserted that the cause of union in things was Concord and the cause of disunion was Strife. Now union implies a certain proportion. I ask you, then, whether Concord is the cause of any and every union or only of such unions as are harmonious. If you answer ‘of every union’, then you must find sole cause other than Concord for the harmony and proportion proper to harmonious unions—unless you say that the latter occur by chance. But if you say that Concord is the cause of harmonious unions, then it is not the cause of all unions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit et hoc utrum quae talis est. Empedocles dicit quod amicitia est quae facit congregationem in rebus. Quaero ergo utrum amicitia sit idem cum ipsa congregatione harmonizata, aut non? Si dicatur quod est idem, tunc, cum nihil sit causa suiipsius, amicitia non erit causa illius congregationis, sicut Empedocles dicebat. Si vero dicatur quod non est idem, contra. Congregatio harmonizata nihil aliud est, quam convenientia quaedam: amicitia vero videtur esse quaedam convenientia: ergo est idem: et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>143. The third argument, at ‘And whether this’, runs as follows. Empedocles says that Concord is what unites things. I ask: is Concord the same as the actual union in harmony, or is it not? If it is the same, then, since nothing causes itself, love cannot be the cause of the union as Empedocles asserted. But suppose it is not the same. Still, harmonious union as such is only a kind of agreement, which seems to be precisely what Concord is too. So they are the same after all; and the preceding argument applies as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit si vero ostendit quomodo haec opinio est multum probabilis; dicens, quod ideo videtur haec opinio probabilis, quia posito uno ponitur aliud, et remoto uno removetur alterum; nam recedente ab aliquo corpore harmonia, recedit anima, et permanente harmonia permanet anima. Sed hoc non sequitur; quia proportio huiusmodi non est forma, sicut ipsi credebant, sed est dispositio materiae ad formam. Et si accipiatur proprie harmonia compositionis pro dispositione, bene sequitur, quod manente dispositione materiae ad formam manet forma, et destructa dispositione, removetur forma. Non tamen quod harmonia sit forma, sed dispositio materiae ad formam.
          <td>144. Proceeding, Aristotle shows how plausible is the theory in question. Its plausibility, he says, relies on the argument that if you grant one thing another must follow, and if you re move one thing another is removed. Thus when a body loses its harmony it loses its soul, and while its harmony remains the soul too remains. Yet the conclusion does not follow; for this kind of proportion is not, as those philosophers thought, the form itself, but only a disposition of the matter in view of the form. And if the harmony of a composite being is taken in this its proper sense, i.e. to mean a disposition, then the consequence is quite correct, that, so long as the matter’s disposition to the form remains, the form itself remains, and when the disposition goes, the form also goes. Not that the harmony is the form, but that it is a disposition of the matter in view of the form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo cum dicit quod quidem concludit et epilogat, quod anima non movetur circulariter, sicut Plato dixit. Nec est harmonia, sicut Empedocles asseruit. Movetur autem secundum accidens, sicut diximus supra, et movet seipsam. Et quod moveatur secundum accidens, patet; quia movetur inquantum movetur corpus in quo est, corpus autem movetur ab anima. Alio modo non est moveri ipsam secundum locum nisi per accidens.
          <td>145. Finally, where he says ‘It is evident, then’ Aristotle, concluding, summarises his rejection both of Plato’s view that the soul moves in a circle and of Empedocles that it is a harmony. The soul, as has been said, is moved indirectly, and it moves itself. That it is moved indirectly is clear, for it moves when its body moves; but the body itself receives movement from the soul. Only indirectly, and in no other way, does the soul move from place to place.

            <td>This, however, is not a necessary conclusion. Even if feeling pain or being glad or understanding are in the fullest sense movements, and each of these is a ‘being moved’ (e. a. being angry or fearful occurs by some movement of the heart), this being moved is from the soul. But as for understanding, it is either of such a nature or perhaps something other. §§ 147-50

            <td>Of these, however, some occur with a change of place in that which moves; others with an alteration,—of what sort or how is another question. To say that the soul is angry is like saying it builds or weaves. For it is perhaps better to say, not that the soul is compassionate, or learns, or understands, but a man by his soul. These modifications occur by movements not so much in the soul as, in some cases, proceeding to it, and in others, proceeding from it, as sensation proceeds from things, whilst remembering proceeds from the soul to the motions or rests which occur in the sensitive organs. §§ 151-62.

But in fact what happens is similar to the case of the sensitive powers. If an old man could acquire the eye of a young man, I he would see as a young man; hence, senility is not an affliction of the soul, but of that which it inhabits, like drunkenness or disease. Understanding and thinking, then, decay with the decay of something else within. Understanding itself cannot be affected. But reasoning and loving and hating are not affections of the intellect, but of that which has it, precisely in so far as it has it. Wherefore, when this decays, the soul ceases to remember or love. For these proceeded, not from it, but from what was common, which has disintegrated. But perhaps intellect is something more godlike and unalterable.

          <td>Postquam philosophus posuit rationes illorum qui dixerunt animam moveri ex eo quod ipsa movet corpus, et disputavit contra eos, hic consequenter vult ostendere, quod evidentior ratio, quod anima moveatur, potest sumi ex ipsis operationibus animae. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim movet dubitationem illorum, qui dixerunt animam moveri ex operibus animae. Secundo vero solvit dubitationem huiusmodi quantum ad propositum pertinet, ibi, hoc autem non est necesse et cetera.
          <td>146. After stating and criticising the arguments of those who thought that, because the soul moves the body, it must itself be in movement, the philosopher is next concerned to show that a stronger support for the assertion that the soul was in movement might be drawn from considering the activities proper to it. Dividing his treatment into two parts, he first states the hypothesis that the soul’s activities are evidence of its movement; and then settles the problem so far as his present purpose requires, this part beginning at ‘This, however’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod licet praedicti philosophi dubitaverint utrum anima moveretur ex eo quod movet corpus, tamen rationabilius, idest probabilius dubitabit aliquis de anima, quod moveatur considerans in huiusmodi quae dicentur, idest in operationibus animae. Ex his enim poterit probabiliter ostendi, quod anima movetur. Nos enim dicimus animam tristari, gaudere, confidere, idest audere et timere. Amplius autem dicimus ipsam irasci, sentire et intelligere. Cum ergo haec omnia sint operationes animae, et sint motus quidam, videtur quod anima moveatur. Haec autem dubitatio videtur magis probabilis quam superior. Nam illa considerat motum animae ex motu corporis. Dicebat enim quod nihil movet, nisi moveatur. Unde, cum anima moveat corpus, manifestum est, quod ipsa movetur. Haec vero opinio considerat motum ipsius animae ex propriis operationibus animae.
          <td>First, then, he says that whereas the philosophers, of whom he has been speaking, thought that the soul might be in movement from considering the fact that it moved the body, a more rational, i.e. a more plausible, argument might be drawn ‘by considering such facts as these’, i.e. as the activities of the soul itself. For from these one might build up a very plausible argument in favour of the soul’s being in movement. For we say that the soul ‘is sad, pleased, confident (i.e. daring) and frightened’; and we say that it gets angry and senses and understands. And since all these are activities of the soul, and also types of movement, it would seem that the soul moves. And this is a more plausible suggestion than the one already discussed. For the latter argued the soul’s movement from the body’s, according to the principle that every mover is itself moved; so that if soul moves body the soul itself is moved. But the theory now to be considered regards the movement of the soul from the standpoint of the soul’s own activities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit hoc autem solvit dubitationem. Circa quod sciendum est, quod quando Aristoteles inquirit veritatem aliquam solvendo et obiiciendo, aliquando obiicit et solvit post determinatam veritatem, et tunc obiicit et solvit secundum suam opinionem: aliquando vero ante determinatam veritatem, et tunc obiicit et solvit supponendo opiniones aliorum, et non secundum suam opinionem et veritatem, quam ipse opinatur. Et huius exemplum habemus in tertio physicorum, ubi philosophus disputat contra ponentes infinitum, et utitur contra eos multis rationibus, quae secundum se sunt falsae, licet secundum illos reputentur verae; puta quod omne corpus habet levitatem et gravitatem. Cuius ratio est, quia hoc, scilicet utrum corpus habet levitatem et gravitatem, nondum determinaverat, quod postea determinavit in libro de caelo: et ideo reiteravit ibi quaestionem de infinito. Hunc autem modum obiiciendi et solvendi servat hic Aristoteles; unde et procedit contra eos supponendo illorum opiniones.
          <td>147. Next, at ‘This, however,’ he clears up the difficulty. Here we should note that when Aristotle is searching for truth by a process of stating and answering objections, he will sometimes employ this method after having already demonstrated the truth in question; and then his objections and solutions are governed by the opinion he has already formed for himself. But sometimes he does all this before demonstrating the truth, and then he bases his objections and solutions on the views of others and not on his own opinion or on what he believes to be the truth. For example, in Book III of the <i>Physics</i> , where he argues against those who maintained the existence of an infinite, he employs a number of principles false in themselves but considered true by his opponents, e.g. that every body is both light and heavy. For he had not yet decided about the lightness and heaviness of bodies; this he did later on in the <i>De Coelo</i> , where, in consequence, he reopens the question of the infinite. And such is his method here. His criticism rests upon presupposing as true the views of his opponents.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Illi enim, et maxime Platonici, opinati sunt, quod tristari, gaudere, irasci, sentire, et intelligere, et huiusmodi quae dicta sunt, sint motus animae. Et quod quodlibet illorum, etiam intelligere, fiat per organum determinatum, et quantum ad hoc non sit differentia inter sensitivam et intellectivam, et quod omnis anima, non solum intellectiva, sit incorruptibilis. Aristoteles vero omnia ista concedit. Ipse enim supponit quod huiusmodi operationes fiant per determinata organa, etiam intelligere. Et quod omnis anima sit incorruptibilis. Hoc tantum negat, scilicet quod huius operationes, scilicet sentire, gaudere, et huiusmodi, sint motus animae, sed motus coniuncti; et quantum ad hoc disputat contra eos.
          <td>148. These latter, especially the Platonists, thought that sorrow, joy, anger, sensation and thought, and so forth, were movements in the soul, and that each of these activities, not excepting thought, had its own particular organ; so that in this respect there was no difference between sensitivity and intelligence; and every kind of soul, not the intellectual soul only, was immortal. All of which Aristotle concedes, presupposing that all such activities, even thinking, are organic, and that all souls are immortal. He only denies that such activities as sensation and joy are movements in the soul, asserting that they belong rather to the compound of body and soul. This alone he makes the point at issue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim ostendit, quod huiusmodi operationes non sunt motus animae. Secundo vero probat hoc quodam medio, ibi, intellectus autem et cetera. Dicit ergo, quod isti dicunt duo. Et primo, quod gaudere et tristari et huiusmodi, sunt motus. Secundo, quod haec attribuuntur animae, scilicet quod irascatur, gaudeat, sentiat et huiusmodi; et sic videtur quod anima moveatur. Sed hoc non est necesse; immo utrumque istorum est falsum: scilicet quia neque huiusmodi operationes sunt motus, et neque attribuuntur animae, scilicet quod irascatur, gaudeat, sentiat, et huiusmodi. Sed dato quod sint motus, et loquamur de eis secundum quod sunt motus, nihilominus tamen falsum est quod attribuantur animae, et per consequens quod secundum huiusmodi operationes moveatur. Quod sic patet.
          <td>149. And here he does two things. First, he shows that the activities in question are not movements of the soul; secondly, he proves this with a special argument beginning at ‘But intellect’. His opponents, he says, maintain two points: (1) that joy and sorrow and so forth are movements; (2) that these movements are to be attributed to the soul; which therefore moves. But the conclusion does not necessarily follow; and in any case both propositions are false—the activities in question are not movements, nor are such things as anger, joy, sensation, to be attributed to the soul. But even granted, for the sake of argument, that they are movements, they should not be attributed to the soul; nor the soul , in consequence, be held to move in and with them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Constat enim quod si huiusmodi operationes sunt motus et attribuantur animae, quod non attribuuntur sibi nisi secundum aliquas determinatas partes corporis; sicut sentire non attribuitur animae, nisi in aliqua parte corporis, ut in oculo, sensus qui est per visum, et irasci in corde, et sic de aliis. Similiter manifeste apparet, quod non sunt animae tantum motus, sed coniuncti. Sunt tamen ab anima, ut puta in hoc quod est irasci. Anima enim iudicat aliquid esse dignum ira, cor autem animalis ex hoc movetur, et fervet circa ipsum sanguis. Sic autem se habet ad timores. Nam aliqua particula corporis contrahitur ad terribile et alteratur, et similiter de aliis. Et sic anima non movetur, sed est moveri ab ea in eo quod aliquid, ut cor, quodammodo movet. Et quia ipse determinabit inferius quod intelligere est quaedam operatio animae, in qua non communicat cum corpore, et non est coniuncti; ideo dicit, quod intelligere forsitan est aliquid alterum ab operationibus coniuncti et dicit forsitan, quia non loquitur definiendo, sed supponendo. Quia vero dixit quod huiusmodi motus non sunt animae, sed coniuncti, sunt tamen ab anima.
          <td>150. For it is obvious that; even if these activities are movements and are of the soul, they are not of the soul except with respect to certain definite parts of the body: thus sensation only takes place in certain parts of the body, such as the eye, the organ o sight; and anger in the heart; and so with the rest. it is clear that they are movements not of the soul alone, but of soul and body together. Yet they are from the soul; for example, when the soul thinks that anything is worthy of anger, the animal organ called the heart is disturbed and the blood gets heated around it. So also with fear; it makes a definite part of the body contract and change. And likewise with the rest. In these cases, then, the soul in itself does not move, but only moves in the movement of another thing, e.g. the heart. But in view of a point which Aristotle is going to prove later on, namely that understanding is an act of the soul alone, in which the body has no share, he observes here that perhaps understanding should be distinguished from all those activities which occur in the compound of soul and body. He says ‘perhaps’ because he is speaking tentatively. But in asserting that the other activities are of soul and body together he implies that they do arise from the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ideo cum dicit horum autem vult ostendere quod huiusmodi motus corporis sunt ab anima secundum loci mutationes. Sicut patet in ira, quae fit in anima motis quibusdam particulis ipsius corporis, scilicet moto corde. Ex ira enim sanguis exit ad partes exteriores, motus a fervore cordis. Alia vero est secundum alterationem, sicut patet in timore. Nam cor ad terribile contrahitur et infrigidatur, et alteratur homo et pallescit. Quales autem passiones sint, et quomodo moveantur, alterius rationis est dicere. Sic igitur patet quod huiusmodi motus non sunt animae, sed corporis ab anima, ut dictum est.
          <td>151. So, when he says ‘of these, etc.’ he means to show that these movements arise from the soul to the accompaniment of certain local changes; as in the case of anger, which occurs in the soul when parts of the body in and around the heart are moved: the blood heated by the heart is dispelled towards the extremities of the body. There may also be an ‘alteration’ or qualitative movement, as in fear, when the heart contracts and grows cold and one turns pale. What these passions are, and how they come about, is another question; but it is clear that as movements they are not in the soul alone, but in soul and body together.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sicut ergo animal habet operationes corporales, et huiusmodi non sunt animae, sed corporis, seu coniuncti, ita et huiusmodi operationes, scilicet sentire et gaudere, et huiusmodi, non debent referri ad animam, sed ad coniunctum. Nam si aliquis dicat animam irasci, et secundum huiusmodi operationes moveri, simile est ac si dicat ipsam animam texere vel aedificare, aut cytharizare. Nam et anima est causa horum motuum. Habitus enim aedificativus et textivus, et cytharizandi est in ipsa anima, et huiusmodi ab anima sunt. Sed sicut melius est dicere quod aedificator aedificat, non ars, licet aedificator aedificet per aedificativam artem, sic fortassis melius est dicere quod anima non miseretur neque addiscit, neque intelligit, sed homo per animam. Dicit fortassis intelligere quia loquitur supponendo, ut dictum est.
          <td>152. Hence just as any animal’s bodily activities spring not from its soul alone but from its body, or from the compound of soul and body, so too sense-perception and joy and so forth should not be attributed to the soul alone, but to body and soul together. To say that the soul gets angry and is thereby moved is like saying that the soul weaves or builds or plays the harp. The soul indeed is the cause of these activities; for the acquired ability to build or weave or play the harp is in the soul, and the exercise of the ability in each case springs from the soul. But, as it is better to say that the builder, not the art of building, builds, though the builder builds by his art, so perhaps it is better to say that it is not the soul that feels pity or learns or thinks, but the man who does these things with his soul. He says ‘perhaps etc.’ for the reason given above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia vero per hoc, quod dicit quod non movetur anima, sed homo per animam, posset intelligi quod motus existeret in anima sicut in subiecto; ideo removet hoc, dicens, quod cum dico hominem moveri ab anima, non sic dico quod motus in illa, scilicet in anima, existat, sed quasi ab illa.
          <td>153. But since the statement that the soul does not move, but man with his soul, might be taken to mean that movement exists in the soul as its subject, to forestall this Aristotle explains that when he says that man moves with his soul he means that movement is derived, as it were, from the soul, not that it is found in the soul itself
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cum enim dico, hoc movetur per hoc, istud potest dupliciter intelligi. Vel quia aliquando ipsa res, qua aliquid movetur, motum sustinet: ut cum dico hominem moveri pede, quia ipse pes movetur. Vel quia ipsa aliquando res non sustinet motum, sed impellit aliquid ad motum. Et hoc modo homo dicitur moveri per animam.
          <td>154. For when I say ‘this moves with that’, my statement can be taken in two senses: either that the source of a given movement is itself moving, as when I say that a man moves with his feet, the feet themselves moving; or that something motionless in itself moves another thing; and it is in this latter sense that a man is said to move with his soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et in hoc est duplex motus. Quia aliquando anima est ut terminus motus, quando scilicet motus est ad illam, scilicet ad animam, sicut in apprehensione sensibilium. Nam quando anima apprehendit exteriora sensibilia, tunc virtus sensitiva, quae est in organo, nititur et movetur ad remittendum et reducendum species et intentiones rerum sensibilium usque ad illam, scilicet ad animam. Aliquando vero est ut principium motus, quando scilicet motus operationis initiatus est ab illa, scilicet ab anima, ut est in reminiscentia, a qua intentiones et phantasmata rerum occultata et recondita educuntur ad intelligendum res sensibiles. Sive autem motus aut quietes dicat aliquis, phantasmata huiusmodi sint derelicta interius, non refert quantum ad praesentem materiam.
          <td>155. Now this movement is two-fold. Sometimes the soul represents the term, to which the movement tends, as in sensation; for in the act of the soul’s apprehending exterior sense-objects, the sensitive faculty in the bodily organ is aroused and, moving, transmits ‘to it’, i.e. to the soul, images and notions of sensible things. But sometimes the soul behaves as the starting point of movement, as in remembering, when the latent, buried images and notions of things are brought to light, in order that sensible things may be understood through them. Whether the inward storing away of images should itself be called a movement or a resting is not immediately relevant.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Patet igitur quod huiusmodi motus non attribuuntur animae, sed sunt coniuncti, ab ipsa anima tamen, et non sicut motu existente in ipsa anima.
          <td>156. Movements of this sort, then, are not to be attributed to the soul, but to the soul and body together; if they spring from the soul, this does not imply movement in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Notandum tamen quod haec solutio praedictae dubitationis non est distinctiva et definitiva veritatis, sed obviativa. Sciendum enim, quod motus attribuuntur operationibus animae, a diversis diversimode. Nam tripliciter invenitur motus in operationibus animae. In quibusdam enim invenitur motus proprie, in quibusdam minus proprie, in quibusdam vero minime proprie.
          <td>157. But observe that this solution of the problem is only provisional; it does not leave us with the truth perfectly defined. For movement is attributed to the soul’s activities in different ways by different people. In fact, three kinds of movement are discernible therein In some of these activities movement in the strict sense is found. In others it is found in a less exact sense of the term. And in others in a still looser sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Proprie enim invenitur motus in operationibus animae vegetabilis, et in appetitu sensitivo. In operatione quidem animae vegetabilis, est proprie motus, quando movetur in esse naturae per nutrimentum, et hic est motus augmenti; et secundum hoc anima vegetabilis se habet ut agens, corpus vero ut patiens. In appetitu vero sensitivo proprie invenitur motus, et secundum alterationem et secundum motum localem. Nam ad appetitum alicuius rei, homo statim movetur et alteratur, vel ad iram, sicut in appetitu vindictae, vel ad gaudium sicut in appetitu delectabilis. Item ex hoc movetur etiam sanguis, qui est circa cor, ad partes exteriores, et etiam homo de loco ad locum ad consequendum id quod appetit.
          <td>158. For movement proper occurs in the activities of the vegetative soul and in sensuous desire. In vegetative activity the material substance itself moves, in consequence of assimilating food. This movement is growth; wherein the vegetative soul plays the active part, the body a passive one. In sensuous desire also movement proper occurs, both through qualitative alterations and also through changes of place. No sooner does a man desire anything than he is affected by certain changes—becoming angry, as in the desire for revenge, or glad as in the pursuit of pleasure. And, accompanying this, the blood moves outwards from the heart to the extremities of the body; besides the fact that the whole man moves from one place to another in pursuit of what he desires.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Minus vero proprie invenitur motus in operationibus animae sensitivae. In his enim non est motus secundum esse naturae, sed solum secundum esse spirituale, sicut patet in visu cuius operatio non est ad esse naturale, sed spirituale: quia est per species sensibiles secundum esse spirituale receptas in oculo. Sed tamen habet aliquid de mutabilitate, inquantum scilicet subiectum virtutis visivae est corpus. Et secundum hoc habet rationem motus, licet minus propriam. Non enim dicitur motus in operationibus proprie, nisi cum operatio illa est ad esse naturae.
          <td>159. In a less strict sense, however, movement occurs in the acts of the sensitive soul. Here there is no movement of the material substance itself, but only a ‘spiritual’ movement of cognition: for example, the act of seeing is not a material modification; it is ‘spiritual’ reception into the eye of sensible forms. Yet it does involve some material change, because the faculty of sight is lodged in the body: and to this extent it involves movement, though it is not movement in the strict sense. Movement in the strict sense is not ascribed to the soul’s activities except when a modification of the material substance is the direct term of the activity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Minimum autem de proprietate motus, et nihil nisi metaphorice, invenitur in intellectu. Nam in operatione intellectus non est mutatio secundum esse naturale, sicut est in vegetabili, nec subiectum spirituale quod immutetur, sicut est in sensibili. Sed est ibi ipsa operatio, quae quodammodo dicitur motus, inquantum de intelligente in potentia fit intelligens in actu. Differt tamen a motu eius operatio, quia eius operatio est actus perfecti, motus vero est actus imperfecti.
          <td>160. Least strictly of all, and indeed only by a metaphor, is movement to be ascribed to the act of the intellect, in which there is no movement of the material substance, as in the case of vegetative activities, nor even any alteration of the subject of ‘spiritual’ operations, as in the case of sense-awareness. There is only an activity which is called movement simply because the mind goes from potency into act. This differs from movement proper; for whereas the latter connotes an imperfection in the moving subject, this activity proceeds from the subject as already perfect and complete.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo patet quomodo operationes animae vegetabilis et sensitivae, non sunt motus animae, sed coniuncti. Operationes autem intellectus non dicuntur motus nisi metaphorice, et sunt solum animae intellectivae absque aliquo determinato organo.
          <td>161. Clearly then the acts of the vegetative and sensitive souls are not exclusively of the soul, but of soul and body together; while those of the intellect are only called movements metaphorically, and are exclusively of the soul, without the use of any particular bodily organ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum etiam, quod sicut in sensu invenitur vis appetitiva et apprehensiva, ita et intellectu invenitur vis appetitiva et apprehensiva. Et ideo haec: amor, odium, gaudium et huiusmodi, possunt intelligi, et prout sunt in appetitu sensitivo, et sic habent motum corporalem coniunctum; et prout sunt in intellectu et voluntate tantum absque omni affectione sensitiva, et sic non possunt dici motus, quia non habent motum corporalem coniunctum. Et inveniuntur etiam in substantiis separatis, secundum quod in sequentibus melius patebit.
          <td>162. Note too that, as desire and cognition are both found in the sensitive fart, the same division appears in the intellectual part also. Hence love, hatred, delight and so forth can be understood either as sensitive, and in this sense they are accompanied by a bodily movement; or as exclusively intellectual and volitional, without any accompanying sensuous desire; and understood in this sense they are not movements, for they involve no accompanying bodily change. In this latter sense they pertain even to immaterial substances, as will be shown more clearly later.

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit intellectus autem vult probare quae ostendit, scilicet quod huiusmodi operationes, etiam si sint motus, sicut ipsi dicebant, non attribuuntur animae, sed corpori et coniuncto. Et hoc probat per quamdam opinionem illorum, quae erat famosa tempore suo, scilicet, quod omnis anima est incorruptibilis; et hoc secundum eos erat de intellectu et de omni anima. Dicit ergo, quod videtur praedictis philosophis quod intellectus sit quaedam substantia, quae est in fieri et nondum completa, et quod non corrumpitur. Cuius ratio est, quia nos videmus quod omnes debilitationes quae fiunt circa intellectum et sensum, non attingunt ad ipsam animam secundum se, sed proveniunt ex debilitate organi. Unde videtur quod intellectus et omnis anima sit incorruptibilis, et quod debilitatio in eius operationibus non sit ex eo quod ipsa corrumpatur, sed ex eo quod debilitantur organa.
          <td>163. Then, at ‘But intellect’, Aristotle sets out to prove what has been shown, namely that even if activities of this kind are movements (as the philosophers he is discussing maintained) still they are not movements of the soul alone, but involve the body also. So he takes one of their opinions (famous in his time), namely that not the intellect only, but every kind of soul without exception, is immortal. According to this view the intellect was a substance in the making, still incomplete, and was immortal. For it is a fact of experience that all the weakening and decay that affect the intellect or the senses come from the side of the bodily organ, not from the soul itself. Whence it would seem to follow that the intellect and every other sort of soul was incorruptible; if its activities grow feeble that does not imply its own decay, but the decay of the organs of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si enim corrumperetur anima, maxime corrumperetur a debilitate quae est in senectute, sicut accidit in organis sensitivis, quae debilitantur ex senectute: tamen anima non debilitatur ex hoc; quia si senex accipiat oculum iuvenis, videbit ut iuvenis. Quare senectus debilitat, non quidem quod ipsa anima patiatur seu virtus sensitiva, sed id in quo est. Sicut in aegritudinibus et in ebrietatibus non debilitatur anima, sed corpus. Sic ergo intelligere, idest simplex apprehensio et considerare, idest operatio intellectus quae est in componendo et dividendo, marcescunt, non quidem quod intellectus corrumpatur et patiatur, sed corrupto quodam alio interius, idest corrupto aliquo, quod est organum intellectus. Ipsum autem intelligere est impassibile.
          <td>164. If the soul itself decayed it would decay especially in old age; that is when the organs of sense grow feeble. Yet in fact the soul itself is unaffected by old age; if an old man could be given a young man’s eye he would see just as well as a young man. The decline of old age, then, is not due to a decline in the soul or in the faculties of sense, but to the body; just as in sickness or drunkenness it is the body, not the soul, that is enfeebled. Hence ‘understanding’, i.e. simple apprehension, and thinking,’ i.e. the intellectual activity of combining and distinguishing ideas, grow weak, not through a weakness in the intellect, but through ‘the decay of something else within’, i.e. the intellect’s organ or instrument. Understanding ‘in itself cannot be affected’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem dicit Aristoteles non quod sit huius opinionis, quod credat intellectum habere determinatum organum corporale; sed sicut dictum est, ipse hic loquitur supponendo opiniones istorum philosophorum, qui, sicut dictum est, erant huius opinionis, quod omnes operationes animae, et etiam ipse intellectus, haberent organa determinata. Et ideo secundum hoc assignat quare intelligere marcescat; quia huiusmodi operationes, quae sunt intelligere, amare et odire, sunt passiones illius, scilicet animae (supponendo loquitur), sed huius habentis, scilicet coniuncti seu organi corporalis. Organi dico habentis illud, scilicet intelligere et huiusmodi secundum quod illud habet. Unde corrupto hoc scilicet determinato organo huiusmodi operationis, quae est amare seu intelligere, non rememoratur neque amat, scilicet anima. Cuius ratio est, quia huiusmodi passiones non erant animae tantum sed communis scilicet coniuncti: quod est iam destructum et corruptum. Si ergo omnes huiusmodi motus et operationes debilitantur non propter animam, sed propter debilitatem corporis seu organi, ut dictum est: manifestum est, quod non sunt animae tantum, sed coniuncti; et per consequens, quod anima non movetur, sed coniunctum, licet anima.
          <td>165. Now in saying this Aristotle is not giving it as his opinion that the intellect has a special bodily organ, but, in the manner already explained, he is arguing on the supposition that the views of the philosophers whom he is criticising are sound; and it was their view, as we have seen, that each of the soul’s activities, and even intellect itself, had its special bodily organ. Assuming this, therefore, he gives as the reason for the decay of the understanding that it is one of those activities (like hating and loving) which are not of the soul alone, but of ‘that which has it’, i.e. of the compound of body and soul, or the bodily organ—precisely, he adds, in so far as this compound has ‘it’, i.e. understanding, and so forth. Consequently when ‘this’ (i.e. the bodily organ) ‘decays’ its activities, such as loving or understanding, decay likewise, and the soul itself neither remembers nor loves any more. The reason is that such processes did not only involve the soul, but that which was common’, i.e. the whole compound being; which has now decayed and passed away. Clearly, then, if all such movements and activities decay through the body’s decay, not the soul’s. they are not themselves exclusively of the soul, but of the soul and body together; and not the soul, but soul and body together, is what moves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia vero Aristoteles locutus est hic de intellectu, supponendo opiniones aliorum, sicut iam patet; ne credatur quod ipse opinetur intellectum sic esse ut supposuit, ideo removet hoc, dicens, quod fortassis intellectus est aliquid divinius et impassibile, idest aliquid altius et aliqua maior potentia, et per consequens operatio ipsius animae, quam dicatur hic. Dicit autem fortassis quia nondum hoc determinaverat, sed postea hoc in tertio ostendit. Unde patet quod supponendo loquitur.
          <td>166. But to remove any impression that he himself believes the intellect to be what the argument he is using supposes it to be, he adds these words, ‘Perhaps intellect is something more godlike and unalterable’, i.e. some sort of nobler power than any we are considering now, whose activity is exclusively of the soul. He says ‘perhaps’ because the question has not been decided yet; it will be cleared up in Book III. So much to show that he is arguing on a supposition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter concludit ex omnibus dicens, quod manifestum est ex omnibus his, quae dicta sunt, quod non est possibile animam moveri. Quod si non movetur aliquo modo, manifestum est quod non movetur a seipsa huiusmodi motibus, sicut isti ponebant.
          <td>167. Finally, he concludes from all this that it is now clear that the soul itself cannot be the subject of movement. And if so, then the soul is obviously not a self-mover with movements of the kinds here discussed, as the philosophers he is criticising had maintained.

For if the spheres of Democritus were to become points, and only quantity remained, there would remain in them a moving and a moved, as in extended matter, For the distinction spoken of is not due to largeness or smallness, but to quantity as such. Hence there must necessarily be something moving the units. But if it is the soul which moves the animal, so also in the case of number: then the soul is not a moving thing, which is also moved, but a mover only. § 172

            <td>Now this would have somehow to be a unit. If so, it must have some principle of differentiation from other units. But how can one isolated point differ from others, but in position? But if there are many different units and points in a body, they will be units in the same subject, and will occupy space as points. But, if there are two in the same place, what is there to prevent an infinity of them together? That of which the place is indivisible is itself such. But if the points in the body are the ‘numbers’ of the soul, or if the ‘number’ of body-points is that of the soul, why are there not souls in all bodies?

For if the soul is in all the body as sentient, there must be two bodies in the same place, if the soul is some sort of body. And for those who say it is a number, there are many points in one point, or else every body has a soul; unless the soul’s ‘number’ be other than that of the points in the body. The animal would then come to be moved by a number, precisely as Democritus said. What difference does it make whether one says small spheres or large units, or, in general, that units are in motion? In any case it must needs be that the animal moves when these are moving. §§ 175-6

          <td>Postquam philosophus improbavit opinionem illorum, qui dixerunt simpliciter animam moveri, hic consequenter arguit contra opinionem Xenocratis, qui supra motum addidit aliquid aliud, scilicet quod anima esset numerus movens seipsum. Et haec opinio est multum irrationabilior opinionibus aliorum philosophorum, quae dictae sunt. Nam his qui dicunt animam esse numerum moventem seipsum, multa impossibilia insunt. Et primo quidem ea quae accidunt eo quod est moveri, id est ex motu, quae etiam accidunt omnibus dicentibus animam moveri; accidunt etiam sic dicentibus, et inconvenientia propria, ex hoc scilicet quod dicunt animam esse numerum. Et propter hoc philosophus improbat definitionem hanc Xenocratis de anima, et non tantum est disputans ad nomen, sed ad ipsam intentionem definientis. Circa hoc autem duo facit. Primo ostendit hanc definitionem esse inconvenientem, quantum ad ipsam animam vel substantiam animae. Secundo vero quantum ad eius accidentia, ibi, complectentibus igitur in unum et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo enim destruit definitionem praedictam de anima per rationes. Secundo vero ostendit quod ad hanc definitionem sequuntur omnia inconvenientia quae sequuntur ad opiniones aliorum philosophorum, ibi, accidit autem sicut diximus et cetera.
          <td>168. After refuting those who asserted that the soul was a thing that moved, the Philosopher goes on now to criticise the view of Xenocrates who said, in addition, that soul was a self-moving number; a far less rational opinion than the others already mentioned. For it involves many absurdities. First of course there are those arising from ‘being moved’, the irrationalities, namely into which all who say that the soul itself moves are led; and then, in addition, there are the special difficulties involved in the notion that soul is a number. Therefore in Xenocrates’ definition of soul the Philosopher criticises, not merely the terms employed, but the meaning itself. This critique has two parts. First he shows that the definition does not fit the soul itself or its substance; and then that ‘it does not fit its accidental qualities,—this at ‘These and many other consequences’. The former part subdivides into reasons for (a) rejecting the said definition and (b) for thinking that it involves all the difficulties implicit in the views of the other philosophers already criticised; this part beginning at ‘This amounts to saying’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem praedicta definitio sit incongrua, probat sex rationibus. Quarum prima talis est. Tu dicis, animam esse numerum moventem seipsum: numerus autem constat ex unitatibus: ergo dicis animam esse unitates. Si tu dicis animam esse numerum moventem seipsum, ergo et animam unitates moventes seipsas: sed omne movens seipsum habet duas partes, ut probat in octavo physicorum; quarum una est movens et alia mota: ergo oportebit dicere quod unitas seu punctum dividetur in duas partes, quarum una sit movens, et altera mota. Hoc autem est impossibile, ergo impossibile est quod anima sit numerus movens seipsum. Quod autem sit impossibile unitatem habere unam partem moventem et aliam motam, probat: quia nullo modo illud quod est omnino impartibile et indifferens, potest intelligi quod moveatur per se, ita quod habeat partem moventem unam, et aliam motam. Nam in nullo possunt haec duo, scilicet vis motiva vel movens, et mobilis vel mota esse, nisi differant. Cum ergo unitas sit impartibilis et indifferens, non potest huiusmodi partes habere, et sic nec moveri. Ergo anima non est numerus movens seipsum.
          <td>169. He shows the unsuitability of the definition by six arguments; the first being as follows. You call the soul a self-moving number; but number is composed of units; the soul then, in your view, consists of units which move themselves. Now in any self-moving thing there are two parts (as is shown in Book VIII of the <i>Physics</i> ), one moving, the other moved. Therefore you must mean that each unit or point is composed of two parts, one moving, the other moved. But this is impossible. Therefore the soul is not a self-moving number. To show the impossibility of a unit having a moving part and a moved part: what is wholly indivisible and undifferentiated cannot be thought of as moving itself in such a way that one part moves and another is moved. For the motive or moving factor and the mobile or moved factor cannot exist without differing. Since, then, the unit is indivisible and undifferentiated, it cannot have such parts as these. Therefore the soul is not a self-moving number.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius quoniam quae talis est. Tu dicis animam esse numerum: ergo et unitates, ut dictum est. Inter unitatem autem et punctum nulla differentia est, nisi quod punctus habet positionem; est enim punctum unitas positionem habens. Sed si anima est numerus, oportet quod alicubi sit huiusmodi numerus animae, et positionem habens: ergo anima erit unitas positionem habens. Huiusmodi autem sunt puncta: ergo anima erit puncta. Sed secundum quod dicunt Platonici, motus puncti facit lineam, linea autem mota facit superficiem, superficies vero corpus. Sed est anima numerus movens seipsum, ergo eodem modo et unitas; et per consequens est punctum movens seipsum: punctum autem motum non facit nisi lineam: ergo motus animae non facit nisi lineam. Et sic anima motu suo non causat vitam, sed lineam, quod est falsum. Non est igitur anima numerus movens seipsum.
          <td>170. The second argument, at ‘Further, since’, runs thus. You say the soul is a number; and therefore composed of units, as has been said. Now the only difference between a unit and a point is that a point has position—it is a unit in position. But if the soul is a number, this number must exist somewhere in position. Therefore the soul is a unit in position, that is to say a point. But according to the Platonists a point in movement makes a line, a line in movement makes a surface, and a surface a body. If then the soul is a self-moving number each of its units is self-moving, and each of these is a self-moving point. But such a point can only make a line; therefore the same is true of the movement of the soul. Hence not life, but a line is the effect of the soul; which is not true. Therefore the soul is not a self-moving number.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Si anima est numerus, ut tu dicis, oportet quod consequatur passiones et naturam numeri: sed constat quod si aliquis auferat a numero unitatem aliquam, seu addat, mutat speciem. Nam si huic numero, scilicet ternario, addas unitatem, mutat speciem. Alia enim species est huius numeri quatuor, et alia eius quod est tria. Si vero ab eodem auferas unitatem, efficitur duo et mutat similiter speciem. Constat autem quod animalia sumunt speciem ab anima, cum unumquodque consequatur per formam speciem suam. Ergo si anima est numerus, ex subtractione vel additione alicuius ab anima, relinquitur alia anima specie: et hoc est falsum. Videmus enim in decisionibus plantarum et animalium annulosorum, quod divisa seu decisa vivunt, et eamdem speciem habent. Non ergo anima est numerus movens seipsum.
          <td>171. The third argument, at ‘Further, if’, is the following. if, as you say, the soul is a number, it must have the nature and attributes of number. Now it is evident that whenever a unit is taken from or added to a number, the number is essentially changed. if you add 1 to 3 you alter the number in kind: 4 differs in kind from 3. Similarly if you take 1 from 3, leaving 2. Now it is agreed that living things are specified by their soul; since it is through the form that things are specified. if” then, the soul is a number, any addition to, or subtraction from, it must alter it in kind. But this is not true: for if plants and segmented animals are cut up the divisions go on living, the same in kind as before. Therefore the soul is not a self-moving number.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit cum dicit videbitur autem quae talis est. Tu dicis animam esse numerum: et sicut dictum est; sequitur quod anima sit unitates positionem habentes, et per consequens quod sit puncta. Secundum hoc autem si recte consideremus, videbitur utique quod nihil differt dicere, quod anima sit corpora parva et indivisibilia, sicut dixit Democritus, aut dicere quod sit unitates positionem habentes. Unum enim positionem habens, quantitas est et indivisibilis.
          <td>172. The fourth argument, at ‘It would seem to be’ is as follows. You say the soul is a number; whence it follows, as we know, that it consists of units in position, i.e. points. But on this, supposition it is obvious that there is no difference between saying, with Democritus, that the soul consists of small indivisible bodies and saying that it is composed of units in position. For each unit in position is a quantity and indivisible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hoc ergo sic arguo: anima, secundum positionem tuam, est numerus movens seipsum, et per consequens unitates et puncta moventia seipsa. Ponamus autem quod corpora indivisibilia, quae posuit Democritus, sint puncta, quia non differt, sicut dictum est, et sint quanta, quod necesse est, quia proprie non movetur nisi quantum. Huiusmodi autem puncta movent seipsa, quia anima est numerus seipsum movens. Sed in movente seipso, sicut dictum est, duo sunt: ergo erit in ipso puncto, unum quod est movens, et aliud quod est motum. Nec est curandum utrum sint magna seu parva, dummodo sit quanta; quia in quolibet continuo movente seipsum hoc accidit, scilicet, quod sint duo ibi, unum ut movens, et aliud ut motum. Et sic necesse est quod sit aliquid motivum unitatum. In animali autem, illud quod movet animal, est anima; ergo et in numero, illud quod movet numerum erit anima; ergo anima non est id quod movetur, sed illud quod movet. Et sic mala est definitio animae, quod sit numerus movens seipsum; sed potius quod sit numerus movens numerum motum.
          <td>Very well then; the soul, in your view, is a self-moving number and, consequently, consists of units and points moving themselves. Let us suppose then that the indivisible bodies of Democritus are points (there is no difference, as we have seen) and are quantities (as they must be, since only quantities, properly speaking, move). Now these points will move themselves if the soul is a self-moving number. But every self-mover, as has been said, is two-fold; hence each point itself is two-fold, having a moving part and a moved part; and this, no matter whether they be large parts or small, provided they have some quantity; for every self-moving continuum contains the two factors; a moving one and a moved one. So there must be a mover of the units. But in living things the mover is the soul; therefore the mover of the number would be the soul; whence it follows that the soul is not a moved but a mover, and thus, the definition of it as a self-moving number is incorrect. It should rather be defined as a number moving another number.

          <td>Quintam rationem ponit cum dicit contingit autem quae talis est. Secundum opinionem Xenocratis contingit hanc, scilicet animam, esse unitatem: sed ex hoc contingit ipsam esse puncta; quia si anima est unitas, oportet quod differat ab aliis unitatibus. Non poterit autem differre ab eis nisi per positionem. Quae enim est differentia puncti solitarii id est unitatis intellectae, nisi positio? Nulla unitas autem nisi positionem habens, est punctum: ergo anima non est unitas sed puncta. Sed anima est in corpore, et quodlibet corpus habet puncta sua per se. Quaero ergo, utrum puncta, quae sunt anima, sint eadem cum punctis corporis, aut alia. Si quidem sunt altera, ergo in qualibet parte corporis erunt puncta animae, et sic erunt duo puncta animae in eodem loco simul. Et si duo, propter quid non plura, aut etiam infinita? Nam illa, quorum locus est indivisibilis, et ipsa indivisibilia sunt, unde non indigent ampliori loco. Unde si ponantur duo esse in loco indivisibili, per consequens possunt in eodem loco esse infinita. Si vero dicas, quod sunt eadem puncta quae sunt in corpore cum his punctis, quae sunt anima, sequitur quod cum omne corpus habeat puncta, quod omne corpus habeat animam: sed hoc est falsum: non ergo anima est numerus movens seipsum.
          <td>173. The fifth argument begins at ‘Now this would have somehow to be a unit’. In Xenocrates’ opinion the soul is a unity. But if so, then it is a point; for it must, as a unity, differ from other unities and it cannot differ except through position. For what is it that differentiates ‘isolated points’, i.e. unities as here understood, excepting their position? Moreover, only through position are unities points. The soil, then, is not a mere unity, but a point. Yet it exists in the body and every body as such has its own points. Well then, are the soul-points identical with the body-points or not? If they are not, then every part of the body will contain also soul-points, and in every such part there will be two points at the same time in the same place. And if two, why not more than two, ad infinitum? Things whose place is indivisible are themselves indivisible; and require no increase of space if they increase in number; so, that if two can be in an indivisible place, there is no reason why an infinite number should not be there. On the other hand if body-points are identical with soul-points, then every body has a soul, since every body has points. But this is false; therefore the soul is not a self-moving number.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem et sumitur ex praecedenti. Quae talis est: sicut dictum est, sequitur ex positione Xenocratis, quod anima sit puncta: sed nos videmus quod puncta non separantur, nec absolvuntur a corporibus. Nam lineae non dividuntur a superficiebus, nec puncta a lineis. Anima vero separatur et absolvitur a corpore: ergo non est puncta, neque numerus. Patet ergo quod definitio Xenocratis de anima est incongrua quantum ad ea quae in definitione ponuntur.
          <td>174. The sixth argument, at ‘Furthermore, how’, continues the preceding one. It follows from Xenocrates’ theory that the soul is composed of points. Points are obviously inseparable and undetachable from bodies; for lines are not separable from surfaces, nor points from lines. But this is not true of the soul; hence it is not a point or a number. Clearly then, Xenocrates’ definition is intrinsically inappropriate.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit accidit autem dicit definitionem praedictam esse incongruam, quantum ad inconvenientia. Nam ex huiusmodi definitione de anima sequuntur omnia inconvenientia, quae sequuntur ex opinionibus omnium philosophorum de anima. Quidam enim erraverunt circa animam, et dixerunt ipsam esse corpus subtilissimarum partium. Ex quo sequebatur, quod cum anima sit ubicumque est sensus in corpore, et sensus sit ubique per corpus, quod si anima est corpus, quod duo corpora sint simul. Et hoc idem sequetur si anima est puncta, sicut dictum est, scilicet quod duo sint simul et etiam infinita; et hoc si puncta animae sint alia a punctis corporis. Sed si non fiat differens numerus punctorum animae, id est si non differant puncta animae a punctis quae sunt in corpore, sequitur quod in quolibet corpore sit anima. In quolibet enim corpore est invenire puncta.
          <td>§175. Then, at ‘This amounts to saying,’ he finds this definition objectionable in its consequences. These consequences involve all the objectionable consequences flowing from the theories of all who have philosophised about the soul. For some of these fell into the mistake of saying that the soul was a body made up of extremely fine parts, whence it would follow that two bodies would be together in the same place; for the soul is wherever sensation occurs, and this is everywhere in the body. And the same would follow, as has been said, if the soul were composed of points: two points, or even an infinite number of points, would exist together in the same place at the same time. This would follow if the soul-points differed from body-points. And if ‘the number be other’, i.e. if there is no difference between soul-points and body-points, then every body contains a soul, since it must contain points.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam vero, sicut Democritus, erravit dicens animam moveri, et corpus ex motu animae; et cum ipse diceret componi animam ex indivisibilibus sphaeris, et ex motu ipsarum moveri corpus, sequebatur, quod corpus moveretur ex corporibus indivisibilibus. Et hoc idem inconveniens sequitur ex definitione istorum, scilicet animal moveri ex numero, et per consequens a punctis: et non est differentia, dicere sphaeras parvas, et unitates magnas, aut quascumque unitates moveri. Nam utrobique id est in sphaericis corporibus et unitatibus, necesse est quod anima moveatur, eo quod ipsa, scilicet corpora sphaerica, et puncta seu unitates moventur.
          <td>176. Others, like Democritus erred in saying that the soul itself moved, and the body because of the soul. And from Democritus’ statement that the soul was made up of indivisible spheres whose movement caused the body to move it followed that indivisible bodies were the cause of bodily movements. The same difficulty follows from the definition which states that an animal is moved by a number and so by points. It makes no difference what size we give to the moving spheres or units; for ‘in any case’, i.e. with spheres or with units, the origin of the soul’s movement is the movement of bodily spheres and points.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit complectentibus igitur ostendit insufficientiam praedictae definitionis ex parte accidentium. Dicit ergo quod, quandocumque definitio sufficienter assignatur, non solum debet ducere in cognitionem substantiae rei definitae, sed etiam accidentium. Sed si complicemus in unum ista duo, quae posita sunt in definitione animae, scilicet numerum et motum, non solum accidunt nobis inconvenientia quae dicta sunt circa substantiam ipsius animae, sed etiam multa alia; quia haec duo non solum est impossibile esse definitionem, idest substantiam animae, verum etiam est impossibile quod ipsa, scilicet numerus et motus, sint accidentia animae, seu ducant in cognitionem accidentium. Non igitur est congrua definitio, cum non ducat, in cognitionem accidentium. Et quod non ducat in cognitionem accidentium animae, manifestum est si quis ex huiusmodi definitione conabitur passiones et operationes animae assignare, puta ratiocinationes, delectationem, tristitiam, et huiusmodi. Ex ipsis enim, scilicet ex numero et motu, non solum non erit facile devenire in cognitionem accidentium et operationum animae, sed nec divinare poterimus ex eis aliquid de ipsis passionibus et operationibus animae.
          <td>177. Next, at ‘These and etc.,’ he shows the weakness of the above definition with respect to accidental qualities. A complete definition, he says, must give knowledge of the accidents as well as of the substance of the thing defined. But if we combine number and movement in our definition of the soul, we shall find ourselves involved in many difficulties besides those that concern the soul’s substance. For these two things, number and movement, not only cannot belong to the substance of the soul, but are not even accidental qualities of it, nor are they means to a knowledge of these qualities. Hence the definition itself is unsuitable; it does not help us to know the accidental qualities of the thing defined. This will be evident to anyone who, relying on this definition, tries to attribute to the soul affections and activities such as reasoning, pleasure, pain and the like. If we started from number and movement, we should not only find it, hard to reach any knowledge of the soul’s accidental qualities and passions and activities, but we could not even begin to hazard any conjecture about them.

They say this is so because the soul perceives things that are and knows each one. But many irrational consequences follow upon this. For they suppose that like is known by like, as if they meant to identify things themselves with the soul. But those [elements] are not the only things; there are many others, perhaps infinite in number, derived from them.

Or is one to say that there are elements and principles proper to each category of which the soul is composed? then there will be quality and quantity and substance in the soul.

Likewise with those who would make of elements the sensitive and intellectual powers; for plants seem to live, but are not endowed with local motion or perception; and many animals lack intelligence. Even setting this fact on one side, and admitting that intellect is a part of the soul, and the sensitive power likewise, they would not be speaking of every soul, nor of the whole of any soul, nor of one [entire soul]. The same objection tells against a notion expressed in the Orphic hymns, where it is said, ‘The soul enters from the universe, breathed in by the winds.’ This cannot occur in the case of plants and certain animals: unless, indeed, all use respiration; a fact overlooked by those who put forward this view. §§ 189-90

          <td>178. Having in the preceding sections explained that the early philosophers pursued their enquiry into the soul by three ways, that of movement, of knowledge and of incorporeal being, and having pressed certain objections against those who took the way of movement, and against those who identified soul with something bodiless and entirely simple, the Philosopher now turns to criticise the upholders of the principle that the soul knows everything because everything is included in itself.

Unde, cum res constent ex elementis, dicebant, quod anima erat composita ex omnibus elementis, ut sentiat et cognoscat omnia quae sunt. Et quia principalis in hac positione fuit Empedocles, cum poneret animam compositam ex pluribus elementis quam aliquis aliorum, ideo philosophus principaliter hic reprobat opinionem suam, et disputat contra eam. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim improbat opinionem Empedoclis. Secundo vero quamdam aliam, ibi, in toto autem quidem ipsam et cetera.
          <td>179. With their theory that all knowledge takes place by means of assimilation these philosophers had caught, as it were, a far-off glimpse of the truth; but they expressed this by saying that the reason why the soul knew all things was that all things entered into its composition, and that the soul possessed the likeness of all things according to the mode of existence, i.e. a corporeal one, which things have in themselves outside it. Hence, if things consist of elements, the same is true, they said, of the soul; and that is the cause of sensation and knowledge. The chief upholder of this view was Empedocles, who posited more elements in the soul than anyone else; and therefore the Philosopher is more concerned here to refute him than anyone else. So he first attacks the opinion of Empedocles, and only then, at ‘And some say’ that of certain others.

          <td>Improbat autem opinionem Empedoclis decem rationibus: quarum prima talis est. Empedocles dicit, quod quia cognitio fit per similitudinem, cum anima cognoscat omnia, oportet animam compositam esse ex omnibus. Sed patet quod huic rationi est necessarium accidere multa inconvenientia et impossibilia. Constat enim, quod in qualibet re non sunt haec sola, scilicet elementa, sed multa alia ab elementis, sicut est proportio commixtionis et ratio uniuscuiusque, et forte sunt infinita numero, quae accidunt rebus compositis ex his, scilicet elementis, sicut patet in osse. Nam non solum oportet cognoscere illa ex quibus componitur os, sed etiam proportionem, quae est inter illa ex quibus componitur et rationem ossis: quia omnia quae sunt composita, non consistunt, quocumque modo se habeant elementa, sed quadam ratione et compositione, scilicet ut sint proportionata adinvicem. Nam os, cum habeat octo partes, secundum quod dicit Empedocles, unumquodque compositum os haberet octo partes quae non aequaliter attribuuntur omnibus elementis, sed terra habet ibi duas partes. Aer habet ibi unam, aqua similiter unam, sed ignis quatuor: et ideo ex maiori participatione ignis dicit ossa esse facta alba, et ex terra sicca. Sic ergo in rebus compositis non solum sunt ipsa elementa, sed proportio et ratio uniuscuiusque. Inde sic. Aut ergo istae proportiones sunt in anima cum elementis, aut non. Si sunt in anima; ergo in anima sunt ossa, et carnes, et huiusmodi, et per consequens homo et lapis, et corpora, et contraria: unde nullus dubitat quod haec non sunt in anima. Si vero dicas, quod non sunt ibi huiusmodi proportiones et rationes, sed solum elementa, tunc anima non cognoscet proportionem rerum, nec ipsa composita: quomodo enim poterit cognoscere Deum, scilicet totum caelum, aut hominem, aut lapidem seu os? Nullo modo cognoscet, sed elementa tantum.
          <td>180. Against Empedocles he brings ten arguments. The first is as follows. Empedocles argues that the soul must be composed of all the objects of its knowledge because knowledge takes place by means of similitude. But this involves many difficulties and absurdities. For clearly the elements are not all that any given thing contains; it includes much else besides, such as the proportion in which its elements are combined and the formulable essence of each one in particular, and there may even be an infinity of accidents belonging to things made up of elements. Take, for example, bones. To understand bones we need to know, not only the elements of which they are composed, but also how these elements combine in them, and the functional pattern of bones; for the order of elements in compound things is not a random one, it involves a certain definite proportional arrangement. If bone, as Empedocles says, is composed of eight parts, each bone has eight parts into which the various elements enter in unequal measure: for earth, he says, contributes two parts, air and water one each, and fire four—to which predominance of fire is due the whiteness of bone, while from earth comes its dryness. Thus in compound things there are, besides the elements, certain proportions and patterns. Well then, either these proportions are in the soul together with the elements, or not. If they are in the soul, then bones and flesh and so forth, and therefore men and stones and bodies and things quite contrary to one another, are all in the soul; and this nobody dreams of conceding. But if only the elements are in the soul, then it does not in fact know the proportion in things nor compound things as such; and how can it know God (i.e. the Heavens as a whole) or man or stone or bone? It cannot possibly know these things; it knows only the elements which compose them, according to this view.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Tu dicis, quod anima est composita ex principiis: sed diversorum generum diversa sunt principia: cum ergo id quod est, dicatur multipliciter, idest secundum diversa genera, sicut substantiae, qualitatis, quantitatis, et aliorum praedicamentorum: ergo erunt diversa principia. Quaero ergo, utrum anima sit composita tantum ex principiis substantiae, aut ex principiis omnium generum. Si tantum ex principiis substantiae, tunc anima non cognoscet nisi substantias, et ipsi ponunt eam cognoscere omnia. Si vero componitur ex principiis omnium generum, tunc, cum quicquid est ex principiis substantiae sit substantia, et ex principiis quantitatis sit quantitas, et sic de singulis, anima erit substantia, quantitas, qualitas, relatio, et huiusmodi.
          <td>181. The second argument, starting at ‘Further, that which is’, runs thus. You say the soul is made up of elementary principles. But these differ according to the different categories of things, such as substance, quality, quantity and the rest. Is then the soul made up of the elementary principles of substance alone, or does it include those of the other categories? If the first alternative is right, then the soul only knows substance; yet the supposition is that it knows everything. But if it includes the elements of all the categories, then, since whatever has the elementary principles of substance is a substance, and whatever has those of quantity is a quantity, and so on likewise with the rest, it follows that the soul is at once both a substance, and a quality, and a relation, and so on and so forth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Posset autem responderi contra hanc rationem Aristotelis quod principia substantiae sunt etiam quantitatis et qualitatis, et aliorum, cum omnia fundentur supra substantiam; et ideo non oportet quod sint in anima aliqua alia principia quam principia substantiae, et nihilominus cognoscet omnia. Ad hoc dicendum, quod quaelibet res habet principia proxima et remota, et cognitio oportet quod sit per principia proxima. Principia autem substantiae, licet sint principia aliorum, sunt tamen remota et non proxima, et ideo per ea non potest haberi cognitio nisi de substantia.
          <td>182. It might be answered that the elementary principles of substance are also those of quantity, quality, etc., since everything is grounded in substance; hence the soul need only possess the principles of substance to know everything. But I say that things have both remote and proximate principles, and should be known by means of the latter. The principles of substance may be the remote, but they are not the proximate, principles of the other categories; hence they cannot give knowledge of anything except substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit inconveniens autem quae talis est. Ratio quare anima sit composita ex omnibus elementis, est, quia anima cognoscit omnia, et cognitio est per similitudinem. Contra. Constat enim quod sentire et cognoscere est pati aliquid. Sed inconveniens est dicere quod simile patiatur a simili, sed a contrario; ergo et inconveniens est dicere quod sentire seu cognoscere sit simile simili.
          <td>183. The third argument, starting at ‘It is unreasonable’, is this. The reason why the soul is said to be composed of all the elements is that it knows all things and knowledge is by similarity. Against this is the admitted fact that sensation and knowledge are a sort of being acted upon; and it seems unreasonable to say that like is acted upon by like, and not rather by its contrary; and consequently, to say that sensation or knowledge are by similarity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit cum dicit multas autem quae talis est. Ex hoc quod dictum est superius, testatur quod dictum Empedoclis, scilicet quod simile simili cognoscatur, habet multas dubitationes et difficultates. Sed adhuc etiam magis apparet difficile et improprie dictum. Nam si anima cognosceret simile simili, sicut Empedocles dicit, tunc sequitur quod elementum aeris cognoscat aera, et sic de aliis. Sed nos videmus quod multae partes terrae sunt in animali, quae nihil sentiunt, sicut pili, et ossa, et nervi: et tamen conveniret quod sentirent secundum positionem eorum; ergo non cognoscitur simile simili, vel etiam non est composita ex omnibus elementis.
          <td>184. The fourth argument, at ‘What has now’, is this. What has been said already is enough to show that Empedocles’ theory is highly questionable and his manner of expressing it slipshod. But there is a yet stronger objection. If the soul, as he says, knows by similarity, then the element air Will know air, and so on for the other elements. But we know that animals’ bodies have many earthy parts which lack sensation, such as hair, bones and nerves; yet they ought to have sensation according to this theory. Therefore knowledge is not by similarity nor the soul composed of the elements.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quintam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Adhuc ex positione Empedoclis, quod simile cognoscatur simili, sequitur aliud inconveniens, scilicet quod principium habet plus de ignorantia quam de intelligentia. Si enim cognitio est per simile tantum, et principium quodlibet sit simplex et non habet alicuius similitudinem in se nisi suam, non cognosceret nisi seipsum, et ignorabit multa, omnia scilicet quae sunt alia ab eo.
          <td>185. The fifth argument’s at ‘Again etc.’, runs thus. Another objection to this view is that it implies that principles as such are more ignorant than percipient. For if knowledge is only by similarity, and if every principle is quite simple, having no likeness to anything but itself, it follows that each principle only knows itself and is ignorant of everything else.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit cum dicit accidet autem quae talis est. Adhuc etiam ex dicta positione, scilicet quod simile cognoscatur simili, accidet aliud inconveniens Empedocli: hoc videlicet, quod Deus sit insipientissimus omnium animalium. Quod ex hoc sequitur. Sciendum enim quod sicut dictum est, Empedocles posuit ista omnia inferiora composita esse ex quatuor elementis, et ex lite et amicitia; et quod generatio et corruptio provenit in rebus ex istis duobus, scilicet lite et amicitia. Caelum vero dixit esse Deum, et dixit quod erat compositus ex quatuor elementis, et amicitia, sed non ex lite, et ideo est incorruptibile. Si ergo simile cognoscitur simili, cum Deus non sit compositus ex lite, non cognoscet litem, et sic erit simpliciter insipientior ceteris animalibus quae cognoscunt litem cum sint composita ex ea.
          <td>186. The sixth argument comes at ‘Further’. This theory also implies the doubtful consequence that God is the most ignorant of all living beings. For, as we have seen, Empedocles thought that everything on this earth could be reduced to the four elements together with Strife and Friendship, these last being the causes of coming-to-be and passing-away. But the sky he called God and said it was composed of the four elements and Friendship, but not of Strife; and was therefore incorruptible. If then knowledge is by similarity, God cannot know Strife, since it does not form part of him, and God is therefore less percipient, strictly speaking, than other living beings which know Strife because they include it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Septimam rationem ponit cum dicit omnino autem quae talis est. Si anima est composita ex omnibus elementis, sequitur quod omnia quae sunt habent animam: omne enim quod est, aut est ex omnibus elementis, aut ex aliquibus: sed omne quod est compositum ex elementis, aut ex elementis, est corpus: ergo omnia corpora habent animam et omnia quae sunt, quod falsum est.
          <td>187. The seventh argument’ comes at ‘In general, why’. If the soul is made of all the elements, then all things have souls; for all things are made of either all or some elements. Now whatever is made up of elements or of compounds of elements is a body. Hence all bodies, indeed all beings, have souls; which is false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Octavam rationem ponit cum dicit dubitabit autem quae talis est. Elementa sunt plura et contraria. Ubicumque autem aliqua contraria conveniunt et componuntur, oportet quod sit aliquid aliud quod contineat et faciat ipsa unum. Si ergo anima est composita ex omnibus elementis, oportet quod sit aliquid aliud continens illa. Sed hoc est valde dubium quid sit, quia sic esset nobilius et prius anima, quod est impossibile, et ad minus de intellectu; quia valde rationabile est quod intellectus sit nobilissimus omnium et divinus secundum naturam. Item sequeretur quod illud esset prius quam elementa: quod est falsum: quia Empedocles et alii dicunt elementa esse prima inter omnia entia. Non est ergo anima composita ex elementis.
          <td>188. The eighth argument’ begins at ‘One might wonder’. The elements are many and contrary; but whenever contrary things come together in a composition there must be some other thing which includes and unifies them. Hence if the soul is made up of the elements there must be something in it which unifies them. But it is extremely doubtful what this can be; for it must be something in the soul nobler than the soul, which is an impossibility, at least as regards that, which it is reasonable to consider the supremely noble and divine thing, namely the mind. Besides, this other thing would have to be prior to the elements, whereas Empedocles and the rest have asserted that the elements were the first of all beings. Therefore the soul is not made up of elements.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nonam rationem ponit cum dicit omnes autem et ostendit defectum et insufficientiam positionis Empedoclis et aliorum omnium qui considerant animam ex motu seu sensu. Quae talis est. Apparet etiam quod omnes et quicumque dixerunt animam esse aliquid motivum secundum locum, insufficienter dixerint. Nam multa animata sunt quae non moventur secundum locum, sed manent, sicut plantae et alia huiusmodi. Similiter autem et illi qui dixerunt animam esse quid intellectivum et sensitivum, insufficienter dixerunt. Nam multa sunt animata quae neque sentiunt neque intelligunt. Si vero aliquis hoc segregaverit, scilicet intellectivum, sensitivum, et motivum, et dicat intellectivum unam partem animae et similiter sensitivum, non tamen propter hoc dicet de omni anima, cum non omnes animae sint intellectivae. Neque de tota, cum intellectivum et sensitivum sunt partes animae. Neque de una, quia sic non diceret omnes proprietates animae cuiuscumque, cum in anima sint aliae proprietates, quam sint intelligere et sentire.
          <td>189. He begins the ninth argument at ‘Not one of those’, showing the weakness of Empedocles’ view and that of all the others who have enquired about the soul, whether by way of movement or by way of sense-perception. For (1) there is a gap in the arguments of all who defined the soul in terms of local movement. Many living beings, such as plants and things resembling plants, do not move locally at all but are fixed in one place. And (2) there is a like inadequacy in the definition of the soul in terms of intellect or sensation; for plenty of living things neither sense nor think. And if local motion, intellect and sensation are taken separately and regarded as distinct parts of the one soul, this will not apply to soul in general, since not all souls are intellectual; nor to the whole of any one soul, since only parts of it will be intellectual and sensitive; nor to any one single soul, since this description does not enumerate all the characteristics of any given soul; for in any soul there are other things besides understanding and sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia quidam philosophus qui vocatus est Orpheus, defective etiam de anima locutus est quasi in similem defectum incidit: ideo hic adiungit eius defectum. Sciendum est quod Orpheus iste fuit unus de primis philosophis qui erant quasi poetae theologi, loquentes metrice de philosophia et de Deo, et fuerunt tantum tres, Samius, Orpheus, et quidam alius. Et iste Orpheus primo induxit homines ad habitandum simul et fuit pulcherrimus concionator, ita quod homines bestiales et solitarios reduceret ad civilitatem. Et propter hoc dicitur de eo, quod fuit optimus cytharaedus, in tantum quod fecit vel faceret lapides saltare, id est, ita fuit pulchre concionator, quod homines lapideos emollivit. Post hos vero tres, fuerunt septem sapientes, quorum unus fuit Thales. Hic ergo Orpheus volebat quod totus aer animatus esset et anima quaedam; et quod anima corporum viventium nihil aliud esset, nisi illud quod attrahit animal de aere animato per respirationem; et hoc dicebat metrice. Et ideo dicit philosophus quod ratio Orphei quae est in metricis carminibus de anima, sustinuit eumdem defectum quem sustinuerunt rationes praecedentium, quia, sicut dictum est, ipse voluit quod illud esset anima, quod attrahitur per respirationem animalium. Sed hoc insufficienter dictum est: quia multa animalium sunt quae non respirant: hoc autem, scilicet quod animalia multa non respirant, latuit illos qui fuerunt praedictae opinionis. Et sic patet quod isti reprehenduntur de insufficientia.
          <td>190. And a certain philosopher named Orpheus having fallen into a rather similar error in what he said about the soul, he too is mentioned here. Orpheus was one of those three early thinkers who were, so to say, poet-theologians; for they wrote in verse on philosophy and about God. The other two were Museus and a certain Linus. Orpheus, a wonderful orator whose words had power to civilise wild and brutish folk, was the first man to induce his fellows to five together in society. For this reason it is said of him that he could make rocks dance to the sweet sounds of his harp, which really means that his eloquence could melt the hardest hearts. And after these three poet-philosophers came the seven sages, of whom Thales was one. Now this Orpheus thought that the whole air was alive, was indeed a sort of living soul, and that the so-called souls of living bodies were really nothing but the air these bodies breathed; and this idea he expressed in verse. But the Philosopher objects to the Orphic theory, saying that it is just as inadequate as the others he has criticised; for there are many animals that do not breathe at all, ‘a fact’, he says, ‘which was overlooked’ by those who held this opinion. The criticism touches the inadequacy of the theory.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Decimam rationem ponit cum dicit si vero et arguit eos de superfluitate: quae talis est. Dicunt enim isti quod ad hoc quod anima cognoscat, oportet quod sit composita ex elementis. Sed cum nos videamus quod cognitio omnis rei possit haberi per pauciora; ergo etsi concedatur animam componi ex elementis, non tamen debet dici composita ex elementis omnibus, sed ad plus, ex duobus. Et quod cognitio habeatur per pauciora, patet; quia cum compositum constet ex aliquo perfecto et imperfecto, ratio cognoscendi imperfectum, est perfectum; et cum contraria reducantur in privationem et habitum, sufficiens est altera pars, scilicet illa quae se habet per modum habitus et perfecti, ad cognoscendum seipsam et alteram partem, quae est per modum privationis et imperfecti. Nam per rectum diiudicamus et cognoscimus ipsum rectum, et etiam obliquum. Canon enim idest regula est illud per quod habetur iudicium de utroque. Per obliquum vero nec ipsum cognoscimus, nec rectum. Non ergo fuit necesse animam facere, idest eam componere ex omnibus elementis, sed ex duobus tantum, scilicet ex igne et terra, et per hoc cognosceret et seipsam et contraria; sicut per ignem cognosceret calida et frigida, et per terram, sicca et humida.
          <td>191. At ‘But if one’ comes the tenth argument; which convicts the Empedoclean theory of unnecessary complication. The soul’s capacity for knowledge is explained by its composition from elements. Now it is a matter of experience that knowledge of anything rests on few, rather than many, principles-, hence even if we grant that the soul is composed of elements we ought not to suppose that these are all the elements, but at the most two. And that knowledge rests on few rather than many principles is clear if we consider that in composite things, consisting of two principles, one of perfection, the other of imperfection, it is in the light of the former that we know the latter; and that in contraries, which can be reduced to a quality and its privation, it suffices to understand the term denoting quality and perfection in order to understand also the other term denoting privation and imperfection. Thus by, the idea of straight line we know and for in judgements about both straight and crooked lines; for ‘the rule’, i.e. the measure, is the means of knowing both; but the crooked line is the means of knowing neither itself nor the straight. Hence there was no need to regard the soul as made up of all the elements; enough to adduce two only, fire and earth, as its means of knowing both itself and contrary things. Through fire it could know both cold and hot objects, and through earth the dry and the moist.

          <td>192. Having stated and rejected the theories and arguments of those who maintained that the soul was composed of elements, the Philosopher is now led, by the same train of thought, to discuss the notion, upheld by some, according to which a soul is intermingled with the elements. First, then, he states this opinion, and then, at ‘They seemed to have held’, the argument used to support it. And the opinion itself is first stated and then, at ‘This, however,’ attacked.

          <td>There are, he says, some who see a soul intermingled with everything, whether simple elements or things composed of these. This perhaps is what Thales meant when he said that everything was full of gods; perhaps he thought that the entire Universe was alive and its life was divine; that just as soul exists everywhere in each living thing so a god was everywhere in the Universe and everything therefore was ‘full of divinities’.

For instance, if a soul exists in air and in fire (and of these two especially this was asserted) it is hard to see why it does not make ‘animated beings’ of them, i.e. why air and fire are not animals. Things composed of several elements are animals precisely because they contain a soul; and one would expect the soul to be all the more powerful where the element is pure and simple.

          <td>194. Again, one might ask, he says, why the soul which they place in the elements should be considered higher and more immortal than the soul of things composed of elements. For the latter constitute knowing, sentient animals; not so the former.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex his autem dubitationibus quaecumque ponatur, accidit inconveniens et irrationabile; quia dicere quod ignis sive aer sit animal, ut primo dubitatur, est maxime inconveniens, et ad sensum apparet falsum, et est dictum non habentium rationem. Et non dicere ea in quibus est anima, esse animalia, valde inconveniens est. Nam secundum hoc in nullo differt, inter esse animam in aliquo corpore, et non esse.
          <td>195. But, however the objections are put, the result is damaging to this theory. To say that fire or air is a living body is most improbable in itself; it is contradicted by experience; and is unsupported by any good reason. And to deny that things which have souls need be living bodies is most unreasonable; for it would follow that there was no difference between souls that exist in bodies and those that do not.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit opinari autem ponit rationem praemissae opinionis; et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit rationem, et improbat eam. Secundo concludit quid manifestum sit ex omnibus quae dicta sunt, ibi, manifestum igitur et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo enim ponit rationem opinionis; dicens, quod ratio quare dicti philosophi opinari videntur animam esse in his, id est in omnibus elementis, est quia ipsi volebant quod totum et partes in elementis, cum sint simplicia, quod essent similis speciei. Unde, cum viderent et opinarentur quod pars continentis, id est aeris, intercepta in corporibus animalium per inspirationem et respirationem, sit causa quare animalia fiant animata, et sit anima, necesse erat eis dicere animam esse similis speciei partibus, id est totum continens esse animatum.
          <td>196. Then, at ‘They seem to have held’, he states the reason used in support of this theory and refutes it; after which, at ‘It is... evident’ he draws a general conclusion from all the foregoing discussions. The reason, he says, why some philosophers seem to have thought that a soul existed in ‘these’, i.e. in all the elements, was that they thought that the whole and the parts in elements were of the same nature, since the elements are simple. Observing that that part of ‘the containing element’, i.e. the air, which came into contact with the bodies of animals through their breathing, was the cause and principle of animal life, they thought it necessary to conclude that the soul of the whole was ‘of the same specific nature as the parts’, that is to say, that all the containing air was alive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo vero cum dicit si autem improbat dictam rationem; dicens, quod quia aer discerptus et attractus est similis speciei toti aeri, sequetur quod anima animalis sit similis partis animae totius aeris. Sed constat quod anima animalis cuiuslibet est dissimilis partis animae aeris, quia una ipsius, scilicet anima aeris existet, id est immortalis est secundum eos, utpote quae semper vivificat et semper vivificavit omnia viva: aliud autem, scilicet anima huius vel illius animalis non existet, idest, est mortalis secundum eos. Necesse est ergo alterum duorum inconvenientium sequi ex hoc; videlicet quod si aer sit similis partis, scilicet ille qui est intra, et ille qui est extra, et anima etiam: quod improbatum est. Aut si ipsa anima est dissimilis partis, et aer similium, tunc sequitur quod anima non sit in qualibet parte omnis idest totius aeris: quod est contra eos qui totum aerem animatum ponebant.
          <td>197. At ‘If then’ he refutes this argument. The assumption is that, because the portion of the air removed and inhaled by an animal is of a like nature to the air as a whole, the soul of the animal itself is, as it were, a portion of the soul of the whole air. But on their own principle this is clearly false; for, according to them, the soul of air ‘exists’, i.e. is immortal, as that which has never ceased from vivifying animate beings, whereas the soul of this or that particular animal ‘does not exist’, i.e. is not immortal. Therefore either of two awkward consequences flow from this theory. If all the parts of air, those outside and those breathed in, are homogeneous, then the same is true of the soul; but this has been disproved. But if the soul’s parts are heterogeneous while the air’s are homogeneous, then the soul is not in every part ‘of the whole’, i.e. of the whole air; which is against those who said that all the air had a soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit manifestum igitur concludit ex omnibus quae dicta sunt de opinionibus antiquorum, quod neutrum illorum quod ipsi attribuebant animae, sit verum, nec bene dictum, eo modo quo ipsi dixerunt, scilicet quod neque cognoscere inest animae ex eo quod ex elementis, sicut ipsi ponebant, neque etiam motus seu moveri inest ei, ex hoc quod ex dictis elementis constabat secundum eos: et hoc satis aperte et clare patet inspicienti ad supradicta.
          <td>198. Then at ‘It is evident’ Aristotle concludes this part of the discussion of earlier opinions. Neither of these two predications made’ by the ancients was, he says, either true or well-expressed; namely that knowledge in the soul is a consequence of its being composed of elements, and that movement is in it for the same reason. So much should be clear to anyone who has followed the discussion up to the present.

          LECTIO 14</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Positis opinionibus antiquorum de anima et improbatis, consequenter philosophus movet quasdam dubitationes. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo enim movet ipsas quaestiones. Secundo vero solvit eas, ibi, dicunt itaque et cetera. Sciendum est autem, quod operationes animae scilicet sentire, intelligere, appetere, moveri secundum locum, et augeri, possunt dupliciter accipi: quia vel secundum modum operandi, et sic sunt tres potentiae animae, et his attribuuntur huiusmodi actiones; potentiae videlicet vegetabili, sensibili et intellectuali.
          <td>199. Having reviewed and criticised earlier opinions on the soul the Philosopher proceeds now to put certain questions of his own; which at ‘Some say’ he begins to answer. But first we have to realise that the activities, of the soul, such as sensation, understanding, desire, movement in space, and growth, can be considered in two distinct ways. We can consider the mode of these activities; and from this point of view we can distinguish, underlying these activities, three powers of the soul: the vegetative, the sensitive and the intellectual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quae quidem differunt. Nam nutritiva sive vegetabilis agit mediantibus qualitatibus activis et passivis, ut calidum, frigidum et huiusmodi. Sensitiva vero seu sensus, licet non indigeat qualitatibus sensibilibus ad sentiendum, indiget tamen organo corporali. Intellectus vero neutro istorum indiget, quia nec qualitatibus, nec per organum corporale aliquid intelligit, sed perficitur in operatione sua absque aliquo organo.
          <td>200. And these powers differ. For whilst the vegetative or nutritive power acts through active and passive qualities of matter, such as heat and cold and the like, the sensitive power requires no such sensible qualities for its sentient activity, though it does depend on corporeal organs; while the intellectual power acts through neither sensible qualities nor a corporeal organ, for it functions in an entirely incorporeal way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem accipiamus huiusmodi actiones secundum genera actionum, sic sunt quinque potentiae; scilicet nutritivum, sensitivum, motivum secundum locum, appetitivum, et intellectivum; et actiones horum sunt sentire, nutrire, movere, et appetere et intelligere.
          <td>201. But if we consider the kinds of activities within the soul’s range, then we distinguish five powers with five corresponding activities: the nutritive, sensitive, locomotive, appetitive and intellectual powers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo cum philosophus de anima secundum suam totalitatem secundum opiniones antiquorum supra tractasset, et reprobasset eas, hic inquirit de partibus et operationibus ipsarum partium, et movet duas quaestiones. Quarum prima talis est: utrum operationes animae, quae sunt cognoscere et sentire quantum ad sensum, et opinari quantum ad intellectum, adhuc concupiscere quantum ad concupiscibilem, deliberare quantum ad rationalem, et etiam appetitus, quod est in plus, quia concludit cum his duobus irascibilem, et moveri secundum locum, et augeri, et stare, et diminui, conveniant toti animae, ut scilicet unumquodque eorum sit in omni parte animae, id est secundum quamlibet partem animae intelligamus, sentiamus, moveamur, appetamus et nutriamur. Aut singulum istorum habeat singulam partem animae determinatam, ut scilicet alio intelligamus et alio sentiamus, et sic de aliis.
          <td>202. Having then discussed and criticised earlier opinions on the soul in general, Aristotle begins now an enquiry into the parts and particular activities of the soul. And he proposes two problems. The first is whether activities like sensing, rational judgement, desiring, deliberating, and also appetition (which he related to special parts of the soul in a more general way than these, placing the irascible urge in both the sensitive and the rational parts), together with local motion and rest, growth and decline, whether all these pertain to the whole soul in such a way that each one occurs in every part of the soul, so that with each part we both understand and sense and move and desire and assimilate food; or whether the truth is not rather that each activity has its own special part, that is to Say, that with one part we understand, with another we sense, and so on
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda quaestio est, quia dato quod quaelibet operatio animae habeat specialem partem, item erit quaestio, utrum hoc, quod est vivere, conveniat alicui partium, ita quod sit in aliquo uno, aut in pluribus partibus, aut in omnibus. Et si non in his, utrum sit in aliquo alio.
          <td>203. The second problem is this. Granted that each activity has its special part of the soul, is this true of the activity of simply being alive? Is this activity proper to any one of these parts? Or to many? Or to all at once? Or does it perhaps belong to some other part?
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit dicunt itaque respondet ad quaestiones positas. Et primo ad primam. Secundo vero ad secundam, ibi, videtur autem et quae et cetera. Respondens autem primae quaestioni, primo ponit opinionem quorumdam philosophorum ad hoc. Secundo improbat eam, ibi, quid igitur continetur et cetera. Quidam enim dicunt quod huiusmodi operationes non conveniunt toti animae, sed partibus. Dicunt enim animam esse partibilem, et quod alio intelligit, et alio concupiscit; sicut qui ponebant sensitivam in cerebro, vivificativam in corde, et huiusmodi.
          <td>204. Then at ‘Some say’ he answers these questions in order. As to the first one, he states and then rejects a view of certain philosophers that the activities in question spring severally from the soul’s parts, life from the soul in general; that the soul is so divided into parts that it understands with one and desires with another, just as some people hold that the sensitive power is in the brain and the vital power in the heart, and so on.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed huiusmodi opinio est quodammodo vera, et quodammodo falsa: quia si in anima intelligas diversas partes potentiales, sic est verum quod anima habet diversas partes et vires, et alia intelligit, et alia sentit. Anima enim est quoddam totum potentiale, et pars accipitur ibi potentialis respectu totius potestativi. Si vero intelligatur quod anima sit quaedam magnitudo, seu quantitas, et dividatur in diversas partes quantitativas, sic est falsa. Isti vero philosophi intelligebant animam esse partibilem secundum hunc modum. Et addebant plus, quod huiusmodi potentiae animae erant diversae animae.
          <td>205. Now this is partly true and partly false. if you take it to mean that the soul has different parts potentially, it is quite true that its parts and powers are distinct and that one of them understands and another senses. The soul is a whole in the sense that it has a total capacity with partial capacities subordinate to the whole. But if you take it quantitatively, as though the soul were of a certain size with parts of certain sizes, then this opinion is false. And this was how the philosophers in question thought of the soul—even to the extent that they made out the soul’s different powers to be different souls.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit quid igitur improbat philosophus opinionem praedictam per tres rationes: quarum prima talis est. Diversa non possunt uni convenire, nisi ab aliquo uniantur: si igitur sunt diversae animae in corpore, oportet quod ab aliquo contineantur et uniantur: sed nihil est quod uniat eas et contineat: ergo non sunt diversae. Et quod nihil sit continens et uniens animam, sic patet. Quia aut est corpus in quo est, aut aliquid aliud sed corpus non unit eam et continet, immo magis anima continet corpus. Videmus enim quod egrediente anima a corpore, corpus deficit et marcescit. Si autem aliquid aliud continet eam, tunc illud erit maxime anima, quia animae est continere et regere. Et si illud erit anima, tunc iterum oportebit quaerere utrum sit una, aut multipartium. Et si dicatur quod multipartium est, iterum erit quaestio quid uniat illud, et sic in infinitum. Si vero dicatur quod est unum, quare non dicunt mox id est ab ipso principio, quod anima sit unum? Non igitur anima est divisibilis in partes quantitativas, sicut ipsi dicunt.
          <td>206. Next, at ‘If then the soul’, Aristotle attacks this last hypothesis, with three arguments. The, first is this. Different things cannot be unified except by something else that unites them. If the one body contained several souls, these would have to be joined together and contained by something else. But there is nothing else that can do this; therefore the hypothesis is groundless. That there is no other unifying principle is shown thus. Whatever contains and unifies the soul will be either the body or some other thing. Now it is not the body. Rather, the body is contained and unified by its soul and falls to pieces when the soul leaves it. Then it is something else; but this must be a soul if it pertains especially the soul to unify and control. Is then this unifying soul itself intrinsically one, or made of several parts? If of several parts, then what unites them? And so on <i>ad infinitum</i> . But if this unifying soul is intrinsically one, then ‘why not call it the soul straight away’, i.e. why not concede at the beginning that the soul is intrinsically one? The soul, then, is not, as they thought, quantitatively divisible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit dubitabit autem quia si diversae partes animae sunt in diversis partibus corporis, sequitur quod cuilibet operationi animae sit determinata pars corporis, seu organum corporale. Sed hoc est impossibile, quia intellectus non habet determinatam partem seu organum in corpore. Non igitur anima habet diversas partes, sicut ipsi dicunt.
          <td>207. The second argument comes at ‘A further query’. If the different parts of the soul are in different parts of the body, then each soul-activity has its own corporeal part or organ. But the intellect has no special corporeal organ. Hence their conception of the soul’s parts is false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit cum dicit dicuntur autem quia si diversae operationes animae sunt in diversis partibus, tunc non erit invenire partem in qua sint plures operationes simul, nec erunt partes animalis similis speciei: sed nos invenimus partes aliquorum animatorum, quae habent plures operationes, et quorum anima est eiusdem speciei in toto et in partibus; sicut est in plantis et in quibusdam animalibus, quae decisa vivunt, sicut est in animalibus anulosis, quorum quaelibet pars decisa sentit et movetur in quoddam tempus. Et si dicatur quod non diu vivunt, non refert; quia non habent instrumenta, quibus salvent suam ipsorum naturam: nihilominus tamen existunt in partibus diversis plures operationes animae, et sunt similis speciei adinvicem, et etiam toti. Non ergo sunt diversae partes animae in diversis partibus corporis.
          <td>208. The third argument starts at ‘It is also held’. If each of the various activities of soul is proper to a special part of the body, then no one part is the organ of several distinct activities, nor are there several parts ‘in an animal’ body the same in kind. But experience proves that certain living things have parts with several activities each, and a soul that is identical in kind in the whole and in all the parts; e.g. in plants and in certain (segmented) animals ‘ which go on living after being cut up, the cut off parts retaining their feelings and movement for some time. It does not matter if these parts live for only a short time through lack of the organs of self-preservation. The point is that several soul-activities exist in several distinct corporeal parts at once, and the latter are specifically similar to each other and to the whole. Therefore the soul is not divided according to the different parts of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ratio autem, quare decisa vivunt, est, quia quanto anima est perfectior, tanto exercet plures perfectas operationes et diversas. Et ideo ad exercendum huiusmodi operationes, necessaria sunt ei plura et diversa organa vel instrumenta corporalia in corpore in quo est. Quia vero anima rationalis, quanto nobilior et perfectior est, tanto exigit maiorem diversitatem organorum; anima autem quae est in animalibus anulosis et in plantis, quia parum habet de perfectione, nec exercet diversas operationes, ideo requirit corpus magis simile et uniforme, et salvatur in qualibet parte.
          <td>The reason why such animals go on living after being divided is that the number and diversity of activities complete in themselves varies in direct proportion to the perfection of the soul in living things. The higher the soul, the wider is the range of its activities; and the wider its active range the more, and the more distinctly diversified, organs or bodily instruments are required by it. So the relatively greater nobility of the rational soul calls for a greater diversity of its bodily organs, whilst the far lower soul of a segmented animal or a plant has only a narrow field of activity and therefore needs a body that is more uniform and less articulated, and in any part of which, taken separately, it can maintain its being.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit videtur autem solvit secundam quaestionem. Circa quod sciendum est quod vivere proprie est eorum quae habent motum et operationem ex seipsis, sine hoc quod moveantur ab aliis. Unde et vivere dupliciter accipitur. Uno modo accipitur vivere, quod est esse viventis, sicut dicit philosophus, quod vivere est esse viventibus. Alio modo vivere est operatio.
          <td>209. Then, at ‘It would seem’, he answers the second question; concerning which we must realise that life belongs, properly speaking, to things that move and act of themselves and are not caused to do so by others. So ‘to live’ has two meanings. It can mean the being of a living thing, and in this sense Aristotle says that living is the being of living things. And also it can mean activity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum ergo quod anima quae est in plantis, scilicet vegetabilis, videtur esse quasi quoddam principium, quod manifestat vitam in rebus inferioribus, quia sine hac nihil vivit, et in hac sola communicant omnia quae vivunt, in aliis autem non omnia. Animalia enim et plantae in vegetabili conveniunt solummodo. Item vegetabile potest esse sine sensibili et intelligibili, sed haec non possunt esse sine vegetabili. Nullum enim animal habet sensum seu intellectum sine hoc scilicet vegetabili. Ergo sic vivere attribuitur isti principio, scilicet vegetabili, sicut sentire tactui. Non tamen quod animal per solam vegetabilem vivat, sed quia est primum principium in quo manifestatur vita.
          <td>210. Now the soul of plants, the vegetative soul, seems to be a sort of primary manifestation of life among things here on earth; for nothing lives without it and all living things share in it, though in other ways their modes of life differ. Animals and plants have only this in common. It can exist without sense or intelligence, but not sense or intelligence without it; no animal has sense or reason except it first have vegetative life. Thus it bears the same relation to life as touch to sensation. Not that living things only live by this principle, but it is the point where life first appears.

            <td>Hitherto we have spoken of what our predecessors handed down to us about the soul. But let us now re-open the enquiry from the beginning and endeavour to determine what the soul is and what is its most comprehensive definition. § 211
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>2. λέγομεν δὴ γένος ἕν τι τῶν ὄντων τὴν οὐσίαν, ταύτης δὲ τὸ μέν, ὡς ὕλην, ὃ καθ' αὑτὸ οὐκ ἔστι τόδε τι, ἕτερον δὲ μορφὴν καὶ εἶδος, καθ' ἣν ἤδη λέγεται τόδε τι, καὶ τρίτον τὸ ἐκ τούτων. ἔστι δ' ἡ μὲν ὕλη δύναμις, τὸ δ' εἶδος ἐντελέχεια, καὶ τοῦτο διχῶς, τὸ μὲν ὡς ἐπιστήμη, τὸ δ' ὡς τὸ θεωρεῖν.
            <td>Now, we say that one of the kinds of things that are is substance. Of this, there is one element, matter, which of itself is no particular thing; another, the form or species according to which it is called ‘this particular thing’; and a third, that which is from both of these. Matter is, indeed, potency, and the form, act; and this latter has two modes of being, one, like knowledge possessed, the other, like the act of knowing. §§ 212-16
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>412a.11 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. οὐσίαι δὲ μάλιστ' εἶναι δοκοῦσι τὰ σώματα, καὶ τούτων τὰ φυσικά· ταῦτα γὰρ τῶν ἄλλων ἀρχαί. τῶν δὲ φυσικῶν τὰ μὲν ἔχει ζωήν, τὰ δ' οὐκ ἔχει· ζωὴν δὲ λέγομεν τὴν δι' αὑτοῦ τροφήν τε καὶ αὔξησιν καὶ φθίσιν.
            <td>Bodies especially seem to be substances; and, among these, natural bodies, for these are the principle’s of the others. Of natural bodies, some possess vitality, others do not. We mean by ‘possessing vitality’, that a thing can nourish itself and grow and decay. §§ 217-19
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>ὥστε πᾶν σῶμα φυσικὸν μετέχον ζωῆς οὐσία ἂν εἴη, οὐσία δ' οὕτως ὡς συνθέτη. 4. ἐπεὶ δ' ἐστὶ καὶ σῶμα καὶ τοιόνδε, ζωὴν γὰρ ἔχον, οὐκ ἂν εἴη σῶμα ἡ ψυχή· οὐ γάρ ἐστι τῶν καθ' ὑποκειμένου τὸ σῶμα, μᾶλλον δ' ὡς ὑποκείμενον καὶ ὕλη. ἀναγκαῖον ἄρα τὴν ψυχὴν οὐσίαν εἶναι ὡς εἶδος σώματος φυσικοῦ δυνάμει ζωὴν ἔχοντος. ἡ δ' οὐσία ἐντελέχεια· τοιούτου ἄρα σώματος ἐντελέχεια.
            <td>Therefore every natural body sharing in life will be a substance, and this substance will be in some way composite. Since, however, it is a body of such and such a nature, i.e. having vitality, the soul will not itself be the body. For the body is not one of the factors existing in the subject; rather, it is as the subject and the matter. It is necessary, then, that the soul be a substance in the sense of the specifying principle of a physical body potentially alive. Now, substance [in this sense] is act; it will therefore be the act of a body of this sort. §§ 220-6
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>5. αὕτη δὲ λέγεται διχῶς, ἡ μὲν ὡς ἐπιστήμη, ἡ δ' ὡς τὸ θεωρεῖν. φανερὸν οὖν ὅτι ὡς ἐπιστήμη· ἐν γὰρ τῷ ὑπάρχειν τὴν ψυχὴν καὶ ὕπνος καὶ ἐγρήγορσίς ἐστιν, ἀνάλογον δ' ἡ μὲν ἐγρήγορσις τῷ θεωρεῖν, ὁ δ' ὕπνος τῷ ἔχειν καὶ μὴ ἐνεργεῖν· προτέρα δὲ τῇ γενέσει ἐπὶ τοῦ αὐτοῦ ἡ ἐπιστήμη. διὸ ἡ ψυχή ἐστιν ἐντελέχεια ἡ πρώτη σώματος φυσικοῦ δυνάμει ζωὴν ἔχοντος. 412b
            <td>Now this can mean one of two things: one, as is the possession of knowledge; another, as is the act of knowing. It is plain that it is like knowledge possessed. For the soul remains in the body whether one is asleep or awake. Being awake is comparable to the act of knowing, sleep to possession without use. Now knowledge possessed is prior in the order of generation, in one and the same thing. The soul, therefore, is the primary act of a physical body capable of life. §§ 227-9
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>6. τοιοῦτον δὲ ὃ ἂν ᾖ ὀργανικόν. (ὄργανα δὲ καὶ τὰ τῶν φυτῶν μέρη, ἀλλὰ παντελῶς ἁπλᾶ, οἷον τὸ φύλλον περικαρπίου σκέπασμα, τὸ δὲ περικάρπιον καρποῦ· αἱ δὲ ῥίζαι τῷ στόματι ἀνάλογον· ἄμφω γὰρ ἕλκει τὴν τροφήν.)
            <td>Such a body will be organic. Parts of plants, indeed, are organs, though very elementary—the leaf is the covering of the pericarp and the pericarp of the fruit: roots, too, are like mouths, for both draw in nourishment. §§ 230-2

            <td>If then there is anyone generalisation to be made for any and every soul, the soul will be the primary act of a physical bodily organism. § 233

            <td>Hence it is unnecessary to enquire whether the soul and body be one, any more than whether the wax and an impression made in it are one; or in general, the matter of anything whatever, and that of which it is the matter. For while one and being are predicated in many ways, that which is properly so is actuality, § 234

          <br>
          LECTIO 1</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam Aristoteles posuit opinionem aliorum de anima in primo libro, in secundo accedit ad determinandum de anima secundum propriam opinionem et veritatem. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo dicit de quo est intentio sua, continuans se ad praecedentia. Secundo prosequitur suam intentionem, ibi, dicimus itaque quoddam et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod in primo libro dicta sunt ea quae tradita sunt a prioribus de anima. Sed oportet iterum quasi redeundo a principio determinare veritatem. Quod quidem propter suam difficultatem magis oportet tentare, quam securitatem de veritate invenienda praesumere. Et cum supra in prooemio quaesitum fuerit, utrum prius de anima ipsa determinandum sit, aut de partibus eius, quasi hanc quaestionem determinans, dicit, quod in principio dicendum est, quid est anima, in quo notificatur ipsa animae essentia. Postea autem determinabitur de partibus sive potentiis ipsius. Et quasi huiusmodi rationem assignans, subiungit, et quae utique erit communissima ratio ipsius. Cum enim ostenditur quid est anima, traditur id quod est commune. Cum autem determinatur de unaquaque partium aut potentiarum ipsius, traditur id quod est speciale circa animam. Hic est autem ordo doctrinae, ut a communibus ad minus communia procedatur, sicut ostendit philosophus in principio physicorum.
          <td>211. Having reviewed, in Book One, other men’s opinions on the soul, Aristotle now begins Book Two of his Treatise, in which he sets out what he himself holds on the matter. First, then, linking up with what has gone before, he states his general aim; I and secondly, at ‘Now we say that one’, he starts to carry it out. He begins by saying that despite all the previous accounts of the soul it is necessary to go into the whole matter again from the beginning. The subject is so difficult that it is wiser to assume that the truth about it has not yet been discovered. And in answer to the question raised in the Introduction to Book One, whether one should first define the soul, and afterwards its parts, he decides now to define the essence of the soul before coming to conclusions about its parts. As though explaining this decision, he adds that we shall thus have acquired the most comprehensive idea of soul. For the definition of the soul itself comprises what is most common or general, whereas that of each of its parts or potencies comprises only some special aspect of it. And as he explains at the beginning of the Physics, the right way to teach is to begin with what is most general and end with precisions in detail.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit dicimus itaque prosequitur suam intentionem quam proposuerat. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima ostendit quid est anima. In secunda determinat de partibus sive potentiis eius, ibi, potentiarum autem animae et cetera. Prima dividitur in duas. In prima ponit definitionem animae, quae est quasi demonstrationis conclusio. In secunda ponit definitionem animae quae est quasi demonstrationis principium, ibi, quoniam autem ex incertis quidem et cetera. Sciendum est enim quod, sicut dicitur in primo posteriorum, omnis definitio aut est conclusio demonstrationis, sicut haec, tonitruum est continuus sonus in nubibus, aut est demonstrationis principium, sicut haec, tonitruum est extinctio ignis in nube, aut est demonstratio positione, idest ordine differens: sicut haec, tonitruum est continuus sonus in nubibus, propter extinctionem ignis in nube. In hac enim ponitur et demonstrationis conclusio, et principium, etsi non secundum ordinem syllogismi.
          <td>212. Beginning then at ‘Now we say’, his treatment divides into two parts, in the first of which he-shows what soul in general is, and in the second, starting at ‘Of the soul’s powers’, what are its parts or powers. The first part subdivides into (a) a definition that concludes, and (b) one that introduces, a demonstrative argument;—this latter part comes at ‘Since it is from the less clear’. Note in passing that any definition, as he says in Book I of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> , is either the conclusion of a demonstration, e.g. ‘Thunder is a continuous noise in the clouds’, or it is the demonstration’s starting point, e.g. ‘Thunder is the extinction of fire in the clouds’, or it is the demonstration itself, but thrown into a different order, e.g. ‘Thunder is a continuous noise etc., caused by the extinction of fire etc.’ in which the conclusion and the starting point both appear, though not in syllogistic order.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Prima autem pars dividitur in duas. In prima ponit definitionem primam animae. In secunda manifestat eam, ibi universaliter igitur dictum et cetera. Prima dividitur in duas. In prima praemittit quasdam divisiones, ex quibus habetur via ad investigandum definitionem animae. In secunda investigat animae definitionem, ibi, quare omne corpus et cetera.
          <td>As to (a), it includes first a definition of the soul, and then, at ‘It has been stated then’, an explanation of the definition. And to clear the ground before the defining proper begins (at ‘Therefore every natural body’), he makes some preliminary distinctions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum autem est, quod sicut docet philosophus in septimo metaphysicae, haec est differentia inter definitionem substantiae et accidentis, quod in definitione substantiae nihil ponitur quod sit extra substantiam definiti: definitur enim unaquaeque substantia per sua principia materialia vel formalia. In definitione autem accidentis ponitur aliquid quod est extra essentiam definiti, scilicet subiectum; oportet enim subiectum poni in definitione accidentis. Sicut cum dicitur simitas est curvitas nasi. Et hoc ideo est, quia definitio significat quod quid est res; substantia autem est quid completum in suo esse et in sua specie; accidens autem non habet esse completum, sed dependens a substantia. Similiter etiam nulla forma est quid completum in specie, sed complementum speciei competit substantiae compositae. Unde substantia composita sic definitur, quod in eius definitione non ponitur aliquid quod sit extra essentiam eius. In omni autem definitione formae ponitur aliquid, quod est extra essentiam formae, scilicet proprium subiectum eius sive materia. Unde, cum anima sit forma, oportet quod in definitione eius ponatur materia sive subiectum eius.
          <td>213. It should be noted here that, according to the teaching of Book VII of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , there is this difference between defining substance and defining accidents that in the former case nothing extrinsic is included: every substance is defined in terms merely of its material and formal principles; but in the latter case something extrinsic to the thing defined is referred to, i.e. the subject of the accidents in question—as when one defines snubness as ‘curvature of the nose’. The reason is that a definition must express what a thing is, and while substance is something complete in its being and kind, accidents have being only in relation to a substance. In the same way no form as such is complete in kind; completeness in this sense belongs only to the substance composed of form and matter; so that the latter’s definition is complete without reference to anything else, whilst that of the form has to include d, reference to its proper subject which is matter. Hence, if the soul is a form its definition will not be complete without reference to its subject or matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo in prima parte ponit duas divisiones; quarum prima necessaria est ad investigandum id quod in definitione animae ponitur ad exprimendam essentiam eius. Alia quae est necessaria ad investigandum id quod ponitur in definitione animae ad exprimendum subiectum ipsius, ibi, substantiae autem maxime et cetera. Circa primum innuit tres divisiones: quarum prima est secundum quod ens dividitur in decem praedicamenta. Et hanc innuit per hoc quod dicit, quod substantia dicitur esse unum genus entium.
          <td>214. So, in the first part of this section, he makes certain distinctions, first in view of the work of defining the soul’s essence, and then, at ‘Bodies especially seem to be substances,’ in view of defining its subject. As regards the former point he alludes to three distinctions, of which the first is that of being into the ten categories; this he hints at when he says that substance is reckoned to be ‘one of the kinds of things that are’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda divisio est secundum quod substantia dividitur in materiam et formam et compositum. Materia quidem est, quae secundum se non est hoc aliquid, sed in potentia tantum ut sit hoc aliquid. Forma autem est, secundum quam iam est hoc aliquid in actu. Substantia vero composita est, quae est hoc aliquid. Dicitur enim esse hoc aliquid, id est aliquid demonstratum quod est completum in esse et specie; et hoc convenit soli substantiae compositae in rebus materialibus. Nam substantiae separatae, quamvis non sint compositae ex materia et forma, sunt tamen hoc aliquid, cum sint subsistens in actu et completae in natura sua. Anima autem rationalis, quantum ad aliquid potest dici hoc aliquid, secundum hoc quod potest esse per se subsistens. Sed quia non habet speciem completam, sed magis est pars speciei, non omnino convenit ei quod sit hoc aliquid.
          <td>215. The second distinction alluded to is that of substance into matter, form and the compound of both. Matter is that which is not as such a ‘particular thing’ but is in mere potency to become a ‘particular thing’. Form is that by which a ‘particular thing’ actually exists. And the compound is ‘the particular thing’ itself; for that is said to be a ‘particular thing’ (i.e. something you can point to) which is complete in being and in kind; and among material things only the compound is such. For although immaterial substances are not compounds of matter and form, still they are particular things, having actual existence in themselves, and being complete in their own nature. Not so the rational soul; for though it has the existence in itself which belongs to a ‘particular thing’, it is not a complete nature by itself; it is rather a part of a specific nature. Hence it is not in all respects a ‘particular thing’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est ergo differentia inter materiam et formam, quod materia est ens in potentia, forma autem est endelechia, id est actus, quo scilicet materia fit actu, unde ipsum compositum est ens actu.
          <td>Matter, then, differs from form in this, that it is potential being; form is the ‘entelechy’ or actuality that renders matter actual; and the compound is the resulting actual being.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertia divisio est quod actus dicitur dupliciter. Uno modo sicut scientia est actus. Alio modo sicut considerare est actus. Et differentia horum actuum ex potentiis perpendi potest. Dicitur enim aliquis in potentia grammaticus, antequam acquirat habitum grammaticae, discendo vel inveniendo: quae quidem potentia in actum reducitur, quando iam aliquis habet habitum scientiae. Sed tunc est iterum in potentia ad usum habitus, cum non considerat in actu; et haec potentia in actum reducitur cum actu considerat. Sic igitur et scientia est actus, et consideratio est actus.
          <td>216. Thirdly, he distinguishes two senses of the term ‘act’. In one sense knowledge is an act, in the other thinking is an act; and the difference can be understood by relating these acts to their potencies. Before one acquires the grammatical habit and becomes a grammarian, whether self-taught or led by another, one is only potentially so; and this potency is actualised by the habit. But once the habit is acquired one is still in potency to the use of it, so long as one is not actually thinking about grammar; and this thinking is a further actualisation. In this sense, then, knowledge is one act and thinking another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit substantiae autem ponit divisiones, ex quibus investigatur id quod ponitur in definitione animae, pertinens ad eius subiectum. Et innuit tres divisiones. Quarum prima est, quod substantiarum quaedam sunt corpora, quaedam non sunt corpora. Inter quas substantias maxime sunt manifestae corporales substantiae. Nam substantiae incorporeae, quaecumque sint, immanifestae sunt, eo quod sunt a sensibus remotae et sola ratione investigabiles. Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod corpora maxime videntur esse substantiae.
          <td>217. Then at ‘Bodies especially’ he alludes to three distinctions which are presupposed by his enquiry into the meaning of the definition of the soul, so far as the subject endowed with soul is concerned. The first is the distinction between corporeal and incorporeal substances. Now the former are the most evident to us: for, whatever the latter may be in themselves, they do not impinge on our senses, but are only discoverable by an exercise of the reason. Hence he says that ‘bodies especially seem to be substances’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda divisio est, quod corporum, quaedam sunt corpora physica, id est naturalia; quaedam non naturalia, sed artificialia. Homo enim et lignum et lapis sunt naturalia corpora, domus et securis sunt artificialia. Magis autem videntur substantiae corpora naturalia quam artificialia, quia corpora naturalia sunt principia artificialium. Ars enim operatur ex materia quam natura ministrat; forma autem quae per artem inducitur, est forma accidentalis, sicut figura vel aliquid huiusmodi. Unde corpora artificialia non sunt in genere substantiae per suam formam, sed solum per suam materiam, quae est naturalis. Habent ergo a corporibus naturalibus quod sint substantiae. Unde corpora naturalia sunt magis substantiae quam corpora artificialia: sunt enim substantiae non solum ex parte materiae, sed etiam ex parte formae.
          <td>218. The next distinction, is between physical or natural bodies and artificial bodies. Man and wood and stone are natural bodies, but a house or a saw is artificial. And of these the natural bodies seem to be the more properly called substances, since artificial bodies are made out of them. Art works upon materials furnished by nature, giving these, moreover, a merely accidental form, such as a new shape and so forth; so that it is only in virtue of their matter, not their form, that artificial bodies are substances at all; they are substances because natural bodies are such. Natural bodies therefore are the more properly called substances, being such through their form as well as through their matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertia divisio est, quod corporum naturalium, quaedam habent vitam, et quaedam non habent. Illud autem dicitur habere vitam, quod per seipsum habet alimentum, augmentum et decrementum. Sciendum autem est, quod haec explanatio magis est per modum exempli, quam per modum definitionis. Non enim ex hoc solo quod aliquid habet augmentum et decrementum, vivit, sed etiam ex hoc quod sentit et intelligit, et alia opera vitae exercere potest. Unde in substantiis separatis est vita ex hoc quod habent intellectum et voluntatem, ut patet in undecimo metaphysicae, licet non sit in eis augmentum et alimentum. Sed quia in istis generabilibus et corruptibilibus anima, quae est in plantis, ad quam pertinent alimentum et augmentum, ut in fine primi dictum est, principium est vitae, ideo hic quasi exemplariter exposuit habens vitam, id quod habet alimentum et augmentum. Propria autem ratio vitae est ex hoc, quod aliquid est natum movere seipsum, large accipiendo motum, prout etiam intellectualis operatio motus quidam dicitur. Ea enim sine vita esse dicimus, quae ab exteriori tantum principio moveri possunt.
          <td>219. Thirdly, he distinguishes between living and non-living natural bodies; and the living are those which of themselves take nutriment and grow and decay. Note here that this is said by way of example rather than definition. For, besides growth and decay, living things may exhibit sensation and intellectual knowledge and other vital activities. Immaterial substances, as is proved in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book XI, have the life of intellect and volition, though they cannot grow and do not take food. But because, in the sphere of things that are born and die, the plant-soul (the principle of nutrition and growth) marks the point where life begins, this soul is here taken as the type of all living things. However, life is essentially that by which anything has power to move itself, taking movement in its wide sense so as to include the ‘movement’ or activity of the intellect. For we call those things inanimate which are moved only from outside.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quare omne investigat animae definitionem, suppositis praemissis divisionibus. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo investigat partes definitionis. Secundo ponit definitionem, ibi, si autem aliquod commune et cetera. Tertio ex definitione data, excludit quamdam dubitationem, ibi, unde non oportet quaerere et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo investigat particulas definitionis, quae pertinent ad essentiam animae. Secundo ea quae pertinent ad essentiam subiecti. Tale autem quodcumque organicum. Circa primum duo facit. Primo investigat hanc particulam, quod anima est actus. Secundo hanc, quod est actus primus, ibi, hic autem dicitur dupliciter.
          <td>220. After this, at ‘Therefore every natural body” he begins to define the soul, presupposing the distinctions already made. And his enquiry here has three parts: (a) he enquires into the elements of the definition taken separately; (b) at, ‘If, then, there is any one generalisation’, he states his definition; and (c) at ‘Hence it is unnecessary’, he uses it to refute an objection. As to (a) he first deals with the elements that refer to the soul’s essence, and then to those that refer to its subject, at ‘Such a body will be organic’, and in the part that concerns the essence he considers first the statement that the soul is an ‘act’, and then, at ‘Now this can mean one of two things’. that it is a ‘primary act’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Concludit ergo primo ex praedictis, quod cum corpora physica maxime videantur esse substantiae, et omne corpus habens vitam, sit corpus physicum, necesse est dicere quod omne corpus habens vitam sit substantia. Et cum sit ens actu, necesse est quod sit substantia composita. Quia vero, cum dico, corpus habens vitam, duo dico, scilicet quod est corpus et quod est huiusmodi corpus, scilicet habens vitam, non potest dici quod illa pars corporis habentis vitam, quae dicitur corpus, sit anima. Per animam enim intelligimus id, quo habens vitam vivit: unde oportet quod intelligatur sicut aliquid in subiecto existens; ut accipiatur hic large subiectum, non solum prout subiectum dicitur aliquid ens actu, per quem modum accidens dicitur esse in subiecto; sed etiam secundum quod materia prima, quae est ens in potentia, dicitur subiectum. Corpus autem, quod recipit vitam, magis est sicut subiectum et materia quam sicut aliquid in subiecto existens.
          <td>Aristotle’s first conclusion, then, in line with what has been said already, is that if physical bodies are substances in the fullest sense, all living bodies are substances too, for they are physical bodies. And as each living body is an actual being, it must be a compound substance. But just because to say ‘living body’ is to imply two things, the body itself and that modification of body by which it is alive, it cannot be said that the element in the composition referred to by the term body is itself the principle of life or the ‘soul’. By ‘soul’ we understand that by which a living thing is alive; it is understood, therefore, as existing in a subject, taking ‘subject’ in a broad sense to include not only those actual beings which are subjects of their accidental modifications, but also bare matter or potential being. On the other hand the body that receives life is more like a subject and a matter than a modification existing in a subject.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur, cum sit triplex substantia, scilicet compositum, materia, et forma, et anima non est ipsum compositum, quod est corpus habens vitam: neque est materia, quae est corpus subiectum vitae: relinquitur, per locum a divisione, quod anima sit substantia, sicut forma vel species talis corporis, scilicet corporis physici habentis in potentia vitam.
          <td>221. Since, then, there are three sorts of substance: the compound; matter; and form; and since the soul is neither the compound-the living body itself; nor its matter—the body as the subject that receives life; we have no choice but to say that the soul is a substance in the manner of a form that determines or characterises a particular sort of body, i.e. a physical body potentially alive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dixit autem habentis vitam potentia et non simpliciter habentis vitam. Nam corpus habens vitam intelligitur substantia composita vivens. Compositum autem non ponitur in definitione formae. Materia autem corporis vivi est id quod comparatur ad vitam sicut potentia ad actum: et hoc est anima, actus, secundum quem corpus vivit. Sicut si dicerem quod figura est actus, non quidem corporis figurati in actu, hoc enim est compositum ex figura et corpore, sed corporis quod est subiectum figurae, quod comparatur ad figuram sicut potentia ad actum.
          <td>222. Note that he does not say simply ‘alive’, but ‘potentially alive’. For by a body actually alive is understood a living compound; and no compound as such can enter into the definition of a form. On the other hand the matter of a living body stands to the body’s life as a potency to its act; and the soul is precisely the actuality whereby the body has life. It is as though we were to say that shape is an actuality; it is not exactly the actuality of an actually shaped body—i.e. the compound of body and shape—but rather of the body as able to receive a shape, of the body as in potency to an actual shape.

          <td>Et ne aliquis crederet quod anima sic esset actus sicut aliqua forma accidentalis actus est, ad hoc removendum, subdit quod anima est sic actus, sicut substantia est actus, id est sicut forma. Et quia omnis forma est in determinata materia, sequitur quod sit forma talis corporis, quale dictum est.
          <td>§.223. But lest it be thought that soul is an actuality in the manner of any merely accidental form, he adds that it is a substantial actuality or form. And since every form has the matter proper to it, the soul must actualise just this special sort of body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum autem est quod haec est differentia formae substantialis ad formam accidentalem, quod forma accidentalis non facit ens actu simpliciter, sed ens actu tale vel tantum, utputa magnum vel album vel aliquid aliud huiusmodi. Forma autem substantialis facit esse actu simpliciter. Unde forma accidentalis advenit subiecto iam praeexistenti actu. Forma autem substantialis non advenit subiecto iam praeexistenti in actu, sed existenti in potentia tantum, scilicet materiae primae. Ex quo patet, quod impossibile est unius rei esse plures formas substantiales; quia prima faceret ens actu simpliciter, et omnes aliae advenirent subiecto iam existenti in actu, unde accidentaliter advenirent subiecto iam existenti in actu, non enim facerent ens actu simpliciter sed secundum quid.
          <td>224. The difference between accidental form and substantial form is that whereas the former does not make a thing simply be, but only makes it be in this or that mode—e.g. as quantified, or white— the substantial form gives it simple being. Hence the accidental form presupposes an already existing subject; but the substantial form presupposes only potentiality to existence, i.e. bare matter. That is why there cannot be more than one substantial form in any one thing; the first makes the thing an actual being; and if others are added, they confer only accidental modifications, since they presuppose the subject already in act of being.

          <td>Per quod tollitur positio Avicebron in libro fontis vitae, qui posuit quod secundum ordinem generum et specierum est ordo plurium formarum substantialium in una et eadem re; ut puta quod in hoc individuo hominis est una forma, per quam est substantia: et alia, per quam est corpus: et tertia, per quam est animatum corpus, et sic de aliis. Oportet enim secundum praemissa dicere, quod una et eadem forma substantialis sit, per quam hoc individuum est hoc aliquid, sive substantia, et per quam est corpus et animatum corpus, et sic de aliis. Forma enim perfectior dat materiae hoc quod dat forma minus perfecta, et adhuc amplius. Unde anima non solum facit esse substantiam et corpus, quod etiam facit forma lapidis, sed etiam facit esse animatum corpus. Non ergo sic est intelligendum quod anima sit actus corporis, et quod corpus sit eius materia et subiectum, quasi corpus sit constitutum per unam formam, quae faciat ipsum esse corpus, et superveniat ei anima faciens ipsum esse corpus vivum; sed quia ab anima est, et quod sit, et quod sit corpus vivum. Sed hoc quod est esse corpus, quod est imperfectius, est quid materiale respectu vitae.
          <td>225. We can therefore reject the view of Avicebron (in the Book called <i>Fons Vitae</i> ) that according to the way in which any given thing can be divided into genera and species so it can be divided into substantial forms. Thus an individual man would have one form that made him a substance, another that gave him a body, another that gave him life, and so on. But what our premises compel us to say is that it is one and the same substantial form that makes a man a particular thing or substance, and a bodily thing, and a living thing, and so on. For the higher form can give to its matter all that a lower form gives, and more; the soul gives not only substance and body (as a stone’s form does) but life also. We must not think, therefore, of the soul and body as though the body had its own form making it a body, to which a soul is superadded, making it a living body; but rather that the body gets both its being and its life from the soul. This is not to deny, however, that bodily being as such is, in its imperfection, material with respect to life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et inde est quod recedente anima, non remanet idem corpus specie; nam oculus et caro in mortuo non dicuntur nisi aequivoce, ut patet per philosophum in septimo metaphysicorum. Recedente enim anima, succedit alia forma substantialis quae dat aliud esse specificum, cum corruptio unius non sit sine generatione alterius.
          <td>226. Therefore, when life departs the body is not left specifically the same; the eyes and flesh of a dead man, as is shown in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book VII, are only improperly called eyes and flesh. When the soul leaves the body another substantial form takes its place; for a passing-away always involves a concomitant coming-to-be.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit hic autem venatur secundam particulam definitionis: et dicit quod actus dicitur dupliciter: alius, sicut scientia, et alius sicut considerare, ut supra expositum est. Et manifestum est, quod anima est actus sicut scientia, quia in hoc quod anima inest animali et somnus et vigilia. Et vigilia quidem assimilatur considerationi; quia sicut consideratio est usus scientiae, ita vigilia est usus sensuum; sed somnus assimilatur habitui scientiae, quando aliquis secundum ipsum non operatur, in somno enim quiescunt virtutes animales.
          <td>227. Then, at ‘Now this can mean’, he examines the second term in the definition. He observes that there are two kinds of actuality, as we explained above, the kind that is like knowledge and the kind like thinking. And clearly the soul is of the former kind; for it is due to the soul that an animal is able to be both awake and asleep; and while waking is similar to thinking (for it is a use of the exterior senses just as thinking is a use of knowledge already possessed), sleep is more like the knowledge which lies dormant in the mind so long as it is not actually being used; for in sleep an animal’s faculties are quiescent.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Horum autem duorum actuum, scientia est prior generatione, in eodem. Comparatur enim consideratio ad scientiam, sicut actus ad potentiam. Actus autem, ut habetur in nono metaphysicae, natura est prior potentia. Est enim finis et complementum potentiae. Sed ordine generationis et temporis, universaliter loquendo actus est prior potentia. Nam id quod est in potentia, reducitur in actum per aliquid ens actu. Sed in uno et eodem potentia est prior actu. Nam aliquid est primo in potentia, et postea actus fit. Et propter hoc dicit quod scientia est prior generatione, in eodem, quam consideratio.
          <td>228. Now, of these two actualities, knowledge comes first in the order of coming-to-be in the same person; for it stands to thinking as potency to act. But in the order of nature or essence act is prior to potency (see the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book IX) as the end and complete perfection of potency. And even in the temporal order of coming-to-be, act, in a quite general sense, is prior; for the potential is actualised only by something already in act. But in this or that particular thing considered in itself potentiality may come first; the thing may be actualised by degrees. Hence his remark that ‘knowledge... is prior (i.e. to thinking) in the order of generation in one and the same thing’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde concludit quod cum anima sit actus sicut scientia, quod sit actus primus corporis physici potentia vitam habentis. Sciendum autem quod philosophus dicit animam esse actum primum, non solum ut distinguat animam ab actu qui est operatio, sed etiam ut distinguat eam a formis elementorum, quae semper habent suam actionem, nisi impediantur.
          <td>229. So he concludes that soul is the primary act of a physical body potentially alive, where act means the same sort of actuality as knowledge. He says primary act, not only to distinguish soul from its subsequent activities, but also to distinguish it from the forms of the elements; for these retain their own proper activities, unless impeded.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit tale autem venatur particulam, quae est ex parte subiecti: et quia dixerat, quod anima est actus corporis physici habentis vitam in potentia, etiam dicit, quod tale est omne corpus organicum. Et dicitur corpus organicum, quod habet diversitatem organorum. Diversitas autem organorum necessaria est in corpore suscipiente vitam propter diversas operationes animae. Anima enim, cum sit forma perfectissima inter formas rerum corporalium, est principium diversarum operationum; et ideo requirit diversitatem organorum in suo perfectibili. Formae vero rerum inanimatarum, propter sui imperfectionem sunt principia paucarum operationum: unde non exigunt diversitatem organorum in suis perfectionibus.
          <td>230. Next, at ‘Such a body’ he examines that part of the definition which has to do with the soul’s subject, observing that the ‘physical body’ referred to is any organic body, i.e. any body equipped with the various organs required by a living body in consequence of the life-principle’s various vital activities. For from this principle (the soul) which is the richest of embodied forms, spring many different activities, so that it requires, in the matter informed by it, a full equipment of different organs. Not so the less perfect forms of inanimate things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Inter animas autem anima plantarum imperfectior invenitur: unde in plantis minor est diversitas organorum quam in animalibus. Et ideo ad ostendendum, quod omne corpus suscipiens vitam est organicum, accipit argumentum ex plantis in quibus est minor diversitas organorum. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod etiam plantarum partes sunt diversa organa. Sed partes plantarum sunt penitus simplices, idest consimiles; non enim est in eis tanta diversitas, sicut in partibus animalium. Pes enim animalis ex diversis partibus compositus est, scilicet carne, nervo, osse, et huiusmodi. Sed partes organicae plantarum non habent talem diversitatem partium, ex quibus componantur.
          <td>231. Now plants, the least perfect of animate things, exhibit less organic diversity than animals. That is why Aristotle chooses plants to illustrate his assertion that every animate body is organic, saying that even plants have organically diversified parts. But these parts are very simple, i.e. like to one another; they lack the differentiation that we find in animals. Thus the foot of an animal is made up of different parts, flesh, nerves, bones and so forth, but the organs of plants are composed of less diverse sets of parts.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod partes plantarum sint organicae, manifestat per hoc, quod diversae partes sunt ad diversas operationes. Sicut folium est ad cooperimentum corticis vel fructiferi, id est illius partis in qua fructus nascitur. Cortex autem vel fructiferum, ad cooperimentum fructus. Radices autem in plantis sunt proportionabiles ori animalium, quia utraque attrahunt alimentum, scilicet radix in plantis, et os in animalibus.
          <td>232. The organic character of the parts of plants is displayed in their diverse functions. Thus a leaf functions as a covering for the pericarp, or fruit-bearing part, i.e. for the part in which the fruit is born. The pericarp, again, protects the fruit itself. So too the roots have a function in a plant similar to that of the mouth in an animal; they draw in nourishment.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit si autem colligit ex omnibus praedictis definitionem animae; et dicit, quod si aliqua definitio communis debeat assignari, quae conveniat omni animae, erit haec, anima est actus primus corporis physici organici. Non autem oportet addere, potentia vitam habentis. Loco enim huius ponitur organicum, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>233. Next, at ‘if, then,’ he gathers all these observations into one definition, saying that if any definition covers all types of ‘soul’ it will be this: <i>the soul is the primary actuality of a physical bodily organism</i> . He does not need to add ‘having life potentially’; for this is implied in ‘organism’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit unde non ex definitione data, solvit quamdam dubitationem. Fuit enim a multis dubitatum, quomodo ex anima et corpore fieret unum. Et quidam ponebant aliqua media esse, quibus anima corpori uniretur, et quodammodo colligaretur. Sed haec dubitatio iam locum non habet, cum ostensum sit, quod anima sit forma corporis. Et hoc est quod dicit quod non oportet quaerere si ex anima et corpore fit unum, sicut nec dubitatur circa ceram et figuram, neque omnino circa aliquam materiam et formam, cuius est materia. Ostensum est enim in octavo metaphysicae quod forma per se unitur materiae, sicut actus eius; et idem est materiam uniri formae, quod materiam esse in actu. Et hoc est etiam quod hic dicit, quod cum unum et ens multipliciter dicatur, scilicet de ente in potentia, et de ente in actu, id quod proprie est ens et unum est actus. Nam sicut ens in potentia non est ens simpliciter, sed secundum quid, ita non est unum simpliciter sed secundum quid: sic enim dicitur aliquid unum sicut et ens. Et ideo sicut corpus habet esse per animam, sicut per formam, ita et unitur animae immediate, inquantum anima est forma corporis. Sed inquantum est motor, nihil prohibet aliquid esse medium, prout una pars movetur ab anima, mediante alia.
          <td>234. Then at ‘Hence it is’ he applies this definition to solve a difficulty. There had been much uncertainty about the way the soul and body are conjoined. Some had supposed a sort of medium connecting the two together by a sort of bond. But the difficulty can be set aside now that it has been shown that the soul is the form of the body. As he says, there is no more reason to ask whether soul and body together make one thing than to ask the same about wax and the impression sealed on it, or about any other matter and its form. For, as is shown in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book VIII, form is directly related to matter as the actuality of matter; once matter actually is it is informed. Moreover, although, as he goes on to say, being and unity are variously predicated (in one way of potential, and in another way of actual, being), that is primarily and properly a being and a unity which has actuality. just as potential being is only a being under a certain aspect, so it is only a unity under a certain aspect; for unity follows being. Therefore, just as the body gets its being from the soul, as from its form, so too it makes a unity with this soul to which it is immediately related. If, on the other hand, we regard the soul in its function as the mover of the body, then there is no reason why it should not move by means of a medium, moving one part of the body by means of another.

            <td>It has been stated, then, what the soul in general is. It is ‘substance’ as definable form; and this means what is the essence of such a kind of body. If some utensil, for example an axe, were a natural body, then ‘being an-axe’ [axeishness] would be its substance, and this would be its soul. Apart from this, it would no longer be an axe, save equivocally. As it is, it is really an axe. And the soul is not the essence or ‘what-it-is’ of such a body as this, but of a natural body, such as has in itself the principle of motion and rest. §§235-8

            <td>Now what has been said should be considered with respect to parts. For if the eye were an animal, sight would be its soul. For this is the substance, in the sense of the definable form, of the eye. The eye is the matter of sight, and apart from this it is an eye no longer save equivocally, as with a painted or stone eye. What, therefore, holds of a part, we ought to apply to the whole living body: for the relation of a part [of the soul] to part [of the body] corresponds to that of sensitivity as a whole to the whole sensitive body, considered as such. §239

            <td>Not that which has cast off its soul is ‘capable of life’, but that which possesses it. But seed and fruit are only in potency such a body. As cutting or seeing is act, so is consciousness. The soul is like sight and the capacity of a tool; the body, like the thing in potency. But as an eye is a pupil together with the power of sight, so is there a living thing where there are both body and soul. §§ 240-1

            <td>Therefore it is evident enough that the soul is inseparable from the body—or certain parts of it, if it naturally has parts; for it is of certain bodily parts themselves that it is the act. But with respect to certain of its parts there is nothing to prevent its being separated, because these are acts of nothing bodily. Furthermore, it is not clear that the soul is not the ‘act’ of the body in the way that a sailor is of his ship. Let these remarks serve to describe and define the soul, in outline. §§ 242-4

Primo manifestat definitionem animae, quantum ad id quod in definitione praedicta ponitur ex parte ipsius animae. Secundo quantum ad id quod ibi ponitur ex parte subiecti, ibi, est autem non abiiciens animam et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo manifestat definitionem animae ex similitudine rerum artificialium. Secundo ex partibus eius, ibi, considerare autem in partibus oportet et cetera.
          <td>235. The Philosopher now begins to explain the definition of the soul given in Lectio 1; after which, at ‘Therefore it is evident’, he draws a conclusion from it. The explanation has two parts, in the first of which he is concerned directly with the soul itself, while in the second, where he says ‘Not that which has cast off’ he explains that part of the definition which refers to the subject which has a soul. With regard to the soul itself, he begins by illustrating the definition by a comparison with artificial things; and then goes on, at ‘Now what has.’ to explain it by considering the parts of the soul separately.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia enim formae artificiales accidentia sunt, quae sunt magis nota, quoad nos, quam formae substantiales, utpote sensui propinquiora: ideo convenienter rationem animae, quae est forma substantialis, per comparationem ad formas accidentales manifestat.

          <td>In artificial things, made by human skiff, the forms imposed on the material are accidental forms; and since these are easier for us to perceive than is substantial form, as being more accessible to the senses, it is obviously reasonable to approach the soul, which is a substantial form, through a comparison with accidental forms. And again, the soul’s parts or potencies are more readily perceptible to us than its essence; for all our enquiry into the soul has to start from the objective terms of its activities and then proceed from these activities to their potencies, and thence to an understanding of the soul in its essence; that is why a study of the soul’s parts can throw light on the definition of it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod dictum est in universali quid sit anima, cum praedicta definitio omni animae conveniat. Dictum est enim quod anima est substantia, quae est forma, a qua accipitur ratio rei. Est autem differentia inter formam quae est substantia, et formam quae non est substantia. Nam forma accidentalis, quae non est in genere substantiae, non pertinet ad essentiam sive quidditatem subiecti: non enim albedo est de essentia corporis albi. Sed forma substantialis est de essentia, sive de quidditate subiecti. Sic igitur anima dicitur forma substantialis, quia est de essentia sive de quidditate corporis animati. Et hoc est quod subdit, haec autem, scilicet substantia quae est secundum rationem est quod quid erat esse huic corpori, id est corpori constituto in specie per talem formam. Ipsa enim forma pertinet ad essentiam rei, quae significatur per definitionem significantem de re quid est.
          <td>236. First, then, he observes that the definition given above is ‘general’, i.e. it applies to any soul. It posits the soul as a substance, which is a form; and this means that it presents to us the idea of the essence of something. For there is this difference between a form that is substance and one that is not, that the latter sort are not strictly of the essence or ‘whatness’ of a thing: whiteness is not of the essence of a white body; whereas substantial form is essential and quidditative. To call the soul a substantial form, therefore, is to imply that it is of the essence and ‘whatness’ of the body it animates. Hence he says ‘this’, i.e. this quidditative substance, ‘is the essence of this body’, i.e. of the body that is what it is precisely through having this particular form. For this form is essential to the thing, and is denoted by the definition of what the thing is.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia formae substantiales, cuiusmodi sunt formae corporum naturalium, sunt latentes, manifestat hoc per formas artificiales, quae sunt accidentales. Et hoc est quod subdit: sicut si aliquid organorum, id est artificialium instrumentorum, ut puta dolabra esset corpus physicum, idest naturale, forma sua hoc modo se haberet ad ipsum sicut dictum est. Et ideo subdit. Erat quidem dolabrae esse substantia ipsis, idest forma dolabrae, secundum quam accipitur ratio dolabrae: quam quidem rationem nominat esse dolabrae, eo quod secundum eam dolabra dicitur esse dolabra, haec inquam forma est substantia dolabrae. Et hoc ideo dicit, quia formae corporum naturalium sunt in genere substantiae. Et ulterius si dolabra non esset solum corpus physicum, sed etiam corpus animatum, forma dolabrae esset anima, et ea separata, non esset amplius dolabra nisi aequivoce, sicut separata anima, non est caro nec oculus, nisi aequivoce. Nunc autem, quia dolabra non est corpus naturale, nec eius forma est quod quid erat esse tali corpori, remota forma dolabrae adhuc est dolabra, id est substantia dolabrae. Substantia enim corporum artificialium est materia eorum, quae remanet sublata forma artificiali, licet non remaneat ipsum corpus artificiale in actu.
          <td>237. And because substantial forms, including the forms of natural bodies, are not evident to us, Aristotle makes his meaning clear with an example taken from the forms (accidental) of artificial. things. ‘If’, he says, ‘some utensil (i.e. an artificial instrument) for example an axe, were a physical (i.e. a natural) body,’ it would possess a form in the manner already explained. So he continues: ‘Then being-an-axe would be its substance,’ i.e. would be the substantial form of the axe, which is that to which we refer our idea of axe as such. This idea of axe as such he identifies with the essence of the axe, with what causes it to be an axe; and this essential form he identifies with the substance of the axe. He says ‘substance’ because the forms of natural bodies are substantial forms. Furthermore, if the axe were not merely a natural, but also an animate, body, its form would be a soul; and if it lost this soul it would no longer be an axe, except in name; just as when the soul leaves the body there is no longer an eye or flesh, except in name. Of course the axe, not being in fact a natural body, has no axe-form which is of the essence of the body that it is; so that if it lost the form of axe, the axe would still exist substantially, because the substance of artificial things is their matter which remains when the artificial form and, with this artificial form, the actuality of the artificial body as such, is removed.

          <td>Et quia dixerat quod aliter nunc est in dolabra, et aliter esset si esset corpus physicum animatum, assignat rationem huius, dicens, quod hoc ideo est, quia anima non est quod quid est esse et ratio, id est forma huiusmodi corporis, scilicet artificialis sed corporis physici huiuscemodi scilicet habentis vitam. Et ut manifestet quid sit esse physicum corpus, subiungit habentis in seipso principium motus et status. Naturalia enim sunt, quae in seipsis principium motus et status habent. Huiusmodi enim principium, natura dicitur, uti habes in libro physicorum secundo.
          <td>238. Then he explains why he has distinguished between the axe as it actually is and as it would be were it a physical (that is, a natural) living body: for the soul is not the essence and idea, i.e. the form, of an artificial body like an axe, but ‘of such a physical body’, i.e. of a body that is alive. To make this clearer he adds ‘as has in itself the principle of movement and rest’—which is characteristic of natural things. For Nature is this sort of principle, as he says in the <i>Physics</i> , Book II.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit considerare autem manifestat definitionem animae ex partibus, dicens, quod id quod dictum est de tota anima et de toto corpore vivente, oportet considerare in partibus utriusque; quia, si oculus esset animal, oporteret quod visus esset anima eius, quia visus est substantialis forma oculi, et oculus est materia visus, sicut corpus organicum materia animae. Deficiente autem visu, non remanet oculus nisi aequivoce, sicut oculus lapideus aut depictus aequivoce dicitur oculus. Et hoc ideo est, quia aequivoca sunt, quorum nomen solum commune est et ratio substantiae diversa: et ideo sublata forma a qua est ratio substantiae oculi, non remanet nisi nomen oculi aequivoce dictum. Quod ergo invenitur in parte viventis corporis, oportet accipere in toto vivente corpore, scilicet quod sicut visus est forma substantialis oculi, et eo remoto non remanet oculus nisi aequivoce, ita anima est forma substantialis viventis corporis, et ea remota non remanet corpus vivum nisi aequivoce. Sicut enim se habet una pars animae sensitivae ad unam partem corporis sensitivi, sic se habet totus sensus ad totum corpus sensitivum inquantum huiusmodi.
          <td>239. Then at ‘Now what has been said’ he applies what has been concluded about the soul as a whole, and the animate body as a whole, to the parts of each. if, he says, the eye were a whole animal, its soul would be sight; for sight is the essential form of the eye; which in itself is the material condition of sight; in the same way as an organic body is the material condition of a soul. Once sight is lost, the eye, is no longer an eye, except in the sense that a stone or painted eye may be called an eye equivocally (this term is used when the same name is given to essentially different things). Remove, then, what makes an eye really an eye, and there is left only the name. And the same argument applies to the animate body as a whole: what makes it an animate body is its form, the soul. This removed, you have a living body only equivocally. For as one part of the sensitive soul is to one part of the sensitive body, so the faculty of sense as a whole is to the whole sensitive body as such.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem exponit praemissam definitionem de anima quantum ad hoc quod dixerat, quod est actus corporis habentis vitam in potentia. Dicitur enim aliquid esse in potentia dupliciter. Uno modo, cum non habet principium operationis. Alio modo cum habet quidem, sed non operatur secundum ipsum. Corpus autem, cuius actus est anima, est habens vitam in potentia, non quidem primo modo, sed secundo. Et hoc est quod dicit corpus potentia ens ut vivat, id est habens vitam in potentia, cuius est actus anima, non sic dicitur esse in potentia ad vitam, quod sit abiiciens animam, id est carens principio vitae, quod est anima, sed quod est habens huiusmodi principium. Sed verum est quod semen et fructus, in quo conservatur semen plantae, est in potentia ad huiusmodi corpus vivum, quod habet animam: nondum enim semen habet animam. Unde sic est in potentia, sicut abiiciens animam.
          <td>240. Next, at ‘Not that which has cast off’, he explains what was meant by defining the soul as the ‘act of a potentially animate body’. Now ‘potentially’ may be said about a thing in either of two senses: (a) as lacking the power to act; (b) as possessed of this power but not acting by it. And the body, whose act is the soul, is potentially animate in the second sense only. So, when he calls the body a thing potentially alive he does not mean that it has lost the soul it had and now lacks a life-principle altogether; he is speaking of what still has such a principle. On the other hand, seeds and the fruits that contain them are only potentially living bodies with souls; for a seed as yet lacks a soul. It is ‘potential’ therefore like that which has lost its soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ut ostendat quomodo est in potentia ad vitam corpus cuius actus est anima, subiungit quod ita vigilantia est actus animae sensitivae, sicut incisio est actus cultelli, et visio est actus oculi. Quodlibet enim istorum est operatio et usus principii habiti. Sed anima est actus primus, sicut visus et quaecumque potentia organi; quodlibet enim horum est principium operationis. Sed corpus quod est perfectum per animam, est potentia habens quidem actum primum, sed aliquando carens actu secundo. Sed sicut oculus est aliquid compositum ex pupilla sicut materia, et visu sicut forma, ita animal est compositum ex anima sicut forma et ex corpore sicut materia.
          <td>241. And to show just how the body is potential to the actuality that comes from its soul he adds that being awake is the actuality of the sensitive soul in the same way as cutting is the actuality of a knife and seeing is that of an eye; for each of these acts is the activity and use of a principle already there. But the soul is the first and underlying actuality; like the faculty of sight itself or the capacity of any tool; for each of these is the operative principle itself. So the body, complete with its soul, is potentially animate in the sense that, though it has its first actuality, it may lack the second. And as the eye is a thing composed of a pupil as its matter and the faculty of sight as its form, so an animal is a thing composed of soul as its form and body as its matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod quidem concludit quamdam veritatem ex praemissis: quia enim ostensum est quod anima est actus totius corporis, et partes sunt actus partium, actus autem et forma non separantur ab eo cuius est actus vel forma: manifestum est quod anima non potest separari a corpore, vel ipsa tota, vel aliquae partes eius, si nata est aliquo modo habere partes. Manifestum est enim quod aliquae partes animae sunt actus aliquarum partium corporis, sicut dictum est quod visus est actus oculi. Sed secundum quasdam partes nihil prohibet animam separari, quia quaedam partes animae nullius corporis actus sunt, sicut infra probabitur de his quae sunt circa intellectum.
          <td>242. Then, at ‘Therefore it is evident’, he deduces a truth from the foregoing. Having shown that the soul is the whole body’s actuality, its ‘parts’ being the actualities of the body’s parts, and granted that an actuality or form cannot be separated from that which is actual and has form, we can certainly conclude that no soul can be separated from its body,—at least certain parts of the soul ‘cannot be separated, if the soul can be said to have parts. For obviously some ‘parts’ of the soul are nothing but actualities of parts of the body; as we have seen in the case of sight, that it is the eye’s actuality. On the other hand, certain parts of the soul may well be separable from the body, since they are not the actuality of any corporeal part, as will be proved when we come to treat of the intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia Plato ponebat quod anima est actus corporis non sicut forma, sed sicut motor, subiungit quod hoc nondum est manifestum, si anima sic sit actus corporis sicut nauta est actus navis, scilicet ut motor tantum.
          <td>243. As to Plato’s opinion that the soul is the act of the body not as its form but as its mover, he adds that it is not yet clear whether the soul is the act of the body as a sailor of a ship, i.e. as its mover only.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde epilogando colligit quae dicta sunt; et dicit quod secundum praedicta determinatum est de anima, et posita est animae descriptio figuraliter quasi extrinsece et superficialiter et incomplete. Complebitur enim determinatio de anima quando pertinget usque ad intima ut determinetur natura uniuscuiusque partis ipsius animae.
          <td>244. Finally, recapitulating, he says that the foregoing is an ‘outline’ description of the soul, meaning that it is extrinsic, as it were, and superficial and incomplete. It will be completed when he comes to define the innermost nature of the soul and the nature of each of its parts.

          LECTIO 3</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus posuit definitionem animae, hic intendit demonstrare ipsam. Et primo dicit de quo est intentio. Secundo prosequitur intentum, ibi, dicamus igitur principium et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo determinat modum demonstrationis, quo uti intendit in demonstrando. Secundo manifestat quomodo quaedam definitiones sunt demonstrabiles, ibi, non enim solum quodque et cetera. Circa primum sciendum est, quod cum ex notis oporteat in cognitionem ignotorum devenire: omnis autem demonstratio adducitur causa notificandi aliud, necesse est, quod omnis demonstratio procedat ex notioribus quo ad nos, quibus per demonstrationem fit aliquid notum. In quibusdam autem eadem sunt notiora quo ad nos et secundum naturam, sicut in mathematicis, quae sunt a materia abstracta; et in his demonstratio procedit ex notioribus simpliciter et notioribus secundum naturam, scilicet ex causis in effectus: unde dicitur demonstratio propter quid. In quibusdam vero non sunt eadem magis nota simpliciter et quo ad nos, scilicet in naturalibus, in quibus plerumque effectus sensibiles sunt magis noti suis causis; et ideo in naturalibus, ut in pluribus proceditur ab his quae sunt minus nota secundum naturam et magis nota quo ad nos, ut dicitur in primo physicorum.
          <td>245. Having defined the soul the Philosopher now sets out to prove his definition. First he says what he intends to do, and then, at ‘Going back, then,’ proceeds to do it. As to the former point, he first determines the method of demonstration that he intends to use; after which, at ‘For it is not enough’ he explains how certain types of definition can be proved. With regard to the method to be used we should note that, since we can only come to know the unknown if we start from what we know, and since the purpose of demonstration is precisely to cause knowledge, it follows that every demonstration must begin from something more knowable to us than the thing to be made known by it. Now in certain subjects, such as mathematics, which abstract from matter, what is the more knowable is such both in itself and relatively to us; hence in these subjects, demonstration can start from what is absolutely and of its nature more knowable, and therefore can deduce effects from their causes; whence the name given it of a priori demonstration. But in the quite different sphere of the natural sciences, what is more knowable is not the same thing in itself and relatively to us; for sensible effects are generally more evident than their causes. Hence in these sciences we generally have to begin from what is, indeed, absolutely speaking less knowable, but is more evident relatively to us (see the <i>Physics</i> , Book 1).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc modo demonstrationis intendit hic uti. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod quia illud quod est certum secundum naturam, et quod est secundum rationem notius, fit certius quo ad nos ex his quae sunt incerta secundum naturam, certiora autem quo ad nos, per istum modum tentandum est iterum aggredi de anima, demonstrando definitionem eius supra positam.
          <td>246. And this is the kind of demonstration which will be used here. So he says that what is of its nature more certain, and is more evident to thought, becomes certain to us by means of things less certain in nature but more certain to us; and that this shows us the method to use in enquiring once more into the soul and showing the grounds of the definition given above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non enim assignat rationem praedictae intentionis; ostendendo quod aliquae definitiones sunt demonstrabiles. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod ideo oportet iterum aggredi de anima, quia oportet quod ratio definitiva non solum dicat hoc quod est quia, sicut plures terminorum idest definitionum dicunt; sed oportet etiam quod in definitione tangatur causa, et quod per definitionem dicentem propter quid, demonstretur definitio quae dicit solum quia. Inveniuntur autem multae rationes terminorum, idest definitiones, quae sunt sicut conclusiones. Et ponit exemplum in geometricalibus.
          <td>247. Then, at ‘For it is not enough’, he tells us why the question must be taken up again. Certain definitions can, he says, be demonstrated, and in these cases it is not enough for the defining formula to express, as most ‘formulae’, i.e. definitions, do, the mere fact; it should also give the cause of the fact; and this being given, one can then proceed to deduce the definition which states the mere fact. At present many definitions are given in the form of conclusions; and he gives an example from geometry.

          <td>Ad cuius intelligentiam sciendum est, quod figurarum quadrilaterarum, quaedam habent omnes angulos rectos, et vocantur orthogonia, idest superficies rectorum angulorum; quaedam autem non habent angulos rectos, et vocantur rhomboydes. Sciendum est autem, quod orthogoniorum quoddam consistit ex omnibus lateribus aequalibus, et vocatur quadratum sive tetragonismus; quoddam autem non habet omnia latera aequalia, in quo tamen quaelibet duo latera sibi opposita sunt aequalia: et vocatur huiusmodi orthogonium altera parte longius, sicut patet in sequentibus figuris.

            248. To understand which we must note that there are two kinds of four-sided figure: those whose angles are all right angles, and these are called rectangles; and the kind with no right angles, and these are called rhomboids. Of the rectangles, again, there is one with four equal sides—the square or tetragon; and another which, without having all four sides equal, has two pairs of equal and opposite sides—the oblong. Thus:

Unde si imaginaremur, quod una earum moveretur per aliam, consurgeret talis superficies.
          <td>249. Note further, that in any rectangular surface the two straight lines enclosing the right angle are said to contain the whole figure; because, the other two sides being equal to these two, each equal to its opposite, it follows that one of the enclosing lines measures the length of the whole figure, and the other its breadth: so that the whole figure is given in the contact of the two lines. If we imagine one of these lines moving along the other we see the whole figure form itself

Et quia haec demonstrationibus geometricis diffusum esset ostendere, sufficiat hoc ad praesens manifestare in numeris. Sit igitur orthogonium altera parte longius, cuius maius latus sit novem palmorum, minus vero quatuor. Accipiatur autem linea media in proportione inter ea, quae scilicet sunt sex palmorum. Quia sicut se habent sex ad novem, ita quatuor ad sex. Quadratum autem huius lineae erit aequale praedicto orthogonio altera parte longiori. Quod etiam in numeris patet. Nam quater novem sunt triginta sex. Similiter etiam sexies sex sunt triginta sex.
          <td>250. Note also that if, between the two unequal sides that contain the oblong, one takes the proportional mean and squares it, one gets a quadrilateral equal to the oblong. This would take too long to prove geometrically, so let a numerical argument do for the present. Let our oblong then have its longer side 9 feet and its shorter side 4 feet. Then the proportional mean line will be 6 feet; for as 6 is to 9, so 4 is to 6. Now the square of this line must equal the oblong; which is obvious numerically: 4 x 9 = 36, 6 x 6 = 36.

Now it is thus, he says,’ that the question, What is a square (i.e. the quadrilateral equal to an oblong)? is answered; it is said ‘to be an orthogon’, i.e. a right-angled plane figure, which is ‘equilateral’, i.e. having all its sides equal, and so on. ‘Such a term’, i.e. a definition of this sort, is really ‘of the nature of a conclusion’, namely of a presupposed demonstration; whereas if one were to say that a square is ‘the discovery of a mean line’, i.e. of the proportional mean between the two unequal sides of the oblong, meaning that a square is what is constructed from this line, then at last the definition would disclose the ‘reason why’ of the thing defined.

          <td>Attendendum est autem, quod hoc exemplum quod hic inducitur, est simile ei quod intendit circa animam, quantum ad aliquid, scilicet quantum ad hoc quod demonstretur definitio animae, non autem quantum ad hoc quod demonstretur demonstratione dicente propter quid.
          <td>252. Note, however, that this example is only relevant to the definition of the soul in so far as this definition is simply to be demonstrated; it must not be taken to imply that our demonstration can proceed a priori from causes to effects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit dicamus igitur incipit demonstrare definitionem animae superius positam, modo praedicto, scilicet per effectum. Et utitur tali demonstratione. Illud quod est primum principium vivendi est viventium corporum actus et forma: sed anima est primum principium vivendi his quae vivunt: ergo est corporis viventis actus et forma. Manifestum est autem, quod haec demonstratio est ex posteriori. Ex eo enim quod anima est forma corporis viventis, est principium operum vitae, et non e converso. Circa hoc ergo duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod anima est principium vivendi. Secundo, quod primum principium vivendi est forma corporis viventis, ibi, quoniam autem quo vivimus et sentimus. Circa primum tria facit. Primo distinguit modos viventium. Secundo ostendit, quod anima est vivendi principium, ibi, unde et vegetabilia omnia, et cetera. Tertio manifestat quomodo se habeant partes animae, abinvicem, secundum quas est principium operum vitae, ibi, utrum autem unumquodque horum.
          <td>253. Next, at ‘Going back then’, he begins to prove the definition of the soul given above; and this in the way indicated, i.e. from effects to causes. This is how he sets about it: the first principle of life in things is the actuality and form of living bodies; but soul is the first principle of life in living things; therefore it is actuality and form of living bodies. Now this argument is clearly a posteriori; for in reality the soul is the source of vital activities because it is the form of a living body, not <i>e converso</i> . So he has to do two things here; first, to show that soul is the source or principle of vitality, and secondly, to show that the first principle of vitality is the form of living bodies (this comes at ‘Since that whereby etc.’). With regard to the first point he does three things: (a) he distinguishes modes of life, (b) he shows that the soul is the principle of living activities—at ‘Hence all plants’; and (c) he explains how these parts of the soul are interrelated, by means of which it originates vital activities. This is at ‘We now ask whether each of these’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod ad prosequendum nostram intentionem, qua intendimus demonstrare definitionem animae, oportet hoc quasi principium accipere, quod animatum distinguitur ab inanimato in vivendo. Animata enim vivunt, sed inanimata non vivunt. Sed cum multiplex sit modus vivendi, si unus tantum eorum insit alicui, dicitur illud vivens et animatum.
          <td>254. He starts then by saying that to carry put our intention of proving the definition of the soul, we must assume as a kind of principle that things with souls differ from those without souls in being alive. Life is the test; and as life shows itself in several ways, if a thing has life in only one of these ways it is still said to be alive and to possess a soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ponit autem quatuor modos vivendi: quorum unus est per intellectum, secundus per sensum, tertius per motum et statum localem, quartus per motum alimenti, et decrementi et augmenti. Ideo autem quatuor tantum modos ponit vivendi, cum supra quinque genera operationum animae posuerit, quia hic intendit distinguere modos vivendi, secundum gradus viventium; qui distinguuntur secundum haec quatuor. In quibusdam enim viventium inveniuntur tantum alimentum, augmentum et decrementum, scilicet in plantis. In quibusdam autem, cum his invenitur sensus sine motu locali, sicut in animalibus imperfectis, sicut sunt ostreae. In quibusdam autem, ulterius invenitur motus secundum locum, sicut in animalibus perfectis, quae moventur motu progressivo, ut bos et equus. In quibusdam autem, cum his ulterius invenitur intellectus, scilicet in hominibus. Appetitivum autem, quod est quintum praeter haec quatuor, non facit aliquam diversitatem in gradibus viventium. Nam ubicumque est sensus, ibi est et appetitus.
          <td>255. Life, he says, shows itself in four modes: (1) as intellectual; (2) as sensitive; (3) as the cause of motion or rest in space; (4) as cause of the motions of taking nourishment, decay and growth. He distinguishes only these four modes, although he has already distinguished five main types of vital activity, and this because he is thinking here and now of the degrees of animate being. There are four such degrees, distinguished in the same way as the four modes in which life is manifested: for some living things, i.e. plants, only take nourishment and grow and decay; some have also sensation, but are always fixed to one place—such are the inferior animals like shell-fish; some again, i.e. the complete animals like oxen and horses, have, along with sensation, the power to move from place to place; and finally some, i.e. men, have, in addition, mind. The appetitive power, which makes a fifth type of vitality, does not, however, imply a distinct degree of living being; for it always accompanies sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit unde et vegetabilia manifestat, quod anima est principium vivendi secundum omnes modos praedictos. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit, quomodo anima est principium vivendi in plantis. Secundo in animalibus, ibi, animal autem propter sensum, et cetera. Tertio ostendit quid dictum sit, et quid restat dicendum, ibi, propter unam autem causam, et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod anima est principium vivendi in plantis; et dicit, quod cum dictum sit, quod quibuscumque inest unum quatuor praedictorum modorum viventium, dicuntur vivere, sequitur quod omnia vegetabilia vivant. Omnia enim in seipsis habent potentiam quamdam, et principium, quo suscipiunt motum augmenti et decrementi.
          <td>256. Next, at ‘Hence all plants’, he shows that a soul is involved in all these modes of life. He does this with regard (1) to plants, and (2) to animals, at ‘But an animal is such, primarily’. Then (3), he summarises, at ‘For what cause”, what has been said and remains to be said. As to (1) he does two things. First he shows that the life-principle in plants is a soul. We have remarked, he says, that whatever evinces one of the four modes of life mentioned above can be said to live. Therefore plants are alive; for they all possess some intrinsic power or principle of growth and decay.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod hoc principium non sit natura sed anima, manifestum est. Nam natura non movet ad contraria loca: motus autem augmenti et decrementi est secundum contraria loca. Augentur enim vegetabilia omnia, non solum sursum et deorsum, sed utroque modo. Manifestum est ergo, quod principium horum motuum non est natura sed anima. Nec solum vegetabilia vivunt, dum augentur et decrescunt, sed quaecumque nutriuntur tamdiu vivunt, quamdiu possunt accipere nutrimentum per quod fit augmentum.
          <td>257. Now this principle is not mere nature. Nature does not move in opposite directions, but growth and decay are in opposite directions; for all plants grow not only upwards or downwards, but in both directions. Hence a soul, not nature, is clearly at work in them. Nor do plants live only when actually growing or decaying, but, as things that take nourishment, they live so long as they can assimilate the food that induces growth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi separari autem ostendit quod praedictum vivendi principium, est primum et separabile ab aliis. Et dicit quod hoc, scilicet principium augmenti et alimenti, potest separari ab aliis principiis vivendi, sed alia non possunt separari ab eo in rebus mortalibus. Quod ideo dicit, quia in rebus immortalibus, sicut sunt substantiae separatae, et corpora caelestia, si tamen sunt animata, invenitur intellectivum sine nutritivo. Quod autem hoc principium sit separabile ab aliis, manifestum est in his quae vegetantur, idest, in plantis, in quibus nulla alia potentia animae inest, nisi huiusmodi. Ex quo manifestum est, quod illud propter quod primum invenitur vita in rebus mortalibus, est principium augmenti et alimenti, quod vocatur anima vegetabilis.
          <td>258. Next, at ‘It is possible’, he shows that this principle of feeding and growing can exist apart from other life-principles, but these cannot exist apart from it, at least in things subject to death. He adds this last clause because of immortal beings like immaterial substances or heavenly bodies; because, if these have a soul, it is intellectual; it is not a capacity to take nourishment. And the separability of this life principle from others is clearly evident in plants which have, in fact, no other one but this. it follows that what first of all causes life in mortal things is this principle of growth and nourishment, the so-called vegetative soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit animal autem manifestat quomodo anima est principium vivendi in animalibus. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo dicit, quod primum dicitur aliquid esse animal propter sensum, licet animalia quaedam et sentiant et moveantur. Ea enim dicimus esse animalia, et non solum vivere, quae licet non mutent locum, tamen habent sensum. Sunt enim multa animalium talia, quae naturaliter manent in eodem loco, et tamen habent sensum, sicut ostreae, quae non moventur motu progressivo.
          <td>259. Then, at ‘But an animal is such primarily’ he shows that a soul is the source of living in animals. And here he does two things. First he observes that what primarily distinguishes animals is sensation, though there are animals which have local movement as well; for we call those things animals (not just living beings) which have sensation, even if they are fixed to one place. For there are many such animals whose nature restricts them to one place, but which have the power of sense, e.g. shell-fish, which cannot move from place to place.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi sensuum autem ostendit quod inter alios sensus primo inest tactus animalibus. Quod probat ex hoc, quod sicut vegetativum potest separari a tactu et ab omni sensu, sic tactus potest separari ab aliis sensibus. Multa enim sunt animalia, quae solum sensum tactus habent, sicut animalia imperfecta. Omnia autem animalia habent sensum tactus. Vegetativum autem principium dicimus illam partem animae, qua etiam vegetabilia, idest plantae, participant. Sic igitur ex praedictis patent tres gradus viventium. Primus est plantarum. Secundus animalium imperfectorum immobilium, quae habent solum sensum tactus. Tertius est animalium perfectorum, quae moventur motu progressivo, quae etiam habent alios sensus. Manifestum est autem, quod quartus gradus est eorum, quae habent cum his etiam intellectum.
          <td>260. Then at ‘Touch is’ he shows that touch is the primary sense in animals. For just as the vegetative soul, he says, is separable from all the senses including touch, so touch is separable from all the other senses. For many inferior animals have only the sense of touch; but there are no animals without this sense. Now that degree of soul in which even plants participate we call the vegetative. Hence we can distinguish three degrees of living beings: first, plants; secondly, the inferior animals fixed to one place and with no sense but touch; and, thirdly, the higher, complete animals which have the other senses and also the power to move from place to place. And a fourth degree consists, evidently, of beings which have all this and mind as well.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit propter quam ostendit quid dictum sit, et quid restat dicendum. Et dicit, quod posterius dicendum est, propter quam causam utrumque horum accidat, scilicet quod vegetativum potest esse sine sensu, et quod tactus sine aliis sensibus. Hoc enim dicet in fine libri. Nunc autem sufficiet intantum dictum esse, quod anima est principium vivendi secundum praedictos modos, et quod distincta est istis quatuor, scilicet vegetativo, quod est in plantis et in omnibus viventibus, et sensitivo, quod est in omnibus animalibus, et intellectivo, quod est in omnibus hominibus, et motu progressivo, qui est in omnibus animalibus perfectis sensu vel intellectu.
          <td>261. Finally, at ‘For what cause’ summarising what has been said and remains to be said, he remarks that the cause of both these phenomena, namely the separability of the vegetative principle from sensation and of touch from the other senses, will be -given later on. He does this at the end of the whole Treatise. For the present it suffices to say that ‘soul’ is the one principle underlying the four distinct modes in which life is manifested, namely the vegetative mode which belongs to plants and to all living things; the sensitive mode in all animals; the intellectual mode in all men; and fourthly, the mode that is a power to move from place to place, which exists in all the higher animals, both those with senses only and those with intellect as well.

For, as in the case of plants some, on being divided, seem to go on living in separation from one another, as if there were in each plant one soul in act, but several in potency; so we find it happens in the case of other differentiations of soul, for instance in divided animals each division has sensation and local motion; and if sensation, phantasm and appetition; for where there is sensation there is pleasure, and pain, and where these are there must necessarily be appetition. §§ 263-7

            <td>Since ‘that whereby we live and perceive’ can mean two things,—like ‘that by which we know’. for we name one thing knowledge, and another, the soul, though we are said to know by both of these; and likewise as ‘that by which we are healthy’; for health is one thing, while a part of the body (or the whole of it) is another; and in these cases knowledge, or health, is the form and specific essence or ratio, and, as it were, the act of such as can receive knowledge in the one case and health in the other (for the action of an agent seems to exist in the recipient or disposed material)—and soul being that by which we primarily live and perceive and move and understand it follows that the soul will be a sort of species or ratio; not, as it were, a matter or substratum. Substance is predicated in three ways, as we have said: in one way as the form; in another as the matter; and in another as what is from both. Of these, matter is the potency, form the act; hence if what is from both is the animate being, the body is not the act of the soul, but the soul of the body. §§ 271-5.

            <td>And on this account they were right who thought that the soul is neither apart from the body nor the same as the body; for it is not, indeed, the body; yet is something of the body. And therefore it is in a body, and a body of a definite kind; and not as some earlier thinkers made out, who related it to a body without defining at all the nature and quality of that body; despite the fact that it is apparent that not any subject whatever can receive any form at random. And that such is the case is confirmed by reason: the act of any one thing is of that which is in potency to it, and it occurs naturally and fittingly in matter appropriate to it. That the soul, then, is an actuality and formal principle of a thing in potency to exist accordingly, is evident from these considerations. §§ 276-8

          <td>Ostendit superius philosophus, quod anima est principium vivendi, secundum diversa genera vitae. Et ideo nunc inquirit, qualiter principia vivendi secundum diversa genera vitae se habent ad animam et adinvicem. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo movet quaestiones duas. Quarum prima est. Cum anima, quae est principium vivendi, sit determinata vegetativo, sensitivo, motivo secundum locum, et intellectivo, utrum quodlibet eorum sit anima per se, aut sit pars animae. Et manifestum est, quod in his quae tantum augentur et nutriuntur, sicut in plantis, vegetativum est anima. In his autem quae vegetantur et sentiunt, est pars animae, et similiter est de aliis. Secunda quaestio est. Si unumquodque praedictorum est pars animae, puta cum omnia inveniantur in una anima sicut in humana, utrum hoc modo sint partes, quod separentur adinvicem solum secundum rationem, ut scilicet sint diversae potentiae, aut etiam separentur loco et subiecto, utpote quod in una parte corporis sit sensitivum, in alia appetitivum, in alia motivum, et sic de aliis, sicut quibusdam visum fuit.
          <td>262. After showing that ‘soul’ is the one principle common to the several types of vitality, the Philosopher now enquires into the various principles of the latter, asking how they are related both to the soul and to each other. And he does two things here. First, he put two questions (a) If the soul, the life-principle, is realised actually as a vegetative, sensitive, locomotive or intellectual principle, is each of these principles to be identified with the soul proper, or is each no more than apart of the soul? Now obviously, where the thing’s vitality consists entirely in growing and taking nourishment (as in plants) the vegetative principle is simply the soul or life-principle itself. But where the thing also has sensation, this vegetative principle is only a part of the soul. And the same reasoning applies to other cases. (b) If each of these principles is a part of the life-principle, as in the human soul which contains all of them, are they parts in the sense that they are merely diverse powers of the one soul, existing in one thing though they can be thought of apart from one another, or are they distinct beings having each its distinct locality, so that the sense-power is in one part of the body, appetition. in another, locomotion in another, and so on; as some indeed have thought.

          <td>Secundo cum dicit de quibusdam solvit propositas quaestiones. Et primo secundam. Secundo primam, ibi, ad haec quibusdam animalium. Circa primum duo facit.

Secundo, quantum ad primam, utrum scilicet sint separabiles ratione, ibi, ratione autem, quod alterae et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod de quibusdam partibus animae, non est difficile videre utrum sint separabiles loco, idest subiecto; sed de quibusdam dubium est.
          <td>263. Secondly, when he says ‘Concerning some of these’, he answers the above questions: first the second one; then, at ‘Further, all these powers’, the first. The second question is answered in two parts: (a) with respect to the local separability of the parts of the soul, and (b) at ‘By definition’ concerning their separability in the mind. As to (a) he says that some parts of the soul raise no difficulties, but that others do.

          <td>Et ad ostendendum quod in quibusdam hoc facile est videre, praemittit similitudinem de plantis, ibi, sicut enim in plantis: dicens quod quaedam partes divisae ab eis, et separatae ab aliis partibus, videntur vivere. Et hoc manifestatur per hoc, quod ramusculi abscissi inseruntur vel plantantur, et coalescunt; quod non esset nisi remaneret in eis vita, et per consequens anima, quae est principium vivendi: quod contingit tamquam in unaquaque planta, anima sit una in actu, et multiplex in potentia. Sicut enim accidere videtur in formis corporum naturalium inanimatorum, ita in eis quae propter sui imperfectionem non requirunt diversitatem in partibus, quod in aliquo uno toto anima est in actu una et plures in potentia, sicut et ipsum corpus est unum in actu, et plura in potentia.

Et eadem ratione, quia anima plantae imperfecta est in ordine animarum, non requirit magnam diversitatem in partibus, unde anima totius potius potest salvari in aliqua partium.
          <td>264. And he illustrates this by a comparison with plant-life. Certain parts, he says, of plants can be cut off and yet seem to go on living; for the cuttings, grafted or replanted, unite with a new stem or with the soil. In these cases the life-principle appears to be actually single but potentially many. The same sort of thing is observable in the forms of inanimate physical bodies; as each such body is actually one and potentially many, so in the lower animate bodies whose parts are still undifferentiated, the soul exists as one whole actually, but as many potentially. For inanimate bodies can be divided into parts which each retain the same specific nature (e.g. air, water, minerals) and this nature was also the nature of the whole body; and it is somewhat the same with plants, the lowest order of animate beings; they require very little differentiation in their parts, and the life-principle of the whole survives, as such, in some of the separated parts.

          <td>Et sic etiam videmus in aliis differentiis animae, sicut in entomis decisis, idest in animalibus quae decisa vivunt, quia utraque partium habet sensum. Quod patet ex hoc, quod retrahit se, si pungitur. Et etiam habet motum secundum locum, ut ad sensum apparet. Sic ergo in una et eadem parte apparet et sensitivum et motivum principium. Et si est ibi sensus, necesse est, quod sit ibi phantasia. Phantasia autem nihil aliud est, quam motus factus a sensu secundum actum, ut infra dicetur. Et similiter si habeat sensum pars decisa, necesse est, quod habeat appetitum; ad sensum enim de necessitate sequitur laetitia et tristitia, sive delectatio et dolor. Necesse est enim, si sensibile perceptum est conveniens, quod sit delectabile: si autem est nocivum, quod sit dolorosum. Ubi autem est dolor et delectatio, oportet quod sit desiderium et appetitus; unde necesse est, quod si pars decisa sentit, quod etiam habeat appetitum.
          <td>265. So also with those animals which remain alive after being cut up. Each division still has a sensitive soul: it will shrink back if you prick it. And obviously it can move about. So the same part retains, evidently, the principle of sensation and local movement. And if sensation, then it must also have imagination which is simply a certain motion derived from actual sensation, as we shall see later. Again, it must also have appetition, since sensation necessarily involves satisfaction or dissatisfaction, i.e. pleasure or pain, because it involves a contact with the congenial or the uncongenial. And pleasure and pain involve desire and appetition. So the divided parts of such animals are able to desire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic ergo manifestum est, quod vegetativum, sensitivum, appetitivum et motivum inveniuntur in una parte decisa: ex quo patet, quod non distinguuntur loco in corpore animalis. Sed de quibusdam potentiis particularibus, manifestum est quod distinguuntur loco. Visus enim manifeste non est nisi in oculo, auditus in aure, olfactus in naribus, gustus in lingua et palato. Sed primus sensus qui est tactus, et necessarius animali, est in toto.
          <td>266. Now if each such divided part contains the vegetative, sensitive, appetitive and locomotive principles all together, it is clear that these principles are not to be located in any special parts of the animal’s body. Yet certain powers are obviously so located: seeing is only in the eye, hearing in the ear, smelling in the nostrils, taste on the tongue and palate. But the fundamental and most necessary sense of touch is found over the whole body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quod dicit quod phantasia est in parte decisa, videtur esse dubium. Nam a quibusdam phantasiae attribuitur determinatum organum in corpore. Sed sciendum est, quod phantasia invenitur indeterminata in animalibus imperfectis, in animalibus vero perfectis determinata, sicut infra in tertio dicetur. Organum ergo aliquod determinatum phantasiae attribuitur, ad maiorem perfectionem et determinationem sui actus, sine quo phantasiae actus nullo modo esse posset, sicut actus visus nullo modo potest esse sine oculo. Sic igitur manifestavit quod in quibusdam potentiis animae, non est difficile videre utrum sunt separabiles loco.
          <td>267. A doubt may occur about imagination; for some assign to it a special organ of the body. But note that imagination (as will be shown later) in the lower animals is indefinite; it is definite only in the higher animals. Hence if we assign a special organ to imagination, this is because the special completeness and definiteness of its activities call for a special organ of the body, just as seeing requires an eye. But as to some powers of the soul it is not difficult to decide whether they are located in distinct parts of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit de intellectu ostendit in qua parte animae circa hoc possit esse dubium. Et dicit, quod de intellectu, quocumque nomine vocetur perspectiva potentia, idest speculativa, nihil est adhuc manifestum. Nondum enim per ea quae dicta sunt, apparet utrum habeat aliquod organum in corpore distinctum loco ab aliis organis, vel non distinctum. Sed tamen quantum in superficie apparet, videtur quod sit alterum genus animae ab aliis partibus animae, idest alterius naturae, et alio modo se habens; et quod hoc solum genus animae possit separari ab aliis partibus animae, vel etiam quod sit separatum ab organo corporeo, sicut perpetuum a corruptibili. Sed quod reliquae partes animae non sint separabiles loco adinvicem, manifestum est ex praedictis.
          <td>268. Then, at ‘But as regards intellect’, he points to one part of the soul over which doubts may arise. About the intellect, or whatever we call the percipient or speculative faculty, we are still, he says, uncertain. No proof has yet been given of its location in any special or particular organ of the body. Yet even at first sight it would seem to be of a different nature from the other parts of the soul, and to exist ‘in a different way; and that it alone is separarable from the rest of the soul (and may even exist apart from any organ of the body) as what is immortal from what is mortal. That the other parts of the soul are not locally separated is now clear.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit ratione autem ostendit quod sint separabiles ratione. Cuiuslibet enim potentiae ratio est secundum ordinem ad actum: unde necesse est, si actus sint diversi secundum speciem, quod potentiae habeant diversam rationem speciei. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod alterum est esse sensitivo et opinativo, id est intellectivo: idest altera est ratio utriusque potentiae, si sentire est alterum ab opinari: et similiter est de praedictis aliis potentiis.
          <td>269. Then at ‘By definition” he shows that they are mentally separable from one another. For we distinguish potencies by their relation to acts; if the acts are specifically distinct, then so are the potencies. Hence he says here that the sensitive and opining, i.e. intellectual, principles are diverse; meaning that,, as sensing is other than forming opinions, the faculties implied have distinct definitions. And the same is true of the other principles already mentioned.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit ad haec quibusdam solvit primam quaestionem: et dicit, quod hic facit differentiam in animalibus, quod quibusdam animalium insunt omnia praedicta, quibusdam vero quaedam horum, aliis vero unum solum. Quibuscumque autem inest unum solum praedictorum, oportet quod illud sit anima. In quibus vero insunt plura, quodlibet est pars animae; sed illa anima denominatur a principaliori, vel sensitiva, vel intellectiva. Quare autem hoc sit, quod quaedam habent unum, quaedam plura, quaedam omnia, posterius dicetur. Et sicut accidit circa potentias animae, ita accidit circa sensus. Quaedam enim habent omnes sensus, sicut animalia perfecta: quaedam vero habent quosdam sensus, sed non omnes, ut talpa: quaedam vero habent unum maxime necessarium, scilicet tactum, ut animalia imperfecta.
          <td>270. Then, at ‘Further, all these powers’, he answers the first of the two questions proposed above, observing that animals differ in this, that in some are found all the four vital principles mentioned above, in others only some of them, and in some only one. And where one only of these principles is found it is the soul itself; but where several are found together each is a part of the soul and the soul itself is named after the principal part, whether sensitive or intellectual as the case may be (the reason why animals differ in this way will be shown later). And as with the powers of the soul, so with the particular senses; for some animals, (the higher) have all the senses; some (e.g. moles) have some, but not all; while some (die lowest animals) have only the most necessary one, touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Potest autem et haec particula ad alium sensum referri, ut dicatur quod quia superius ostenderat philosophus, quod partes animae non sunt separabiles abinvicem loco, vel subiecto, in animali in quo sunt, quod propter hoc etiam non separentur in diversis animalibus, sed cuicumque inest unum, inessent omnia. Et ideo removet hoc in hac particula.
          <td>This passage might also be understood as referring to the statement, made a few lines earlier, that the parts of the soul which coexist ‘in any one animal are not distinct beings nor in different places. For from this one might argue that they are not separable as between one animal and another; which error this passage removes.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem ostenso quod anima est primum vivendi principium, concludit ex hoc definitionem prius assignatam. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo demonstrat propositum. Secundo ex veritate demonstrata, quasdam conclusiones ulterius inducit, ibi, propter hoc bene opinantur et cetera. Circa primum ponit talem demonstrationem. Duorum, quorum utroque dicimur esse aliquid aut operari, unum, scilicet quod primum est, est quasi forma, et aliud quasi materia. Sed anima est primum quo vivimus, cum tamen vivamus anima et corpore: ergo anima est forma corporis viventis. Et haec est definitio superius de anima posita, quod anima est actus primus physici corporis potentia vitam habentis. Manifestum est autem, quod medium huius demonstrationis est quaedam definitio animae, scilicet anima est quo vivimus primum.
          <td>271. Next, at ‘Since etc.’, he concludes, from the fact, that the soul is the first principle of life, to the definition of it already given; first proving this definition, and then, at ‘And on this account’, drawing some further conclusions. The proof runs thus. Granted that there are two principles of our being and activity, one (the form) will be prior to the other (the matter). Now both body and soul are principles of life in us, but the soul comes first in this respect. The soul then is the form of the living body; which agrees with the definition already given: the soul is the primary actuality of a physical body capable of life. Clearly, the middle term of this argument is the definition of the soul as the primary principle of life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa hanc autem demonstrationem quatuor facit. Primo ponit maiorem; dicens, quod quo vivimus et sentimus dicitur dupliciter: scilicet altero, sicut forma, et altero sicut materia. Sicut et quo scimus dicitur dupliciter. Duobus enim dicimur scire: quorum unum est scientia, et aliud est anima. Et similiter quo sanamur dicitur de duobus: quorum unum est sanitas, et aliud est aliqua pars corporis, vel etiam totum corpus. Utrobique autem unum est quasi forma, et aliud quasi materia. Nam scientia et sanitas sunt formae et quasi actus susceptivorum: scientia quidem forma scientifici, idest partis animae, in qua est scientia; sanitas vero est forma corporis sanabilis. Ideo autem dicit sanabile et scientificum, ut ostendat aptitudinem in subiecto ad tales formas. Semper enim activorum actus, idest formae, quae inducuntur ab agentibus in materia, videntur esse in patiente et disposito, idest in eo quod est natum pati actiones agentis a tali agente, et quod est dispositum ad consequendum finem passionis, scilicet formam ad quam patiendo perducitur.
          <td>272. The argument itself he sets out in four parts. (1) Explaining the major, he observes that we can speak of the principle of life and sensation from two points of view, formally or materially, just as we speak of the act of knowing as proceeding either from knowledge itself or from the soul; or as we speak of becoming healthy either with respect to health itself, or with respect to some part of the body, or to the whole of it. In both these cases, one of the principles is formal and the other material. For knowledge and health are forms or actualities of certain subjects: knowledge is a form of the part of the soul that knows, health of the body capable of health. Thus he says ‘capable of knowing’ and ‘capable of health’ in order to indicate the, particular subject’s aptitude to its particular form. For the actuality of an active principle, such as the form transmitted to matter by an agent, always appears to exist in what receives it and is adapted to it, i.e. in the subject, whose nature it. is to receive from some one particular active principle, and which is adapted to attain the final term of the receiving-process, namely the form in question.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi, anima autem hoc, ponit minorem propositionem: et dicit, quod anima est primum quo et vivimus, et sentimus, et movemur, et intelligimus. Et referuntur haec quatuor ad quatuor genera vitae de quibus superius fecerat mentionem. Vivere enim refert ad principium vegetativum, quia superius dixerat, quod vivere propter hoc principium inest omnibus viventibus. Sciendum est autem, quod quamvis sanitate et corpore dicamur esse sani, tamen sanitas est primum quo sani dicimur esse. Non enim dicimur esse sani corpore nisi inquantum habet sanitatem. Et similiter scientia est primum quo dicimur esse scientes, quia anima non dicimur esse scientes nisi inquantum habet scientiam. Similiter etiam et corpore non dicimur esse viventes, nisi inquantum habet animam: et propter hoc, hic dicitur, quod anima est primum quo vivimus, sentimus, et cetera.
          <td>273. (2) At ‘and soul being that by which’, he states the minor, saying that the soul is the primary principle of our life and feeling and movement and understanding—these being the four chief manifestations of vitality already mentioned (for by ‘life’ here is meant the vegetative principle which, as has been said, is common to all living things). Now though it is in the body that we enjoy health, health itself is that by which we are called healthy primarily. Only in so far as the body has health are we said to be healthy. So too our souls are not said to know except in so far as they have knowledge; thus knowledge itself is that by which, primarily, the soul is said to be in the state of knowing. And the same is true of our body and its life; we are not said to live by the body except in so far as the body has a soul. Therefore he calls the ‘soul’ here the first principle of life and feeling, etc.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi, quare ratio quaedam, ponit conclusionem, et pendet hucusque constructio ab illo loco quoniam autem quo vivimus et cetera. Concludit ergo ex praedictis, quod anima se habet ut ratio et species, et non sicut materia et subiectum.
          <td>274. (3) He concludes at ‘it follows that the soul’, linking this phrase with the previous one, that the soul is a sort of nature or specific form; not the material for, or mere subject of, anything.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quarto ibi, tripliciter enim dicta substantia, etc., ostendit conclusionem sequi ex praemissis. Non enim videbatur magis sequi de anima, quod sit forma, quam de corpore, cum utroque vivere dicamur: unde ad perfectionem dictae demonstrationis, subiungit, quod cum substantia dicatur tripliciter, ut supra dictum est, scilicet de materia, forma, et composito ex utrisque, quorum materia est potentia, et species sive forma est actus, et compositum ex utrisque est animatum, manifestum est, quod corpus non est actus animae, sed magis anima est actus corporis alicuius: corpus enim est in potentia respectu animae. Et ideo cum consequatur ex praedicta demonstratione, quod vel corpus vel anima sit species: et corpus, ut dictum est, non sit species animae, sequitur quod anima sit species corporis.
          <td>275. (4) Then at ‘Substance is predicated’, I he shows how this conclusion follows from the premises. For it might have seemed to follow that the body no less than the soul was a form, since we call the body also a principle of life. So, to clinch the argument, he adds that if, as we have said, the term ‘substance’ can refer to three things, to matter, to form, and to the complex of both (the matter being the potential element; the form the actuality; and the complex the thing that is alive in this way) the body is clearly not the soul’s actuality, but rather the soul is the body’s; for the body is potential with respect to the soul. And if the foregoing argument has led us to the alternative that the specifying principle is either the soul or the body, we can now conclude that it is the soul; for it is now dear that the body is not the form of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et propter hoc bene inducit quasdam conclusiones ex praemissis: quarum prima est, quod bene opinati sunt, quibus visum est, quod anima non sit sine corpore, neque sit corpus. Non enim est corpus, quia non est materia; sed est aliquid corporis, quia est actus corporis. Et quia omnis actus est in eo cuius est actus, infert consequenter ibi et propter hoc, in corpore.
          <td>276. Then at ‘And on this account’, he deduces from the foregoing: (a) that they were right who thought that the soul required the body and yet was essentially distinct from it. It is not the body, for it is not matter; but it is essentially involved with the body, because it is its actuality; whence too it follows, as he says here, that it exists in that body whose actuality it is.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam conclusionem, scilicet quod anima est in corpore, et tali corpore, scilicet physico, organico, et hoc non est per modum quo priores physici loquebantur de anima et unione eius ad corpus, nihil determinantes in quo vel quali corpore esset. Et vere hoc est, sicut nunc dicimus, quod anima est in determinato corpore, cum non videatur anima accipere quodcumque corpus contingat, sed determinatum. Et hoc rationabiliter accidit; quia unusquisque actus natus est fieri in propria et determinata materia: unde et anima oportet, quod in determinato corpore recipiatur.
          <td>277. (b) Being then in the body, and in a special kind of body, namely physical and organic, it is not, however, in it as the old natural philosophers fancied when they spoke of it. For they did not specify the kind of body that it has. Yet it does in fact have only one kind of body. And this we should expect a priori, it being natural to any act to be realised in some definite and appropriate material. So also, then, with the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo autem epilogando concludit, quod anima est actus quidam et ratio habentis esse huiusmodi, scilicet potentia viventis.
          <td>278. Summarising, he concludes that the soul is a certain actuality and formal principle of that which exists accordingly, namely as potentially animate.

But they are nourished by the other sense-objects only indirectly. Sound, colour and smell contribute nothing to nutrition; and as for savour, it is found in objects of touch. Hunger and thirst being appetites, hunger for the hot and dry and thirst for the cold and liquid, savour is as it were the delectable in these. We must settle these questions later; for the present let us only say that animals endowed with touch have appetition also. The case of imagination is not clear and must be examined later. Some animals, again, have local motion; some intellect and mind—such as men and whatever other beings there are of a like nature, or of one even more excellent. §§ 290-4

            <td>It is therefore clear that the idea of soul must be one in the same way as that of figure: for as there is no figure other than the triangle and those that derive from it, so there is no soul apart from the aforesaid. There will be, however, in the case of figures a general idea applicable to all figures, yet proper to none. Likewise with these souls just mentioned. Hence it is absurd to seek a common definition in this matter (or in any other) which will be that of no existing thing, and on the other hand, to seek to define in terms of the individual species without taking into account such a common definition. There is indeed an analogy between what holds of figures and what holds of the soul. For in that which is consequent there is always potential that which is primary, both in figures and in animate beings. As the triangle is contained in the square, so is the vegetative in the sensitive. §§ 295-8

Et quia superius non nominaverat eas potentias, sed partes animae; ideo manifestat, quod per potentias idem intelligit, quod supra per partes. Quarum quidem sunt quinque genera; scilicet vegetativum, sensitivum, appetitivum, motivum secundum locum, intellectivum.
          <td>279. After defining the soul in general Aristotle comes to treat of its ‘parts’. Now the soul has no parts except in the sense that its potentialities are parts of it; in that one subject, being in potency to many activities, its power with respect to each in particular can be called a part of it. To treat of its parts then is to treat of its various potencies. This he does here in two main sections: the first treats of the soul’s powers in general and their distinction from one another; the second, at ‘Hence we must speak first’, takes them one by one. The former subdivides into (a) a division of the powers of the soul; and (b) at ‘So we must enquire” a discussion of what has to be proved about them, and how and in what order. The division itself of the powers (at ‘it is therefore clear’) necessitates showing how the soul as a whole is related to its parts; but before we come to this, the powers enumerated have to be related to each other, which he does at ‘In plants there is etc.’ First of all, then, he observes that, of the powers already enumerated, all are in some beings (men); some are in some beings (the other animals); and one only is in some others (plants). And having previously called them, not ‘powers’, but ‘parts’ of the soul, he clearly implies that the two terms mean the same. Now of these parts or powers there are five main types: the vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, locomotive and intellectual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Oportet autem haec duo videre. Primo quidem quare ponuntur hic quinque genera potentiarum animae; praecipue cum consuetum sit dici triplicem esse animam, vegetabilem, sensibilem et rationalem. Secundo considerare oportet quare hic ponit quinque cum superius posuerit tantum quatuor.
          <td>280. Regarding this five-fold division two things must be made clear: (1) why the usual threefold division of potencies into vegetative, sensitive and intellectual is set aside; and (2) why he has already made a fourfold division.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum autem circa primum, quod cum omnis potentia dicatur ad actum proprium, potentia operativa dicitur ad actum qui est operatio. Potentiae autem animae sunt operativae, talis enim est potentia formae; unde necesse est secundum diversas operationes animae, accipi diversitatem potentiarum. Operatio autem animae, est operatio rei viventis. Cum igitur unicuique rei competat propria operatio, secundum quod habet esse, eo quod unumquodque operatur inquantum est ens: oportet operationes animae considerare, secundum quod invenitur in viventibus.
          <td>281. As to (1) we should note that all potencies are defined by their proper acts, and operative potencies by activities. The soul, being a form, has operative potencies; hence by differences between its activities we have to differentiate between its potencies. Now, as the activity of anything is consequent upon and corresponds to its being, we have to study vital activities precisely in the living beings which display them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Huiusmodi autem viventia inferiora, quorum actus est anima, de qua nunc agitur, habent duplex esse. Unum quidem materiale, in quo conveniunt cum aliis rebus materialibus. Aliud autem immateriale, in quo communicant cum substantiis superioribus aliqualiter.
          <td>282. The being of things whose actuality is ‘soul’, i.e. of the animate beings that exist on this earth and are the subject of the present discussion, this being includes two factors: one, material, in which it resembles the being of all other material things; and the other, immaterial, by which it has something in common with the world of the higher substances.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est autem differentia inter utrumque esse: quia secundum esse materiale, quod est per materiam contractum, unaquaeque res est hoc solum quod est, sicut hic lapis, non est aliud quam hic lapis: secundum vero esse immateriale, quod est amplum, et quodammodo infinitum, inquantum non est per materiam terminatum, res non solum est id quod est, sed etiam est quodammodo alia. Unde in substantiis superioribus immaterialibus sunt quodammodo omnia, sicut in universalibus causis.
          <td>283. Now there is this difference between these two divisions of being, that in so far as a thing is material, it is restricted by its matter to being this particular thing and nothing else, e.g. a stone; whilst in so far as it is <i>unmaterial</i> , a thing is free from the restriction of matter and has a certain width and infinity, so that it is not merely this particular subject but, in a certain sense, it is other things as well. That is why everything pre-exists, somehow, in the higher immaterial substances, as in universal causes.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Huiusmodi autem immateriale esse, habet duos gradus in istis inferioribus. Nam quoddam est penitus immateriale, scilicet esse intelligibile. In intellectu enim res habent esse, et sine materia, et sine conditionibus materialibus individuantibus, et etiam absque organo corporali. Esse autem sensibile est medium inter utrumque. Nam in sensu res habet esse sine materia, non tamen absque conditionibus materialibus individuantibus, neque absque organo corporali. Est enim sensus particularium, intellectus vero universalium. Et quantum ad hoc duplex esse, dicit philosophus in tertio huius, quod anima est quodammodo omnia.
          <td>284. But in the lower terrestrial natures there are two degrees of immateriality. There is the perfect immateriality of intelligible being; for in the intellect things exist not only without matter, but even without their individuating material conditions, and also apart from any material organ. Then there is the half-way state of sensible being. For as things exist in sensation they are free indeed from matter, but are not without their individuating material conditions, nor apart from a bodily organ. For sensation is of objects in the particular, but intellection of objects universally. It is with reference to these two modes of existence that the philosopher will say, in Book III, that the soul is somehow all things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Operationes igitur, quae competunt viventi secundum esse materiale, sunt operationes quae attribuuntur animae vegetabili: quae tamen licet ad id ordinentur, ad quod etiam ordinantur actiones in rebus inanimatis, scilicet ad consequendum esse et conservandum, tamen in viventibus hoc fit per altiorem et nobiliorem modum. Corpora enim inanimata generantur et conservantur in esse a principio motivo extrinseco; animata vero generantur a principio intrinseco, quod est in semine, conservantur vero a principio nutritivo intrinseco. Hoc enim videtur esse viventium proprium, quod operentur tamquam ex seipsis mota. Operationes autem, quae attribuuntur rebus viventibus secundum esse penitus immateriale, pertinent ad partem animae intellectivam; quae vero attribuuntur eis secundum esse medium, pertinent ad partem animae sensitivam. Et secundum hoc triplex esse distinguitur communiter triplex anima: scilicet vegetabilis, sensibilis et rationalis.
          <td>285. The activities, therefore, appropriate to living things in their material being are those we attribute to the vegetative soul. They fulfil the same purpose as the actions of inanimate beings, i.e. to attain and maintain existence; but they do this in a higher or nobler way. Inanimate bodies are brought into being and maintained by an exterior moving principle, whereas animate beings are generated by an intrinsic principle, i.e. seed, and are kept in existence by an intrinsic nutritive principle. It seems characteristic of living things that their activities should thus proceed from within themselves. But the purely immaterial activities of living things we identify with the intellectual part of the soul; while those in between belong to its sensitive part. Hence it is usual to distinguish three kinds of soul: vegetative, sensitive, intellectual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia omne esse est secundum aliquam formam, oportet, quod esse sensibile sit secundum formam sensibilem, et esse intelligibile secundum formam intelligibilem. Ex unaquaque autem forma sequitur aliqua inclinatio, et ex inclinatione operatio; sicut ex forma naturali ignis, sequitur inclinatio ad locum qui est sursum, secundum quam ignis dicitur levis; et ex hac inclinatione sequitur operatio, scilicet motus qui est sursum. Ad formam igitur tam sensibilem quam intelligibilem sequitur inclinatio quaedam quae dicitur appetitus sensibilis vel intellectualis; sicut inclinatio consequens formam naturalem, dicitur appetitus naturalis. Ex appetitu autem sequitur operatio, quae est motus localis. Haec igitur est ratio, quare oportet esse quinque genera potentiarum animae, quod primo quaerebatur.
          <td>286. But since everything exists as formed in a certain way, the being of the sensible must have a sensible form, and the being of the intelligible an intelligible form. Now every form has by nature a certain trend or tendency whence proceed its activities or operations. Thus the form of fire tends naturally upwards (giving to fire its lightness) whence follows fire’s <i>activity</i> which is the movement upwards. Now the trend that proceeds from a sensible or intellectual form is called sensitive or intellectual <i>desire</i> ; as that of any form in nature is called a natural desire. And from this desire follows the activity of local movement. Here then is the explanation we required of the five-fold division of the powers of soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa secundum sciendum est, quod supra Aristoteles intendens ostendere quod anima est principium vivendi in omnibus viventibus, distinxit ipsum vivere secundum gradus viventium, et non secundum operationes vitae secundum quas distinguuntur haec genera potentiarum. Appetitivum autem non constituit aliquem diversum gradum in viventibus; quia omnia quae habent sensum, habent appetitum; et sic remanent tantum quatuor gradus viventium, ut supra ostensum est.
          <td>287. And as to the second point, note that when Aristotle wished to show that soul was the life-principle in things that five, he divided these into grades; which are not the same as those different kinds of vital activity whence we get our division of the powers of the soul. For, since all things that sense also desire, desire or appetition does not constitute a distinct grade of animate being; so we are left with only four such grades.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit inest autem ostendit, quomodo praedictae potentiae consequuntur se invicem: manifestans quod supra dixerat, quod potentiarum quibusdam insunt omnes, quibusdam quaedam, quibusdam una sola. Ubi considerandum est, quod ad hoc quod universum sit perfectum, nullus gradus perfectionis in rebus intermittitur, sed paulatim natura de imperfectis ad perfecta procedit. Propter quod etiam Aristoteles, in octavo metaphysicae, assimilat species rerum numeris, qui paulatim in augmentum proficiunt. Unde in viventibus quaedam habent unum tantum praedictorum, scilicet plantae, in quibus est solum vegetativum, quod necesse est in omnibus viventibus materialibus esse, quia huic potentiae attribuuntur operationes pertinentes ad esse materiale. Aliis autem, scilicet animalibus, inest vegetativum et sensitivum. Si autem est ibi sensitivum, oportet quod adsit tertium, scilicet appetitivum. Quod quidem dividitur in tria: scilicet desiderium, quod est secundum vim concupiscibilem; et iram, quae est secundum vim irascibilem: qui duo appetitus pertinent ad partem sensitivam: sequuntur enim apprehensionem sensus. Tertium autem est voluntas, quod est appetitus intellectivus, consequens scilicet apprehensionem intellectus.
          <td>288. Then, at ‘In plants there is only’, he shows the interconnection of the powers of the soul, thus explaining what he said previously, that all these powers are in some things, some of them in tome, and only one in some others. Here we have to consider that the completeness of the Universe requires that there should be no gaps in its order, that in Nature there should everywhere be a gradual development from the less to the more perfect. Hence, in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book VIII, Aristotle likens the nature of things to numbers; which increase by tiny degrees, one by one. Thus among living things there are some, i.e. plants, which have only the vegetative capacity,—which, indeed, they must have because no living being could maintain an existence in matter without the vegetative activities. Next are the animals, with sensitivity as well as vegetative life; and sensitivity implies a third power, appetition, which itself divides into three: into <i>desire</i> , in the stricter sense, which springs from the concupiscible appetite; <i>anger</i> , corresponding to the irascible appetite—both of these being in the sensitive part and following sense-knowledge; and finally <i>will</i> , which is the intellectual appetite and follows intellectual apprehension.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem appetitivum insit omnibus animalibus, probat duplici ratione. Quarum prima est, quod omnia animalia habent ad minus unum sensum, scilicet tactum; quibus autem inest sensus, inest laetitia et tristitia, delectatio et dolor. Laetitia enim et tristitia magis videntur sequi apprehensionem interiorem. Sed delectatio et dolor consequuntur apprehensionem sensus, et praecipue sensus tactus. Et si est laetitia et tristitia, necesse est quod sit aliquid triste et dulce, idest delectabile et dolorosum; oportet enim, omne quod sentitur secundum tactum, esse, vel conveniens, et sic est delectabile: vel nocivum, et sic est dolorosum. Quibuscumque autem inest aliquid delectabile et triste, his inest et concupiscentia, quae est appetitus delectabilis; ergo de primo ad ultimum omnibus animalibus, quibus inest sensus tactus, inest appetitus.
          <td>289. That appetition exists in all animals he demonstrates in two ways. (1) All animals have at least one sense, touch; but where there is any sensation there is pleasure and pain, joy and sorrow. Now while joy and sorrow seem to spring from inward apprehension, pain and pleasure come from external sensations, especially from touch. But joy and sorrow necessarily imply some sweet or disagreeable object, i.e. something pleasant or painful. For everything touched is either congenial to the one touching, and then it gives pleasure; or uncongenial, and then it gives pain. But whatever can feel pleasure and pain can desire the pleasant. Since then all animals, without exception, have a sense of touch, all can desire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ad idem ostendendum ponit ibi adhuc autem quae talis est. Omnia animalia habent sensum, quo cognoscunt suum alimentum; scilicet sensum tactus, qui est sensus alimenti. Et quia necessarium est omnibus animalibus uti alimento, ut dictum est; ideo necessarium est, quod habeant sensum tactus quo percipiant alimentum sibi conveniens. Quod autem tactus sit sensus alimenti, manifestum est: sicuti enim corpora viventia constant ex calidis, et humidis, et frigidis, et siccis, ita ex his nutriuntur: tactus autem est sensus discretivus horum. Sed aliis sensibilibus, idest aliis sensibilibus non nutriuntur viventia nisi secundum accidens, inquantum videlicet coniunguntur tangibilibus. Sonus enim et odor et color nihil conferunt in alimentum inquantum huiusmodi, sed solum inquantum contingit colorata et odorata et sonantia esse calida vel frigida, humida vel sicca: humor autem, idest sapor, est quoddam de numero tangibilium qualitatum, sicut et gustus est quidam tactus. Sic igitur patet, quod omnia animalia habent sensum alimenti.
          <td>290. (2) This second argument begins at ‘Further, all have’ and runs thus. All animals have the sense that is aware of food; and this is touch; which is as necessary therefore to every animal as eating the food that agrees with it. The fact that it is touch that perceives food is clear if we consider that, as living bodies are made up of warm, moist, cold and dry elements it is of these that their food must consist; and these elements are just what touch is aware of. But other sense-objects’, he says, do not, save indirectly, nourish living bodies; they do so only so far as they are involved in the objects of touch. Sound, colour, smell have nothing to do with food as such; they occur in food only in so far as things that sound or are coloured or odorous, are also hot, or cold, moist or dry. Savour, however, is reckoned a tangible quality—so that tasting is a sort of touch. Clearly, then, all animals have a sense-awareness of food.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quibuscumque autem inest sensus alimenti, his inest esuries et sitis: quorum utrumque est concupiscentia alimenti: esuries quidem est concupiscentia calidi et sicci, quod habet rationem cibi: sitis autem frigidi et humidi, quod habet rationem potus. Sapor autem est quoddam horum delectamentum: sapor enim delectabilis indicat convenientem proportionem calidi et frigidi, humidi et sicci in alimento. Unde magis pertinet ad delectationem alimenti, quam ad necessitatem. Sic igitur ubicumque est sensus tactus, est etiam appetitus.
          <td>291. But whatever has this awareness can feel the two desires of nourishment, hunger and thirst. Hunger is desire for the hot and the dry elements, i.e. food; thirst for the cold and the moist, i.e. drink. Savour is a certain delectability in food and drink indicating a proper balance of the hot and cold, the moist and dry elements. It is more of a pleasure added to eating than a necessity. Desire, then, always accompanies touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quomodo autem phantasia se habet ad appetitivum et sensitivum, posterius dicetur.
          <td>292. What imagination has to do with desire and sensitivity will be shown later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quibusdam autem animalibus, supra haec tria, scilicet vegetativum, sensitivum et appetitivum, inest etiam motivum secundum locum. Aliis vero supra haec quatuor inest etiam intellectivum et intellectus ipse, scilicet hominibus, et si aliquod aliud genus rerum est simile hominibus, aut etiam honorabilius hominibus. Invenitur autem aliquid honorabilius hominibus, quibus inest intellectus; est enim in substantiis separatis, et in corporibus caelestibus, si tamen sunt animata: licet in viventibus mortalibus non est aliquod genus viventium habentium intellectivum, nisi in specie humana.
          <td>293. Now besides these three powers, the vegetative, the sensitive and the appetitive, some animals also have the capacity to move from one place to another. Some, too, i.e. human beings and any other kind of beings, if such exist, resembling or even perhaps excelling mankind, have, in addition to these four capacities, the power of understanding or intellect. The beings ‘more excellent’ are the immaterial substances and the heavenly bodies, the latter, however, only if they are alive. Among living corruptible beings the human race alone is endowed with intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cum enim intellectus non habeat organum corporale, non possunt diversificari habentia intellectum secundum diversam complexionem organorum, sicut diversificantur species sensitivorum secundum diversas complexiones, quibus diversimode se habent ad operationes sensus.
          <td>294. For as intellect has no bodily organ, intelligent beings cannot be differentiated according to a physical diversity in the constitution of their bodily organs, as are the different species of animals (whose different constitutions cause them to sense in different ways).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit manifestum igitur ostendit qualiter se habet praedicta definitio animae ad partes enumeratas. Et ad huius intellectum, sciendum est, quod Plato posuit universalia esse separata secundum esse; tamen in illis, quae se habent consequenter, non posuit unam ideam communem, sicut in numeris et figuris: non enim posuit unam ideam numeri praeter omnes numeros, sicut posuit unam ideam hominis praeter omnes homines, eo quod numerorum species naturali ordine consequenter se habent. Et sic prima earum, scilicet dualitas, est causa omnium consequentium. Unde non oportet ponere aliquam ideam communem numeris, ad causandum speciem numerorum. Et similis ratio est de figuris. Nam eius species consequenter se habent, sicut et species numerorum: trigonum enim est ante tetragonum, et tetragonum ante pentagonum.
          <td>295. Then at ‘It is therefore clear’ he shows how his definition of soul is related to the ‘parts’ that we have enumerated. To understand him here we must remember what Plato said about universal ideas, that they had a separate existence of their own. He did not say, however, that objects which follow successively from each other, such as numbers and geometrical figures, had a universal idea, i.e. he did not posit a universal idea of Number apart from particular numbers—as, for him, there was a universal idea of Man in addition to all existing men; and this because the classes of number are, of their nature, derived successively from each other, so that the first of these, duality, is the cause of all the rest. There is no need to posit a general idea of Number as the cause of the numerical species. The same argument applies to geometrical figures. They follow each other in the same way as numbers: from the triangle comes the tetragon, and from the latter the pentagon.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo manifestum esse, quod eodem modo una est ratio animae, sicut una est ratio figurae. Sicuti enim inter figuras non est aliqua figura quae sit praeter triangulum et alias species consequentes, utpote quae sit communis omnium figurarum, ita nec in proposito est aliqua anima, quasi separata existens praeter omnes praedictas partes.
          <td>296. Aristotle, then, says that the idea of Soul is one in the same way as that of geometrical figure is one. just as there is no figure existing apart from the triangle and the rest, as their common idea, so it is with the soul. There exists’ no soul apart from the parts which have been enumerated.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quamvis non sit una figura separata in esse praeter omnes figuras, etiam secundum Platonicos, qui ponunt species communes separatas; tamen invenitur una ratio communis, quae convenit omnibus figuris, et non est propria alicuius earum; ita est et in animalibus. Et ideo ridiculum est, quod homo quaerat unam rationem communem, tam in animalibus, quam in aliis rebus, quae non conveniat alicui animarum quae sunt in rerum natura particulariter. Neque etiam est conveniens, quod homo quaerat definitionem animae, secundum unamquamque speciem animae, et dimittat definitionem communem omnibus. Ergo neque definitio communis animae praetermittenda fuit; neque sic est assignanda definitio communis animae quod non conveniat singulis animabus.
          <td>297. But while, there is (even for the Platonists), no figure existing apart from all figures, nevertheless one common definition can be found which answers to all figures, without being proper to any particular one. And the same is true of living beings. It would be ludicrous therefore to seek a common definition, whether of animals or anything else, which did not fit any particular living thing actually existing. On the other hand it will not do to look for a definition that will fit only one sort of soul, ignoring what all have in common. We need a common definition which must, however, be applicable to souls in particular.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia dixerat, quod eodem modo se habet ratio animae sicut ratio figurae, ostendit convenientiam inter utrumque: et dicit quod similiter se habent figurae et animae adinvicem: in utrisque enim illud quod est prius, est in potentia in eo quod est consequenter. Manifestum est enim in figuris, quod trigonum, quod est prius, est potentia in tetragono. Potest enim tetragonum dividi in duos trigonos. Et similiter in anima sensitiva, vegetativa est quasi quaedam potentia eius, et quasi anima per se. Et similiter est de aliis figuris, et aliis partibus animae.
          <td>298. He goes on now to show the resemblance between the two definitions, namely of soul and of geometrical figure. In both cases what comes first is potentially in what follows. In figures the three-sided figure exists potentially in the square; for the square is divisible into two triangles. Likewise the sensitive life-principle contains the vegetative, both as potential, as it were, with respect to sensitivity, and also as a certain life-principle in itself. The same holds good with the other figures and the other divisions of soul.

          <br>
          LECTIO 6</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus enumeravit genera potentiarum animae, et quomodo se habet definitio communis animae supra posita ad partes eius, hic ostendit quid aliud modo determinandum sit, et quo ordine. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima ostendit quid determinandum restat de anima. Secundo ostendit quo ordine determinare oporteat, ibi, necessarium autem est debentem. Circa primum ostendit duo restare ad determinandum: quorum unum concludit ex praedictis. Dictum est supra, quod sicut non est quaerenda talis definitio communis animae, quae nulli animae partium conveniat, ita non debemus esse contenti definitione communi, sed oportet propriam definitionem cuiuslibet partis animae inquirere. Et ex hoc concludit, quod hoc, secundum unumquodque animatum quaerendum est, quae sit uniuscuiusque anima; ut scilicet sciatur quid est anima plantae, et quid anima hominis, et quid anima bestiae: et hoc est scire de unaquaque parte animae, quid sit.
          <td>299. After enumerating the powers of the soul and showing how the general definition given above is related to the particular divisions. of soul, the Philosopher now explains what remains to be cleared up and in what order. There are, he says, still two points to be made clear, one of which links up with the argument just given. For we have seen that, just as we must not be satisfied with a completely general definition of soul, such as will not express any of its particular realisations, so too we cannot rest content even with a definition which does answer in some way to these latter; we must pursue our enquiry until we shall have defined precisely what is proper to each of these divisions of soul in particular. Whence it follows that we have to ask about each particular type of living being—plant or man or animal—what is its own particular life-principle; thus applying and particularising our common notion of soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi propter quam ponit aliud, quod restat ad determinandum. Dictum est enim supra, quod partes animae consequenter se habent adinvicem, sicut species figurae. Sed considerandum est propter quam causam partes animae hoc modo se habeant consequenter. Huiusmodi enim causam in fine libri assignabit. Exponit autem qualiter se habeant consequenter: quia sensitivum non potest esse sine vegetativo, sed vegetativum separatur a sensitivo in plantis. Nec est mirum; quia supradictum est; quod opera vegetativi ordinantur ad adipiscendum et conservandum esse, quod subiacet quasi fundamentum. Iterum etiam consequentia quaedam invenitur in ipsis sensibus; quia sine sensu tactus, nullus aliorum sensuum esse potest; tactus autem invenitur sine aliis sensibus. Multa enim animalium, neque visum habent, neque auditum, neque sensum odoratus, sed solum tactum. Et hoc etiam rationabiliter accidit. Nam tactus est sensus perceptivus eorum quae pertinent ad consistentiam animalis, ex quibus scilicet animal constat et nutritur. Alia vero sensibilia non conferunt ad hoc nisi per accidens. Unde alii sensus non sunt de necessitate animalis, et propter hoc non inveniuntur in omnibus animalibus, sed in perfectis.
          <td>300. Then at ‘It must be considered’, he states the next point to be decided. He has already said that the parts of the soul follow each other in a series like the kinds of geometrical figure; and it remains to consider the reason for this. This reason will be given at the end of the Treatise; here he only shows how the parts of soul follow one from the other successively. The sensitive part, he says, cannot exist without the vegetative, but the latter can, in plants, exist without the sensitive. And this is not surprising; for, as we have seen, the purpose of the vegetative activities is to attain and retain existence itself, which is the ground of all the rest, as it were. And the senses display a like sequence; there. are no senses at an unless there is touch; but touch itself can exist without the others. Many animals neither see, nor hear, nor smell, but only touch. And this will appear quite reasonable if we consider that by touch an animal is aware of the elements of which its substance consists (what it consists of and is nourished by), with which elements the other senses are only indirectly concerned. Hence the latter are not necessary for all animals, and in fact are found only in the higher animals.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est etiam consideranda consequentia sensitivi et motivi. Nam motivum non potest esse sine sensitivo: sensitivum autem potest esse sine motivo: aliqua enim habentium sensum, habent etiam motum secundum locum, sed aliqua non habent. Sed intelligendum est de motu progressivo animalium secundum quod animalia moventur de loco ad locum. Hic enim motus non inest omnibus animalibus. Sed quae carent hoc motu, habent aliquem motum localem, scilicet dilatationis et constrictionis, sicut apparet in ostreis.
          <td>301. Again, there is the connection between sensitive and motive powers. Motive power cannot exist without sensitive, but the converse is not true. Some sentient beings move from place to place, but not all. We are speaking of the progressive movement of animals from one place to another; which is not found in all ,animals; though such as lack it show certain local movements of expansion and contraction—for instance, shellfish.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Illud autem, quod est ultimum inter omnes partes animae et minimum, quia non dividitur in diversa secundum speciem, est, quod habet rationem et intellectum, quia quibuscumque de numero corruptibilium inest ratio, his insunt et omnia alia praedicta. Hoc autem dicit, ut praeservet se a substantiis separatis, et a corporibus caelestibus si sunt animata: quia cum sint sine generatione et corruptione, non indigent vegetativo. Iterum, eorum intellectus per se speculatur ea quae sunt secundum se intelligibilia: unde non indigent sensibus ad cognitionem intellectivam consequendam. Sed in mortalibus habentibus intellectum, necesse est omnia alia praeexistere, sicut quaedam instrumenta, et praeparatoria ad intellectum, qui est ultima perfectio intenta in operatione naturae. Non autem omnibus quibus inest aliquod praedictorum, inest et ratio. Et quia imaginatio videtur habere quamdam affinitatem ad intellectum, cum supra dictum sit, quod intellectus, vel est phantasia quaedam, vel non sine phantasia; addit de imaginatione; et dicit quod quibusdam animalibus non solum non inest intellectus, sed non etiam imaginatio.
          <td>The ultimate division of soul—and the least extensive since it is not subdivided into different species—is that which has the power of reason and understanding; because where reason exists in mortal beings, there also are found all the other aforesaid powers. He says ‘mortal’ to exclude immaterial substances and the heavenly bodies (if these are alive) which, as neither being born nor dying, do not need the vegetative power; and as being able to understand by a direct intuition of the intelligible object, do not require sense-knowledge as a preliminary condition of understanding; whereas in corruptible natures all the sub-intellectual powers are presupposed as instruments preparing the way for intellect, which is the final perfection of Nature. But these sub-intellectual powers do not necessarily imply reason in the subjects that possess them. And in view of the affinity between intellect and imagination (as he said above, intellect either is, or is accompanied by, imagination), he adds that some animals lack not only intellect but also imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Videtur tamen hoc esse contrarium ei quod supra dixerat: quia si pars decisa habet sensum et appetitum, habet etiam phantasiam; si tamen phantasia est idem cum imaginatione, ut videtur. Dicendum est igitur, quod animalia imperfecta, ut in tertio dicetur, habent quidem phantasiam, sed indeterminatam, quia scilicet motus phantasiae non remanet in eis post apprehensionem sensus: in animalibus autem perfectis remanet motus phantasiae, etiam abeuntibus sensibilibus. Et secundum hoc, dicitur hic quod imaginatio non est eadem omnibus animalibus. Sed quaedam animalia sunt, quae hac sola vivunt, carentia scilicet intellectu, et directa in suis operationibus per imaginationem, sicut nos dirigimur per intellectum. Et licet non omnibus animalibus insit imaginatio, sicut nec intellectus, tamen de intellectu speculativo est alia ratio quam de imaginatione. Differunt enim adinvicem, ut infra patebit.
          <td>302. Now this might seem to contradict a previous remark of his, that if a part cut from an animal retains sensation and desire, it retains also images—if the latter imply imagination, as seems likely. We must therefore say that (as will be shown in Book III)3 the lower animals have indeed a sort of imagination but indeterminately: i.e. the activity of imagining does not, in them, outlast actual sense-apprehension, as it does in the higher animals which retain images of things sensed after these have been removed. Thus, as he says here, imagination varies in different animals. Some animals, lacking reason, live only by imagination, being led by it as we are led by reason. And though certain other animals lack both imagination and speculative intelligence, these two powers are not the same, as we shall see.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est igitur quod de unaquaque parte animae propriissime dicitur haec definitio, quae assignata est de anima.
          <td>Clearly, then, the definition of the soul which has been given applies very precisely to each part of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit necessarium autem ostendit quo ordine determinandum sit de partibus animae. Et assignat ordinem, quantum ad duo. Primo quantum ad hoc, quod ille qui debet de partibus animae perscrutari, primo debet accipere unumquodque horum, quid est: et postea debet considerare de habitis, idest consequentibus partibus, et de aliis quae sunt consideranda circa partes animae et circa ipsa animata, sicut de organis, et de aliis huiusmodi. Et iste ordo necessarius est; quia si simul de omnibus determinaretur, esset confusa doctrina.
          <td>303. Then, at ‘It is necessary’, he shows the order to be followed in examining the parts of soul. From one point of view, he explains, the first thing to do is to define the nature of each of these parts; and then consider ‘habits’, i.e. whatever other parts of soul derive from them, and anything else pertaining to them and to whatever they animate, such as the organs of the body and things of that kind. This procedure is necessary to avoid confusion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum tangit ibi si autem dicens, quod si oportet de aliqua parte animae dicere quid est, scilicet quid est intellectivum, aut sensitivum, aut vegetativum, prius oportet dicere de actibus, scilicet quid sit intelligere, et quid sentire. Et hoc ideo, quia secundum rationem definitivam, actus et operationes sunt priores potentiis. Potentia enim, secundum hoc ipsum quod est, importat habitudinem quamdam ad actum: est enim principium quoddam agendi vel patiendi: unde oportet, quod actus ponantur in definitionibus potentiarum. Et si ita se habet circa ordinem actus et potentiae, et actibus adhuc sunt priora opposita, idest obiecta.
          <td>304. Then, at ‘But if etc.’, he observes that, from another point of view, our definition of any part of the soul—intellect or sensitivity or vegetativity—must begin from the act of the part in question, e.g. understanding or actual sensation; because in idea acts and operations precede potentialities. Potentiality is nothing but a capacity to act or be acted upon; it essentially involves a relation to actuality and can only be defined in such terms. And if this is the case with acts and potencies, acts in their turn connote something prior to themselves, i.e. their objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Species enim actuum et operationum sumuntur secundum ordinem ad obiecta. Omnis enim animae operatio, vel est actus potentiae activae, vel passivae. Obiecta quidem potentiarum passivarum comparantur ad operationes earum ut activa, quia reducunt potentias in actum, sicut visibile visum, et omne sensibile sensum. Obiecta vero potentiarum activarum comparantur ad operationes ipsarum ut fines. Obiecta enim potentiarum activarum, sunt operata ipsarum. Manifestum est autem, quod in quibuscumque praeter operationes sunt aliqua operata, quod operata sunt fines operationum, ut dicitur in primo Ethic.: sicut domus quae aedificatur, est finis aedificationis. Manifestum est igitur, quod omne obiectum comparatur ad operationem animae, vel ut activum, vel ut finis. Ex utroque autem specificatur operatio.
          <td>305. For the type of every act or operation is determined by an object. Every operation of the soul is the act of a potentiality—either active or passive. Now the objects of passive potentialities stand to these as the causal agents which bring each potentiality into its proper activity; and it is thus that visible objects, and indeed all sensible things, are related to sight and to the other senses. But the objects of the active capacities are related to these as the final terms attained by their activities; for in this case the object is what each of these activities effectively realises. It is obvious that whenever an activity effectively realises anything besides the activity itself, the thing thus realised is the final term of the activity (cf. the <i>Ethics</i> , Book I); for example a house is the final term of building. Hence all the objects of the soul’s activities are either causal agents or final terms; and in both respects they specify those activities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est enim, quod diversa activa secundum speciem, habent operationes specie differentes, sicut calefactio est a calore, et infrigidatio a frigore. Similiter etiam ex termino et fine specificatur operatio; sicut sanatio et aegrotatio differunt specie, secundum differentiam sanitatis et aegritudinis. Sic igitur obiecta sunt priora operationibus animae in via definiendi.
          <td>For, obviously, specifically diverse causal agents do specifically diverse things—as heat heats and cold chills. And so also with the final term of activity: becoming well or becoming ill differ as ‘doings’, because health differs from illness. Thus in the work of seeking definitions we have to consider the objects of the soul’s operations before these operations themselves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde et prius oportebit determinare de obiectis quam de actibus, propter eamdem causam, propter quam et de actibus prius determinatur quam de potentiis. Obiecta autem sunt sicut alimentum respectu vegetativi, et sensibile respectu sensus, et intelligibile respectu intellectus.
          <td>306. We ought, therefore, to reach conclusions about objects before activities for the same reason as leads us to define activities before potencies. The ‘objects’ in question are such things as food and sensible being and intelligible being, with respect to the vegetative, sensitive and intellectual faculties respectively.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed sciendum est, quod ex obiectis diversis non diversificantur actus et potentiae animae, nisi quando fuerit differentia obiectorum inquantum sunt obiecta, id est secundum rationem formalem obiecti, sicut visibile ab audibili. Si autem servetur eadem ratio obiecti, quaecumque alia diversitas non inducit diversitatem actuum secundum speciem et potentiae. Eiusdem enim potentiae est videre hominem coloratum et lapidem coloratum; quia haec diversitas per accidens se habet in obiecto inquantum est obiectum.
          <td>307. But note that the activities and powers of soul are not distinguished with respect to distinct objects except precisely in so far as these are objects. For instance, visible being differs from audible being precisely as object. But if there is no difference as object, then it does not matter what other differences there may be; they win not essentially affect the kind of activity or potentiality. Thus by the same faculty we see a coloured man and a coloured stone; the difference is merely incidental to the object of the faculty.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum est etiam, quod intellectus noster possibilis est in potentia tantum in ordine intelligibilium: fit autem actu per formam a phantasmatibus abstractam. Nihil autem cognoscitur nisi secundum quod est actu: unde intellectus possibilis noster cognoscit seipsum per speciem intelligibilem, ut in tertio habetur, non autem intuendo essentiam suam directe. Et ideo oportet, quod in cognitionem animae procedamus ab his quae sunt magis extrinseca, a quibus abstrahuntur species intelligibiles, per quas intellectus intelligit seipsum; ut scilicet per obiecta cognoscamus actus, et per actus potentias, et per potentias essentiam animae. Si autem directe essentiam suam cognosceret anima per seipsam, esset contrarius ordo servandus in animae cognitione; quia quanto aliquid esset propinquius essentiae animae, tanto prius cognosceretur ab ea.
          <td>308. Note too that our intellectual potency is, as such, only potentially intelligible; in order to be understood it must be actualised through an idea drawn from sensible images. A thing is knowable only in the degree that it is actual; hence our intellectual potency attains to self-knowledge only through possessing an intelligible object in a concept (as will be explained in Book III), and not by directly intuiting its own essence. This is why the process of self-knowledge has to start from the exterior things whence the mind draws the intelligible concepts in which it perceives itself; so we proceed from objects to acts, from acts to faculties, and from faculties to essence. But if the soul could know its essence in itself and directly it would be better to follow the reverse procedure; for in that case the closer anything was to the soul’s essence, the more directly could it be known by the soul.

To this extent do they participate, as far as they are able, in the imperishable and the divine. For this all things seek after, doing all that they do by nature for the sake of this. Now ‘that for the sake of which’ anything takes place, is twofold, one, the end ‘for which’, the other the end ‘in which’. Since then they cannot share by a continuous being, in the divine and everlasting (since nothing corruptible remains for ever numerically one and the same) each shares in this as far as it is able, one, however, more, and another less. And thus it endures, not the same, but as if the same; one indeed, but in species, not numerically. §§311-17

This he does in two stages. First, he examines one by one the divisions into which he has analysed soul, coming to certain conclusions about all of them.

          <td>Treatise (1) divides into two parts: the first part contains certain preliminaries to the study of the vegetative principle; the second, beginning at ‘Since the vegetative and generative’ [II, 9: §333], contains Aristotle’s conclusions on this matter. The former section again divides into (a) a statement of his aim, and (b) at ‘For the most natural’ [§311] an exposition of certain things which an understanding of the vegetative principle presupposes.

          <td>Concludit ergo primo ex praedictis, quod cum dicendum sit primo de obiectis et actibus, quam de potentiis: et primo de prima potentia, quam de consequentibus; sequitur quod primo dicendum est de alimento, quod est obiectum animae vegetativae, et de generatione, quae est actus eius. Ideo primo dicendum est de obiecto et actu huiusmodi partis, quam aliarum: quia ista pars est prima inter alias partes animae in subiectis in quibus invenitur cum aliis: est enim quasi fundamentum aliarum, sicut esse naturale ad quod pertinent operationes eius, est fundamentum esse sensibilis et intelligibilis. Et alia ratio est, quare prius de ea dicendum est; quia ipsa est communis omnibus viventibus: ipsa enim separatur ab aliis, sed aliae non separantur ab ea, et de communibus prius est agendum. Huiusmodi autem partis opera sunt: generare, et alimento uti; et ideo de istis primo agendum est.
          <td>310. (a) First of all, then, he remarks that if, as we saw in the last chapter, objects and acts have to be defined before potencies, and the fundamental potency before those which follow from it, we ought in consequence to begin by discussing nourishment, the object with which the vegetative principle deals, and generation, which is this principle’s activity. Now this principle should be discussed first; because, whenever it coexists in one subject with the other parts. of ‘soul’, it is as it were their foundation; for through its activities the physical reality, underlying both sensitivity and intelligence, is maintained. Besides, this part of ‘soul’ is common to all living things, and while it can exist apart from the others, they cannot exist without it; and it is always best to start with the more general datum. Its activities, then, being reproduction and taking nourishment, it is with these that we begin.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit naturalissimum enim determinat quaedam quae praeexiguntur ad cognitionem partis vegetativae. Et dividitur in duas partes. In prima ostendit, quod generare pertinet ad partem vegetativam: quod ideo necessarium fuit quia supra huic parti non attribuit generationem, sed solum augmentum et decrementum. In secunda ostendit, quod opera potentiae vegetativae sint ab anima: quod ideo necessarium fuit, quia cum his operibus deserviant qualitates activae vel passivae, posset alicui videri, quod essent a natura, et non ab anima; et praecipue quia in plantis est vita occulta et latens, et hoc ibi, est autem anima viventis corporis, et cetera.
          <td>3 11. (b) Next, when he says ‘For the most natural’ he settles a few preliminary questions; and this in two stages. First, he shows that to generate one’s kind is an act of the vegetative principle. This he had not yet shown, having spoken so far only of growth and decay in this connection. Next, at ‘The soul is cause’, he proves that a soul is the principle of all vegetative activities (for indeed these activities might have seemed to come from mere nature, and not from a life-principle, since it is of their essence that they make use of the active and passive physical and corporeal qualities; and still more, because life in plants is hard to discern and latent).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primum ostendit tali ratione. Omnis operatio, quae naturaliter invenitur in omnibus viventibus, pertinet ad potentiam vegetativam, secundum quam primo vivere inest omnibus, ut dictum est: sed generare naturaliter inest omnibus viventibus: ergo pertinet ad potentiam vegetativam. Dicit ergo, quod ideo generare est opus animae vegetativae, quia inter alia opera est magis naturale omnibus viventibus. Et dicitur naturalissimum, quia in hoc convenit etiam cum aliis rebus inanimatis, quae generationem habent, licet alio modo: habent enim inanimata generationem ab extrinseco generante; sed viventia a principio intrinseco, inquantum generantur ex semine, quod proficit in rem vivam.
          <td>312. The first point is proved thus. All activities found to be natural to all living things spring, as we have seen, from the vegetative principle as the fundamental condition of there being any life at all; and reproduction being one such activity, it must spring from the vegetative principle. Indeed, he relates reproduction to this principle because it is, as he says, the activity most natural to all living things; and this because in a certain way the process of generation is common to all beings, even to inanimate things. Of course the latter are generated differently; still, they are generated. But with them the generating principle is something quite exterior to the thing that comes into being, whereas animate things proceed from an, interior principle inasmuch as they spring from the seed with its potentiality for new life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed ab ista generalitate viventium excipiuntur tria, quibus hoc opus non competit. Primo illa quae sunt imperfecta, sicut pueri non generant. Quod enim potest alterum facere tale quale ipsum est, in unoquoque genere, perfectum est. Secundo excipit illa quae patiuntur aliquem defectum alicuius principii naturalis, sicut sunt spadones et frigidi. Tertio animalia et plantae quae generantur sine semine ex putrefactione. In his enim, propter sui imperfectionem sufficit ad eorum productionem agens universale, scilicet virtus corporis caelestis, et materia disposita. In animalibus autem perfectis plura requiruntur principia; non enim agens universale sufficit, sed requiritur agens proprium univocum.
          <td>313. There are, however, three exceptions to the general rule that living things reproduce their kind. First, the immature; for children do not beget. Secondly, those defective in some essential requirement, such as the impotent and eunuchs. Thirdly, the case of spontaneous generation from putrefying matter. In this last case the life resulting is of a type so inferior that the general environment suffices to cause it, i.e. the influence of the heavenly bodies and the right material conditions. But these causes alone are not sufficient to generate the higher animals: this requires also the activity of particular causes of the same species as the animals generated.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo, quod viventia possunt facere alterum quale ipsa sunt quaecumque sunt perfecta ad excludendum pueros: et non orbata: ad excludendum eunuchos, et habentes similes defectus: aut quaecumque non habent generationem spontaneam: ad excludendum ea quae generantur ex putrefactione, quae dicuntur quasi sponte nasci, quia producuntur ex terra sine semine, per illam similitudinem, qua dicitur aliquis sponte facere illud, ad quod extrinseco non inducitur. Sic autem intelligitur, quod res viva facit alterum quale ipsum est, quia animal facit animal, et planta plantam. Et ulterius secundum speciem tale animal facit tale animal, ut homo generat hominem, et oliva olivam. Ideo autem est naturale viventibus facere alterum tale quale ipsum est, ut semper participent, secundum quod possunt, divino et immortali, id est ut assimilentur ei secundum posse.
          <td>314. Hence he says that any living thing can reproduce its kind provided that it is ‘mature’ (excluding children) and not ‘defective’ (excluding eunuchs and such like) and that the effect generated is not ‘spontaneously generated’ (excluding things produced by putrefaction, which are said to come to be ‘spontaneously’ because they spring up without seed, which is something like the way things are done, as we say, spontaneously, i.e. not under exterior compulsion). And what he means by living things producing their like is that animals produce animals and plants plants; and more precisely that each species produces its like, men producing men and olive-trees olive-trees. And the reason why living things produce their like is that they may continuously participate, so far as they can, in what is divine and immortal, i.e. that they may become as like to the divine as possible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est enim, quod sicut sunt diversi gradus perfectionis in aliquo uno et eodem, quod exit de potentia in actum, ita etiam sunt diversi gradus perfectionis in diversis entibus: unde quanto aliquid fuerit magis perfectum, tanto perfectioribus magis assimilatur. Sicut igitur unumquodque quando fuerit exiens de potentia in actum, cum fuerit in potentia, ordinatur ad actum, et appetit ipsum naturaliter, et cum fuerit in actu minus perfecte desiderat actum perfectiorem: ita unumquodque, quod est in inferiori gradu rerum, desiderat assimilari superioribus, quantum potest. Et hoc est quod subiungit, quod omnia appetunt illud, scilicet assimilari divino et immortali, et illius causa agunt, quaecumque naturaliter agunt.
          <td>315. For just as there are degrees of perfection in one and the same being, inasmuch as it develops from potentiality into act, so there are more and less perfect beings; and therefore the more perfect a given thing is in itself, the more does it resemble the more perfect beings. Hence just as, while a thing is moving from potency to actuality, and as long as it is still in potency, it has a natural relation and inclination towards actuality, and when it attains incomplete actuality it still desires a more complete actuality, so, in the same way, everything in a lower form of existence is inclined to the maximum possible assimilation to the higher form. Hence Aristotle adds that ‘all things seek this’, i.e. an assimilation to what is divine and imperishable, and this is that ‘for the sake of which they do all that they do by nature’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed intelligendum est, quod id cuius causa agitur, dicitur dupliciter. Uno modo id cuius causa agitur directe, sicut sanitatis causa agit medicus: alio modo sicut quo. Quod potest intelligi dupliciter. Uno modo, ut intelligamus, quod finis dicitur, et subiectum habens id cuius causa agitur, ut si dicamus, quod finis medicinae est, non tantum sanitas, sed etiam corpus habens sanitatem; alio modo ut dicamus, quod finis est, non tantum principale intentum, sed etiam illud quo illud adipiscimur, ut si dicamus, quod finis medicinae est calefacere corpus, quia a calore habetur aequalitas complexionis, quae est sanitas. Sic igitur et hoc potest dici, quod ipsum esse perpetuum est cuius causa agitur, vel res habens perpetuitatem, cui naturalia intendunt assimilari per generationem, in quo scilicet est perpetuitas, vel etiam ipsa generatio, qua perpetuitatem adipiscuntur.
          <td>316. Now ‘that for the sake of which’ something is done can mean two things: (a) the end aimed at directly by an activity, as health is the direct aim of doctoring; and (b) as the end aimed at indirectly; and this again may be taken in two ways. For we might take the ‘end’ to include also that subject in which the activity’s direct aim is realised, and in this sense the end of doctoring would be not health merely, but a healthy body. Alternately, we could mean by ‘end’ not only what is principally intended, but also the means to be employed; we might say, e.g. that the end of doctoring was to keep the body warm, because warmth preserves that harmony of elements in the body which is health. So then, when it is said here that perpetuity of being is the reason for the activity in question, we are referring either to some imperishable nature which material things strive, by reproducing their kind, to resemble, or to the reproductive process itself, which is the means to this end.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia igitur non possunt communicare inferiora viventia ipsi esse sempiterno et divino, per modum continuationis, idest ut maneant eadem numero, propter hoc quod nihil corruptibilium contingit unum et idem numero permanere semper, et cum necessitas corruptionis sit necessitas absoluta, utpote proveniens ex ipsa materia, non ex fine, sequitur, quod unumquodque communicet perpetuitate secundum quod potest: hoc quidem magis, quod est diuturnius: illud vero minus, quod est minus diuturnum, et tamen permanet semper per generationem, non idem simpliciter, sed ut idem, id est in simili secundum speciem. Unde exponens quod dixerat, subdit quod non permanet unum numero, quod est esse unum simpliciter; sed permanet idem specie, quia unumquodque generat sibi simile secundum speciem.
          <td>317. Because, then, the lower forms of life are unable to share in the perpetual, divine being by way of continuity of their individual identity—since it is absolutely and intrinsically necessary (not merely a necessity imposed from without) that all corruptible things should individually pass away since they are intrinsically material—it follows that they can only share in it so far as their nature allows; the more lasting natures more, the less lasting less; but all sharing in it continuously by way of reproduction; each remaining one and the same, not indeed literally, but ‘as if the same’ in the sense that one and the same species remains. Hence he adds that it does not remain one thing numerically, i.e. in the strict sense of the terms, but only specifically; and this because each individual reproduces its like according to species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem ostendit quod opera, quae attribuuntur potentiae vegetativae, sunt ab anima. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit veritatem. Secundo excludit errorem, ibi, Empedocles autem non bene dixit, et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo proponit quod intendit: et dicit, quod anima est principium et causa viventis corporis. Et cum principium et causa dicatur multipliciter, anima dicitur tribus modis principium et causa viventis corporis. Uno modo, sicut unde est principium motus. Alio modo, sicut cuius causa, idest finis. Tertio, sicut substantia, id est forma corporum animatorum.
          <td>318. Then, at ‘The soul is the cause’, he shows the connection between the activities attributed to the vegetative principle and the soul. And he does two things here: first, he establishes a truth; secondly, at ‘Empedocles’, he points out an error. The proof of the truth, again, has two stages. First, he states his aim, asserting that the soul is principle and cause of the living body; and since these terms are ambiguous, going on to distinguish three senses in which this proposition is to be taken. Soul, he says, is cause of the living body, (a) as the source of its movements, (b) as ‘that for the sake of which’, or end, and (c) as its ‘essence’ or form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi quod igitur probat quod supposuerat. Et primo, quod anima sit causa viventis corporis, ut forma: et hoc duplici ratione: quarum prima talis est. Illud est causa alicuius ut substantia, idest, ut forma, quod est causa essendi. Nam per formam unumquodque est actu. Sed anima viventibus est causa essendi; per animam enim vivunt, et ipsum vivere est esse eorum: ergo anima est causa viventis corporis, ut forma.
          <td>319. in the second place, at ‘That it is’, he proves his proposition; and first with regard to soul being the cause of the living body as its form. Here he uses two arguments: first, the cause of anything as its ‘essence’, i.e. form, is the same as the cause of its being, for everything has actual existence through its form. Now it is the soul that gives being to living things; for their being is precisely their life, which they have from the soul. Hence the soul causes the body as its form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi amplius autem quae talis est. Id quod est actus alicuius, est ratio et forma eius quod est in potentia: sed anima est actus corporis viventis, ut ex superioribus patet: ergo anima est ratio et forma viventis corporis.
          <td>320. Then the second argument, at ‘Further’: the actuality of anything is the immanent idea and form of the thing as in potency. Now the soul, as we have seen, is the living body’s actuality. Therefore it is the form and immanent idea of the living body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi manifestum autem ostendit quod anima est causa, ut finis. Et quod sit causa, ut finis, viventium corporum, sic ostendit. Sicut enim intellectus operatur propter finem, ita et natura, ut probatur in secundo physicorum. Sed intellectus in his quae fiunt per artem, materiam ordinat et disponit propter formam: ergo et natura. Cum igitur anima sit forma viventis corporis, sequitur quod sit finis eius.
          <td>321. Next, at ‘It is manifest’, he shows that the soul is a final cause of living bodies. For Nature, like mind, acts for a purpose, as was shown in Book II of the <i>Physics</i> . But the mind, in its constructions, always orders and arranges materials in view of some form. So also, then, does Nature. If then the soul is the living body’s form, it must also be its final cause.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ulterius non solum anima est finis viventium corporum, sed etiam omnium naturalium corporum in istis inferioribus: quod sic probat. Videmus enim quod omnia naturalia corpora sunt quasi instrumenta animae, non solum in animalibus, sed etiam in plantis. Videmus enim quod homines utuntur ad sui utilitatem animalibus, et rebus inanimatis: animalia vero plantis et rebus inanimatis; plantae autem rebus inanimatis, inquantum scilicet alimentum et iuvamentum ab eis accipiunt. Secundum autem, quod agitur unumquodque in rerum natura, ita natum est agi. Unde videtur quod omnia corpora inanimata, sint instrumenta animatorum, et sint propter ipsa. Et etiam animata minus perfecta, sint propter animata magis perfecta. Et consequenter distinguit id cuius causa est, sicut et supra.
          <td>322. Moreover the soul is the end not only of living bodies, but also of all sublunary natural bodies. For it is evident that all such bodies are, as it were, instruments of ‘soul’—not only of animals’ souls but of the plant soul as well. Thus men turn to their own, purposes both animals and inanimate things; animals make use of plants and inanimate things; and plants of the inanimate things which support and feed them. If then the action of things is an index to their nature it seems that all inanimate bodies are naturally instruments of animate things and exist for their sake. And, incidentally, the lower animate things exist for the higher. After this he distinguishes ‘for the sake of’ into the two aspects which have already been explained.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi at vero ostendit quod anima est principium moventis corporis, sicut unde motus: et utitur quasi tali ratione. Omnis forma corporis naturalis est principium motus proprii illius corporis, sicut forma ignis est principium motus eius. Sed quidam motus sunt proprii rebus viventibus: scilicet motus localis, quo animalia movent seipsa motu processivo secundum locum, licet hoc non insit omnibus viventibus: et similiter sentire est alteratio quaedam: et hoc non inest nisi habentibus animam. Item motus augmenti et decrementi non inest nisi illis quae aluntur, et nihil alitur nisi habens animam: ergo oportet, quod anima sit principium omnium istorum motuum.
          <td>323. Thirdly, at ‘But also the soul’, he shows that the soul is the source of movement in the body. The form of every natural body, he explains, is the principle of the characteristic movement of that particular kind of body—e.g. the form of fire is cause of fire’s movement. Now certain movements are characteristic of living bodies; such, for instance, as that by which animals move themselves about from place to place, though this, to be sure, is not found in all living things. Similarly sensation involves a certain alteration of the body not found except in beings that have soul. So too with growth and decay; these movements imply the use of food and therefore also a soul. The soul, then, is the principle of all these movements.

          <td>Superius ostendit philosophus, quod opera quae attribuuntur potentiae vegetativae, sunt ab anima. Nunc excludit quosdam errores, contra determinatam veritatem. Et dividitur in partes duas, secundum duos errores, quos removet. Secunda pars incipit, ibi, videtur autem quibusdam. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ponit errorem. Secundo improbat ipsum, ibi, neque enim sursum et deorsum. Sciendum est igitur circa primum, quod sicut Empedocles alias utilitates, quae in rebus viventibus proveniunt, non dixit procedere ex intentione naturae, sed ex necessitate materiae, puta quod pedes animalium sic sunt dispositi, non ut sint utiles ad gressum, sed quia sic contingit materiam dispositam fuisse circa pedes; ita etiam et augmentum viventium non attribuit animae, sed motui gravium et levium. Videbat enim quod viventia augentur in diversas partes, puta sursum et deorsum; quod apparet manifeste in plantis, quae radices in deorsum mittunt, et rami in sursum elevantur. Dicebat igitur, quod augmentum plantarum in deorsum, causatur ex motu terrae, quae est in compositione plantae, et naturaliter deorsum fertur, propter sui gravitatem. Augmentum autem in sursum causatur ex motu ignis, qui propter sui levitatem naturaliter sursum fertur.
          <td>324. The Philosopher has just shown that the activities we call vegetative have their origin in the soul. He now proceeds to refute two errors on this subject, which he deals with respectively in two sections; the second of which begins at ‘Now it seems to some that the nature of fire’. In the first section he begins by stating the error, and then, at ‘Nor did he understand’ attacks it. Regarding the error itself, we should note that just as Empedocles refused to explain other cases of purposeful arrangement in Nature by any natural finality—for example he said that animals had the sort of feet they have, not in order to help them to walk, but simply because the matter of that part of their bodies happened to be arranged in that sort of way; so also the growth of living things he ascribed merely to the motion of light and heavy bodies. Observing that living things increase their size in different directions, e.g. up and down—as is evident in plants, which thrust their roots down and their branches up—he said that the downward growth of plants was due to the earth in their composition, which is heavy and therefore necessarily tends downwards; whilst their upward growth was due to fire which, being light, must tend upwards.

Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod sursum et deorsum, et aliae positionum differentiae, scilicet ante et retro, dextrum et sinistrum, in quibusdam quidem distinguuntur secundum naturam, in quibusdam vero solum positione quoad nos. In quibus enim sunt determinatae partes, quae sunt naturaliter principia aliquorum motuum, in his distinguuntur praedictae positionum differentiae secundum naturam; sicut in universo, ad cuius medium naturaliter feruntur gravia, ad circumferentiam feruntur naturaliter levia. Unde in universo sursum et deorsum naturaliter distinguuntur. Et sursum dicitur locus ad quem feruntur levia: et deorsum sive medium, ad quem feruntur naturaliter gravia. In viventibus etiam et mortalibus, secundum motum augmenti et decrementi, determinantur sursum et deorsum. Nam sursum dicitur illa pars, unde viventia alimentum accipiunt; deorsum autem pars opposita, unde superfluitates emittuntur.
          <td>325. Aristotle, then, at ‘Nor did he’, brings two arguments against this opinion of Empedocles. First, he says that Empedocles misunderstood ‘up and down’. To see what he means here we should note that ‘up and down’, and the other differences of position (before and behind, right and left) are differentiated in some objects naturally, whilst in others they are merely relative to ourselves. In things which have definite parts as the natural principle of their various movements, these positions are based on Nature itself Thus the Cosmos as a whole has a mid-point to which heavy things naturally tend, and a circumference to which light things naturally rise; which makes a natural cosmic difference between up and down, according to the natural resting places of the light and the heavy. Again, in living things and mortal beings up and down follow growth and decay: the upper is that part which takes in food, and the lower the opposite part which ejects superfluities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ante vero et retro determinatur in quibusdam animalibus vel viventibus secundum sensum: dextrum et sinistrum secundum motum localem. In his vero in quibus non est aliqua determinata pars, principium aut terminus alicuius motus, in eis non determinantur positionum differentiae secundum naturam, sed solum positione quoad nos, sicut in rebus inanimatis. Unde eadem columna dicitur sinistra et dextra, secundum quod est homini dextra vel sinistra. In quibusdam autem viventium, in quibus determinatur sursum et deorsum secundum naturam, eodem modo determinantur sicut in universo; ut in homine, cuius superior pars, idest caput, est versus sursum universi, inferior autem est versus deorsum ipsius. In plantis autem est e converso; nam radices plantarum sunt proportionabiles capiti; ad eumdem enim actum ordinantur: nam sicut animalia cibum accipiunt ore, quod est in capite, ita plantae radicibus. Instrumenta autem dicuntur eadem et altera, sive similia et dissimilia, ex operibus, quae sunt fines eorum; unde radices plantarum sunt similes capitibus animalium, et tamen sunt versus deorsum. Unde modo contrario se habet sursum et deorsum in plantis, et in universo. In brutis autem animalibus non eodem modo se habet; quia eorum capita non se habent versus sursum universi, neque deorsum ipsius. Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod sursum et deorsum non est idem omnibus, scilicet viventibus, et omni, idest universo.
          <td>326. Again, in some animals before and behind are determined in relation to their senses, and the right and the left by their movements in space. But things, no part of which is a special source or term of movement, have no natural differences of position in themselves; these are fixed simply by the thing’s position relative to us. So is it with inanimate objects: the same pillar is said to be on the right or the left according as it is to the right or left of a man. Now in certain living things the natural upper and lower parts are fixed in the same way as in the Cosmos as a whole. It is so in man whose head is turned towards the top of the Cosmos and his feet to its bottom. But the reverse is found in plants, whose roots correspond to the head in man, since they function (as the part which takes in food) in the same way as the head in man. For we reckon that instruments are similar or dissimilar if their functions are so; hence the likeness between a plant’s roots and the head of an animal, although they point downwards. Up and down, then, mean opposite things in plants and in the Cosmos as a whole. But brute animals are different; their heads are turned neither up nor down in relation to the Cosmos as a whole. This is what he means when he says that up and down are not for all things (i.e. living things) what they are for the Cosmos.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed Empedocles sic accipit sursum et deorsum, ac si eodem modo esset in omnibus viventibus et in universo. Si enim motus augmenti, secundum quem determinatur sursum et deorsum in viventibus, sit secundum motum gravium et levium secundum quem determinatur sursum et deorsum in universo, sequetur quod eodem modo sit sursum et deorsum in omnibus viventibus et in universo. Et ideo etiam ipse in plantis augmentum radicum dicit esse deorsum.
          <td>327. But Empedocles took up and down to be the same for all living things and for the Cosmos. And. indeed, if the movement of growth, by which we fix the upper and lower in living beings, followed the movements of the heavy and the light, by which the same relations are fixed for the Cosmos as a whole, then up and down would mean the same in all living beings and in the Cosmos. This is what led Empedocles to say that the roots of plants grew downwards.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi adhuc autem reprobat praedictam positionem alio modo. Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod cum elementa non sint actu in mixto, sed in virtute, non habet in eo quodlibet elementum seorsum proprium motum, sed totum mixtum movetur motu elementi praedominantis in ipso. Si autem quodlibet elementum haberet proprium motum, ut Empedocles ponere videbatur; cum naturalis motus elementorum sit ad contraria loca, sequeretur, quod totaliter abinvicem separarentur, nisi esset aliquid continens elementa, quod non sineret totaliter abscedere elementa abinvicem. Illud autem quod continet elementa, ne totaliter abinvicem segregentur, maxime videtur esse causa augmenti. Sed augmentum secundum diversas partes contingit ex diversis motibus elementorum. Non enim posset imaginari, qualiter esset augmentum, elementis in contraria motis, nisi per hoc quod manent adinvicem coniuncta; quia si totaliter separarentur, esset divisio, non augmentum. Illud igitur principaliter est causa augmenti, quod continet elementa, ne totaliter abinvicem separentur: hoc autem est anima in rebus viventibus: anima igitur est principium augmenti.
          <td>328. The second argument against Empedocles begins at ‘Besides, what holds’. To understand it, we should note that each element in a mixture is present not equally but virtually, and, therefore lacking the movement proper to itself. The whole mixture moves with the movement of the element that predominates. If each, as, Empedocles seems to have thought, retained its own movement, then, since the elements have natural movements in contrary directions, it follows that they would become quite separate from one another, unless some containing force held them together. Now it is just this container of the element which seems to be the chief cause of growth. For though, to be sure, the increase of the body in its various parts is due to diverse motions of the elements, yet,’ given the contrariety of elemental motion, growth is inconceivable unless the elements remain conjoined; otherwise there would be division, not growth. But in living things the soul is what holds the elements together; it is also, therefore, the’ source of their growth.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit videtur autem ponit aliam positionem. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit eam. Secundo improbat, ibi, hoc autem concausa, et cetera. Sciendum est autem, quod haec opinio differt in hoc a prima, quod prima attribuebat causam augmenti et alimenti diversis elementis, scilicet igni et terrae: haec autem attribuit eorum causam igni tantum.
          <td>329. Next, at ‘Now it seems to some’, he states another theory; which, at ‘It is indeed’ he then disproves. Unlike the theory. of Empedocles, which put the causes of growth and nutrition in both earth and fire, this theory ascribes them only to fire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et movebantur ad hoc hac ratione. Quia illud videtur esse principium alicuius passionis vel motus in aliquo, secundum quod se habet illam passionem vel motum: sicut ignis, qui secundum se calidus est, est causa caloris in rebus mixtis; et terra, quae secundum se est gravis, est causa gravitatis in eis. Inter autem elementa videtur solus ignis nutriri et augeri, si superficialiter de nutrimento et augmento loquamur. Solus igitur ignis videtur esse faciens augmentum et alimentum in plantis et animalibus. Utrum vero ignis nutriatur et augeatur, inferius erit manifestum.
          <td>330. The reason given is that the cause of anything’s modifications or motion would appear to be whatever had such modifications or motions essentially—e.g. fire, being essentially hot, is the cause of heat in things that contain other elements as well; and in the same way earth is the cause of heaviness. Now of the elements fire alone seems to ‘feed’ itself and to ‘grow’ ; if we take these terms in a superficial sense. Therefore fire alone would seem to cause growth and nutrition in plants and animals. But whether fire really feeds itself and grows will be made clear later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit hoc autem improbat praedictam positionem. Sciendum tamen est, quod praedicta positio aliquid habet veritatis. Necesse est enim omne alimentum decoqui: quod quidem fit per ignem: unde ignis aliquo modo operatur ad alimentum, et per consequens ad augmentum: non quidem sicut agens principale, hoc enim est animae; sed sicut agens secundarium et instrumentale. Et ideo dicere, quod ignis quodammodo concausa est augmenti et alimenti, sicut instrumentum concausa est principalis agentis, verum est; non tamen est principaliter causa ut principale agens, sed hoc modo causa est anima: quod sic probat.
          <td>331. Then he attacks the above opinion. But note its grain of truth. All food has to be cooked, and this is done by fire, so that fire does play a part in nutrition, and consequently in growth also; not indeed as the principal agent (which is the soul) but as a secondary, instrumental agent. To say then that fire is a sort of concurrent or instrumental cause of growth and nutrition is true. But it cannot be the principal cause or agent, as he goes on to show.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Illud est principale in qualibet actione a quo imponitur terminus et ratio ei quod fit; sicut patet in artificialibus, quod terminus vel ratio arcae vel domui non imponitur ab instrumentis, sed ab ipsa arte. Nam instrumenta se habent differenter ut cooperentur ad hanc formam vel quantitatem, vel aliam. Serra enim quantum est de se, apta est ad secandum lignum, secundum quod competit et ostio, et scamno, et domui, et in quacumque quantitate; sed quod sic secetur lignum, quod sit aptum ad talem formam et ad talem quantitatem, est ex virtute artis. Manifestum est autem, quod in omnibus quae sunt secundum naturam, est certus terminus, et determinata ratio magnitudinis et augmenti: sicut enim cuilibet speciei debentur aliqua accidentia propria, ita et propria quantitas, licet cum aliqua latitudine propter diversitatem materiae, et alias causas individuales; non enim omnes homines sunt unius quantitatis. Sed tamen est aliqua quantitas tam magna, ultra quam species humana non porrigitur; et alia quantitas tam parva, ultra quam homo non invenitur. Illud igitur quod est causa determinationis magnitudinis et augmenti est principalis causa augmenti. Hoc autem non est ignis. Manifestum est enim, quod ignis augmentum non est usque ad determinatam quantitatem, sed in infinitum extenditur, si in infinitum materia combustibilis inveniatur. Manifestum est igitur, quod ignis non est principale agens in augmento et alimento, sed magis anima. Et hoc rationabiliter accidit; quia determinatio quantitatis in rebus naturalibus est ex forma, quae est principium speciei, magis quam ex materia. Anima autem comparatur ad elementa, quae sunt in corpore vivente, sicut forma ad materiam. Magis igitur terminus et ratio magnitudinis et augmenti est ab anima, quam ab igne.
          <td>332. The principal agent in any action is that which imposes the term or natural limit upon what is done; thus in artificial things like boxes or houses the limit or term is fixed, not by the instruments used in the work, but by the art itself. The instruments, as such, are quite indifferent as to whether they are used to produce a thing of this shape and quantity or of that. A saw, as such, can be used to cut wood for a door or a bench or a house, and in any quantity you please; and if it cuts wood in this or that particular shape and quantity, this is due to the man who uses it. Now in Nature each thing obviously has certain limits to its size and its increase; each thing grows to a certain fixed pattern. For as each species of thing requires its own accidental modifications, so it needs its own measure of quantity, though some margin must be left to material differences and other individual factors. Men are nor all equal in size. But there is a limit both to their largeness and their littleness; and whatever determines this limit is the true principal cause of growth. But this cannot be fire, because the growth of fire has no naturally fixed limits; it would spread to infinity if an infinite amount of fuel were supplied to it. Clearly, then, fire is not the chief cause of growth and nutrition, but rather the soul. And this is reasonable enough, for the quantitative limits of material things are fixed by form—the specific principle—rather than matter. Now the soul of a living being is to the elements it contains as form is to matter; the soul, then, rather than fire, sets the term and natural limit to size and growth.

For there are many things which originate from opposites: but not all derive their increase thus; (for instance, health coming from sickness). Nor, it seems, do all that do so nourish one another in the same way. For water is a food to fire, but fire does not feed water. And with uncompounded bodies this seems especially to be the case; that which feeds is one thing and that which is fed another. §§ 334-5

But to others, as we have said, it seems, on the contrary, that a thing is nourished by its opposite,—as though it were impossible that like [should be altered] by, like; whilst food is altered and digested. Change in all things is either [to] an opposite or to a mean state. Moreover nutriment is acted upon by that which is nourished: not the latter by the nourishment; any more than a craftsman by his material; but this is acted on by him—the craftsman changing only from repose to activity.

Tertio potentias definit, quae sunt principia harum operationum, ibi, quare huiusmodi animae, et cetera. Circa primum tria facit. Primo dicit de quo est intentio. Secundo proponit id quod primo aspectu apparet de alimento, ibi, videtur autem esse alimentum, et cetera. Tertio movet circa hoc dubitationem, ibi, dubitationem autem habet.
          <td>333. After showing that the activities called vegetative originate in the soul, the Philosopher proceeds to examine these activities. And first he examines their subject-matter, which is food. Next he shows how the activities and their subject-matter correspond—this at ‘Since only what is alive’. Thirdly, at ‘Wherefore this soul-principle’, he defines the faculties brought into play in these activities. As regards the first point he does three things: (a) he states the plan of the present argument; (b) at ‘It would appear that food’, he says what at first sight appears true about nutrition; to which (c) at ‘But a difficulty’ he brings an objection.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum vegetativa et generativa ab eadem communi potentia animae contineatur, licet vegetativa, idest nutritiva sit quaedam specialis potentia distincta a generativa, oportet primum determinare de alimento, quod est obiectum generativae, sive nutritivae. Hoc enim opere, scilicet nutritione, distinguitur haec pars animae ab aliis, scilicet intellectivo, sensitivo, et cetera. Nam aliae operationes huius partis, idest animae, hanc praesupponunt.
          <td>In the first place, then, (a) he observes that, as the vegetative and reproductive powers are included in the same general vegetative power (‘vegetative’ as a special power being really the nutritive power), we should discuss food first of all in relation to this power as a whole. For it is taking food that characterises this part of the soul as distinct from the intellectual or sensitive parts. For the other vegetative activities all presuppose taking food.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit videtur autem proponit illud, quod primo aspectu de alimento apparet; et proponit tria: quorum primum est, quod alimentum videtur esse contrarium ei quod alitur; et hoc ideo, quia nutrimentum convertitur in id quod nutritur: generationes autem fiunt ex contrariis. Secundum autem est quod non videtur quodcumque contrarium sufficere ad rationem alimenti, sed oportet quod sit de illis contrariis, quae habent generationem ex se invicem. Nutrimentum enim convertitur in substantiam nutriti; unde quaecumque contraria insunt in substantia, secundum quae fiunt alterationes adinvicem, et non generationes, non pertinent ad rationem alimenti. Non enim dicimus quod infirmum sit nutrimentum sani, vel album nigri, aut aliquid huiusmodi. Quomodo autem in substantiis sit aliqua contrarietas, alia quaestio est.
          <td>334. Then (b) he states in three points what appears at first sight with regard to nourishment. First, food would always seem to be the contrary of the subject fed; and this because it has to become the latter, and becoming is from one thing to its contrary. Secondly, however, it seems to be clear that not any contraries will do; they must be such as can change into one another. Food is changed into the being of the one fed; hence all contraries which alternate in a subject without the one ever actually changing into the other have nothing to do with food. Thus sickness is not the food of health, nor white of black. But how substances come to contain contraries is another question.

          <td>Tertio oportet, quod sit de illis contrariis, quae augmentum suscipiunt ex invicem, quia alimentum videtur sequi augmentum. Unde licet ex igne generetur aqua, sicut e converso, non tamen dicitur quod ex igne nutriatur aqua: sed quod ex aqua nutriatur ignis, inquantum liquores humidi cedunt in ignis nutrimentum: quia scilicet dum ignis in aquam convertitur, non apparet nova aquae generatio; sed ignis praeexistens, ad sui conservationem et augmentum videtur in se humorem convertere. Et ideo in elementis videtur solus ignis nutriri, et sola aqua esse eius nutrimentum, secundum quod ad aquam pertinent omnes humores et liquores.
          <td>335. (c) Again, since increase of bulk seems to follow nutrition, the contraries involved must be such as affect each other in this way. Water may be generated by fire and <i>e converso</i> , but we do not say that water is fed by fire. Yet we can say that fire is fed by water, inasmuch as watery vapour nourishes fire. When water comes from fire there is no new coming-to-be of water; but fire can make use of and grow by means of watery vapours. Among the elements, therefore, only fire seems to be fed and only water seems to be food, taking water to include all vapours and liquids.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit dubitationem autem movet quamdam dubitationem circa praedeterminata. Et primo obiicit ad utramque partem. Secundo solvit eam, ibi, utrum autem sit alimentum, et cetera. Oritur autem dubitatio circa hoc quod supra dictum est, quod alimentum oportet esse contrarium. Quibusdam autem videtur quod alimentum oportet esse simile ei quod alitur. Alimentum enim est causa augmenti: oportet autem quod simile simili augeatur. Si enim aliquid diversum apponeretur alicui, non esset eiusdem augmentum, sed naturae extraneae adiunctio. Videtur igitur quod oporteat simile simili ali.
          <td>336. Then at ‘But a difficulty” Aristotle brings an objection against what he has just said. The difficulty concerns the statement that food is a ‘contrary’. For some maintain that food should resemble the subject fed. Food causes growth, and a thing grows by what it resembles; otherwise the growth would be a mere addition of something extrinsic. Therefore like, it seems, is fed by like.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aliis autem videtur, quod alimentum oportet esse contrarium ei quod alitur, secundum id quod supra dictum est. Et ad hoc inducuntur duplici ratione: quarum prima est, quia alimentum decoquitur et mutatur in id quod nutritur. Nihil autem mutatur nisi in contrarium aut medium; sicut album mutatur in nigrum aut pallidum. Medium autem est quodammodo contrarium. Pallidum enim albo comparatum, est nigrum: nigro vero comparatum, est album; est enim compositum ex utroque. Ergo nutrimentum est contrarium ei quod alitur, et in quod mutatur.
          <td>337. To others, however, it seems that food must, as we have said, be contrary to what is fed. And they are moved by two reasons. (a) Food, being cooked, is transformed into the subject fed. But all transformation is either into a contrary or into an intermediate, as white into either black or grey. And the intermediate is a sort of contrary: grey compared with white, is black; and compared with black, is white; for it combines both. Therefore food is contrary to the subject into which it is transformed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda ratio est, quia agens est contrarium patienti; non enim simile a simili patitur. Alimentum autem patitur ab eo quod alitur; alteratur enim ab eo, et digeritur. Id autem quod alitur, non patitur ab alimento, sicut neque artifex patitur a materia, sed e converso: materia enim mutatur, non autem artifex, nisi forte per accidens, secundum quod exit de potentia in actum. Videtur igitur, quod alimentum sit contrarium ei quod alitur. Prima igitur harum rationum sumitur ex contrarietate quam oportet esse inter terminos mutationis. Secunda vero ex contrarietate, quam oportet esse inter agens et patiens. Id enim quod alitur, et agit in alimentum, est terminus, in quem alimentum mutatur.
          <td>338. (b) Again, every agent is contrary to that on which it acts; like is not passive to like. But food is passive to what is fed: it is transformed and digested. What is fed is not passive to its food, any more than an artist to his material (for it is the material that is altered, not the artist, except indirectly, in so far as he moves from potency to act). It would seem, then, that food is contrary to what is fed. Now the first of these two reasons is drawn from the contrariety between the two terns of a change; and the second from the contrariety between agent and patient. That which is fed, and itself acts upon the food, is the term into which the food is transformed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit utrum autem solvit propositam dubitationem; dicens, quod differt quantum ad propositam quaestionem, utrum alimentum dicatur id quod ultimo advenit, scilicet post decoctionem et digestionem, an illud quod primo assumitur, scilicet antequam digeratur et decoquatur. Et si dici possit utrumque horum, alimentum: unum horum quasi alimentum decoctum, aliud vero quasi non decoctum, secundum utramque partem quaestionis poterit iudicari de alimento. Quia inquantum alimentum dicitur non decoctum, sic contrarium contrario alitur, hoc enim est quod patitur et mutatur. Inquantum vero est coctum, sic alitur simile simili; agens enim assimilat sibi patiens; unde in fine passionis oportet passum esse simile agenti, et per hunc modum potest augere id quod alitur. Et sic patet quod utrique praedictorum opinantium, aliquo modo dicunt recte, et aliquo modo non dicunt recte.
          <td>339. Then at ‘It makes all the difference’, he solves the problem, saying that the answer depends on whether by ‘food’ we mean what remains at the end of the process of heating and digesting, or what is received at first before this process begins. If food can be taken in both these senses—namely as the finished and as the raw product—then the two answers are both admissible. If it is taken in the latter sense, then subjects are fed by their contrary, which itself is acted upon and transformed; but if in the former sense, then like is fed by like; for the active agent assimilates what it acts upon, which is ultimately made like the agent and, as such, can increase the agent’s bulk. Thus both the above opinions were in one way true and another way false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem determinat de alimento secundum quod convenit operationibus animae vegetativae. Et primo secundum quod congruit nutritioni. Secundo secundum quod congruit augmento, ibi, est autem alterum alimento, et cetera. Tertio secundum quod congruit generationi, ibi, et generationis autem factivum, et cetera.
          <td>340. Next, at ‘Since only’, he shows how food is related to the activities of the vegetative principle: to taking nourishment; to growth (at ‘To be nutritive’) ; and to reproduction (at ‘And it is productive’).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod nihil nutritur, quod non participet vitam: omne autem participans vitam est animatum: sequitur ergo quod corpus quod alitur sit animatum. Alimentum autem est in potentia ad id quod alitur, convertitur enim in ipsum: relinquitur ergo quod alimentum, inquantum est nutritionis obiectum, sit aliquid existens in potentia ad animatum per se, et non secundum accidens.
          <td>First, then, he observes that nothing is fed except what has life and soul; hence the besouled body is what is fed. Now food is potential with respect to the subject fed; for it is changed into this subject. It follows that, inasmuch as food is the material of feeding, it is essentially, not accidentally, related to the besouled body as in potency to this body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est autem, quod nihil proprie nutritur nisi animatum: ignis autem videtur quidem per quamdam similitudinem nutriri, non autem proprie nutritur: quod sic patet. Id proprie nutriri dicimus, quod in seipso aliquid recipit ad suiipsius conservationem: hoc autem in igne videtur quidem accidere, sed tamen non accidit. Cum enim igne accenso aliqua materia combustibilis additur, in illa materia combustibili novus ignis generatur, non autem ita, quod illud combustibile additum cedat in conservationem ignis, in alia materia prius accensi. Puta, si aliquod lignum de novo ignitur, per hanc ignitionem non conservatur ignitio alterius ligni prius igniti: totus enim ignis qui est ex congregatione multorum ignitorum, non est unus simpliciter, sed videtur unus aggregatione, sicuti acervus lapidum est unus: et propter talem unitatem, est ibi quaedam similitudo nutritionis.
          <td>341. Nothing then is, properly speaking, fed excepting what has a soul. Fire might seem to resemble in some way things that are fed, but it is not fed, strictly speaking. For that is properly said to be fed which absorbs something else in order to maintain its own being; and though this appears to happen with fire, it does not really happen. Once a fire has started, if you add fresh fuel, a new fire starts in the new fuel; but not in such a way that the new fuel maintains the fire already started before it was added. By starting a fire in fresh wood you do not maintain the flame in the other wood already burning. For the one flame made up of many flames is not one in the simple sense of the term; it is only one by the aggregation of many units, like a heap of stones. And it is this sort of unity that gives to burning a certain likeness to taking food.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed corpora animata vere nutriuntur, quia per alimentum conservatur vita in illa parte eadem, quae prius fuit. Et propter hoc etiam sola animata vere augentur, quia quaelibet pars eorum nutritur et augetur; quod non convenit rebus inanimatis, quae videntur per additionem crescere. Non enim crescit id quod prius fuit, sed ex additione alterius constituitur quoddam aliud totum maius.
          <td>342. Living bodies, on the other hand, are really fed; food maintains life precisely where it already existed. This also is why only living bodies, properly speaking, grow; for each and every part in them is fed and increases; whereas inanimate things increase only by addition of part to part; what existed already does not increase, it is merely made into a new whole together with some other thing added to it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ideo autem similitudo augmenti et nutrimenti praecipue apparet in igne, quia ignis habet plus de forma, quam alia elementa, et est potentior in virtute activa: unde propter hoc quod manifeste alia convertit in se, videtur nutriri et augeri.
          <td>But if fire has a special likeness to living and growing things, this is because the formal principle in fire is stronger than in the other elements, and its active power greater. It seems, therefore, to feed and grow because it so obviously seizes and subdues to itself other things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem ostendit quomodo alimentum congruit augmento. Et dicit quod licet idem sit subiecto, quod est obiectum nutritionis, prout dicitur alimentum, et quod est obiectum augmenti, prout dicitur augmentativum, tamen differt ratione. Dictum est enim quod alimentum est in potentia ad corpus animatum. Corpus autem animatum, et est quoddam quantum, et est hoc aliquid et substantia. Secundum igitur quod est quoddam quantum, secundum hoc alimentum adveniens ei, quod etiam et ipsum quantum est facit augmentum, et dicitur augmentativum: in quantum autem corpus animatum, hoc aliquid et substantia est, sic habet rationem alimenti. Hoc enim est de ratione alimenti, quod conservat substantiam eius quod alitur. Quae quidem conservatio necessaria est propter continuam consumptionem humidi a calido naturali; et ideo tamdiu durat substantia eius quod nutritur, quamdiu nutriatur.
          <td>343. Then, at ‘To be nutritive’, he relates taking food to growth, observing that whilst the objective terms of feeding as feeding and of growing as growing are one and the same thing, they differ in idea. Food, we have seen, is in potency to the living body; which itself is both a quantum and a definite particular thing or substance. As a quantum it receives its food (which itself is a quantum) as a cause of growth; but as a particular sort of substance it receives food precisely as food. For it is of the nature of food to maintain the substance of what is fed; which is required by the continuous using up of natural warmth and moisture. Hence the substance of the thing fed lasts just so long as it is fed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et generationis ostendit quomodo alimentum congruat generationi. Et dicit, quod etiam alimentum est factivum generationis. Semen enim quod est generationis principium, est superfluum alimenti. Non tamen alimentum est principium generationis eius quod alitur, sed alterius quod est tale secundum speciem, quale est quod alitur: quia substantia quae alitur, iam est, et quod est, non generatur, et nihil generat seipsum; quia quod generat, iam est, quod generatur nondum est. Sed aliquid potest agere ad sui conservationem.
          <td>344. Then at ‘And it is productive’ he relates nutrition to generation, as the latter’s cause. For seed, the generative principle, is the residue of food. And food is an agent in generating, not the subject fed, but other subjects of the same kind; for the subject fed already exists and cannot be generated afresh. Nothing generates itself; only what does not yet exist is generated. This is not to say, however, that things cannot maintain themselves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quare tale ex praemissis accipit definitionem potentiarum animae vegetabilis. Et primo potentiae nutritivae. Secundo totius animae vegetabilis, ibi, quoniam autem a fine, et cetera. Circa primum, primo ex praemissis concludit definitionem potentiae nutritivae: et dicit, quod cum dictum sit, quod nutrimentum inquantum huiusmodi salvat nutritum, manifestum est quod hoc principium animae, quod scilicet est principium nutritionis, nihil est aliud quam potentia potens salvare suum susceptivum, inquantum huiusmodi. Alimentum vero est, quod praeparat operationem huiusmodi potentiae, inquantum talis potentia mediante alimento salvat suum susceptivum. Et propter hoc, illud quod privatur alimento, non potest conservari.
          <td>345. Next, at ‘Wherefore, this soul-principle’ he concludes with a definition of the powers of the vegetative soul: first, of the nutritive power, and then, at ‘Since all things’, of the whole vegetative principle. As to the nutritive power, he observes that it is simply that faculty by which a living being is able to maintain itself as such; while food is the condition of this faculty’s activity, that by means of which it maintains its subject. Hence loss of being follows lack of food.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia dixerat, quod principium nutritionis est potentia animae, cuius principium est etiam alimentum, ut ex dictis patet; ideo secundo ibi quoniam autem ostendit quomodo differenter potentia animae et alimentum sunt principia nutritionis. Dicit ergo, quia in nutritione sunt tria: quod alitur, quo alitur et alens primum. Primum quidem alens est prima anima, scilicet anima vegetabilis. Illud vero quod alitur est corpus habens hanc animam, sed illud quo alitur est alimentum. Sic igitur potentia animae est principium nutritionis, ut agens principale; alimentum autem, ut instrumentum.
          <td>346. And, having remarked ‘that the source of nutritive activity is a capacity in the soul relating essentially to food, he goes on, at ‘Since there are three’, to show how that power and the food itself differ as sources of nutrition. Nutrition, he says, involves three factors: what is fed; that, wherewith it is fed; and the primary agent in feeding: this primary agent is the primary, i.e. vegetative, soul. What is fed is its body; and that wherewith it is fed is food. Thus a capacity in the soul is the cause of taking food as the principal agent; but food as the instrumental agent.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem definit ipsam primam animam, quae dicitur anima vegetabilis; quae quidem in plantis est anima, in animalibus pars animae. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo definit huiusmodi animam. Ad cuius definitionis intellectum, sciendum est, quod inter tres operationes animae vegetabilis, est quidam ordo. Nam prima eius operatio est nutritio, per quam salvatur aliquid ut est. Secunda autem perfectior est augmentum, quo aliquid proficit in maiorem perfectionem, et secundum quantitatem et secundum virtutem. Tertia autem perfectissima et finalis est generatio per quam aliquid iam quasi in seipso perfectum existens, alteri esse et perfectionem tradit. Tunc enim unumquodque maxime perfectum est, ut in quarto Meteororum dicitur, cum potest facere alterum tale, quale ipsum est. Quia igitur iustum est, ut omnia definiantur et denominentur a fine, finis autem operum animae vegetabilis est generare alterum tale quale ipsum est, sequitur quod ipsa sit conveniens definitio primae animae, scilicet vegetabilis, ut sit generativa alterius similis secundum speciem.
          <td>347. Next, at ‘Since all things’, he defines that primary or vegetative soul (the entire soul of plants, but only part of any animal’s soul). To understand his definition, we must realise that the three vegetative activities fall into a certain order. First is taking food, by which things are maintained in being; the second and more perfect activity is growth, by which a thing increases in both quantity and capacity; while the third and most perfect and ultimate vegetative activity is reproduction, by which a being, already pretty complete in itself, gives existence and perfection to another being. For each thing is at its best, as is said in the <i>Meteorologica</i> , Book IV, when it can reproduce its likeness in another. If then all things are rightly defined and named in terms of their end, and the end of all the activities of the vegetative soul is to generate its likeness in another, it follows that we can suitably define this ‘primary soul’ as that which is reproductive of another, like to itself in kind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia dixerat, quod alimentum est instrumentum huius animae, ne credatur quod non habeat aliud instrumentum, ideo secundo ibi est autem ostendit quod habeat aliud instrumentum: et dicit quod duplex est instrumentum quod alitur, sicut duplex est instrumentum gubernationis: gubernator enim gubernat manu, et temone: manus enim est instrumentum coniunctum, cuius forma est anima. Unde temo est instrumentum movens navem, et motum a manu; sed manus non est instrumentum motum ab aliquo exteriori, sed solum a principio intrinseco: est enim pars hominis moventis seipsum. Sic igitur et nutritionis instrumentum est duplex. Et ut separatum quidem, et cuius forma nondum est anima, est nutrimentum. Oportet autem, quod aliud sit instrumentum nutritionis coniunctum. Necesse est enim, quod alimentum decoquatur: quod autem operatur decoctionem, est aliquid calidum. Sicut igitur gubernator movet temonem manu, navem autem temone, ita anima movet calido alimentum, et alimento nutrit. Sic igitur calidum aliquod est instrumentum coniunctum huius animae, in quo scilicet radicaliter est calor naturalis digerens; et propter hoc oportet, quod omne animatum, quod nutritur, habeat calorem naturalem, qui est digestionis principium. Si autem haec anima non haberet instrumentum coniunctum, non esset actus alicuius partis corporis: quod soli intellectui competit.
          <td>348. And in view of his previous remark that this primary soul’s instrument was food, to prevent anyone thinking that it had no other instrument, he shows, at ‘That by which’ that the subject fed has another instrument wherewith it is fed; just as in steering a ship there are two instruments. For the pilot steers with both hand and rudder. Now the hand is a conjoined instrument which has the soul for its form. Whilst, then, the rudder is an instrument which moves the boat and itself is moved by the hand, the hand itself is not moved by an exterior motive force, but by an interior one; for it is a part of the man and the man moves himself. Similarly, the instrument of nutrition is twofold. There is the separated instrument not yet informed by the soul; and this is food. But there must also be a conjoined instrument; for the food must be digested; and this requires heat. As then a pilot moves the rudder with his hand, and the boat with the rudder, so the soul moves the food with heat and, by means of the food, nourishes itself. The heat is the soul’s conjoined instrument; a natural warmth inseparably rooted in the soul and necessary to all living things as the condition of their digesting their food. And it. is because this primary soul is, unlike the intellect, the actuality of a. part of the body that it has a conjoined instrument.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo epilogans quod dixerat, concludit quod figuraliter, id est universaliter dictum est quid sit alimentum; sed posterius certius tractandum est de alimento, in propriis rationibus. Fecit enim unum specialem librum de alimento, sicut de generatione animalium, et de motu animalium.
          <td>349. Summarising, Aristotle says that he has defined ‘in outline’, that is in general, what food is; later he will treat of it with more precision and finality. For he wrote a special book on food, as also on the generation and movement of animals.

This treatment divides into two sections, the first of which deals with what is most apparent in sensitivity, i.e. the exterior senses, while the second, beginning at ‘That there is no other sense’, treats of what is latent therein. In the former section Aristotle first explains how sense-faculties are related to sensible objects, and then, at ‘In treating of each sense’ he defines both faculty and object. Regarding the former point, he first repeats some earlier observations and then, at ‘It may be asked’, proceeds to the present problem.

          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod determinatis his quae pertinent ad animam vegetativam, dicendum est de his quae pertinent ad sensum in communi. De his enim quae pertinent ad unumquemque sensum specialiter, postmodum dicet. Duo autem resumit dicta de sensu: quorum unum est, quod sentire consistit in moveri et pati. Est enim sensus in actu, quaedam alteratio: quod autem alteratur, patitur et movetur. Aliud autem quod resumit est, quod quidam dicunt simile a simili pati, et propter hoc sentire est pati.
          <td>First of all, then, he remarks that this is the place to start discussing the sensitive soul, beginning with a general view of the subject and going on later to a more detailed treatment. And he repeats two things already said: that to sense is to be moved or acted upon in some way, for the act of sensation involves a certain alteration of the subject; and secondly, that it was the view of some enquirers that the passivity of sensation was an instance of like being acted upon by like.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam antiqui philosophi posuerunt, quod simile simili cognoscitur et sentitur; sicut Empedocles posuit quod terra, terra cognoscitur, ignis igne, et sic de aliis. Sed hoc quomodo esse possit, vel non, quod simile simili patiatur, dictum est in universalibus rationibus de agere et pati, idest in libro de generatione, ubi determinavit de actione et passione in communi. Dictum est enim ibi, quod id quod patitur, a principio dum patitur est contrarium agenti, sed in fine, quando iam est passum, est simile. Agens enim agendo assimilat sibi patiens.
          <td>351. For some early thinkers held that like is known and sensed by like: as Empedocles said, earth knows earth, fire knows fire, and so on. Now the general problem of the action of like upon like is discussed in the <i>De Generatione</i> , where Aristotle’s conclusion is that, although at the start of any action the agent and patient are contrary, when the action is finished they are similar. For the agent, in acting, assimilates the patient.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit habet autem determinat veritatem circa propositum. Et circa hoc facit tria. Primo ostendit, quod sensus sit in potentia. Secundo quod quandoque est in actu, ibi, quoniam autem sentire et cetera. Tertio ostendit quomodo sensus reducatur de potentia in actum, ibi, dicendum autem et cetera.
          <td>352. Then, at ‘It may be asked’, he proceeds to the present problem. He shows that in themselves the senses are in potency; then, at ‘But since we speak of sensing in two ways’, that they are sometimes in act; and thirdly, at ‘Distinctions however’, he shows how they move from potency into act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum considerandum est, quod Empedocles et quicumque posuerunt simile simili cognosci, posuerunt sensum esse actu ipsa sensibilia. Ut enim cognosceret omnia sensibilia, posuerunt animam sensitivam esse compositam quodammodo ex omnibus sensibilibus, inquantum constabat, secundum eos, ex elementis sensibilium.
          <td>To understand the first of these three points, note that all who, like Empedocles, said that like was known by like, thought that the senses were actually the sense-objects themselves,—that the sensitive soul was able to know all sense-objects because it consisted somehow of those objects; that is, of the elements of which the latter are composed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Duo ergo ad hanc positionem consequebantur. Quorum unum est, quod sensus est ipsa sensibilia in actu, utpote compositus ex eis: et cum ipsa sensibilia in actu sentiri possint, sequeretur quod ipsi sensus sentiri possent. Secundum est, quod cum sensus sentire possit praesentibus sensibilibus, si sensibilia actu sunt in sensu, utpote ex eis composito, sequitur quod sensus possit sentire sine exterioribus sensibilibus. Utrumque autem horum est falsum. Et ideo haec duo inconvenientia, quae sequuntur ad antiquorum positionem, sub quaestione proposuit, tamquam quae per antiquos solvi non possint. Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod dubitationem habet, propter quid non sunt sensus ipsorum sensuum, id est quare ipsi sensus non sentiantur: hoc enim videtur sequi, si sensus sint similes sensibilibus.
          <td>353. Two things follow from this hypothesis. (1) If the senses actually are, or are made up of, the sense-objects, then, if the latter can be sensed, the senses themselves can be sensed. (2) Since the presence of its object suffices, to enable the sense-faculty to sense, then, if this object actually exists in the faculty as part of its composition, it follows that sensation can take place in the absence of external objects. But both these consequences are false. He introduces them here as specimens of the problems which the early philosophers could not solve. So he says, ‘It may be asked why there is no sensation of the senses’, i.e. why the senses themselves are not sensed; for it seems they would be sensed if they, the faculties, were really like their objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Etiam habet dubitationem, quare non faciunt sensum, id est quare sensus non sentiunt actu, sine his, quae sunt extra, id est sine exterioribus sensibilibus, cum tamen interius existant in ipsis sensibus secundum opinionem antiquorum ignis, et terra, et alia elementa, quae sunt sensibilia, aut secundum se, id est secundum suam substantiam, secundum eos, qui non discernunt inter sensum et intellectum: intellectus enim est proprie cognoscitivus substantiae, aut secundum accidentia propria, scilicet calidum et frigidum, et alia huiusmodi, quae sunt per se sensibilia. Quia igitur hae dubitationes per se solvi non possunt, si sensus habet sensibilia in actu, ut antiqui posuerunt, concludit tamquam manifestum, quod anima sensitiva non est actu sensibilis, sed potentia tantum. Et propter hoc, sensus non sentiunt sine exterioribus sensibilibus, sicut combustibile, quod est potentia tantum ignitum, non comburitur a seipso, sine exteriori combustivo. Si enim esset actu ignitum, combureret seipsum, et non indigeret exteriori igne ad hoc quod combureretur.
          <td>354. It is also hard to see ‘why they do not produce sensation’, i.e. why actual sensation does not occur, ‘without something extraneous’, i.e. without exterior sense-objects; since, in the opinion of the ancients, fire, earth and the other elements belong to the inner nature of the sense-faculty and are perceptible by sense, either in themselves, i.e. in their essence (as these philosophers thought, not distinguishing between the senses and the intellect which alone perceives essence), or in the accidental qualities proper to them, namely heat and cold and so forth, which are essentially sense-perceptible. Now since these difficulties are insurmountable if the sense-faculty consists of its objects in their actuality (as the early philosophers thought), Aristotle concludes that the sensitive soul is clearly not actually, but only potentially, the sense-object. That is why sensation will not occur without an exterior sense-object, just as combustible material does not burn of itself, but needs to be set on fire by an exterior agent; whereas if it were actually fire it would burn simply by itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem ostendit quod etiam sensus est quandoque actu. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit sensum quandoque esse in actu, per hoc, quod dupliciter dicimus aliquem sentire: quandoque enim dicimus aliquem videre et audire, qui audit et videt in potentia: puta cum aliquis est dormiens: quandoque autem dicimus aliquem videre et audire, eo quod est in ipsa operatione audiendi et videndi. Ex quo patet, quod sensus et sentire dicuntur dupliciter, scilicet in actu et in potentia.
          <td>355. Then, at ‘But as we speak of sensing’, he shows, by the two ways in which we speak of anyone sensing, that sensation is intermittently actual. For we sometimes say that a man sees or hears when he only does these things potentially, as when he is asleep; but sometimes we mean that what he is actually doing is seeing or hearing. Clearly, then, sensation and sensing may be referred to either in act or in potency.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi primum igitur manifestat quomodo intelligendum sit quod dictum est. Videbatur enim repugnare, quod sentire dicitur in actu, ei quod dictum est, quod sentire est quoddam pati et moveri. Esse enim in actu videtur magis pertinere ad agere. Et ideo ad hoc exponendum dicit, quod ita dicimus sentire in actu, ac si dicamus, quod pati et moveri sint quoddam agere, id est quoddam esse in actu. Nam motus est quidam actus, sed imperfectus, ut dictum est in tertio physicorum. Est enim actus existentis in potentia, scilicet mobilis. Sicut igitur motus est actus, ita moveri et sentire est quoddam agere, vel esse secundum actum. Per hoc autem quod dicit primum, significat quod quaedam alia postmodum subdet ad ostendendum, quomodo sensus fiat in actu.
          <td>356. Next, at ‘To start with then,’ he explains the above. For to speak of sensation as ‘in act’ might seem contradictory to his previous statement that it was a certain passive being acted upon or moved; for to be in act seems to pertain to an active agent. So he explains that in calling sensation an ‘act’ he is referring precisely to the state of being acted upon or moved; inasmuch as this is a certain state of being actual. For movement has a certain actuality; which is the actuality (as he says in the <i>Physics</i> , Book III) of the imperfect or potential, that is to say, of changeable being. In the same way, being moved and sensation itself are a sort of action, as implying an actuality of being. The phrase ‘To start with’, however, means that he will add something later to show how the senses become actual in fact.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi omnia autem ostendit secundum praedicta, quomodo antiquorum positio non possit esse vera, scilicet quod simile simili sentitur. Dicit ergo, quod omnia quae sunt in potentia, patiuntur et moventur ab activo, et existente in actu; quod scilicet dum facit esse in actu ea, quae patiuntur, assimilat ea sibi: unde quodammodo patitur aliquis aliquid a simili, et quodammodo a dissimili, ut dictum est; quia a principio dum est in transmutari et pati, est dissimile; in fine autem, dum est in transmutatum esse et passum, est simile. Sic igitur et sensus postquam factus est in actu a sensibili, est similis ei: sed ante non est similis. Quod antiqui non distinguentes erraverunt.
          <td>357. Thirdly, at ‘All things are moved and affected’, he shows how it follows from the above that the old theory that like senses like cannot be true. Everything potential, he says, is acted upon and moved by some active agent already existing; which in its actualising function makes the potential thing like itself In some sense, then, a thing is acted upon by both its like and its unlike (as we have already remarked). At first, and while the transforming process is going on, there is dissimilarity; but at the end, when the thing is transformed and changed, there is similarity. And so it is as between the sense-faculty and its object. And the early philosophers went wrong because they missed this distinction.

But also as when we speak of a, man as ‘knowing’ because he possesses the science of grammar. These two are not capable in the same way; but the former’s power is, as it were, generic and comparable to matter; whereas the latter has the power to consider at will, so long as no extraneous obstacle intervenes. Yet again, only he who is actually attending to (say) the letter A, is in the strictest sense knowing. §§ 359-61

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit sensum esse in potentia et actu, et nunc intendit ostendere quomodo educatur de potentia in actum. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima distinguit potentiam et actum, et ostendit quomodo diversimode aliquid educatur de potentia in actum, utens exemplo in intellectu. In secunda parte ostendit propositum circa sensum, ibi, sensitivi autem.
          <td>358. Having explained how the sensitive faculties are both in act and in potency, the Philosopher now goes on to say how they are brought from potency into act. This he does in two parts: first distinguishing between act and potency, and between the diverse ways in which a thing may pass from one state to the other, taking his example from the intellect; and secondly, at ‘The first change in the sensitive being’, he applies all this to the case of sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum tria facit. Primo dicit de quo est intentio. Secundo distinguit potentiam et actum circa intellectum, ibi, est quidem enim sic sciens et cetera. Tertio ostendit quomodo educitur aliquid de utraque potentia in actum, ibi, ambo quidem igitur et cetera.
          <td>As regards the first of these parts he does three things: (a) he states his intention; (b) he distinguishes, at ‘For there is such a thing as’, between act and potency in the intellect; and (c) he explains, at ‘Therefore the first two’ how what is potential, in both the two senses of the term which have been distinguished, becomes actual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod dicendum est de potentia et actu, id est ostendendum quot modis dicitur aliquid in potentia, et quot modis in actu: quod necessarium fuit, quia in superioribus, simpliciter, id est absque distinctione usus est potentia et actu.
          <td>First of all, then, he says he is about to discuss potency and act, in order to show the diverse ways in which things can be said to be actual or potential—because so far the two terms have been used ‘in one sense only’, i.e. without distinctions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est enim distinguit potentiam et actum circa intellectum. Et dicit, quod uno modo dicitur aliquid in potentia, puta homo sciens, quia habet naturalem potentiam ad sciendum, sicut homo dicitur esse de numero scientium et habentium scientiam, inquantum habet naturam ad sciendum, et ad habendum habitum scientiae. Secundo modo dicimus aliquem esse scientem, quod aliqua sciat; sicut dicimus habentem habitum alicuius scientiae, puta grammaticae, esse iam scientem.
          <td>359. Then at ‘For there is such a thing as’, he distinguishes act and potency in the intellect. We speak, he says, in one sense of potency when we say that man is a knower, referring to his natural capacity for knowledge. Man, we say, is one of that class of beings that know or have knowledge, meaning that his nature can know and form habits of knowing. In another sense, however, we say of someone that he knows, meaning that he knows certain definite things; thus we say of one who has the habit of some science—e.g. Grammar—that he is now one who knows.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est autem quod uterque horum dicitur sciens, ex eo quod aliquid potest: sed non eodem modo uterque est potens ad sciendum. Sed primus quidem dicitur potens, quia est genus huiusmodi et materia, scilicet quia habet naturalem potentiam ad sciendum, per quam collocatur in tali genere; et quia est in potentia, puta ad scientiam, sicut materia ad formam. Secundus autem, scilicet qui habet habitum scientiae, dicitur potens, quia cum vult, potest considerare, nisi aliquid extrinsecum per accidens impediat; puta vel occupatio exterior, vel aliqua indispositio ex parte corporis.
          <td>360. Now, obviously, in both cases the man’s capacities are implied by calling him a knower; but not in the same way in both cases. In the first case man is said to be ‘able’ through belonging to a certain genus or ‘matter’, i.e. his nature has a certain capacity that puts him in this genus, and he is in potency to knowledge as matter to its form. But the second man, with his acquired habit of knowing, is called ‘able’ because when he wishes he can reflect on his knowledge—unless, of course, he is accidentally prevented, e.g. by exterior preoccupations or by some bodily indisposition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertius autem, qui iam considerat, est in actu; et iste est qui proprie et perfecte scit ea quae sunt alicuius artis; puta hanc literam a, quae pertinet ad grammaticam, de qua supra fecit mentionem. Horum igitur trium, ultimus est in actu tantum: primus in potentia tantum; secundus autem in actu respectu primi, et in potentia respectu secundi. Unde manifestum est, quod esse in potentia, dicitur dupliciter, scilicet de primo et secundo; et esse in actu dicitur dupliciter, scilicet de secundo et tertio.
          <td>361. A third case would be that of a man who ‘was actually thinking about something here and now. He it is who most properly and perfectly is a knower in any field; e.g. knowing the letter A, which belongs to the above-mentioned science of Grammar. Of the three, then, the third is simply in act; the first is simply in potency; while the second is in act as compared with the first and in potency as compared with the third. Clearly, then, potentiality is taken in two senses (the first and second man); and actuality also in two senses (the second and third man).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit ambo igitur ostendit quomodo de utraque potentia aliquid reducitur in actum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quomodo de utraque potentia aliquid in actum reducitur. Secundo ostendit utrum talis reductio sit secundum aliquam passionem, ibi, non est autem simpliciter neque pati et cetera.
          <td>362. Then where he says ‘Therefore the first two’, he explains (1) how both these types of potency are actualised, and (2), at ‘Nor is being acted on’, he discusses whether this actualisation is the result of a being acted upon.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum ambo primi sint scientes secundum potentiam, et id quod est in potentia, reducatur in actum; alio modo reducitur in actum aliquid de potentia prima, et aliter de secunda. Nam quod est in potentia primo modo, reducitur in actum, quasi alteratus per doctrinam, et motus ab aliquo alio existente in actu, sicut a magistro; et multoties talis mutatio est ex contrario habitu. Quod ideo dicit, quia cum aliquis reducitur de potentia prima in actum, ex ignorante fit sciens.
          <td>First, then, he remarks that while in the two first cases there is potential knowledge, and while potency as such is able to be actualised, there is a difference, in respect of actualisation, between a primary and a secondary potency. One in primary potency to knowledge is brought into act through being, as it were, changed or altered by teaching received from another (the teacher) who already knows actually. And often, he says, this change is from a contrary habit; alluding to those who come to actual knowledge from a state of ignorance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ignorans autem dicitur dupliciter: uno modo secundum simplicem negationem, quando nec veritatem cognoscit nec contrario errore detinetur: et qui sic ignorans est, fit actu sciens; non quod mutatus de contrario habitu, sed solum sicut acquirens scientiam. Alio modo dicitur aliquis ignorans, secundum pravam dispositionem; utpote quia detinetur errore contrario veritati; et hic in actum scientiae reducitur quasi de contrario habitu mutatus.
          <td>363. Ignorance has two meanings. it can be purely negative: when the ignorant person neither knows the truth nor is involved in the opposite error; and in this case he is simply brought into actual knowledge, not changed by being rid of a contrary habit. On the other hand, ignorance may imply the bad condition of being involved in error contrary to the truth; and to acquire knowledge, then, one must be changed by being delivered from that contrary habit.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Qui vero est in potentia secundo modo, ut scilicet iam habens habitum, transit ex eo quod habet sensum aut scientiam et non agit secundum ea, in agere; quia scilicet fit agens secundum scientiam. Sed alio modo iste fit actu, et alio modo primus.
          <td>364. But one in potency in the secondary sense—i.e. as already possessing the habit—passes from the state of having, indeed, sensations or knowledge but not exercising them, into the state of actually knowing something here and now. And this kind of actualisation differs from the other.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non est autem manifestat utrum secundum quod aliquid educitur de potentia in actum scientiae primo modo, vel secundo, possit dici pati. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quot modis dicitur pati. Secundo manifestat propositum, ibi, speculans autem fit habens scientiam. Dicit ergo primo, quod sicut potentia et actus non dicuntur simpliciter, sed multipliciter; ita et pati non uno modo, sed multipliciter. Dicitur enim pati uno modo, secundum quamdam corruptionem, quae fit a contrario. Passio enim proprie dicta, videtur importare quoddam decrementum patientis, inquantum vincitur ab agente: decrementum autem patienti accidit secundum quod aliquid a patiente abiicitur. Quae quidem abiectio, corruptio quaedam est: vel simpliciter, sicut quando abiicitur forma substantialis; vel secundum quid, sicut quando abiicitur forma accidentalis. Huiusmodi autem formae abiectio fit a contrario agente: abiicitur enim forma a materia vel subiecto, per introductionem contrariae formae; et hoc est a contrario agente. Primo igitur modo proprie dicitur passio, secundum quod quaedam corruptio fit a contrario.
          <td>365. Then at ‘Nor is being acted on’ he discusses the question whether both kinds of actualisation can be called being acted upon. First, he explains the different meanings of ‘being acted on’. Then at ‘For when a man possessed of etc.’, he applies these distinctions to the present problem. First, then, he remarks that being acted upon has several meanings, like potency and act. In one sense it implies some kind of destruction caused by a contrary quality. For in the strict sense the state of being passive to action seems to connote, on the side of the patient, a loss of something proper to it through its being overcome by the agent; and this loss is a sort of destruction, either absolutely, as when the patient loses its substantial form, or relatively, as in the loss of an accidental form. And the loss implies a contrariety in the agent, the imposition upon the patient’s matter, or being, of a contrary form from outside. In the first and strict sense, then, ‘being acted on’ means a destruction caused by a contrary agent.

          <td>Alio modo passio communiter dicitur et minus proprie, secundum scilicet quod importat quamdam receptionem. Et quia quod est receptivum alterius, comparatur ad ipsum sicut potentia ad actum: actus autem est perfectio potentiae; et ideo hoc modo dicitur passio, non secundum quod fit quaedam corruptio patientis, sed magis secundum quod fit quaedam salus et perfectio eius quod est in potentia, ab eo quod est in actu. Quod enim est in potentia, non perficitur nisi per id quod est in actu. Quod autem in actu est, non est contrarium ei quod est in potentia, inquantum huiusmodi, sed magis simile: nam potentia nihil aliud est quam quidam ordo ad actum. Nisi autem esset aliqua similitudo inter potentiam et actum, non esset necessarium quod proprius actus fieret in propria potentia. Potentia igitur sic dicta, non est a contrario, sicut potentia primo modo dicta; sed est a simili, eo modo quo potentia se habet secundum similitudinem ad actum.
          <td>366. In another and looser sense the term connotes any reception of something from outside. And as a receiver is to what it receives as a potency to its actuality; and as actuality is the perfection of what is potential; so being acted upon in this sense implies rather that a certain preservation and perfection of a thing in potency is received from a thing in act. For only the actual can perfect the potential; and actuality is not, as such, contrary to potency; indeed the two are really similar, for potency is nothing but, a certain relationship to act. And without this likeness there would be no necessary correspondence between this act and this potency. Hence potency in this sense is not actualised from contrary to contrary, but rather from like to like, in the sense that the potency resembles its act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit speculans enim manifestat, utrum quod educitur de potentia in actum scientiae patiatur. Et primo manifestat hoc circa id quod educitur de secunda potentia in actum purum. Secundo autem manifestat hoc circa id quod educitur de potentia prima in habitum, ibi, ex potentia autem et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod habens scientiam, id est habitualiter sciens, fit actu speculans. Sed hoc aut non est vere et proprie alterari et pati; quia, ut dictum est, non est proprie passio et alteratio, cum de potentia procedit in actum, sed cum aliquid de contrario mutatur in contrarium. Cum autem habitualiter sciens, fit speculans actu, non mutatur de contrario in contrarium, sed proficit in eo quod iam habet. Et hoc est quod dicit quod est additio in ipsum, et in actum. Additur enim ei perfectio secundum quod proficit in actum. Aut si dicatur alterari et pati, erit aliud genus alterationis et passionis non proprie dictae. Et hoc manifestat per exemplum; dicens, quod non bene se habet, dicere sapientem habitualiter, cum sapiat actu, alterari, sicut neque dicimus aedificatorem alterari, cum aedificat.
          <td>367. Next at ‘When a man possessed of’, Aristotle discusses whether the actualising of already acquired knowledge involves a being acted upon. And he takes first the transit from secondary potentiality into fullest actuality; and then at ‘The change from being in potency’, that from primary potentiality into the acquired habit of knowledge. Now, as to the former point, he asserts that this movement into actual thinking is not truly a passive being altered; for, as we have seen, no movement into act, as movement into act, is such. The term applies, strictly, only to the alteration of a subject from one to the other of two mutually exclusive qualities. But this is not what happens when a man begins to exercise his mind on knowledge he already possesses; rather, he is developing a quality already possessed; as Aristotle says here, it is ‘a new perfection in him and an increase of actuality’; for perfection increases with actuality. And if one insists on using the terms ‘actuality’ and ‘being acted upon’, they must be taken in a wider and less strict sense. And to illustrate the point he adds that it is just as inept to speak of a thinker being ‘altered’ when he actually thinks as to say of a builder that he is altered by building.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Concludit autem ulterius, quod cum ille qui transit de habitu in actum, non accipiat de novo scientiam, sed proficiat, et perficiatur in eo quod habet: doceri autem, scientiam est acquirere: manifestum est, quod cum educitur aliquis de potentia in actum, secundum hoc quod incipit facere eum intelligere actu et sapere, non est iustum quod talis exitus de potentia in actum habeat denominationem doctrinae; sed aliquam aliam potest habere, quae quidem forte non est posita, sed potest poni.
          <td>368. A further conclusion: if it be granted that to pass from habitual to actual knowing is not a reception of new knowledge, but rather a drawing out and perfection of knowledge possessed already, it remains true that to be taught is to acquire new knowledge. Therefore, when a man is brought simply to the act of knowing or understanding, this ought not, strictly speaking, to be called ‘instruction’; it might be given some other name, though perhaps no other has in fact been found for it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit ex potentia manifestat, utrum cum aliquis exit de prima potentia in actum scientiae, alteretur et patiatur: et dicit quod cum aliquis prius sciens in potentia tantum fit addiscens et accipiens scientiam ab eo qui est actu sciens, et a magistro; vel non debet dici pati simpliciter et alterari; aut dicendum est esse duos modos alterationis: quorum unus alterationis est secundum mutationem, in privationis dispositiones, id est in dispositiones contrarias, quibus privantur, propter dispositiones prius existentes, quia unum contrariorum est privatio alterius. Alter vero alterationis modus est secundum mutationem in habitum et naturam, id est secundum quod recipiuntur aliqui habitus et formae, quae sunt perfectiones naturae, absque eo quod aliquid abiiciatur. Ille igitur, qui addiscit scientiam, non alteratur neque patitur primo modo, sed secundo.
          <td>369. Then at ‘The change from being in potency’, he discusses whether the transit from potency to act of one who acquires completely fresh knowledge is an ‘alteration’, in the sense of a ‘being acted upon’. He says that when a learner, previously knowing only potentially, is instructed by a master already knowing actually, one should either call this simply not a case of alteration and being acted upon, or else distinguish two kinds of alteration. The one kind is ‘a change to a condition of privation’, i.e. into qualities opposed to those which the thing already has, and incompatible with these, and therefore until now excluded by them. The other kind is ‘by a change to a possession and maturity’, i.e. through receiving habits and forms which perfect the thing’s nature and involve no loss of what it already has. And the learner is altered in this second sense, not in the first.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Videtur autem hoc esse contrarium eius quod supra dixit, quod multoties qui addiscit scientiam, mutatus est a contrario habitu; et ita videtur quod sit alteratio secundum mutationem in privativas dispositiones. Sed dicendum, quod cum aliquis ab errore reducitur ad scientiam veritatis, est ibi quaedam similitudo alterationis, quae est de contrario ad contrarium; non tamen vere est ibi talis alteratio. Nam alterationi, quae est de contrario in contrarium, utrumque per se et essentialiter competit: scilicet quod sit a contrario, et quod sit in contrarium. Sicut enim dealbatio non est nisi ad album, ita non est nisi a nigro vel medio, quod respectu albi, est quodammodo nigrum. Sed in acquisitione scientiae accidit quod ille qui acquirit scientiam veritatis, prius fuerit in errore: absque hoc enim potest adduci ad scientiam veritatis; unde non est vere alteratio de contrario in contrarium.
          <td>370. Now this seems to contradict what was said above, that learners often changed from a contrary habit, and thus, it would seem, acquired qualities opposed to their former ones. But really, when one is brought from error to the knowledge of truth there is indeed a certain likeness to the change from one quality to its opposite, but it is only a likeness. For where there is true alteration both the opposed qualities—the terms of the process—are necessarily and essentially involved, e.g. becoming white involves not only white, but also black, or some intermediary colour which in relation to white is a sort of blackness. But where knowledge is acquired it is quite accidental that the learner was previously in error. He could learn without first being in error. Hence it is not in the true sense an alteration.,
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item dubitatur de hoc quod dicit, quod ille qui accipit scientiam fit actu sciens a sciente in actu, et magistro. Hoc enim non semper fit; scientiam enim aliquis acquirit, non solum addiscendo a magistro, sed etiam per se inveniendo. Et ad hoc dicendum est, quod semper cum aliquis est in potentia sciens, si fiat actu habens scientiam, oportet quod hoc sit ab eo quod est actu. Considerandum tamen est, quod aliquid aliquando reducitur de potentia in actum ab extrinseco principio tantum: sicut aer illuminatur ab eo quod est actu lucidum: quandoque autem et a principio intrinseco, et a principio extrinseco: sicut homo sanatur, et a natura, et a medico; utrobique autem sanatur a sanitate in actu. Manifestum est enim quod in mente medici est ratio sanitatis, secundum quam sanat. Oportet etiam in eo qui sanatur secundum naturam, esse aliquam partem sanam, scilicet cor, cuius virtute aliae partes sanantur. Et cum medicus sanat, hoc modo sanat, sicut natura sanaret, scilicet calefaciendo, aut infrigidando, aut aliter transmutando. Unde medicus nihil aliud facit quam quod auxiliatur naturae ad expellendum morbum; quo auxilio natura non egeret, si esset fortis.
          <td>371. Another difficulty occurs where he says that the learner as such is taught by a master who already knows. For it does not always happen thus; a man may acquire knowledge by finding out for himself. To this we reply that whenever a potential knower becomes an actual knower, he must indeed be actualised by what is already in act. But this may be effected either by a purely extrinsic cause, as when air is lit up by an already actual fight, or by an intrinsic cause as well, as when a man is healed both by nature and by a doctor. In this latter case both causes of healing are actual health; for obviously health exists both in the mind of a doctor and in some healthy part of the man’s nature (i.e. the heart) in virtue of which the rest of the man recovers health. Doctors make use of such natural means to health as warmth or cold or other variable dispositions, so that we can say that the whole of their skill consists in helping nature to drive out sickness. If nature were strong enough she could do this by herself without a doctor’s aid.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Eodem autem modo se habet in scientiae acquisitione. Homo enim acquirit scientiam, et a principio intrinseco, dum invenit, et a principio extrinseco, dum addiscit. Utrobique autem reducitur de potentia in actum, ab eo quod est actu. Homo enim per lumen intellectus agentis, statim cognoscit actu prima principia naturaliter cognita; et dum ex eis conclusiones elicit, per hoc quod actu scit, venit in actualem cognitionem eorum quae potentia sciebat. Et eodem modo exterius docens ei auxiliatur ad sciendum; scilicet ex principiis addiscenti notis deducens eum per demonstrationem in conclusiones prius ignotas. Quod quidem auxilium exterius homini necessarium non esset, si adeo esset perspicacis intellectus quod per seipsum posset ex principiis notis conclusiones elicere: quae quidem perspicacitas hominibus adest secundum plus et minus.
          <td>372. And the case is the same when a man acquires knowledge. For here again there are two principles involved: an intrinsic one, which a man uses when he finds things out for himself; and an extrinsic one, as when he learns from others. But in both cases a potency is actualised by something already in act. The fight of the agent intellect gives a man immediate actual knowledge of the first principles which we know by nature, and in virtue of this actual knowing he is led to actual knowledge of conclusions previously known by him only potentially. In like manner too a teacher can help him towards knowledge, leading him step by step from principles he already knows to conclusions hitherto unknown to him. Nor would this external aid be necessary if the human mind were always strong enough to deduce conclusions from the principles it possesses by nature; and indeed the power so to deduce is present in men, but in varying degrees.

The cause [of the difference] is that sensation, even in act, is of particulars: whereas scientific knowledge is of universals. For the latter are, in a way, within the soul itself; hence the act of the intellect is interior and at will; whereas sensation is not from within the soul, and requires that a sense-object be presented. The same holds good of the sciences which concern sense-objects, and for the same reason, i.e. that sense objects are singulars and are external. But there will be time later to deal with these more conclusively. §§ 375-80

The same holds of the sensitive power. Since, however, this distinction has no name, and yet it is settled that the [two stages] differ, and in what way, it is necessary to use the expressions ‘to be acted upon’ and ‘to be altered’ as if they were precise terms. The sensitive power is potentially that which the sense-object is actually, as we have said. It is acted upon in so far as it is not like: it becomes like, in being acted upon; and is then such as is the other. §§ 381-2

          <td>Postquam philosophus distinxit potentiam et actum, et ostendit quomodo aliquid de potentia in actum exeat circa intellectum, quod dixerat de intellectu adaptat ad sensum. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit quomodo circa sensum aliquid educitur de potentia in actum. Secundo ostendit differentiam inter sensum et intellectum, ibi, differunt autem, quia huius quidem accidentia et cetera. Tertio colligit epilogando quae dixerat de sensu, ibi, nunc autem in tantum.
          <td>373. After distinguishing between potency and act, and elucidating in terms of intellectual activity the transit from one state to the other, the Philosopher now applies what he has said to the case of sensation. First, he shows how there is a transit from potency to act in sensing. Secondly, at ‘They differ, however’ he explains the difference between the two cases. Thirdly, at ‘For the present it is sufficiently established’, he recapitulates what has been said about sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est ergo circa primum, quod sicut in scientia est duplex potentia et duplex actus, ita est et circa sensum. Nam quod nondum habet sensum et natum est habere, est in potentia ad sensum. Et quod iam habet sensum et nondum sentit, est potentia sentiens, sicut circa scientiam dicebatur. Sicut autem de potentia prima aliquid mutatur in primum actum, dum acquirit scientiam per doctrinam; ita de prima potentia ad sensum, aliquid mutatur in actum, ut scilicet habeat sensum per generationem. Sensus autem naturaliter inest animali: unde sicut per generationem acquirit propriam naturam, et speciem, ita acquirit sensum. Secus autem est de scientia, quae non inest homini per naturam sed acquiritur per intentionem et disciplinam.
          <td>Regarding the first point, we must take into account that, as in intellectual cognition, so too in sensation, potency and act are each two-fold. For what so far possesses no sense-faculty but is due by nature to have one, is in potency to sensation; and what has the sense-faculty, but does not yet sense, is in potency to actual sensation in the same way as we have seen in the case of acquired intellectual knowledge. Now, as a subject moves from primary potency into primary actuality when it acquires knowledge through teaching, so too a subject’s primary potency to the possession of a sense-faculty is actualised by his birth. But whereas a sense-faculty is natural to every animal,—so that in the act of being generated it acquires a sense-faculty along with its own specific nature—the case is not the same with intellectual knowledge; this is not naturally inborn in man; it has to be acquired through application and discipline.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod prima mutatio sensitivi fit a generante. Manifestat autem primam mutationem, quae est de pura potentia in actum primum ducens. Haec autem mutatio fit a generante; nam per virtutem, quae est in semine, educitur anima sensitiva de potentia in actum cum omnibus suis potentiis. Cum autem animal iam generatum est, tunc hoc modo habet sensum, sicut aliquis habet scientiam quando iam didicit. Sed quando iam sentit secundum actum, tunc se habet sicut ille qui iam actu considerat.
          <td>374. This is what he means by saying that ‘the first change in the sensitive being’ is caused by the parent. This ‘first change’, he explains, is from sheer potency to the primary actuality; and it is due to the parent; because there is a power in the semen to actualise the sensitive soul with all its capacities. Once an animal has been generated it has its senses in the same way as a man who has been taught possesses knowledge. And when it actually senses it corresponds to the man who actually exercises his knowledge by thinking.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit differunt tamen quia posuerat similitudinem inter sentire in actu et considerare, vult ostendere differentiam inter ea: cuius quidem differentiae causam assignare incipit ex differentia obiectorum, scilicet sensibilium, et intelligibilium, quae sentiuntur et considerantur in actu. Sensibilia enim quae sunt activa operationis sensitivae, scilicet visibile et audibile, et alia huiusmodi, sunt extra animam. Cuius causa est, quia sensus secundum actum, sunt singularium quae sunt extra animam, sed scientia est universalium quae quodammodo sunt in anima. Ex quo patet, quod ille qui iam habet scientiam, non oportet quod quaerat extra sua obiecta, sed habet ea in se; unde potest considerare ea cum vult, nisi forte per accidens impediatur. Sed sentire non potest aliquis cum vult; quia sensibilia non habet in se, sed oportet quod adsint ei extra.
          <td>375. Then at ‘They differ, however’, he sets himself to discriminate between actual sensation and thinking; and he finds the first reason for distinguishing these activities in the difference between their objects, i.e. the sense-objects and intelligible objects which are attained by actual sensation and actual thinking respectively. The sense-objects which actuate sensitive activities—the visible, the audible, etc.—exist outside the soul; the reason being that actual sensation attains to the individual things which exist externally; whereas rational knowledge is of universals which exist somehow within the soul. Whence it is clear that the man who already has scientific knowledge about certain things does not need to seek such things outside himself, he already possesses them inwardly, and is able, unless prevented by some incidental cause, to reflect on them whenever he pleases. But a man cannot sense whatever he pleases; not possessing sense-objects inwardly, he is forced to receive them from outside.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sicut est de operatione sensuum, ita est in scientiis sensibilium; quia etiam sensibilia sunt de numero singularium, et eorum quae sunt extra animam. Unde homo non potest considerare secundum scientiam, omnia sensibilia quae vult, sed illa tantum, quae sensu percipit. Sed secundum certitudinem determinare de his, iterum erit tempus, scilicet in tertio, ubi agetur de intellectu, et de comparatione intellectus ad sensum.
          <td>376. And as with sense-activities, so with the sciences of sense-objects; for the latter are individual things existing outside the soul. Therefore a man cannot speculate scientifically on any sense-objects, but only on such as he perceives in sensation. But there will be time to treat conclusively of this matter later on, in Book III, where we discuss the intellect and its relation to the senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>377. Concerning what is said here, we have to ask ourselves (a) why sensation is of individual things, whereas science is of universals; and (b) how exactly universals exist in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum est igitur circa primum, quod sensus est virtus in organo corporali; intellectus vero est virtus immaterialis, quae non est actus alicuius organi corporalis. Unumquodque autem recipitur in aliquo per modum sui. Cognitio autem omnis fit per hoc, quod cognitum est aliquo modo in cognoscente, scilicet secundum similitudinem. Nam cognoscens in actu, est ipsum cognitum in actu. Oportet igitur quod sensus corporaliter et materialiter recipiat similitudinem rei quae sentitur. Intellectus autem recipit similitudinem eius quod intelligitur, incorporaliter et immaterialiter. Individuatio autem naturae communis in rebus corporalibus et materialibus, est ex materia corporali, sub determinatis dimensionibus contenta: universale autem est per abstractionem ab huiusmodi materia, et materialibus conditionibus individuantibus. Manifestum est igitur, quod similitudo rei recepta in sensu repraesentat rem secundum quod est singularis; recepta autem in intellectu, repraesentat rem secundum rationem universalis naturae: et inde est, quod sensus cognoscit singularia, intellectus vero universalia, et horum sunt scientiae.
          <td>As to (a) we should note that while the sense-faculty is always the function of a bodily organ, intellect is an immaterial power—it is not the actuality of any bodily organ. Now everything received is received in the mode of the recipient. If then all knowledge implies that the thing known is somehow present in the knower (present by its similitude), the knower’s actuality as such being the actuality of the thing known, it follows that the sense-faculty receives a similitude of the thing sensed in a bodily and material way, whilst the intellect receives a similitude of the thing understood in an incorporeal and immaterial way. Now in material and corporeal beings the common nature derives its individuation from matter existing within specified dimensions, whereas the universal comes into being by abstraction from such matter and all the individuating material conditions. Clearly, then, a thing’s similitude as received in sensation represents the thing as an individual; as received, however, by the intellect it represents the thing in terms of a universal nature. That is why individuals are known by the senses, and universals (of which are the sciences) by the intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa secundum vero considerandum est, quod universale potest accipi dupliciter. Uno modo potest dici universale ipsa natura communis, prout subiacet intentioni universalitatis. Alio modo secundum se. Sicut et album potest accipi dupliciter: vel id, cui accidit esse album, vel ipsummet, secundum quod subest albedini. Ista autem natura, cui advenit intentio universalitatis, puta natura hominis, habet duplex esse: unum quidem materiale, secundum quod est in materia naturali; aliud autem immateriale, secundum quod est in intellectu. Secundum igitur quod habet esse in materia naturali, non potest ei advenire intentio universalitatis, quia per materiam individuatur. Advenit igitur ei universalitatis intentio, secundum quod abstrahitur a materia individuali. Non est autem possibile, quod abstrahatur a materia individuali realiter, sicut Platonici posuerunt. Non enim est homo naturalis, id est realis, nisi in his carnibus, et in his ossibus, sicut probat philosophus in septimo metaphysicae. Relinquitur igitur, quod natura humana non habet esse praeter principia individuantia, nisi tantum in intellectu.
          <td>378. As to (b), note that the term ‘universal’ can be taken in two senses. It can refer to the nature itself, common to several things , in so far as this common nature is regarded in relation to those several things; or it can refer to the nature taken simply in itself Similarly, in a ‘white thing’ we can consider either the thing that happens to be white or the thing precisely as white. Now a nature—say, human nature,—which can bethought of universally, has two modes of existence: one, material, in the matter supplied by nature; the other, immaterial, in the intellect. As in the material mode of existence it cannot be represented in a universal notion, for in that mode it is individuated by its matter; this notion only applies to it, therefore, as abstracted from individuating matter. But it cannot, as so abstracted, have a real existence, as the Platonists thought; man in reality only exists (as is proved in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book VII) in this flesh and these bones. Therefore it is only in the intellect that human nature has any being apart from the principles which individuate it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nec tamen intellectus est falsus, dum apprehendit naturam communem praeter principia individuantia, sine quibus esse non potest in rerum natura. Non enim apprehendit hoc intellectus, scilicet quod natura communis sit sine principiis individuantibus; sed apprehendit naturam communem non apprehendendo principia individuantia; et hoc non est falsum. Primum autem esset falsum: sicut si ab homine albo separarem albedinem hoc modo, quod intelligerem eum non esse album: esset enim tunc apprehensio falsa. Si autem sic separarem albedinem ab homine, quod apprehenderem hominem nihil apprehendendo de albedine eius, non esset apprehensio falsa. Non enim exigitur ad veritatem apprehensionis, ut quia apprehendit rem aliquam, apprehendat omnia quae insunt ei. Sic igitur intellectus absque falsitate abstrahit genus a speciebus, inquantum intelligit naturam generis non intelligendo differentias. Et similiter abstrahit speciem ab individuis, inquantum intelligit naturam speciei, non intelligendo individualia principia.
          <td>379. Nevertheless, there is no deception when the mind apprehends a common nature apart from its individuating principles; for in this apprehension the mind does not judge that the nature exists apart; it merely apprehends this nature without apprehending the individuating principles; and in this there is no falsehood. The alternative would indeed be false—as though I were so to discriminate whiteness from a white man as to understand him not to be white. This would be false; but not if I discriminate the two in such wise as to think of the man without giving a thought to his whiteness. For the truth of our conceptions does not require that, merely apprehending anything, we apprehend everything in it. Hence the mind abstracts, without any falsehood, a genus from a species when it understands the generic nature without considering the differences; or it may abstract the species from individuals when it understands the specific nature, without considering the individuating principles.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur patet, quod naturae communi non potest attribui intentio universalitatis nisi secundum esse quod habet in intellectu: sic enim solum est unum de multis, prout intelligitur praeter principia, quibus unum in multa dividitur: unde relinquitur, quod universalia, secundum quod sunt universalia, non sunt nisi in anima. Ipsae autem naturae, quibus accidit intentio universalitatis, sunt in rebus. Et propter hoc, nomina communia significantia naturas ipsas, praedicantur de individuis; non autem nomina significantia intentiones. Socrates enim est homo, sed non est species, quamvis homo sit species.
          <td>380. It is dear, then, that universality can be predicated of a common nature only in so far as it exists in the mind: for a unity to be predicable of many things it must first be conceived apart from the principles by which it is divided into many things. Universals as such exist only in the soul; but the natures themselves, which are conceivable universally, exist in things. That is why the common names that denote these natures are predicated of individuals; but not the names that denote abstract ideas. Socrates is a ‘man’, not a ‘species’—although ‘man’ is a ‘species’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit nunc autem recolligit quod dictum est de sensu. Et dicit, quod nunc tantum sit definitum, quod non simpliciter dicitur, quod est in potentia, seu simpliciter. Uno enim modo dicimus puerum posse militare, secundum potentiam remotam. Alio modo posse dicimus militare, quoniam iam est in aetate perfecta, et hoc secundum potentiam propinquam. Et similiter se habet in sensitivo. Dupliciter enim est aliquis in potentia ad sentiendum aliquid, ut iam dictum est. Et licet non sint nomina posita, in quibus harum differentia potentiarum ostendatur, tamen determinatum est quod istae potentiae sunt alterae abinvicem, et quomodo sint alterae.
          <td>381. Finally, at ‘For the present etc.’, he recapitulates his remarks on sensation and observes that only now has it become clear that what we call potency has more than one meaning. It is in one sense that we say that a boy can be a soldier, i.e. by a remote potentiality. But in another sense we say that a grown man can be a soldier, i.e. by proximate potentiality. And the same distinction applies to sense-perception; as we have seen there are two ways of being in potency to sense anything. Though we have found no terms to express this difference, we have seen, nevertheless, that the two kinds of potency differ, and how they differ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et licet alterari et pati non proprie dicatur aliquid, secundum quod exit de potentia secunda in actum, prout habens sensum fit actu sentiens: tamen necesse est uti hoc ipso, quod est pati et alterari, ac si essent nomina propria et convenientia: quia sensitivum in potentia est tale quale est in actu sensibile. Et propter hoc sequitur, quod secundum quod patitur a principio, non est similis sensus sentienti; sed secundum quod iam est passum, est assimilatum sensibili, et est tale quale est illud. Quod quia distinguere nescierunt antiqui philosophi, posuerunt sensum esse compositum ex sensibilibus.
          <td>382. And in spite of the fact that a thing which passes from the second stage of potency into act, through actualising its sense-faculty, ought not, strictly speaking, to be said to be ‘altered’ or ‘acted upon’, we cannot help using these terms; and this because the sense-faculty is potentially such as the sense-object is actually. It follows that, whilst at the start of the process of being acted upon the faculty is not like its object, at the term of the process it has this likeness. It was because they failed to make this distinction that the earlier philosophers thought that sense-faculties were composed of the same elements as their objects.

          <td>Postquam ostendit philosophus, quomodo se habet sensus ad sensibilia, incipit determinare de sensibili et sensu. Et dividit in partes duas. In prima parte determinat de sensibilibus. In secunda de sensu, ibi, quod autem universaliter de omni sensu et cetera. Prima dividitur in duas partes. In prima distinguit sensibilia propria ab aliis modis sensibilium. In secunda determinat de sensibilibus propriis secundum unumquemque sensum, ibi, cuius quidem est visus et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ponit divisionem sensibilium. Secundo exponit membra divisionis, ibi, dico autem proprium quidem et cetera.
          <td>383. Having explained in general terms how sense-faculties are related to their objects, the Philosopher now begins his examination of objects and faculties separately. This enquiry divides into two parts, of which one is concerned with the sense-objects, and the other, starting at ‘It must be taken as a general rule’, with the faculties. The first part again divides into (a) a discrimination of the proper or special sense-objects from the rest, and (b) at ‘That of which there is sight’, an examination of the special objects of each sense. As to (a) he first makes a division of the sense-objects, and then, at ‘Now I call that the proper object,’ explains this division piecemeal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod antequam determinetur de sensu quidnam sit, oportet primo dicere de sensibilibus secundum unumquemque sensum, quia obiecta sunt praevia potentiis. Sensibilia vero tribus modis dicuntur. Uno quidem modo per accidens, et duobus modis per se: quorum uno dicuntur sensibilia illa, quae propria sint singulis sensibus; alio modo dicuntur sensibilia illa, quae communiter sentiuntur ab omnibus quae sentiunt.
          <td>Beginning then, he observes that before we decide what the senses themselves are we must discuss the objects of each sense; for objects are prior to faculties. Now the term sense-object is used in three ways, in one way incidentally, and in two ways essentially or absolutely; and of the latter we use one in referring to the special objects proper to each sense, and the other in referring to objects that-are common to more than one sense in all sentient beings.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit dico autem exponit membra divisionis. Et primo exponit quae sunt sensibilia propria. Et dicit, quod sensibile proprium est quod ita sentitur uno sensu, quod non potest alio sensu sentiri, et circa quod non potest errare sensus: sicut visus proprie est cognoscitivus coloris, et auditus soni, et gustus humoris, id est saporis: sed tactus habet plures differentias appropriatas sibi: cognoscit enim calidum et humidum, frigidum et siccum, grave et leve, et huiusmodi multa. Unusquisque autem horum sensuum iudicat de propriis sensibilibus, et non decipitur in eis; sicut visus non decipitur quod sit talis color, neque auditus decipitur de sono.
          <td>384. Then at ‘Now I call that’, he explains the members of the division, and first what he means by a special sense-object. He says that he means by this term what is perceived by one sense and by no other, and in respect of which the perceiving sense cannot err; thus it is proper to sight to know colour, to hearing to know sound, to taste to know flavour or savour. Touch, however, has several objects proper to itself— heat and moisture, cold and dryness, the heavy and the light, etc. Each sense judges the objects proper to itself and is not mistaken about these, e.g. sight with regard to such and such a colour or hearing with regard to sound.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed circa sensibilia per accidens vel communia, decipiuntur sensus; sicut decipitur visus, si velit iudicare homo per ipsum, quid est coloratum, aut ubi sit. Et similiter decipitur quis, si velit iudicare per auditum quid est quod sonat. Haec igitur sunt propria sensibilia uniuscuiusque sensus.
          <td>385. But the senses can be deceived both about objects only incidentally sensible and about objects common to several senses., Thus sight would prove fallible were one to attempt to judge by sight what a coloured thing was or where it was; and hearing likewise if one tried to determine by hearing alone what was causing a sound. Such then are the special objects of each sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi communia autem exponit secundum membrum divisionis; dicens, quod communia sensibilia sunt ista quinque: motus, quies, numerus, figura et magnitudo. Haec enim nullius sensus unius sunt propria, sed sunt communia omnibus. Quod non est sic intelligendum, quasi omnia ista sint omnibus communia; sed quaedam horum, scilicet numerus, motus et quies, sunt communia omnibus sensibus. Tactus vero et visus percipiunt omnia quinque.
          <td>386. Next, at ‘Now the sense-objects’, he says, touching the second member of the division, that the common sense-objects are five: movement, rest, number, shape and size. These are not proper to any one sense but are common to all; which we must not take to mean that all these are common to all the senses, but that some of them, i.e. number, movement and rest, are common to all. But touch and sight perceive all five.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur manifestum est, quae sint sensibilia per se.
          <td>It is clear now what are the sense-objects that are such in themselves or absolutely.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi secundum accidens exponit tertium membrum divisionis; et dicit, quod secundum accidens sensibile dicitur, ut si dicimus quod Diarus vel Socrates est sensibile per accidens, quia accidit ei esse album. Hoc enim sentitur per accidens, quod accidit ei quod sentitur per se: accidit autem albo, quod est sensibile per se, quod sit Diarus, unde Diarus est sensibile per accidens. Unde nihil patitur sensus ab hoc, in quantum huiusmodi.
          <td>387. Then, at ‘To be a sense-object incidentally’, he takes the third member of the division. We might, he says, call Diarus or Socrates incidentally a sense-object because each happens to be white: that is sensed incidentally which happens to belong to what is sensed absolutely. It is accidental to the white thing, which is sensed absolutely, that it should be Diarus; hence Diarus is a sense-object incidentally. He does not, as such, act upon the sense at all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quamvis autem sensibilia communia et sensibilia propria sint per se sensibilia, tamen propria sensibilia sunt proprie per se sensibilia; quia substantia uniuscuiusque sensus et eius definitio est in hoc, quod est aptum natum pati a tali sensibili. Ratio autem uniuscuiusque potentiae consistit in habitudine ad proprium obiectum.
          <td>While it is true, however, that both common and special sense-objects are all absolutely or of themselves perceptible by sense, yet, strictly speaking, only the special sense-objects are directly perceived, for the very essence and definition of each sense consists in its being naturally fitted to be affected by some such special object proper to itself The nature of each faculty consists in its relation to its proper object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dubitatur autem hic de distinctione sensibilium communium a sensibilibus per accidens. Sicut enim sensibilia per accidens non apprehenduntur nisi in quantum sensibilia propria apprehenduntur, sic nec sensibilia communia apprehenduntur, nisi apprehendantur sensibilia propria: nunquam enim visus apprehendit magnitudinem aut figuram, nisi inquantum apprehendit coloratum. Videtur ergo quod sensibilia communia sunt etiam sensibilia per accidens.
          <td>388. A difficulty arises here about the distinction between common and incidental sense-objects. For if the latter are only perceived in so far as the special objects are perceived, the same is true of the common sense-objects: the eye would never perceive size or shape if it did not perceive colour. It would seem then that the common objects themselves are incidental objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicunt igitur quidam, quod huiusmodi communia sensibilia non sunt sensibilia per accidens, propter duas rationes. Primo quidem, quia huiusmodi sensibilia communia sunt propria sensui communi, sicut sensibilia propria sunt propria singulis sensibus. Secundo, quia sensibilia propria non possunt esse sine sensibilibus communibus; possunt autem esse sine sensibilibus per accidens.
          <td>389. Now there are some who base the distinction between common and incidental sense-objects upon two reasons. They say that (a) the common objects are proper to the ‘common sense’, as the special objects are to the particular senses; and (b) that the proper objects are inseparable from the common objects, but not from the incidental objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Utraque autem responsio incompetens est. Prima quidem, quia falsum est, quod ista sensibilia communia sint propria obiecta sensus communis. Sensus enim communis est quaedam potentia, ad quam terminantur immutationes omnium sensuum, ut infra patebit. Unde impossibile est quod sensus communis habeat aliquod proprium obiectum, quod non sit obiectum sensus proprii. Sed circa immutationes ipsas sensuum propriorum a suis obiectis, quas sensus proprii habere non possunt: sicut quod percipit ipsas immutationes sensuum, et discernit inter sensibilia diversorum sensuum. Sensu enim communi percipimus nos vivere et discernimus inter sensibilia diversorum sensuum, scilicet album et dulce.
          <td>390. But both answers are inept. The first is based on the fallacy that these common sense-objects are the special object of the ‘common sense’. As we shall see later, the common sense is the faculty whereat the modifications affecting all the particular senses terminate; hence it cannot have as its special object anything, that is not an object of a particular sense. In fact, it is concerned with those modifications of the particular senses by their objects which these senses themselves cannot perceive; it is aware of these modifications themselves, and of the differences between the objects of each particular sense. It is by the common sense that we are aware of our own life, and that we can distinguish between the objects of different senses, e.g. the white and the sweet.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea. Dato quod sensibilia communia essent propria obiecta sensus communis, non excluderetur quin essent per accidens sensibilia, respectu sensuum propriorum. Sic enim agitur de sensibilibus, secundum quod habent habitudinem ad sensus proprios: nam potentia sensus communis nondum est declarata. Quod autem est obiectum proprium alicuius interioris potentiae, contingit esse per accidens sensibile, ut postea dicetur. Nec est mirum; quia hoc quod est per se sensibile uni sensuum exteriorum, est per accidens sensibile respectu alterius: sicut dulce est per accidens visibile.
          <td>391. Moreover, even granted that the common sense-objects were proper to the common sense, this would not prevent their being the incidental objects of the particular senses. For we are still studying the sense-objects in relation to the particular senses; the common sense has not yet been elucidated. As we shall see later, the special object of an interior faculty may happen to be only incidentally sensible. Nor is this strange; for even as regards the exterior senses, what is in itself and essentially perceptible by one of these exterior senses is incidentally perceptible by another; as sweetness is incidentally visible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda etiam ratio non est competens. Non enim refert ad id quod est sensibile per accidens, utrum id quod est subiectum sensibilis qualitatis, sit per se subiectum eius, vel non per se. Nullus enim diceret ignem, qui est proprium subiectum caloris, esse per se sensibile tactu.
          <td>392. The second reason is also inept. Whether or no the subject of a sensible quality pertains essentially to that quality makes no difference to the question whether the quality itself is an incidental sense-object. No one, for instance, would maintain that fire, which is the essential and proper subject of heat, was directly and in itself an object of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo aliter dicendum, quod sentire consistit in quodam pati et alterari, ut supra dictum est. Quicquid igitur facit differentiam in ipsa passione vel alteratione sensus, habet per se habitudinem ad sensum, et dicitur sensibile per se. Quod autem nullam facit differentiam circa immutationem sensus, dicitur sensibile per accidens. Unde et in litera dicit philosophus, quod a sensibili per accidens nihil patitur sensus, secundum quod huiusmodi.
          <td>393. So we must look for another answer. We have seen that sensation is a being acted upon and altered in some way. Whatever, then, affects the faculty in, and so makes a difference to, its own proper reaction and modification has an intrinsic relation to that faculty and can be called a sense-object in itself or absolutely. But whatever makes no difference to the immediate modification of the faculty we call an incidental sense-object. Hence, the Philosopher says explicitly that the senses are not affected at all by the incidental object as such.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Differentiam autem circa immutationem sensus potest aliquid facere dupliciter. Uno modo quantum ad ipsam speciem agentem; et sic faciunt differentiam circa immutationem sensus sensibilia per se, secundum quod hoc est color, illud autem est sonus, hoc autem est album, illud vero nigrum. Ipsae enim species activorum in sensu, actu sunt sensibilia propria, ad quae habet naturalem aptitudinem potentia sensitiva; et propter hoc secundum aliquam differentiam horum sensibilium diversificantur sensus.
          <td>394. Now an object may affect the faculty’s immediate reaction in two ways. One way is with respect to the kind of agent causing this reaction; and in this way the immediate objects of sensation differentiate sense-experience, inasmuch as one such object is colour, another is sound, another white, another black, and so on. For the various kinds of stimulants of sensation are, in their actuality as such, precisely the special sense-objects themselves; and to them the sense-faculty (as a whole) is by nature adapted; so that precisely by their differences is sensation itself differentiated.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quaedam vero alia faciunt differentiam in transmutatione sensuum, non quantum ad speciem agentis, sed quantum ad modum actionis. Qualitates enim sensibiles movent sensum corporaliter et situaliter. Unde aliter movent secundum quod sunt in maiori vel minori corpore, et secundum quod sunt in diverso situ, scilicet vel propinquo, vel remoto, vel eodem, vel diverso. Et hoc modo faciunt circa immutationem sensuum differentiam sensibilia communia. Manifestum est enim quod secundum omnia haec quinque diversificatur magnitudo vel situs. Et quia non habent habitudinem ad sensum, ut species activorum, ideo secundum ea non diversificantur potentiae sensitivae, sed remanent communia pluribus sensibus.
          <td>On the other hand there are objects which differentiate sensation with respect, not to the kind of agent, but to the mode of its activity. For as sense-qualities affect the senses corporeally and locally, they do so in different ways, if they are qualities of large or small bodies or are diversely situated, i.e. near, or far, or together, or apart. And it is thus that the common sensibles differentiate sensation. Obviously, size and position vary for all the five senses. And not being related to sensation as variations in the immediate factors which bring the sense into act, they do not properly differentiate the sense-faculties; they remain common to several faculties at once.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Viso igitur quomodo dicantur per se sensibilia, et communia et propria, restat videndum, qua ratione dicatur aliquid sensibile per accidens. Sciendum est igitur, quod ad hoc quod aliquid sit sensibile per accidens, primo requiritur quod accidat ei quod per se est sensibile, sicut accidit albo esse hominem, et accidit ei esse dulce. Secundo requiritur, quod sit apprehensum a sentiente: si enim accideret sensibili, quod lateret sentientem, non diceretur per accidens sentiri. Oportet igitur quod per se cognoscatur ab aliqua alia potentia cognoscitiva sentientis. Et hoc quidem vel est alius sensus, vel est intellectus, vel vis cogitativa, aut vis aestimativa. Dico autem quod est alius sensus; sicut si dicamus, quod dulce est visibile per accidens inquantum dulce accidit albo, quod apprehenditur visu, et ipsum dulce per se cognoscitur ab alio sensu, scilicet a gustu.
          <td>395. Having seen how we should speak of the absolute or essential sense-objects, both common and-special, it remains to be seen how anything is a sense-object ‘incidentally’. Now for an object to be a sense-object incidentally it must first be connected accidentally with an essential sense-object; as a man, for instance, may happen to be white, or a white thing happen to be sweet. Secondly, it must be perceived by the one who is sensing; if it were connected with the sense-object without itself being perceived, it could not be said to be sensed incidentally. But this implies that with respect to some cognitive faculty of the one sensing it, it is known, not incidentally, but absolutely. Now this latter faculty must be either another sense-faculty, or the intellect, or the cogitative faculty, or natural instinct. I say ‘another sense-faculty’, meaning that sweetness is <i>incidentally visible</i> inasmuch as a white thing seen is in fact sweet, the sweetness being directly perceptible by another sense, i.e. taste.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed, ut proprie loquamur, hoc non est universaliter sensibile per accidens, sed per accidens visibile, sensibile autem per se. Quod ergo sensu proprio non cognoscitur, si sit aliquid universale, apprehenditur intellectu; non tamen omne quod intellectu apprehendi potest in re sensibili, potest dici sensibile per accidens, sed statim quod ad occursum rei sensatae apprehenditur intellectu. Sicut statim cum video aliquem loquentem, vel movere seipsum, apprehendo per intellectum vitam eius, unde possum dicere quod video eum vivere. Si vero apprehendatur in singulari, utputa cum video coloratum, percipio hunc hominem vel hoc animal, huiusmodi quidem apprehensio in homine fit per vim cogitativam, quae dicitur etiam ratio particularis, eo quod est collativa intentionum individualium, sicut ratio universalis est collativa rationum universalium.
          <td>396. But, speaking precisely, this is not in the fullest sense an incidental sense-object; it is incidental to the sense of sight, but it is essentially <i>sensible</i> . Now what is not perceived by any special sense is known by the intellect, if it be a universal; yet not <i>anything</i> knowable by intellect in sensible matter should be called a sense-object incidentally, but only what is at once intellectually apprehended <i>as soon as a sense-experience occurs</i> . Thus, as soon as I see anyone talking or moving himself my intellect tells me that he is alive; and I can say that I see him live. But if this apprehension is of something <i>individual</i> , as when, seeing this particular coloured thing, I perceive this particular man or beast, then the cogitative faculty (in the case of man at least) is at work, the power which is also called the ‘particular reason’ because it correlates individualised notions, just as the ‘universal reason’ correlates universal ideas.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nihilominus tamen haec vis est in parte sensitiva; quia vis sensitiva in sui supremo participat aliquid de vi intellectiva in homine, in quo sensus intellectui coniungitur. In animali vero irrationali fit apprehensio intentionis individualis per aestimativam naturalem, secundum quod ovis per auditum vel visum cognoscit filium, vel aliquid huiusmodi.
          <td>397. Nevertheless, this faculty belongs to sensitivity; for the sensitive power at its highest—in man, in whom sensitivity is joined to intelligence—has some share in the life of intellect. But the lower animals’ awareness of individualised notions is called natural instinct, which comes into play when a sheep, e.g., recognises its offspring by sight, or sound, or something of that sort.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Differenter tamen circa hoc se habet cogitativa, et aestimativa. Nam cogitativa apprehendit individuum, ut existens sub natura communi; quod contingit ei, inquantum unitur intellectivae in eodem subiecto; unde cognoscit hunc hominem prout est hic homo, et hoc lignum prout est hoc lignum. Aestimativa autem non apprehendit aliquod individuum, secundum quod est sub natura communi, sed solum secundum quod est terminus aut principium alicuius actionis vel passionis; sicut ovis cognoscit hunc agnum, non inquantum est hic agnus, sed inquantum est ab ea lactabilis; et hanc herbam, inquantum est eius cibus. Unde alia individua ad quae se non extendit eius actio vel passio, nullo modo apprehendit sua aestimativa naturali. Naturalis enim aestimativa datur animalibus, ut per eam ordinentur in actiones proprias, vel passiones, prosequendas, vel fugiendas.
          <td>398. Note, however, that the cogitative faculty differs from natural instinct. The former apprehends the individual thing as existing in a common nature, and this because it is united to intellect in one and the same subject. Hence it is aware of a man as this <i>man</i> , and this tree as this <i>tree</i> ; whereas instinct is not aware of an individual thing as in a common nature, but only in so far as this individual thing is the term or principle of some action or passion. Thus a sheep knows this particular lamb, not as this lamb, but simply as something to be suckled; and it knows this grass just in so far as this grass is its food. Hence, other individual things which have no relation to its own actions or passions it does not apprehend at all by natural instinct. For the purpose of natural instinct in animals is to direct them in their actions and passions, so as to seek and avoid things according to the requirements of their nature.

Air and water and many solids are such. But transparency does not depend on either air or water as such, but on the same quality being found in both, and in the eternal sphere above as well. § 404

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus distinxit propria sensibilia a communibus sensibilibus, et a sensibilibus secundum accidens, hic determinat de propriis sensibilibus secundum unumquemque sensum. Et primo de proprio sensibili visus. Secundo de proprio sensibili auditus, ibi, nunc autem primum de sono et cetera. Tertio de proprio sensibili olfactus, ibi, de odore autem et cetera. Quarto de proprio sensibili gustus, ibi, gustabile autem est et cetera. Quinto de proprio sensibili tactus, ibi, de tangibili autem, et tactu et cetera.
          <td>399. Having distinguished the proper sense-objects from the common, and from those that are sensible incidentally, the Philosopher now treats of the proper object of each sense: first of the proper object of sight; then, at ‘Now let us start’, of that of hearing; then, at ‘It is not so easy’, of that of smell; then, at ‘The tasteable’, of that of taste; and lastly, at ‘The same reasoning holds’, of that of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit. Primo determinat de visibili. Secundo dicit, quomodo visibile videatur, ibi, nunc autem in tantum et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo determinat quid est visibile, distinguens visibile in duo. Secundo determinat de utroque visibili, ibi, visibile enim est color et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod cum dictum sit, quod propria sensibilia sunt quae unusquisque sensus proprie percipit, illud sensibile cuius proprie perceptivus est visus, hoc est visibile. Sub visibili autem comprehenduntur duo. Nam visibile et est color, et est quoddam aliud, quod oratione quidem designari potest, sed non habet proprium nomen sibi impositum: quod quidem visibile competit his quae videntur de nocte, sicut sunt noctilucae, et putredines quercuum, et huiusmodi, de quibus erit manifestum in processu huius tractatus, postquam ingressi fuerimus in cognitionem visibilis, ex cognitione coloris, quod est manifestius visibile.
          <td>As to sight, he discusses, first, its object, and then, at ‘At present what is clear’, how this object comes to be seen. Touching the object of sight, he does two things. First, he determines what is the visible, dividing it into two. secondly, he deals with either visible, at ‘For the visible is colour’. He says then, first, that, the proper sense-object being that which each sense perceives <i>of itself exclusively</i> , the sense-object of which the special recipient is sight is the visible. Now in the visible two things are included; for both colour is a visible, and also something else, which can be described in speech, but has no proper name; which visible belongs to things which can be seen by night, such as glow-worms and certain fungi on oak-trees and the like, concerning which the course of this treatise will inform us more clearly as we gain a deeper understanding of the visible; but we have to start from colour which is the more obvious visible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit visibile enim determinat de utroque visibili. Et primo de colore. Secundo de eo quod dixit esse innominatum, ibi, non autem omnia visibilia et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit quomodo color se habet ad hoc quod sit visibilis. Secundo determinat de his quae requiruntur ad hoc, quod color videatur, ibi, est igitur aliquid diaphanum et cetera.
          <td>400. Then, at ‘For the visible’, he begins to define both objects of sight: first colour and then, at ‘Not all visible things’,” that of which he says that it has no proper name. As to colour he does two things: first, he shows what colour has to do with visibility; secondly, at ‘There is, accordingly, something transparent’ he settles what is required for colour to be seen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum color sit quoddam visibile, esse visibile convenit ei secundum se; nam color in eo quod est color, est visibilis per se.
          <td>First of all, then, he says that, colour being visible, it is visible of itself, for colour as such is essentially visible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Per se autem dupliciter dicitur. Uno enim modo dicitur propositio per se, cuius praedicatum cadit in definitione subiecti, sicut ista, homo est animal: animal enim cadit in definitione hominis. Et quia id quod est in definitione alicuius, est aliquo modo causa eius, in his quae sunt per se, dicuntur praedicata esse causa subiecti. Alio modo dicitur propositio per se, cuius e contrario subiectum ponitur in definitione praedicati; sicut si dicatur, nasus est simus, vel numerus est par; simum enim nihil aliud est, quam nasus curvus, et par nihil aliud est quam numerus, medietatem habens, et in istis subiectum est causa praedicati.
          <td>401. ‘Essentially’ is said in two ways. In one way, when the predicate of a proposition falls within the definition of the subject, e.g. ‘man is an animal’; for animal enters into the definition of man. And since that which falls within the definition of anything is in some way the cause of it, in cases such as these the predicate is said to be the cause of the subject. In another way, on the contrary, when the subject of the proposition falls within the definition of the predicate, as when it is said that a nose is snub, or a number is even; for snubness is nothing but a quality of a nose, and evenness of a number which can be halved; and in these cases the subject is a cause of the predicate.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Intelligendum est ergo, quod color est visibilis per se, hoc secundo modo, et non primo. Nam visibilitas est quaedam passio, sicut simum est passio nasi. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod color secundum se est visibile non ratione, idest non ita quod visibile ponatur in eius definitione, sed quia in seipso habet causam ut sit visibile, sicut subiectum in seipso habet causam propriae passionis.
          <td>402. Now colour is essentially visible in this second manner, not in the first; for visibility is a quality, as being snub is a quality of a nose. And this is why he says that colour is visible ‘essentially’, but ‘not by definition’; that is to say, not because visibility is placed in its definition, but because it possesses of itself the reason why it should be visible, as a subject possesses in itself the reason for its own peculiar qualities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod probat per hoc, quod omnis color est motivus diaphani secundum actum. Diaphanum autem est idem quod transparens, ut aer vel aqua; et hoc habet color de sui natura, quod possit movere diaphanum in actu. Ex hoc autem quod movet diaphanum in actu, est visibile: unde sequitur quod color secundum suam naturam est visibilis. Et quia diaphanum non fit in actu nisi per lumen, sequitur quod color non sit visibilis sine lumine. Et ideo antequam ostendatur qualiter color videatur, dicendum est de lumine.
          <td>403. Which he proves by this, that every colour as such is able to affect what is actually diaphanous. The diaphanous is the same as the transparent (e.g. air or water), and colour has it in its nature to actualise further an actual transparency. And from this, that it affects the actually transparent, it is visible; whence it follows that colour is of its nature visible. And since the transparent is brought to its act only by light, it follows that colour is not visible without light. And therefore before explaining how colour is seen, we must discuss light.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est igitur determinat de his sine quibus color videri non potest; scilicet diaphano et lumine. Et dividitur in partes tres. Primo ostendit quid sit diaphanum. Secundo determinat de lumine, quod est actus eius, ibi, lumen autem est huius actus et cetera. Tertio ostendit quomodo diaphanum est susceptivum coloris, ibi, est autem coloris et cetera.
          <td>404. Then, at ‘There is, accordingly’, he discusses those things without which colour cannot be seen, namely the transparent and light; and this in three sections. First, he explains the transparent. Secondly, at ‘Light is’, he treats of the transparent’s actuality, i.e. light. Thirdly, he shows how the transparent is receptive of colour, at ‘Now that only can receive colour’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum color sit motivus secundum suam naturam diaphani, necesse est, quod diaphanum sit aliquid. Est autem diaphanum, quod non habet proprium colorem, ut secundum ipsum videri possit, sed est susceptivum extranei coloris, secundum quem aliquo modo est visibile. Huiusmodi autem diaphanum est, sicut aer et aqua et multa corpora solida, ut lapides quidam, et vitrum. Licet autem alia accidentia, quae conveniunt elementis et elementatis conveniant eis secundum naturam elementorum, sicut calidum et frigidum, et grave, et leve, et alia huiusmodi, tamen diaphanum non convenit praedictis ex natura aeris, aut aquae, secundum quod huiusmodi, sed consequitur quamdam naturam communem non solum aeri et aquae quae sunt corpora corruptibilia, sed convenit etiam caelesti corpori, quod est perpetuum et incorruptibile. Manifestum est enim aliqua caelestia corpora esse diaphana. Non enim possemus videre stellas fixas, quae sunt in octava sphaera, nisi inferiores sphaerae planetarum essent transparentes, vel diaphanae. Sic ergo manifestum est quod diaphanum non est proprietas consequens naturam aeris aut aquae, sed aliquam communiorem naturam, ex cuius proprietate oportet causam diaphanitatis assignare, ut postea apparebit.
          <td>To begin with, therefore, he says that if colour is that which of its nature affects the transparent, the latter must be, and in fact is, that which has no intrinsic colour to make it visible of itself, but is receptive of colour from without in a way which renders it somehow visible. Examples of the transparent are air and water and many solid bodies, such as certain jewels and glass. Now, whereas other accidents pertaining to the elements or to bodies constituted from them, are in these bodies on account of the nature of those elements (such as heat and cold, weight and lightness, etc.), transparency does not belong to the nature of air or water as such, but is consequent upon some quality common, not only to air and water, which are corruptible bodies, but also to the celestial bodies, which are perpetual and incorruptible. For at least some of the celestial bodies are manifestly transparent. We should not be able to see the fixed stars of the eighth sphere unless the lower spheres of the planets were transparent or diaphanous. Hence it is evident that to be transparent is not a property consequent on the nature of air or water, but of some more generic nature, in which the cause of transparency is to be found, as we shall see later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit lumen autem ostendit quid sit lumen. Et primo manifestat veritatem. Secundo excludit errorem, ibi, quod quidem igitur et cetera. Dicit ergo primo, quod lumen est actus diaphani, secundum quod est diaphanum. Manifestatum est enim, quod neque aer, neque aqua, neque aliquid huiusmodi est actu transparens, nisi fuerit illuminatum. Ipsum autem diaphanum secundum se est in potentia respectu luminis et respectu tenebrae, quae est privatio luminis, sicut materia prima est ut potentia respectu formae et privationis. Lumen autem comparatur ad diaphanum, sicut color ad corpus terminatum; quia utrumque est actus et forma sui susceptivi. Et propter hoc dicit, quod lumen est quasi quidam color diaphani, secundum quod diaphanum est actu factum diaphanum ab aliquo corpore lucente, sive illud sit ignis, aut aliquid aliud huiusmodi, sive aliquod corpus caeleste. Esse enim lucens actu et illuminativum, commune est igni et corpori caelesti, sicut esse diaphanum est commune aeri et aquae, et corpori caelesti.
          <td>405. Next, at ‘Light etc.’, he explains light, first stating the truth, then dismissing an error. He says, to begin with, that light is the act of the transparent as such. For it is evident that neither air nor water nor anything of that sort is actually transparent unless it is luminous. Of itself the transparent is in potency to both light and darkness (the latter being a privation of light) as primary matter is in potency both to form and the privation of form. Now light is to the transparent as colour is to a body of definite dimensions: each is the act and form of that which receives it. And on this account he says that light is the colour, as it were, of the transparent, in virtue of which the transparent is made actually so by some light-giving body, such as fire, or anything else of that kind, or by a celestial body. For to be full of light and to communicate it is common to fire and to celestial bodies, just as to be diaphanous is common to air and water and the celestial bodies.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quid quidem excludit falsam opinionem de lumine. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quod lumen non est corpus. Secundo improbat quamdam solutionem ad rationem quamdam, per quam potest probari lumen non esse corpus, ibi, et non recte Empedocles. Circa primum tria facit.
          <td>406. Then, at ‘We have then indicated’ he rejects a false opinion on light; and this in two stages. First, he shows that light is not a body; then he refutes an objection brought against the arguments which prove that fight is not a body, at ‘Empedocles... was wrong’. As to the first point he does three things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primo ponit intentum; et dicit quod cum dictum sit quid est diaphanum, et quid lumen, manifestum est quod lumen, neque est ignis, ut quidam dicebant, ponentes tres species ignis, carbonem, flammam, et lumen: neque est aliquod corpus omnino, neque aliquid defluens ab aliquo corpore, sicut posuit Democritus, lumen esse quasdam decisiones defluentes a corporis lucidis: scilicet atomos quosdam. Si essent aliqua defluentia a corpore, sequeretur quod essent corpora vel aliquod corpus, et sic nihil aliud esset lumen quam praesentia ignis, aut alicuius huiusmodi corporis in diaphano: nihil ergo differt dicere quod lumen est corpus, aut quod est defluxus corporis.
          <td>(a) He states his own view, saying that, once it is clear what the transparent is, and what light is, it is evident that light is neither fire (as some have said, positing three kinds of fire, the combustible, and flame, and light); nor a body at all, or anything flowing from a body, as Democritus supposed, asserting that light consisted of atomic particles emanating from luminous bodies. If there were these emanations from bodies, they would themselves be bodies, or something corporeal, and light would thus be nothing other than fire, or something material of that sort, present in the diaphanous; which is the same as to say that light is a body or an emanation from a body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi neque enim probat quod proposuerat, tali ratione. Impossibile est duo corpora esse simul: si ergo lumen est corpus, impossibile est quod lumen sit simul cum corpore diaphano: hoc autem est falsum: ergo lumen non est corpus.
          <td>407. (b) At ‘For it is impossible’, he proves his own hypothesis thus. It is impossible for two bodies to be in one place at one time. If therefore light were a body, it could not co-exist with a diaphanous body; but this is false; therefore light is not a body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi videtur autem probat quod lumen sit simul cum diaphano. Contrariorum enim est idem subiectum: lumen autem et tenebra sunt contraria secundum modum quo privatio et habitus est quaedam contrarietas, ut dicitur in decimo metaphysicae. Manifestum est autem, quod tenebra est quaedam privatio huius habitus, scilicet luminis in diaphano; et sic subiectum tenebrae est diaphanum; ergo et praesentia dicti habitus, scilicet lucis, est lumen: ergo lumen est simul cum diaphano.
          <td>408. (c) At ‘Light seems’ he shows that light does co-exist with the diaphanous body. For contraries exist in one and the same subject. But light and darkness are contraries in the manner in which a quality and its privation are contraries, as is stated in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book X. Obviously, darkness is a privation of this quality, i.e. of light in the diaphanous body-which is therefore the subject of darkness. Hence too, the presence of this quality is light. Therefore light co-exists with the diaphanum.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et non recte reprobat quamdam responsionem ad rationem quamdam, quae potest fieri contra ponentes lumen esse corpus. Potest enim contra eos sic argui. Si lumen esset corpus, oportet quod illuminatio sit motus localis luminis deveniens in diaphanum. Nullus autem motus localis cuiuscumque corporis, potest esse subitus sive in instanti; ergo illuminatio non est subito sed successive.
          <td>409. Then at ‘Empedocles... was wrong’ he refutes an answer to one argument which might be urged against those who hold that light is a body. For it is possible to argue thus against them: if light were a body, illumination ought to be a local motion of light passing through the transparent; but no local movement of any body can be sudden or instantaneous; therefore, illumination would be, not instantaneous but successive, according to this view.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius contrarium videmus; quia in eodem instanti, in quo corpus lucidum praesentatur, illuminatur diaphanum totum simul, et non pars eius post partem. Non autem recte Empedocles neque quicumque alius dixit, quod scilicet lumen feratur motu locali, tamquam corpus, et extendatur successive in spatio, quod est medium inter terram et continens, scilicet caelum, et quod ista successio nos lateat, sed videatur nobis quod totum illuminetur simul et subito.
          <td>410. Of which the contrary is a fact of experience; for in the very instant in which a luminous body becomes present, the transparent it illuminated all at once, not part after part. So Empedocles, and all others of the same opinion, erred in saying that light was borne along by local motion, as a body is; and that it spread out successively through space, which is the medium between the earth and its envelope, i.e. the sky; and that this successive motion escapes our observation, so that the whole of space seems to us to be illuminated simultaneously.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc enim dictum est contra veritatem, quae potest ratione percipi; quia ad illuminationem diaphani nihil requiritur nisi directa oppositio, absque obstaculo medio, corporis illuminantis ad illuminabile.
          <td>411. For this assertion is irrational. The illumination of the transparent simply and solely presupposes the placing of a luminous body over against the one illumined, with no intervening obstacle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Iterum autem est contra id quod apparet. Posset enim dici quod successio motus localis parvo spatio lateat nos: sed quod lateat nos successio in motu luminis, ab oriente, usque ad occidentem horizontis nostri, hoc habet magnam quaestionem, tamquam difficile aut omnino impossibile.
          <td>412. Again, it contradicts appearances. One might indeed allow that successive local motion over a small space could escape our notice; but that a successive movement of light from the eastern to the western horizon should escape our notice is so great an improbability as to appear quite impossible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia vero hic agitur de natura luminis et diaphani et necessitate luminis ad videndum, de his tribus considerandum est.
          <td>413. But as the subject matter under discussion is threefold, i.e. the nature of light, and of transparency, and the necessity of light for seeing, we must take these three questions one by one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa naturam igitur luminis diversi diversimode opinati sunt. Quidam enim opinati sunt lumen esse corpus, ut in litera dicitur. Ad quod dicendum moti sunt ex quibusdam locutionibus, quibus utimur, loquentes de lumine. Consuevimus enim dicere, quod radius transit per aerem, quod reverberatur, quod radii se intersecant, quae omnia videntur esse corporis.
          <td>On the nature of light various opinions have been held. Some, as we have seen, held that light was a body; being led to this by certain expressions used in speaking of light. For instance, we are accustomed to say that a ray ‘passes through’ the air, that it is ‘thrown back’, that rays ‘intersect’, and so forth; which all seem to imply something corporeal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quae quidem opinio stare non potest, propter rationes, quas Aristoteles in litera adducit, et plures alias facile esset adducere. Non enim facile esset assignare, quomodo huiusmodi corpus per totum hemisphaerium subito multiplicaretur aut generaretur vel corrumperetur; quomodo etiam sola oppositio corporis opaci esset causa corruptionis huius corporis in parte diaphani aliqua. Quod autem dicitur de motu luminis, aut reverberatione ipsius, metaphorice dictum est; sicut etiam possumus dicere, quod calor procedit dum aliqua de novo calefiunt; vel reverberantur, cum habet obstaculum.
          <td>414. But this theory is groundless, as the arguments here adduced of Aristotle show, to which others might easily be added. Thus it is hard to see how a body could be suddenly multiplied over the whole hemisphere, or come into existence or vanish, as light does; nor how the mere intervention of an opaque body should extinguish light in any part of a transparent body if light, itself were a body. To speak of the motion or rebounding of light is to use metaphors, as when we speak of heat ‘proceeding into’ things that are being heated or being ‘thrown back’ when it meets an obstacle.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam vero alii dixerunt quod lux est quaedam natura spiritualis, argumentum sumentes quod in rebus intellectualibus, nomine luminis utimur: dicimus enim in substantiis intellectualibus esse quoddam lumen intelligibile. Sed hoc etiam est impossibile.
          <td>415. Then there are those who maintain, on the contrary, that light is spiritual in nature. Otherwise, they say, why should we use the term ‘light’ in speaking of intellectual things? For we say that intellectual things possess a certain intelligible ‘light’. But this also is inadmissible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Impossibile est enim quod aliqua natura spiritualis et intelligibilis cadat in apprehensione sensus: qui cum sit virtus corporea, non potest esse cognoscitivus nisi rerum corporalium. Si quis autem dicat quod aliud est lumen spirituale ab eo quod sensus percipit, non erit cum eo contendendum, dummodo hic habeat quod lumen quod visus percipit, non est natura spiritualis. Nihil enim prohibet unum nomen imponi rebus quantumcumque diversis.
          <td>416. For it is impossible that any spiritual or intelligible nature should fall within the apprehension of the senses; whose power, being essentially embodied, cannot acquire knowledge of any but bodily things. But if anyone should say that there is a spiritual ‘light’ other than the light that is sense-perceived, we need not quarrel with him; so long as he admits that the light which is sense-perceived is not spiritual in nature. For there is no reason why quite different things should not have the same name.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem lumine, et his quae ad visum pertinent, utamur in rebus intellectualibus, contingit ex nobilitate sensus visus, qui est spiritualior et subtilior inter omnes sensus. Quod patet ex duobus. Primo quidem ex suo obiecto. Nam aliqua cadunt sub visu, secundum proprietates in quibus communicant inferiora corpora cum caelestibus: tactus autem est perceptivus proprietatum quae sunt propriae elementis, scilicet calidi, et frigidi, et similium; gustus autem et olfactus, proprietatum quae competunt corporibus mistis secundum diversam rationem commistionis calidi et frigidi, humidi et sicci. Sonus autem causatur ex motu locali, qui etiam communis est corporibus caelestibus et inferioribus, licet species motus quae causat sonum, non competat corporibus caelestibus secundum sententiam Aristotelis. Unde ex ipsa natura obiecti, apparet quod visus est altior inter sensus, et auditus propinquior ei, et alii sensus magis remoti.
          <td>417. The reason, in fact, why we employ ‘light’ and other words referring to vision in matters concerning the intellect is that the sense of sight has a special dignity; it is more spiritual and more subtle than any other sense. This is evident in two ways. First, from the object of sight. For objects fall under sight in virtue of properties which earthly bodies have in common with the heavenly bodies. On the other hand, touch is receptive of properties which are proper to the elements (such as heat and cold and the like); and taste and smell perceive properties that pertain to compound bodies, according as these are variously compounded of heat and cold, moisture and dryness; sound, again, is due to local movement which, indeed, is also common to earthly and heavenly bodies, but which, in the case of the cause of sound; is a different kind of movement from that of the heavenly bodies, according to the opinion of Aristotle. Hence, from the very nature of the object it would appear that sight is the highest of the senses; with hearing nearest to it, and the others still more remote from its dignity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo apparet quod sensus visus est spiritualior, ex modo immutationis. Nam in quolibet alio sensu non est immutatio spiritualis, sine naturali. Dico autem immutationem naturalem prout qualitas recipitur in patiente secundum esse naturae, sicut cum aliquid infrigidatur vel calefit aut movetur secundum locum. Immutatio vero spiritualis est secundum quod species recipitur in organo sensus aut in medio per modum intentionis, et non per modum naturalis formae. Non enim sic recipitur species sensibilis in sensu secundum illud esse quod habet in re sensibili. Patet autem quod in tactu, et gustu, qui est tactus quidam, fit alteratio naturalis; calefit enim et infrigidatur aliquid per contactum calidi et frigidi, et non fit immutatio spiritualis tantum. Similiter autem immutatio odoris fit cum quadam fumali evaporatione: immutatio autem soni, cum motu locali. Sed in immutatione visus est sola immutatio spiritualis: unde patet, quod visus inter omnes sensus est spiritualior, et post hunc auditus. Et propter hoc hi duo sensus sunt maxime spirituales, et soli disciplinabiles; et his quae ad eos pertinent, utimur in intellectualibus, et praecipue his quae pertinent ad visum.
          <td>418. The same point will appear if we consider the way in which the sense of sight is exercised. In the other senses what is spiritual in their exercise is always accompanied by a material change. I mean by ‘material change’ what happens when a quality is received by a subject according to the material mode A the subject’s own existence, as e.g. when anything is cooled, or heated, or moved about in space; whereas by a ‘spiritual change’ I mean, here, what happens when the likeness of an object is received in the sense-organ, or in the medium between object and organ, as a form, causing knowledge, and not merely as a form in matter. For there is a difference between the mode of being which a sensible form has in the senses and that which it has in the thing sensed. Now in the case of touching and tasting (which is a kind of touching) it is clear that a material change occurs: the organ itself grows hot or cold by contact with a hot or cold object; there is not merely a spiritual change. So too the exercise of smell involves a sort of vaporous exhalation; and that of sound involves movement in space. But seeing involves only a spiritual change-hence its maximum spirituality; with hearing as the next in this order. These two senses are therefore the most spiritual, and are the only ones under our control. Hence the use we make of what refers to them—and especially of what refers to sight—in speaking of intellectual objects and operations.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam vero dixerunt quod lumen non est nisi evidentia coloris. Sed hoc aperte apparet esse falsum in his quae lucent de nocte, et tamen eorum color occultatur.
          <td>419. Then again some have simply identified light with the manifestation of colour. But this is patently untrue in the case of things that shine by night, their colour, nevertheless, remaining obscure.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alii vero dixerunt quod lux est forma substantialis solis, et lumen defluens a luce habet esse intentionale, sicut species colorum in aere. Utrumque autem horum est falsum. Primum quidem, quia nulla forma substantialis est per se sensibilis, sed solo intellectu comprehensibilis. Et si dicatur quod id quod videtur in sole, non est lux, sed splendor, non erit contendendum de nomine; dummodo hoc quod dicimus lucem, scilicet quod ex visu apprehenditur, non sit forma substantialis. Secundum etiam falsum est; quia quae habent solum esse intentionale, non faciunt transmutationem naturalem: radii autem corporum caelestium transmutant totam naturam inferiorem. Unde dicimus, quod sicut corpora elementaria habent qualitates activas, per quas agunt, ita lux est qualitas activa corporis caelestis, per quam agit, et est in tertia specie qualitatis sicut et calor.
          <td>420. Others, on the other hand, have said that light was the substantial form of the sum, and that the brightness proceeding therefrom (in the form of colours in the air) had the sort of being that belongs to objects causing knowledge as such. But both these propositions are false. The former, because no substantial form is in and of itself an object of sense perception; it can only be intellectually apprehended. And if it is said that what the sense sees in the sun is not light itself but the splendour of light, we need not dispute about names, provided only it be granted that what we call light, i.e. the sight-perceived thing, is not a substantial form. And the latter proposition too is false; because whatever simply has the being of a thing causing knowledge does not, as such, cause material chance; but the rays from the heavenly bodies do in fact materially affect all things on earth. Hence our own conclusion is that, just as the corporeal elements have certain active qualities through which they affect things materially, so light is the active quality of the heavenly bodies; by their light these bodies are active; and this light is in the third species of quality, like heat.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in hoc differt a calore, quia lux est qualitas primi corporis alterantis, quod non habet contrarium; unde nec lux contrarium habet: calori autem est aliquid contrarium. Et quia luci nihil est contrarium, in suo susceptibili non potest habere contrariam dispositionem: et propter hoc suum passivum, scilicet diaphanum, semper est in ultima dispositione ad formam; et propter hoc statim illuminatur; non autem calefactibile statim calefit. Ipsa igitur participatio vel effectus lucis in diaphano, vocatur lumen. Et si fit secundum rectam lineam ad corpus lucidum, vocatur radius. Si autem causetur ex reverberatione radii ad corpus lucidum, vocatur splendor. Lumen autem commune est ad omnem effectum lucis in diaphano.
          <td>421. But it differs from heat in this: that light is a quality of the primary change-effecting body, which has no contrary: therefore light has no contrary: whereas there, is a contrary to heat. And because there is no positive contrary to light, there is no place for a contrary disposition in its recipient: therefore, too, its matter, i.e. the transparent body, is always as such immediately disposed to its form. That is why illumination occurs instantaneously, whereas what can become hot only becomes so by degrees. Now this participation or effect of light in a diaphanum is called ‘luminosity’. And if it comes about in a direct line to the lightened body, it is called a ‘ray’; but if it is caused by the reflection of a ray upon a light-receiving body, it is called ‘splendour’. But luminosity is the common name for every effect of light in the diaphanum.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>His igitur visis circa naturam luminis, de facili apparet ratio, quare quaedam corpora sunt lucida actu: quaedam diaphana, quaedam opaca. Nam cum lux sit qualitas primi alterantis, quod est maxime perfectum et formale in corporibus, illa corpora quae sunt maxime formalia et mobilia sunt lucida actu; quae autem propinqua his, sunt receptiva luminis sicut diaphana; quae autem sunt maxime materialia, neque habent lumen in sui natura, neque sunt luminis receptiva, sunt opaca. Quod patet in ipsis elementis. Nam ignis habet lucem in sui natura, licet eius lux non appareat nobis nisi in natura aliena propter densitatem. Aer autem et aqua, quae sunt minus formalia, sunt diaphana: terra autem quae est maxime materialis, est opaca.
          <td>422. So much being admitted as to the nature of light, we can easily understand why certain bodies are always actually lucent, whilst others are diaphanous, and others opaque. Because light is a quality of the primary change-effecting body, which is the most perfect and least material of bodies, those among other bodies which are the most formal and the most mobile to actualisation are always actually lucent; and the next in this order are diaphanous; whilst those that are extremely material, being neither luminous of themselves nor receptive of light, are opaque. One may see this in the elements: fire is lucent by nature, though its light does not appear except in other things. Air and water, being more material, are diaphanous; whilst earth, the most material of all, is opaque.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa tertium vero sciendum est, quod quidam dixerunt quod lumen necessarium est ad videndum ex parte ipsius coloris. Dicunt enim quod color non habet virtutem ut moveat diaphanum, nisi per lumen. Et huius signum dicunt, quia ille qui est in obscuro, videt ea quae sunt in lumine, sed non e converso. Rationem etiam ad hoc adducunt; quia oportet quod, cum visus sit unus, quod visibile non sit nisi per rationem unam; quod non esset, si color esset per se visibilis, non per virtutem luminis, et item lumen esset per se visibile.
          <td>423. With regard to the third point (the necessity of light for seeing), note that it has been the opinion of some that not merely seeing, but the object of seeing, i.e. colour as such, presupposed the presence of light; that colour as such had no power to affect a transparent medium; that it does this only through light. An indication of this was, they said, that one who stands in the shadow can see what is in the light, but one who stands in the light cannot see what is -in shadow. The cause of this fact, they said, lay in a correspondence between sight and its object: as seeing is a single act, so it must bear on an object formally single; which would not be the case if colour were visible of itself—not in virtue of light—and light also were visible of itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc est manifeste contra id quod Aristoteles hic dicit, et quod habet in se causam essendi visibile. Unde secundum sententiam Aristotelis dicendum est, quod lumen necessarium est ad videndum, non ex parte coloris eo quod faciat colores esse actu, quos quidam, tantum dicunt esse in potentia, cum sunt in tenebris; sed ex parte diaphani, inquantum facit ipsum esse in actu, ut in litera dicitur.
          <td>424. Now this view is clearly contrary to what Aristotle says here, ‘and... has in itself the cause of being visible’; hence, following his opinion, I say that light is necessary for seeing, not because of colour, in that it actualises colours (which some say are in only potency so long as they are in darkness), but because of the transparent medium which light renders actual, as the text states.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ad huius evidentiam, considerandum est, quod omnis forma, inquantum huiusmodi, est principium agendi sibi simile: unde cum color sit quaedam forma, ex se habet, quod causet sui similitudinem in medio. Sed tamen sciendum est quod differentia est inter virtutem perfectam et imperfectam. Nam forma quae est perfectae virtutis in agendo, non solum potest inducere suam similitudinem in suo susceptibili; sed potest etiam disponere patiens, ut sit proprium eius susceptivum; quod quidem non potest facere, cum fuerit imperfectae virtutis. Dicendum est igitur quod virtus coloris in agendo est imperfecta respectu virtutis luminis. Nam color nihil aliud est quam lux quaedam quodammodo obscurata ex admixtione corporis opaci. Unde non habet virtutem, ut faciat medium in illa dispositione, qua fit susceptivum coloris; quod tamen potest facere lux pura.
          <td>425. And in proof of this, note that every form is, as such, a principle of effects resembling itself colour, being a form, has therefore of itself the power to impress its likeness on the medium. But note also that there is this difference between the form with a complete, and the form with an incomplete, power to act, that the former is able not merely to impress its likeness on matter, but even to dispose matter to fit it for this likeness; which is beyond the power of the latter. Now the active power of colour is of the latter sort; for it is, in fact, only a kind of light somehow dimmed by admixture of opaque matter. Hence it lacks the power to render the medium fully disposed to receive colour; but this pure light can do.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo etiam patet quod, cum lux sit quodammodo substantia coloris, ad eamdem naturam reducitur omne visibile, nec oportet quod color per lumen extrinsecum fiat actu visibile. Quod autem colores illuminati ab eo qui est in obscuro, videantur, contingit ex eo, quod etiam medium illuminatur, in quantum sufficit ad immutationem ipsius.
          <td>426. Whence it is also clear that, as light is, in a certain way, the very substance of colour, all visible objects as such share in the same nature:, nor does colour require to be made visible by some other, extrinsic, light. That colours in light are visible to one standing in the shade is due to the medium’s having been sufficiently illumined.

For to be colour is to be able to move the transparent into act; and this act of the transparent is light.

This is, however, impossible; for only when the sensitive faculty is affected does vision occur. This cannot, however, be effected by the colour seen, in itself. It must therefore be due to the medium. If there were a vacuum, a thing, so far from being perceived clearly, would not be seen at all.

But man, and whatever living things breathe, are unable to smell except when breathing. The cause of this will be dealt with later. § 438

          <br>
          LECTIO 15</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit superius quid est color, et quid diaphanum, et quid lumen, hic ostendit, quomodo diaphanum se habeat ad colores. Manifestum est autem ex praemissis, quod diaphanum est susceptivum coloris; est enim color motivus diaphani, ut supra dictum est. Quod autem est susceptivum coloris, oportet esse sine colore, sicut quod est susceptivum soni, oportet esse sine sono: nihil enim recipit quod iam habet: et sic patet quod diaphanum, oportet esse sine colore.
          <td>427. After treating of colour and the transparent medium and luminosity, the Philosopher now proceeds to explain how the medium is related to colour. It is clear, from the foregoing, that the transparent medium is receptive of colour; for colour, we have seen, acts upon it. Now what is receptive of colour must itself be colourless, as what receives sound must be soundless; for nothing receives what it already has. The transparent medium is therefore colourless.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cum autem corpora sint visibilia per suos colores, sequitur quod diaphanum secundum seipsum sit invisibile. Quia vero eadem est potentia cognoscitiva oppositorum, sequitur, quod visus qui cognoscit lucem, cognoscat et tenebram. Licet igitur diaphanum secundum se careat colore et lumine, quorum est susceptivum, et sic secundum se visibile non sit, eo modo quo sunt visibilia, lucida et colorata, tamen potest dici visibile, sicut videtur tenebrosum quod vix videtur. Diaphanum igitur est huiusmodi, idest tenebrosum, cum non est actu diaphanum, sed in potentia tantum. Eadem enim natura est subiecta quandoque quidem tenebrarum, quandoque autem luminis. Et sic diaphanum carens lumine, quod ei accidit, dum est in potentia diaphanum, oportet, quod sit tenebrosum.
          <td>428. But, as bodies are visible by their colours, the transparent medium must itself be invisible. Yet since one and the same power apprehends contrary qualities, it follows that sight, which apprehends light, also apprehends darkness. Hence, although the transparent medium of itself possesses neither light nor colour, being receptive of both, and is thus not of itself visible in the way that things bright or coloured are visible, it can, all the same, be called visible in the same sort of way as dark things and scarcely visible things are so called. The diaphanum is therefore a kind of darkness, so long as it is not actually but only potentially transparent: the same thing is the subject, sometimes of darkness, sometimes of light. Thus the diaphanum, while it lacks luminosity and is only potentially transparent, is in a state of darkness.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non omnia quia iam determinatum est de colore, quod videtur in lumine, determinat de alio visibili, quod supra dixit esse innominatum. Et dicit quod non omnia sunt visibilia in lumine, sed solum proprius color uniuscuiusque corporis in lumine visibilis est: quaedam enim non videntur in lumine, sed in tenebris, sicut animalia quae in tenebris videntur ignita, et lucentia, haec sunt multa, sed non habent unum nomen commune, sicut putredines quercuum, et aliquod cornu alicuius animalis et capita quorumdam piscium, et squamae, et oculi quorumdam animalium. Sed licet ista videantur in tenebris, nullius tamen horum proprius color in tenebris videtur. Videntur ergo ista in tenebris et in lumine; sed in tenebris, ut lucentia; in lumine autem, ut colorata.
          <td>429. Then at ‘Not all’, having decided about colour, which is made visible by light, he reaches a conclusion about that other visible object of which he said above that it had no proper name. He observes that not all things depend on light for being seen, but only the colour that is proper to each particular thing. Some things, e.g. certain animals that appear fiery and lucent in the dark, are not visible in the light, but only in darkness. There are many such things, including the fungi of oaks, the horn of certain beasts and heads of certain fish, and some animals’ scales and eyes. But while all these things are visible in the dark, the colour proper to each is not seen in the dark. The things are seen both in light and in darkness; but in darkness only as bright objects, in light as coloured objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed propter quam causam sic videantur in tenebris lucentia, alia ratio est. Non enim hic inducitur hoc, nisi quasi per accidens, ad ostendendum comparationem visibilis ad lumen. Videtur autem visibilitatis eorum in tenebris haec esse ratio: quia huiusmodi ex sua compositione habent aliquid lucis, inquantum lucidum ignis et diaphanum aeris et aquae non est totaliter in eis comprehensum per opacum terrae. Sed quia modicum habent de luce, eorum lux ad praesentiam maioris luminis occultatur. Unde in lumine non videntur, ut lucentia, sed ut colorata tantum. Lux autem eorum propter sui debilitatem non potest diaphanum perfecte reducere in actum, secundum quod natum est moveri a colore; unde sub eorum luce, nec eorum color, nec aliorum videtur; sed solum lux ipsorum. Lux enim, cum sit efficacior ad movendum diaphanum, quam color, et magis visibilis, cum minori immutatione diaphani videri potest.
          <td>430. The reason why they are seen shining in the darkness is another matter. Aristotle only mentions the fact incidentally, in order to show the relation of the visible to luminosity. This, however, seems to be the reason for their being visible in the dark, that such things have in their constitution something of light, inasmuch as the brightness of fire and the transparency of air and water is not entirely smothered in them by the opacity of earth. But having only a small amount of light, their brightness is obscured in the presence of a greater light. Hence in the light they appear not as bright, but only as coloured. The light in their constitution is so weak that it is unable perfectly to actualise the potentially transparent medium to receive the full effect of the colours which by nature it is fitted to receive. Hence, by this light neither their own colour, nor that of other things, is seen: but only their brightness. For brightness, being a more effective agent upon the medium than colour, and in itself more visible, can be seen with less alteration of the medium than colour requires.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit nunc autem ostendit quomodo color perveniat ad visum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quod est necessarium ad hoc, quod visus moveatur a colore. Secundo ostendit aliquid simile, quod est necessarium in aliis sensibilibus, ibi, eadem autem ratio. Circa primum duo facit. Primo determinat veritatem. Secundo excludit errorem, ibi, non enim bene hoc. Dicit ergo primo, quod per supradicta, intantum manifestum fit, quod illud quod videtur in lumine, est color, et quod sine lumine videri non potest, quia, ut supra dictum est, hoc est de ratione coloris quod sit motivum diaphani; quod quidem fit per lumen, quod est actus diaphani; et ideo sine lumine color videri non potest.
          <td>431. Next, at ‘At present what is clear’, he explains how colour actually affects sight, first pointing out what this necessarily presupposes, and then, at ‘The same account holds’, indicating a like necessary condition in the case of the other senses. As to the former point, he first decides what is the truth of the matter, and then at ‘Democritus etc.’, sets aside an error. First, then, he says that we are now clear that what is seen in light is colour, and that colour is invisible without light; and this because, as has been explained, colour of its nature acts upon a transparent medium, and it does this in virtue of fight, which is the latter’s actuality. Hence light is necessary if colour is to be seen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius signum est: quia si aliquis ponat corpus coloratum super organum visus, non videbitur: quia non est ibi diaphanum in actu, quod moveatur a colore. Nam etsi pupilla sit quoddam diaphanum, non tamen erit diaphanum in actu, si superponatur sibi corpus coloratum. Oportet autem quod color moveat diaphanum in actu, puta aerem vel aliquid huiusmodi; et ab hoc movetur sensitivum, idest organum visus, sicut a corpore sibi continuato. Corpora enim non se immutant, nisi se tangant.
          <td>432. An indication of this is the fact that if a coloured body is placed upon the organ of sight it cannot be seen; for then there remains no transparent medium to be affected by the colour. The pupil of the eye is indeed some such medium, but, so long as the coloured body remains placed upon it, it lacks actual transparency. There has to be a medium, say air or something of the kind, which, being actualised by colour, itself acts upon the organ of sight as upon a body continuous with itself For bodies only affect one another through actual contact.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non enim excludit errorem; dicens, quod non bene dixit Democritus, qui opinatus fuit, quod si medium, quod est inter rem visam et oculum esset vacuum, quod posset aliquid quantumcumque parvum videri per quantamcumque distantiam, puta si formica esset in caelo. Sed hoc est impossibile. Oportet enim, ad hoc quod aliquid videatur, quod organum visus patiatur a visibili. Ostensum est autem, quod non patitur ab ipso visibili immediate, quia visibile superpositum oculo non videtur. Relinquitur ergo, quod oporteat organum visus pati a visibili per aliquod medium: necesse est ergo esse aliquod medium inter visibile et visum. Si autem est vacuum, nihil est medium, quod posset immutare et immutari. Relinquitur ergo, quod si esset vacuum, omnino nihil videretur.
          <td>433. Then at ‘Democritus etc.’, he sets aside an erroneous view. Democritus, he says, was wrong in thinking that if the medium between the eye and the thing seen were a vacuum, any object, however small, would be visible at any distance, e.g. an ant in the sky. This cannot be. For if anything is to be seen it must actually affect the organ of sight. Now it has been shown that this organ as such is not affected by an immediate object—such as an object placed upon the eye. So there must be a medium between organ and object. But a vacuum is not a medium; it cannot receive or transmit effects from the object. Hence through a vacuum nothing would be seen at all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Incidit autem in hanc opinionem Democritus, quia putabat, quod causa quare distantia impedit visionem alicuius rei, sit per medium quod resistit immutationi visibilis: hoc autem est falsum. Non enim diaphanum habet contrarietatem ad lumen vel colorem, sed est in ultima dispositione ad eorum receptionem: cuius signum est quod subito immutatur a lumine vel colore. Causa autem, quare distantia impediat visum, est, quia omne corpus videtur sub quodam angulo cuiusdam trianguli, vel magis pyramidis, cuius basis est in re visa, et angulus est in oculo videntis.
          <td>434. Democritus went wrong because he thought that the reason why distance diminishes visibility was that the medium is of itself an impediment to the action of the visible object upon sight. But it is not so. The transparent medium as such is not in the least incompatible with luminosity or colour; on the contrary, it is proximately disposed to their reception; a sign of which is that it is illumined or coloured instantaneously. The real reason why distance diminishes visibility, is that everything seen is seen within the angle of a triangle, or rather pyramid, whose base is the object seen and apex in the eye that sees.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Neque differt quantum ad hoc, utrum visus fiat extramittendo, ita quod lineae concludentes triangulum vel pyramidem, sint lineae vel visuales progredientes a visu ad rem visam, vel e converso sit, dummodo visus sit sub praedicta figura trianguli vel pyramidis. Quod ideo necesse est, quia cum res visa sit maior quantitate, quam pupilla, oportet quod proportionaliter diminuendo, proveniat immutatio visibilis, usque ad visum. Manifestum est autem, quod quanto latera trianguli vel pyramidis sunt longiora, dummodo sit eadem basis, tanto angulus est minor: et ideo quanto a remotiori videtur, minus videtur; et tanta potest esse distantia quod omnino non videatur.
          <td>435. It makes no difference whether seeing takes place by a movement from the eye outwards, so that the lines enclosing the triangle or pyramid run from the eye to the object, or e converso, so long as seeing does involve this triangular or pyramidal figure; which is necessary because, since the object is larger than the pupil of the eye, its effect upon the medium has to be scaled down gradually until it reaches the eye. And, obviously, the longer are the sides of a triangle or pyramid the smaller is the angle at the apex, provided that the base remains the same. The further away, then, is the object, the less does it appear—until at a certain distance it cannot be seen at all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit ignis autem ostendit quomodo videatur ignis et lucida corpora: et dicit quod videntur non solum in lumine, sicut colorata, sed etiam in tenebris, sicut illa de quibus supra dixit. Et hoc ex necessitate contingit; quia ignis habet tantum de lumine, quod potest diaphanum omnino facere in actu, ita ut et ipsum et alia videantur. Nec est tantum debile lumen eius, quod ad praesentiam maioris luminis obumbretur, sicut accidit in his quae sunt dicta supra.
          <td>436. Next, at ‘But fire’, he explains how fire and bright bodies are seen—which are visible not only, like coloured objects, in the light, but even in the dark. There is a necessary reason for this, namely that fire contains enough light to actualise perfectly the transparent medium, so that both itself and other things become visible. Nor does its light fade out in the presence of a greater light, as does that of the objects mentioned above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit eadem autem ostendit quod similiter se habet in aliis sensibus sicut in visu: et dicit quod eadem ratio est de sono et odore, sicut et de colore. Nullum enim eorum sentitur, si tangit organum sensus; sed ab odore et sono moventur media, a medio autem utrumque organorum, auditus scilicet et olfactus. Sed cum aliquis ponit corpus odorans aut sonans, super organum sensus, non sentitur. Et similiter est in tactu et gustu, licet non videatur, propter causam quae inferius dicetur.
          <td>437. Then, at ‘The same account’, he shows how the case of the other senses is similar to sight. No sound or odour, e.g., is perceived if there is immediate contact with the organ in question. There must be a medium affected by sound or odour, which itself then. affects our sense of hearing or of smell. A sounding or odorous body placed upon the organ is not perceived as such. The same is true even of touch and taste, though, for a reason to be given later, this is less evident.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit medium autem ostendit quid sit medium in his sensibus; et dicit, quod illud quod movetur a sono, est aer; medium autem, quod movetur ab odore, est aliquid commune aeri et aquae, sicut et utrumque eorum est medium, quod movetur a colore; sed a colore movetur utrumque horum, secundum quod diaphanum. Passio autem communis aeri et aquae, secundum quam moventur ab odore, est innominata: non enim moventur ab odore secundum quod sunt diaphana. Et quod utrumque horum moveatur ab odore, manifestat per hoc, quod animalia aquatica habent sensum odoris: ex quo manifestum est, quod aquae moventur ab odore. Homo autem et animalia gressibilia et respirantia, non odorant nisi respirando. Et sic manifestum est, quod aer est medium in odoratu. Horum autem causa posterius dicetur.
          <td>438. Finally, at ‘The medium of sound’ he states what is the medium in hearing and smelling. That of hearing is air, and that of smelling is something common to air and water—just as both of these provide a medium for colour in so far as each is a transparency. There is indeed no name for the quality in air and water which provides the medium for odour; but it certainly is not transparency. And that both air and water are conductors of smell he shows from the fact that marine animals have a sense of smell. Man, however, and other animals that walk and breathe, only smell by breathing; which proves that air is the medium of smell. This fact will be explained later.

            <td>Now let us start by treating of sound and hearing. Sound is twofold: the sort that is actual, and the sort that is potential. For certain things, we say, have no sound, such as sponges, wool and fur; while others, such as bronze and all other smooth and hard things, have sound, because they are able to produce it, i.e. to cause actual sound in the medium and in the hearing. §§ 439-41

            <td>Sound in act is always of something, on something, in something: for it is caused by percussion. Hence it is impossible for anything by itself, as a single thing, to produce sound. For there must be one thing that strikes and another that is struck; hence whatever emits sound does so ‘on something’. i.e. by contact with something—which, when touched with a blow, sounds. And the blow necessarily implies movement. § 442

            <td>As we said before, it is not a blow upon anything whatever that gives sound: wool makes no sound, although it be struck; but bronze, or anything smooth and hollow, is such. Bronze because it is smooth; whilst hollow things by repercussion produce many ‘blows’ after the first, since what is set in motion cannot find an outlet. § 443-4

            <td>Further: sound is heard in air and water, but less in water. It is, however, neither air nor water that, properly, sounds; there must be a percussion of solid objects on each other, and on air. This happens if air is confined when struck, and cannot disperse. Hence if the striking is rapid and violent sound results. For the movement of what strikes must be sudden, if it is to out-run the breaking-up of the air; just as if one were to strike a rapidly-moving heap of sand or pile of stones. §§ 445-6

            <td>It seems there is always some echo, but not always a clear one. For the same occurs with sound as with light; which also is always, reflected: otherwise it would not spread to every part, but beyond the area illuminated by the sun there would be darkness. Still, it is not [always] reflected as it is reflected by water or bronze or other smooth things; hence it makes the shadow by which we discern the boundaries of light.

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de visibili, hic determinat de audibili, id est de sono. Et dividitur in duas partes. In prima determinat de sono in communi. In secunda determinat de quadam specie soni, scilicet voce, ibi, vox autem. Prima in duas partes dividitur. In prima determinat de sono.

          <td>439. Having disposed of the visible, the Philosopher now deals with the audible, that is, with sound. This section divides into two parts. In the first he deals with sound in general. In the second he deals with one kind of sound, namely voice, at ‘Voice’ etc. The first part is again divided into two ‘arts. First, he deals with sound itself; then with difference of sound, at ‘Differences in sonorous things’. The former part again subdivides. First, he reaches a conclusion on sound; then he raises a doubt about this conclusion, at ‘is it that which strikes’. The former of these sections again divides into two conclusions, the first on the origin of sound, and the second on the way that sound affects the hearing, at ‘Empty space’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem quaeratur quare determinat hic de generatione soni, cum supra non determinaverit de generatione coloris, sed solum de immutatione sensus et medii a colore, dicendum est, quod color et odor et sapor et qualitates tangibiles habent esse permanens et fixum in suo subiecto. Unde est alia consideratio ipsarum qualitatum secundum se, et secundum quod immutant sensum; et propter hoc alterius est considerationis utrumque. Unde philosophus de generatione coloris et saporis et odoris determinat in libro de sensu et sensato: de qualitatibus autem tangibilibus, in libro de generatione, et quantum ad aliqua, in libro Meteor. In hoc autem libro non intendit determinare de sensibilibus, nisi inquantum sunt immutativa sensus. Sonus autem causatur ex motu, et non habet esse fixum et quiescens in subiecto, sed in quadam immutatione consistit: unde simul determinatur de eo secundum quod generatur in sua specie et secundum quod immutat sensum. Prima autem pars dividitur in duas. In prima determinat de prima generatione soni. In secunda de secunda soni generatione quae fit per reflexionem, ibi, echo autem fit. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod sonus quandoque est in actu, quandoque in potentia. Secundo ostendit quomodo fit sonus in actu, ibi, fit autem secundum actum.
          <td>Should it be asked why he now raises the question of the origin of sound, whereas he did not deal with the production of colour, but only with colour’s effects on sense-organ and medium, the, answer is that colour and odour and taste and the tangible qualities have a fixed and permanent existence in their subjects. The consideration therefore of these qualities in themselves is one thing, and that of the way they affect the senses is another. The two questions are quite distinct. So the Philosopher deals with the origin of colour, taste and smell in his work <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> ; and with that of tangible qualities in the <i>De Generatione</i> , and in part also in the <i>Meteorologica</i> ; whilst in the present book he is only considering the objects of sensation in so far as they affect the sense-organs. But as sound is caused by change and has no fixed and stable existence in a subject, but actually consists in a movement or change, therefore it can be considered at one and the same time in its objective origin and in its effect on the senses. Its origin, then, is regarded under two aspects: first he deals with the primary origin of sound; and then, at ‘Echo arises’, with its secondary origin, produced by reverberation. As to the primary origin, he first explains that sound is sometimes in act and sometimes in potency; after which he shows how sound comes to be in act, at ‘Sound in act’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod antequam determinetur de tactu et de gustu, dicendum est de sono et olfactu: sed primo de sono, quia spiritualior est, ut supra ostensum est. Sonus autem dupliciter dicitur: dicitur enim sonus in actu, et sonus in potentia. Dicimus autem aliquam rem habere sonum, et quando actu sonat, et quando habet potentiam sonandi; sicut dicimus, haec Campana bene sonat, quamvis, non sonet in actu. Et secundum hunc modum dicimus, quod quaedam non habent sonum, quia non habent potentiam sonandi, sicut spongia, et huiusmodi mollia. Quaedam autem dicuntur habere sonum, quia possunt sonare, sicut aes, et alia huiusmodi plana et lenia. Sic ergo patet, quod sonus quandoque dicitur secundum potentiam, quandoque secundum actum.
          <td>440. He says, then, first that, before dealing with touch and taste, we must consider sound and smell; but first sound, because it is more spiritual, as has been shown. We speak of sound in two ways: as in act and as in potency. We say a thing has a sound when it is actually sounding, and also when it is only able to make sounds; as when we say, ‘this bell sounds well’, though it may not be actually ringing. In the same way we say of some things that they have no sound, meaning that they have no power to produce sound, e.g. sponges and similar soft objects; whereas other things, on the contrary, are said to sound because they are especially apt to produce sound, such as bronze, and other smooth and even materials. So it is clear that sound is sometimes spoken of as potential, and sometimes as actual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quod fiat sonus in actu, hoc pertinet, et ad medium, et ad auditum. Omne enim sensibile dupliciter dicitur esse in actu. Uno modo, quando actu sentitur; hoc est dum species eius est in sensu; et sic sonus est actu, secundum quod est in auditu. Alio modo secundum quod habet propriam speciem, per quam sentiri potest, prout est in subiecto; et sic alia sensibilia fiunt in actu, prout sunt in corporibus sensibilibus, sicut color prout est in corpore colorato, odor et sapor prout sunt in corpore odorifero et saporoso. Sic autem non est de sono. Nam in corpore sonante non est sonus, nisi in potentia. In medio autem quod movetur ex percussione corporis sonantis, fit sonus in actu. Et propter hoc dicitur, quod sonus in actu est medii et auditus, non autem subiecti sonabilis.
          <td>441. But the actuality of sound involves the medium and the faculty of hearing. For we can speak of a sense-object as actual in two ways: (1) So far as the object is actually being sensed, i.e. when its likeness is affecting the sense-organ. In this way a sound is actual when it is heard. (2) So far as the object actually is such that it can be sensed, but is such simply in its own objective being, outside the senses. And in this way the other sense-objects, colour, odour, savour, etc., exist actually in coloured or odorous or savourable bodies. But not so sound; for in a sound-productive body there is sound only potentially: actual sound exists only when the medium is affected by a disturbance from that body. Therefore the act of sound exists, he says, in the medium and in the hearing, but not in the audible body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit fit autem ostendit quomodo sonus fiat in actu. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quot concurrunt ad hoc, quod sonus constituatur in actu. Secundo ostendit, qualia esse oporteat, ibi, sicut autem diximus. Dicit ergo primo, quod ad hoc quod sonus fiat in actu, oportet tria concurrere. Fit enim semper alicuius, et ad aliquid, et in aliquo: et ideo si sit unum tantum, non potest sonum facere. Et huius ratio est, sive signum, quia percussio est causa soni: oportet igitur esse aliquid, id est percutiens, et aliquid percussum. Et propter hoc dicit, quod sonus est alicuius ad aliquid idest percutientis ad percussum. Oportet enim quod illud quod facit sonum, tangat aliquid; et cum tetigerit suo ictu, generetur tunc sonus. Ictus autem percutientis, non fit sine motu locali: motus autem localis non est sine medio. Unde relinquitur, quod oportet esse medium, et ad hoc quod fiat sonus in actu. Et hoc est, quod dictum est, quod oportet esse sonum non solum alicuius et ad aliquid, sed etiam in aliquo.
          <td>442. Then at ‘Sound in act’, Aristotle shows how sound actually comes about: first with regard to the number of factors required for sound to come into act; and then, at ‘As we said before’, with regard to what these factors are. First then, there are three concurrent factors in sound: Sound is of something, on something, in something. Therefore no single thing by itself can produce sound—the reason (or sign) of this being that the cause of sound is percussion, which implies a thing struck and a striker. Hence his saying ‘ <i>of</i> something, <i>on</i> something’, i.e. of the thing striking and on the thing struck. What produces sound must touch something as with a sudden blow. Now a blow implies local movement, which implies a medium. Hence the need for a medium, if sound is to be produced actually. Hence his saying, ‘in something’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sicut autem ostendit qualia oportet esse ea quae requiruntur ad soni generationem. Et primo ostendit qualia oportet esse percutiens et percussum. Secundo quale oportet esse medium, ibi, amplius autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod sicut praedictum est, sonus non fit ex percussione quorumcumque corporum. Dictum est enim supra, quod pili, et spongiae, et huiusmodi mollia, non habent potentiam sonandi; unde nullum sonum faciunt, etiam si percutiantur. Cuius ratio est, quia mollia cedunt percutienti; unde ex percussione non extruditur aer, ut sic in eo possit formari sonus ex ictu percutientis et resistentia percussi. Sed si huiusmodi mollia comprimantur, ut aliquam duritiem habeant, et resistant percutienti, sequitur sonus, licet sonus surdus. Sed aes, et corpora lenia et concava, sua percussione faciunt sonum. Necesse est enim quod illa, ex quorum percussione sonus redditur, sint dura, ut aer extrudatur: quae quidem extrusio est causa generationis soni. Requiritur etiam quod sint lenia, ut sit aer unus, sicut infra dicetur.
          <td>443. When he says ‘As we said before’, he shows what sort of factors produce sound. And first he shows of what sort must the striking and the struck objects be; and then, at ‘Further etc.’ what sort of thing the medium must be. First, then, as we have already noted, sound is not produced by striking any material body whatever. Wool and sponges and suchlike soft things cannot give out sound even when struck; the reason being that soft things yield to the impact, so that no air is expelled by it-no air in which a sound might be formed by the blow of a striker and the resistance of something struck. Yet when such soft things are compressed firmly enough to resist an impact, then a sound results, though only a dull one. But bronze objects, and bodies that are smooth and concave, give out sound when struck. Hardness is needed; else air will not be driven out by the blow, and consequently no sound be caused. And the body struck should also be smooth, so that the air expelled may hold compactly together in one, as will be explained below.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Concava autem etiam percussa, bene reddunt sonum, quia in eis intus aer concluditur. Et cum illud quod primo motum est, non possit statim exire, percutit alium aerem, et sic ex repercussione fiunt multi ictus et multiplicatur sonus. Et propter hoc etiam illa quae in sui compositione habent aerem bene dispositum, sunt bene sonora, sicut aes et argentum. In quorum autem compositione aer non bene se habet, non sunt bene sonora, sicut plumbum, et alia huiusmodi, quae sunt magis feculenta et terrestria.
          <td>444. Hollow bodies give out sound very well, when struck, because they hold the air in, and, as this air first set in motion cannot at once come out, it disturbs the rest of the air, and thus by repercussion the impact and the sounding are multiplied. For this reason also materials with a suitable disposition of air in their composition are especially sonorous, such as bronze and silver; but materials in which air is less well disposed are less sonorous, like lead and such things as are more earthy and sedimentary.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit amplius auditur ostendit quale sit medium, in quo generatur sonus: et dicit, quod medium, in quo sonus auditur, est aer et aqua, sed minus auditur in aqua quam in aere; unde propriissimum medium tam in generatione soni quam in auditu, est aer. Et quia medium, in quolibet sensu, qualitatibus sensibilibus secundum illum sensum caret, ut possit omnes recipere; manifestum est, quod neque aer neque aqua habent proprium sonum, sed necessarium est ad soni generationem, in aere vel aqua, quod aliqua corpora firma vel solida et dura percutiant seinvicem, et percutiant aerem.
          <td>445. Then, at ‘Further: sound is heard’, he explains the medium in which sound is produced: observing that the medium of sound is air or water, but water less than air. The most suitable medium for both the production and the reception of sound is air. And since the medium of any sense must lack all the sensible qualities perceived by that sense, if it is to serve as the receiver of them, it is evident that neither air nor water has a sound of its own; but if sound is to be produced in air or water some firm and solid and hard objects must strike upon one another, and so cause an impact on the air.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem simul fiat percussio solidorum adinvicem, et per consequens sonus et ad aera, contingit cum aer in sua integritate manet, ut possit percuti, et non dividitur ante percussionem. Et propter hoc videmus, quod si aliquid tardo motu tangat alterum, non facit sonum, quia prius recedit aer et dissolvitur, quam contactus solidorum corporum fiat. Sed si percussio sit velox et fortis, tunc fit sonus; quia ad hoc quod fiat sonus, oportet quod motus percutientis praeveniat divisionem aeris, ut aer adhuc adunatus sive collectus percuti possit, et in eo sonus generari. Et est simile, sicut cum aliquid velociter fertur, percutere potest acervum lapidum antequam dissolvatur, quod non contingit si tarde moveatur. Et propter hoc etiam, quando aliquid velociter fertur in ipso aere, facit sonum ex suo motu, quia ipse aer adhuc adunatus, se habet in ratione percussi, et non solum medii.
          <td>446. Now if the impact of solid bodies upon one another is to be simultaneous with the production of sound in the air, it is necessary that the air remain a whole and continuous, that it be not broke up before receiving the effect of the impact. Hence it is, as experience shows that when two bodies are brought slowly together no sound occurs: for the air recedes and melts away before the contact is made. But if the impact is swift and violent, then a sound results; for if sound is to occur, the movement of what strikes must <i>precede</i> the division of the air, so that the air can be struck while still <i>en bloc</i> , or collected, and so a sound be produced in it. It is as when one strikes swiftly with a whip, hitting a whole heap of stones all at once, before they fall apart. For the same reason, when anything passes rapidly through the air, it makes a noise as it goes, because the air itself, being compact, serves as the object struck, not merely as the medium.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit echo autem determinat de secunda generatione soni, quae fit per reverberationem; qui quidem sonus vocatur echo. Primo ergo determinat quomodo generetur. Secundo ostendit quomodo diversificetur in sui generatione, ibi, videtur autem. Considerandum est autem circa primum, quod generatio soni in aere consequitur motum aeris, ut dictum est. Sic autem contingit de immutatione aeris apud generationem soni, sicut de immutatione aquae, cum aliquid in aquam proiicitur. Manifestum est enim quod fiunt quaedam regyrationes in circuitu aquae percussae. Quae quidem circa locum percussionis sunt parvae, et motus est fortis. In remotis autem gyrationes sunt magnae, et motus debilior. Tandem autem motus totaliter evanescit, et gyrationes cessant. Si autem antequam motus cesset, gyrationes illae aliquod obstaculum inveniant, fit motus gyrationis in contrarium; et tanto vehementius, quanto propinquius sunt primae percussioni.
          <td>447. Next, at ‘Echo arises’, he deals with the secondary production of sound, which is by reverberation. This sound is called echo. He settles, first, how echo itself is produced; and then, at ‘It seems’, how its varieties occur. With regard to the former point, we may note that the production of sound in air follows the movement of air, as has been said. What takes place in the air when sound is produced is like what happens in water when something is thrown into it. Obviously, circular undulations form in the water where it is hit; and these are small around the point of striking, but with a strong movement; whilst further away the undulations are large and the movement is weak. Ultimately, the movement disappears altogether and the undulations cease. But if the undulations meet an obstacle before they cease moving a contrary wave-movement is set up, so much the more violent as it is closer to the original impact.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur intelligendum est, quod ad percussionem corporum sonantium, aer in gyrum movetur, et sonus undique diffunditur. Et in vicino quidem gyrationes sunt minores, sed motus fortior; unde sonus fortius percipitur. In remotis autem gyrationes sunt maiores, et motus debilior, et sonus obscurior auditur. Tandem autem deficit totum. Si autem antequam huiusmodi gyrationes deficiant, fiat reverberatio aeris sic moti, et sonum deferentis ad aliquod corpus, gyrationes revertentur in contrarium, et sic auditur sonus quasi ex adverso. Et haec vocatur echo.
          <td>448. Now, in a similar way, when sounding bodies strike together the air is moved in a circular motion and the sound diffused in all directions. Near to the impact the air-circles are small, but are moving swiftly. Hence, there the sound will be very distinctly heard. Further away the circles are larger and the sound is less distinct; and at length it ceases altogether. But if, before the circles vanish, the air so moving and so carrying sound, is repulsed from some body, the undulations return on their tracks and a new sound comes in the reverse direction. And this is called ‘echo’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod praecipue fit, quando illud obstans, ad quod repercutitur aer motus, est aliquod corpus concavum, quasi quoddam vas determinans, et concludens aerem in sua unitate, et ideo prohibens ipsum dividi. Tunc enim ille aer sic unitus et commotus, quia non potest ulterius motum protendere, propter corpus obstans, percutit iterum aerem, a quo percutiebatur, et fit motus in contrarium. Sicut accidit cum aliquis proiicit pilam, quae hic sphaera dicitur, et inveniens obstaculum resilit.
          <td>449. This effect is realised most perfectly when the obstacle in question is concave, for then it acts like a vessel that holds the air together in its own unity, preventing its dispersal. For then the moving air, thus held together and unable to move further because of the obstacle, is thrown back on the air behind and a reverse movement begins-just as when a ball thrown against an obstacle rebounds.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit videtur autem ostendit quomodo diversimode fit echo; et dicit, quod videtur semper fieri echo, sed non semper fit certa, id est manifeste perceptibilis. Et hoc ostendit per simile. Dicit enim quod accidit in sono sicut in lumine. Lumen enim semper repercutitur; sed quandoque quidem est manifesta repercussio luminis, quandoque autem non. Manifesta quidem est repercussio luminis, quando repercutitur ab aliquo corpore fulgido, itaque cum quadam claritate fit luminis repercussio, simili modo primae luminis emissioni. Immanifesta autem est repercussio luminis, quando repercutitur ab aliquo corpore opaco; quia huiusmodi repercussio fit sine claritate et radiorum emissione. Nisi enim a corporibus opacis fieret repercussio radiorum solis, non fieret lumen penitus, idest in qualibet parte aeris superioris hemisphaerii, sed ubique esset tenebra extra solem, id est extra loca ad quae directe perveniunt radii solares. Non tamen sic repercutitur lumen a corporibus opacis, sicut ab aqua vel aere, aut aliquo de numero lenium corporum et tersorum, a quibus fit repercussio cum claritate et radiorum emissione. Et ideo, quia repercussio, quae fit a corporibus opacis, non est similis repercussioni quae fit a corporibus fulgidis; repercussio, quae fit a corporibus opacis, facit tenebram, idest umbram ex illa parte ubi determinatur lumen manifestum, quod est ex directa emissione radiorum solarium. Similiter autem, quando repercussio soni fit ad corpus concavum, in quo natus est multiplicari sonus, fit echo certus, id est manifeste comprehensibilis. Quando autem ad alia corpora fit reverberatio soni, quae non sunt nata multiplicare sonum, non fit echo manifestus.
          <td>450. Then, where he says ‘It seems’, he explains how echo occurs in various ways, saying that there would seem to be always some echo produced, but it is not always definite, i.e. clearly perceptible. This he shows by a simile drawn from light. Light, he says, is always reflected; but sometimes the reflection is perceptible, sometimes not. The reflection of light is visible when it comes from a shining body; for then the reflection is accompanied by some brightness, as was the original emission of light. The reflection is not visible when it comes from an opaque body, for then it takes place with no brightness or radiance. Yet unless the sun’s rays were reflected by opaque bodies there would be no light at all in the air of any part of the upper hemisphere, but instead only darkness everywhere away from the sun, i.e. outside the places reached by the solar rays directly. But light is not reflected by opaque bodies in the same way as by water or air or any of the smooth and polished bodies which throw back light brightly and radiantly. The reflection from opaque bodies is ‘dark’, that is to say, it forms the shadow extending outside the limit of the clear light of the solar rays. So also, then, when the repercussion of sound takes place in a concave body, wherein sound cannot but be multiplied, a clear and distinctly perceptible echo results. But when the repercussion of sound is from other bodies which do not naturally redouble it, there is no perceptible echo.

Dicit ergo primo, quod quia medium in sono est aer, recte dicitur a quibusdam, quod vacuum est proprium sensui auditus, quia videtur eis quod vacuum sit aer. Aer autem facit audire sonum, cum moveatur, existens unus et continuus, ut in eo possit formari sonus. Et quia ad hoc quod formetur sonus, necessaria est unitas et continuitas aeris, ideo non fit sonus, nisi sonabile quod percutitur, sit lene. Lene enim est cuius una pars non supereminet alteri. Asperum autem cuius una pars alicui supereminet. Unde manifestum est, quod superficies lenis corporis est simpliciter una; et propter hoc, aer propter unitatem plani, id est superficiei, fit unus, et simul existens. Si autem corpus non sit lene, sed asperum, tunc superficies non est una. Et, quia aer est frangibilis, id est facile divisibilis, sequitur quod etiam aer non sit unus et continuus: unde non potest in eo formari sonus.
          <td>451. After deciding about the origin of sound the Philosopher now comes to certain conclusions about sound’s impression on sense: and first, at ‘Hearing’ is etc., about its effect on the sense organ. First, then, he observes that, the medium of sound being air, it has been rightly said that the vacuum was an essential factor in hearing (for those who said this thought that ‘the vacuum’ was air). Now when air is disturbed it makes sound audible, provided that it is a single continuum such that a sound can be formed in it. For if sound is to be produced it requires a singleness and continuity in the air; therefore no sound occurs unless the sounding thing that is struck be smooth. A thing is smooth if no part of it juts out from the rest. A smooth surface, then, is a simple unity, upon which the air too exists in a single and uniform way. it is otherwise if the body in question has a rough surface; and since air is ‘unstable’, that is, easily broken up, it follows that neither will the air be a continuous unity, and therefore that no sound will be formed in it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur patet, quod illud est sonans tantum, id est faciens sonum, quod movet aerem unum continuum existentem a se usque ad auditum. Sic ergo patet, quod illi qui dicunt quod vacuum est proprium sensui auditus, dicunt aliquid recte: quia esse proprium auditus competit aeri, quem vacuum esse dicunt. Non autem dicunt recte quantum ad hoc quod plenum aere dicunt esse vacuum.
          <td>452. It is clear then that nothing sounds, i.e. produces sound, unless it sets in motion a single continuum of air between itself and the hearing. It follows that those who said that the ‘vacuum’ was adapted to the sense of hearing said something to the point; for to be adapted to hearing is a property of air, which they called a vacuum. But they were not right in using the term ‘vacuum’ for that which is really full of air.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit auditus autem determinat de immutatione auditus a sono, quantum ad ipsum organum sensus auditus. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit, quod aer appropriatur organo auditus. Secundo ostendit, qualis sit aer, qui competit organo auditus, ibi, per se quidem igitur. Tertio ostendit, quomodo auditus impeditur vel non impeditur ex impedimento organi, ibi, propter hoc autem et aqua.
          <td>453. Then, when he says ‘Hearing is naturally conjoined’, he concludes about the impression made on hearing by sound, so far as the organ is concerned. And he does three things here. First, he shows that air is adapted to the organ of hearing: secondly, he shows what sort of air this is (at ‘Of itself air’), and thirdly, he shows how hearing may or may not be obstructed by an impediment in the organ (at ‘On this account therefore’).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod auditus connaturalis est aeri, ita quod, sicut humidum aqueum convenit instrumento visus, ita aer convenit instrumento auditus. Et hoc ideo, quia si attribuatur aer instrumento auditus, sequitur quod eadem passio soni erit in aere exterius moto et in aere qui movetur intus, et est instrumentum auditus. Et ideo anima non audit in qualibet parte sui corporis, neque aer sonans generat sonum, sive penetrat quamcumque partem corporis animati, quia animatum non habet in qualibet sui parte aerem, ut quaelibet pars eius possit esse movenda a sono; sicut etiam animatum habet humidum aqueum non ubique, sed in quadam parte determinata, scilicet in pupilla.
          <td>First, then, he says that hearing has a natural congruity with air; air is adapted to the organ of hearing as watery fluid to the organ of sight. And this because, air pertaining to the organ of hearing, the same effect of sound can exist in the moving air both inside and outside the organ—the air inside acting as the instrument of hearing. This is why hearing does not occur in every part of the body, nor the sounding air produce a sound in, or penetrate into, every part of the animate body. The latter has not air in each of its parts so that any part might be set in motion by sound; in the same way as the living body has a certain watery fluid only in one special part (the pupil of the eye), not everywhere.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit per se igitur ostendit qualis sit aer, qui appropriatur instrumento auditus. Et dicit, quod cum omne habens sonum sit aptum natum resistere percutienti: manifestum est, quod aer per se non habet sonum, eo quod de se non est natum resistere percutienti, sed facillime cedit. Prohibetur enim cessio eius, sive diffluxus, ab aliquo corpore solido; et ideo cum hoc accidit, motus aeris reddit sonum. Dictum est enim, quod ad generationem soni, oportet fieri percussionem duorum solidorum adinvicem, et ad aerem. Sed aer, qui est connaturalis auditui est aedificatus, id est firmiter dispositus in auribus, cum hac proprietate quod sit immobilis, ad hoc quod animal possit sentire per certitudinem omnes differentias motus. Sicut enim humidum aqueum, quod est in pupilla, caret omni colore, ut possit cognoscere omnes colorum differentias, ita oportet quod aer, qui est intra tympanum auris, careat omni motu ad hoc quod possit discernere omnes sonorum differentias.
          <td>454. Then, at ‘Of itself air’, he shows what sort of air is instrumental in hearing. And he says that everything that sounds is by nature resistant to percussion. Obviously air is not of itself a sounding material, for it does not by nature resist what strikes it, but rather yields easily. However, its yielding or diffusion can be prevented by a solid body, and then the movement of the air gives out a sound. For we have seen that, for the production of sound, two solids must strike against each other and against air. But the air proper to hearing is ‘built into’, or firmly set in, the ears with a certain stillness, in order that the animal may perceive distinctly every one of its movements. For, as the watery matter in the pupil lacks colour in order to take in all differences of colour, so must the air in the tympanum of the ear lack motion that it may discern every difference bf sound.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit propter hoc ostendit quomodo impediatur auditus ex impedimento organi. Ponit autem duo impedimenta, secundum duo quae dixit esse necessaria ad organum auditus. Quorum primum est quod sit ibi aer. Secundum est, quod ille aer sit immobilis. Primum ergo impedimentum est ex hoc quod ipse aer corrumpitur. Et ideo ex praedictis manifestum est, quod in aqua auditus fit ita dumtaxat, quod aqua non ingrediatur ad ipsum connaturalem aerem, quem dixit aedificatum esse in auribus; sed neque etiam in aurem ingrediatur; quod impossibile est propter reflexiones, quae prohibent introitum aquae in aurem.
          <td>455. Next, at ‘On this account’, he shows how hearing may be hindered by an impediment in the organ. He states two impediments, according to the two conditions which, he says, are necessary to the organ of hearing. Of these, the first is air, and the second that this air be still. The first impediment, then, will be any elimination of the air. It follows therefore that hearing can take place in water, provided that the water does not penetrate to that special air which, as he says, is ‘built into’ the ear. But in fact water does not enter into the ear at all; because of the spirals which prevent its entry.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed cum hoc accidit, quod aqua scilicet ingrediatur ad naturalem aerem, non audit animal propter corruptionem aeris, qui est necessarius ad audiendum. Sicut etiam, si corrumpatur humidum pupillae ex immissione alicuius extranei, impeditur visio. Et non solum ex corruptione aeris impeditur auditus, sed etiam si meninga, id est pellis circumdans aerem, aut aliqua pars coniuncta laboret, idest impediatur pellis pupillae, quae continet humorem aqueum pupillae.
          <td>456. But if water should happen to penetrate to this inner air, the animal would cease to hear, because the air needed for hearing would then have been eliminated; just as sight is prevented if the aqueous matter of the pupil is destroyed by the entry of some alien body. And not only is hearing impeded by the loss of this air, but also ‘if the ear-drum’, that is, the skin enclosing this air, or some adjoining portion, ‘is ailing’; just as in the case of sight, when the cornea of the pupil which holds the aqueous matter of the eye is injured.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam autem libri habent quod in aqua non audimus. Quod est contra illud quod dictum est, quod audimus in aere et in aqua, et contra illud quod philosophus dicit in libro de historia animalium, quod animalia audiunt in aqua. Licet enim aqua non ingrediatur ad interiorem aerem, tamen potest eum commovere, et sic imprimere in ipsum speciem soni.
          <td>457. Now, certain books maintain that we do not hear in water. This is contrary to what has been said here (that we hear both in air and in water) and also to what the Philosopher says in the <i>Historia Animalium</i> , that animals hear in water. For though the water does not penetrate to the interior air, it can set it in motion, and thus impress upon it some sort of sound.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum autem impedimentum auditus, ponit ibi sed signum. Et hoc impedimentum provenit ex hoc, quod aer, qui est in auribus, non est immobilis: unde dicit, quod signum per quod potest discerni, utrum aliquis sit boni auditus vel non, est quod semper audiat tinnitum in auribus, et sonum, sicut auditur cum apponitur cornu ad aures, propter motum aeris in cornu. Cum enim hoc accidit, homo non est boni auditus, quia aer in auribus sic audientis tinnitum, semper movetur quodam proprio motu. Sed ab instrumento auditus, sonus debet esse extraneus, et non proprius sicut instrumentum visus recipit extraneum colorem, et non habet proprium. Si autem haberet proprium, impediretur visio. Et similiter si aer, qui est in auribus, habeat proprium motum et sonum, impeditur auditus. Quia igitur auditus fit per aerem, propter hoc aliqui credentes aerem esse vacuum, dicunt nos audire vacuo et sonanti, quia scilicet pars qua audimus, habet aerem determinatum, id est immobilem et distinctum ab aere exteriori.
          <td>458. He states the second impediment to hearing at ‘A test of good hearing’. This impediment would come from a lack of stability in the air of the inner ear: so he says that a sign of one’s good or bad hearing is whether one continually hears a ringing in the ear, like the sound heard when a horn is held up to the ear; which sound is due to the movement of air in the horn. One in this condition has poor hearing, for the air in his ears is continually moving by a motion of its own. Each sound ought to be adventitious to the organ of hearing, not intrinsic; just as the organ of sight should receive each colour from without, having none of its own. If it has any of its own, sight is impeded. And in the same way, if the air in the ear has a motion and sound of its own, hearing is impeded. And it is because hearing thus comes about through air that some (thinking that air is a vacuum), say that we hear through a resounding vacuum; and indeed the organ by which we hear has its own special, motionless air, quite distinct from the air outside.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit utrum autem movet quaestionem circa generationem soni; utrum causa activa soni sit verberans, aut quod verberatur. Et determinat quod utrumque est causa, sed alio et alio modo: quia enim consequitur sonus motum, necesse est quod sicut aliquid est causa activa motus, ita aliquid est causa activa soni. Generatur autem sonus ex motu, quo aliquid percutiens, propter resistentiam percussi, resilit, eo scilicet modo quo saltantia, idest resilientia, moventur a lenibus et duris, et cum aliquis ea traxerit, idest fortiter impulerit. Manifestum est igitur, quod primum percutiens movet, et iterum percussum, inquantum facit resilire percutiens; et sic utrumque est causa activa motus.
          <td>459. Then, at ‘Is it that which strikes’ he raises a question about the origin of sound: whether the active cause of sound is the thing that strikes or that which is struck. He concludes that both are causes, though in different ways; because as sound follows upon motion, whatever is an efficient cause of motion is so also of sound. Sound originates in the movement with which a thing striking rebounds from the resistance of the thing struck; just as ‘bouncing’ or resilient bodies rebound from hard smooth objects, when one impels them violently against the latter. Clearly then the thing striking is a cause of movement; and also the object struck, inasmuch as it makes the latter rebound: and thus both are efficient causes of the motion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia in generatione soni necesse est quod quaedam resilitio fiat ex resistentia percussi, non omne quod verberat et verberatur sonat, sicut dictum est primo; puta si obiiciatur acus acui, non fit sonus. Sed ad hoc quod generetur sonus, oportet hoc quod percutitur esse regulare, idest esse sic dispositum, ut aer subito dissiliat ex eius resistentia, et moveatur, et ex tali motu generetur sonus.
          <td>460. And, because to produce sound it is necessary that there be a rebound from a struck thing’s resistance, consequently not everything that strikes or is struck gives out sound (as was said to begin with): e.g. if one needle is struck against another. To produce sound what is struck must be ‘smooth’, that is, so disposed that the air spreads and moves at once when the thing struck resists. Such a movement will cause sound.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit differentiae autem determinat de differentiis sonorum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quomodo percipiantur. Secundo quomodo nominentur, ibi, haec autem dicuntur. Dicit ergo primo, quod diversae res sonantes faciunt diversos sonos. Sed huiusmodi differentiae sonantium, secundum quod natae sunt facere diversos, non manifestantur quando sonus est in potentia, sed solum quando sonus est in actu. Sicut enim non videntur colores sine lumine, sic non percipiuntur acutum et grave in rebus sonativis, nisi fiat sonus in actu.
          <td>461. Then, at ‘Differences’, he examines the differences of sounds. First, he shows how these differences are perceived; and secondly, how they are named (at ‘These terms are used’). He says first, then, that different things produce different sounds. But these varieties in sounding bodies’ capacity to produce sound are only manifested in act, not in potency. For as colours are not perceived without light, so high or low tones are not perceived until a sound is actual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit haec autem ostendit quomodo differentiae sonorum nominentur. Et circa hoc quatuor facit. Primo ostendit unde sumantur nomina sonorum: et dicit, quod sumuntur, secundum metaphoram a qualitatibus tangibilibus. Manifestum est enim quod acutum et grave inter qualitates tangibiles computantur.
          <td>462. Then, where he says ‘These terms are used’, he shows how differences of sound are named. And he does four things here. First, he states whence the names of sounds are taken, saying that they are taken by metaphor from tangible qualities; for obviously high and low are reckoned as tangible qualities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi acutum enim ponit rationes nominum. Et dicit quod ille sonus acutus est, qui multum movet sensum auditus in pauco tempore; gravis autem sonus est, qui multo tempore movet parum.
          <td>463. Next, at ‘A high note moves’, he explains these names, saying that a sound is ‘high’ which moves the sense of hearing much in a short time: while a ‘low’ sound is one which moves it little in a longer time.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi neque tamen quia praedictae rationes videntur esse velocis et tardi, (velox enim est quod in parvo tempore multum movetur, tardum autem quod in multo tempore parum), ostendit qualiter se habet acutum et grave in sonis, ac velox et tardum in motibus: et dicit, quod velox non est idem quod acutum, nec grave in sonis est idem quod tardum, sicut nec sonus cuius differentiae sunt grave et acutum, est idem quod motus cuius differentiae sunt velox et tardum. Sed sicut motus est causa soni, ita velocitas motus est causa soni acuti, et tarditas motus est causa soni gravis. Sed hoc intelligendum est cum sonus causatur ab uno motu. Cum autem causatur ex pluribus motibus, frequentia motuum est causa acuti soni, et tarditas est causa gravis, ut dicit Boetius in musica. Unde et chorda magis tensa, acutius sonat, quia ex una percussione frequentius movetur.
          <td>464. Thirdly, at ‘But this does not mean’, since the above descriptions would seem to apply to the fast and the slow (the fast being that which in a short time moves much, the slow that which in much time moves little), he shows how the high and low in sounds are related to the fast and slow in motions. The fast, he says, is not the same as the high-toned, nor the low-toned the same as the slow, any more than sound, differentiated by the high and the low, is the same as movement, differentiated by the fast and the slow. But, as movement causes sound, so speed of movement is the cause of high tones, and slowness of low; in the case of sounds caused by a single movement. But when sound is produced by many movements, it is frequency of movements that causes the high tones, whilst their slowness causes the low, as Boethius says in the <i>De Musica</i> . Hence the tauter is a string, the higher is its note; because at a single stroke it vibrates more frequently.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quarto ibi et videntur assimilat differentias sonorum qualitatibus tangibilibus a quibus nominantur: et dicit quod ea quae sunt circa tactum, habent similitudinem cum acuto et hebeti in sonis: quia acutus sonus quasi pungit auditum, eo quod in pauco tempore movet ipsum: hebes autem quasi pellit, quia in multo tempore movet. Unde unum eorum accidit cum velocitate motus, aliud cum tarditate. Ultimo concludit quod sic de sono determinatum sit.
          <td>465. Fourthly, at ‘So there seems to be’, he likens differences of sounds to the tangible qualities from which they are named: observing that these qualities do resemble the sharp or flat in sounds; for the high note ‘pierces’ the hearing, in that it disturbs it quickly; whilst the low tone ‘thuds’ on it, so to speak, because it takes a longer time to disturb it. So the one takes place rapidly, the other slowly. Concluding, he says that he has sufficiently examined sound.

The cause of this, however, is another question. § 478

Et dividitur in partes duas: quarum prima praemittit quaedam, quae sunt necessaria ad definitionem vocis. In secunda definit vocem, ibi, quare percussio. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit quorum sit habere vocem. Secundo, quid sit proprium organum vocis, ibi, vox autem sonus. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit quod habere vocem est animatorum. Secundo ostendit quorum animatorum, ibi, multa autem animalium.
          <td>466. After discussing sound the Philosopher deals with voice which is a kind of sound. His treatment divides into two parts: first, he gives certain facts preliminary to a definition of voice; which he then defines, at ‘Hence a striking’. In the former part he does two things. First, he points out what things have voice: and secondly, what is the particular organ of voice, at ‘Voice is a sound’. The former division subdivides: first, he shows that only animate beings have voice, and then states which of these have it, at ‘Many animals’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod vox est quaedam species soni: est enim sonus animati: non autem quorumlibet, sed quorumdam, ut post patebit.
          <td>First, then, he observes that voice is a kind of sound,—the sound of the living being; and not of any, but of certain species, as will be explained later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nullum autem inanimatum habet vocem. Et si aliquando aliquod eorum dicatur habere vocem, hoc est secundum similitudinem, sicut tibia et lyra et huiusmodi instrumenta dicuntur habere vocem. Habent enim tria, eorum soni, in quibus assimilantur voci. Quorum primum est extensio. Manifestum est enim quod in corporibus inanimatis ex simplici percussione causatur sonus: unde, cum percussio statim transeat, sonus etiam cito transit et non continuatur. Sed vox causatur ex percussione aeris ad vocalem arteriam, ut post dicetur: quae quidem percussio continuatur secundum appetitum animae, et ideo vox extendi potest et continuari. Illa igitur instrumenta, de quibus dictum est, ex hoc ipso quod habent quamdam continuitatem in suo sono, habent similitudinem vocis.
          <td>467. No inanimate thing has a voice. And if sometimes such are said to have voice, this is by way of similitude, as when we speak of the voice of flutes and lyres and suchlike instruments. There are three respects in which the sounds made by these are comparable to voice. The first is prolongation; for while the sound of ‘inanimate bodies is produced by a simple percussion, which is no sooner ended than the sound quickly passes away without continuing, voice, on the contrary, is produced by a percussion of air in the windpipe (as will be explained later), which can be maintained by the soul according to its desire, and so be prolonged and continued. The instruments mentioned above have, then, some likeness to voice in the relatively prolonged character of their sounds.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum autem, in quo assimilantur voci, est melos, idest consonantia. Sonus enim corporis inanimati, cum ex simplici percussione proveniat, uniformis est, non habens in se diversitatem gravis et acuti: unde in eo non est consonantia, quae ex eorum proportione causatur. Sed vox diversificatur secundum grave et acutum, eo quod percussio, quae causat vocem, diversimode fit secundum appetitum animalis vocem emittentis. Unde, cum in praedictis instrumentis distinctio sit gravis et acuti in sono, eorum sonus est cum quadam melodia ad similitudinem vocis.
          <td>468. The second respect in which they resemble voice is melody. The sound of an inanimate body, since it arises from simple percussion, is uniform, with no variations of high and low pitch; and therefore without harmony. But in voice the percussions occur differently according to the varying feelings of the animal that is producing it; hence it is diversified by high and low pitch. And something like this occurs in the melodies produced by the said instruments.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertium, in quo sonus horum instrumentorum habet similitudinem vocis, est locutio, idest interpretatio sonorum ad similitudinem locutionis. Manifestum est enim, quod humana locutio non est continua; unde et in libro praedicamentorum, oratio, quae in voce profertur ponitur species quantitatis discretae. Distinguitur enim oratio per dictiones, et dictio per syllabas; et hoc accidit propter diversas percussiones aeris ab anima. Et similiter sonus praedictorum instrumentorum distinguitur secundum diversas percussiones, utpote diversarum chordarum, vel diversorum flatuum, aut aliquorum huiusmodi.
          <td>469. The third resemblance their sounds bear to voice consists in a certain likeness to speech in the way these sounds are co-ordinated. Human speech is not a continuous sound (hence in the <i>Predicaments</i> it is counted as a species of ‘discrete quantity’). Speech is divided into words, and words into syllables—and this by the separate percussions made upon air by the soul. In a similar way the said instruments, by means of separate strokes or breathings, etc., produce sounds successively.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit multa autem ostendit quorum animatorum sit habere vocem; et dicit quod etiam multa animalia sunt quae non habent vocem, sicut omnia carentia sanguine, quorum quatuor sunt genera, ut dicitur in libro de animalibus: scilicet mollia, quae habent mollem carnem exterius, ut pulpi et sepiae; et animalia mollis testae ut cancri, et animalia durae testae ut ostreae, et animalia anulosi corporis ut apes, formicae et huiusmodi. Nullum enim horum habet sanguinem neque vocem.
          <td>470. Next, at ‘Many animals”, he points out which animated beings have voice. Even many animals, he says, have none. These are the bloodless animals, of which there are the four genera enumerated in the <i>De Animalibus</i> , namely: the ‘soft-bodied’, having soft flesh externally, such as cuttlefish and molluscs; those with a soft shell, like crabs; those with a hard shell, like oysters; and those with anular bodies, like bees, ants, and so forth. None of these have voice.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et similiter etiam aliqua animalium habentium sanguinem non habent vocem, scilicet pisces. Et hoc rationabiliter accidit; quia sonus est quidam motus aeris, ut supra dictum est. Huiusmodi autem animalia non respirant aerem, et ideo non habent proprium sonum, qui sit vox. Sed quod aliqui pisces dicuntur habere vocem, sicut qui sunt in Acheloo, quod est proprium nomen fluvii, non habent proprie vocem, sed faciunt quemdam sonum cum branchiis, quibus expellunt aquam et attrahunt aerem, aut aliquo alio instrumento motus.
          <td>471. And even some sanguineous animals lack voice-namely fish. This is natural enough if sound is a movement of the air (as we have seen); for animals of this sort do not breathe air, and therefore produce no sound which could be their voice. And if it is asserted that certain fish, like those in the Achelous (the name of a river), have a voice, this is not true properly speaking; they merely make a sound with the gills by which they expel water and draw in air, or perhaps with some other moving instrument.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit vox autem ostendit quod sit organum vocis. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit, quod idem est organum vocis et respirationis. Secundo ostendit ad quid respiratio sit utilis, ibi, iam enim respiratio. Tertio ostendit quid sit organum respirationis, ibi, organum autem.
          <td>472. Then, at ‘Voice is a sound made by an animal’, he points out the organ of voice. First, he shows that the organ of voice is the same as that of respiration. Secondly, he explains the use of respiration, at ‘For Nature employs’. Thirdly, he shows what is the organ of respiration, at ‘Now the organ’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod quamvis vox sit sonus animalis, non tamen cuiuscumque partis animalis sonus est vox. Sed quia ad generationem soni requiritur quod sit percussio alicuius ad aliquid, et in aliquo, quod est aer: rationabile est, quod illa sola animata vocem habeant, quae aerem respirando suscipiunt, et ex eadem parte, unde respirant.
          <td>He observes first, then, that, while voice is an animal sound, not any sound of any part of the animal is voice. And since the production of sound requires the striking of something against something in something (i.e. in the air) it is understandable why those animals only have a voice which take in air by respiration, and that they have voice in the part through which they breathe.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit iam enim dicit quod natura utitur aere respirato ad duo opera, sicut etiam utitur lingua ad gustum et ad locutionem: quorum duorum, gustus est necessarius: est enim discretivus alimenti convenientis, quo conservatur animal; et propter hoc pluribus animalibus inest. Sed interpretatio quae fit per locutionem, est ad bene esse. Et similiter aere respirato natura utitur ad mitigationem caloris naturalis, quod est necessarium: et huius causa dicta est in libro de respiratione et expiratione: et utitur aere respirato ad formationem vocis, quod est ad bene esse.
          <td>473. Then, at ‘For Nature employs air’, he says that Nature uses air inhaled for two operations, as it uses the tongue for both tasting and speech. Of these two last activities, tasting is a necessity, since by it the animal discerns the nutriment that maintains it in mere existence (which is why taste is found in most animals). But the expression of meaning by means of speech is for the sake of a more complete existence. In a similar way, Nature uses inhaled air both for the mitigation of natural heat, which is simply necessary (the cause of this is given in the <i>De Respiratione et Expiratione</i> ) and also for the production of voice, which is for a more complete existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit organum autem ostendit quod sit organum respirationis: et dicit quod organum respirationis est vocalis arteria, quae est ordinata ad pulmonem ut ei deserviat ad aeris attractionem. Aer enim necesse est ut recipiatur in pulmone, quia animalia gressiva habent in hac parte plus de calore, quam in aliis partibus. Pulmo enim coniungitur cordi, in quo est principium caloris naturalis: et ideo locus, qui est circa, cor, indiget respiratione ad refrigerium caloris naturalis.
          <td>474. Next, at ‘Now the organ of respiration’ he says that this organ is the windpipe, the function of which is to serve the lungs by enabling them to draw in air. It is necessary that air be taken into the lungs because animals that can move about have more heat in this part than in others. The lungs are connected with the heart, wherein lies the source of the natural warmth of the body; consequently the parts around the heart need to be cooled; and this is done by respiration.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit autem locus primus, vel quia est primus post cor, pulmo utpote ei vicinior; vel quia cor est prima pars animalis, quantum ad generationem, et quantum ad causalitatem motus: et propter hoc necesse est, ut aer ingrediatur ad pulmonem ad refrigerium caloris naturalis cordis. Vel hoc quod dicit, quia in hac parte animalia pedibus gradientia habent plus caloris aliis, intelligendum est aliis animalibus. Manifestum est enim, quod animalia habentia sanguinem habent plus de calore naturali, carentibus sanguine. Et in genere habentium sanguinem habent pisces minus de calore naturali. Et propter hoc animalia carentia sanguine et pisces non respirant, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>475. These parts he says need to be cooled ‘first’, either because the lungs come first after the heart as being next to it, or because the heart comes first among the animal’s parts, both in origin and in the process of causing movement: which is why it is necessary that air enter the lungs to cool the heart’s natural heat. Or indeed the comparison may be between ‘this part’ in animals that move upon feet, and the same parts in other animals. For it is clear that animals with blood have more natural heat than those without; and among those with blood, fishes have the least; which is why neither bloodless animals nor fishes breathe, as has been said.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quare percussio ex praemissis, vocis definitionem concludit. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit definitionem vocis. Secundo manifestat eam, ibi, non enim omnis. Dicit ergo primo, quod quia vox est sonus animati, et ex illa parte, qua aerem respirat: omnis autem sonus est ex aliqua percussione aeris: sequitur quod vox sit respirati percussio aeris ad arteriam vocalem; quae quidem percussio fit ab anima, quae est in his partibus, idest principaliter in corde. Quamvis enim anima sit in toto corpore, ut est forma animalis, tamen vis eius motiva est principaliter in corde. Datur autem haec definitio per causam: non enim vox est percussio, sed sonus ex percussione causatus.
          <td>476. Then, at ‘Hence a striking’, he draws from the foregoing observations a definition of voice; first stating the definition and then, at ‘For not every animal’, explaining it. First, then, he says that, since voice. is the sound of the animate being, proceeding from the part through which it breathes air (for every sound implies some striking on air), it follows that voice is a striking upon air breathed in through the windpipe; which striking is caused by the soul as animating these parts, but especially the heart. For while the soul exists everywhere in the body of an animal (as its form), yet its motive power is principally in the heart. Note that he is defining in terms of the cause of the thing defined; for voice is not in fact the striking itself, but a sound made by striking.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non enim manifestat praedictam definitionem. Et primo quantum ad hoc quod dixerat, quod percussio vocalis est ab anima. Secundo quantum ad hoc quod dixit, quod est aeris respirati, ibi, signum autem. Posuerat enim tria in definitione vocis. Percutiens, scilicet animam. Percussum, scilicet aerem respiratum. Et ad quod fit percussio: scilicet vocalem arteriam: quorum tertium supra manifestaverat: unde restabat, quod duo prima manifestaret. Dicit ergo primo, quod sicut supra dictum est, non omnis sonus animalis est vox. Contingit enim linguam facere aliquos sonos, qui tamen non sunt voces; sicut et tussientes faciunt sonum, qui tamen non est vox. Oportet enim ad hoc quod sit vox, quod verberans aerem sit aliquid animatum, et cum imaginatione ad aliquid significandum. Oportet enim quod vox sit sonus quidam significans, vel naturaliter, vel ad placitum; et propter hoc dictum est, quod huiusmodi percussio est ab anima. Operationes enim animales dicuntur, quae ex imaginatione procedunt. Et sic patet, quod vox non est percussio respirati aeris, sicut accidit in tussi. Sed id cui principaliter attribuitur causa generationis vocis, est anima, quae utitur isto aere, scilicet respirato, ad verberandum aerem, qui est in arteria, ad ipsam arteriam. Aer ergo non est principale in vocis formatione, sed anima quae utitur aere, ut instrumento, ad vocem formandam.
          <td>477. Next, at ‘For not every animal sound’, he explains the definition with regard to his assertions (1) that the vocal impact came from the soul; and(2) that its material is breath, at ‘A sign of this’. Three factors have entered into his definition of voice: that which impels, i.e. the soul; that which is impelled, i.e. the air respired; and that in which the vocal impact occurs, i.e. the windpipe. The third of these he has explained above; So there remain the first two. He observes, then, first, that, as he has said, not every animal sound is a voice. Sometimes the tongue makes sounds which are not voice. Again, coughing is not voice. For voice to be produced it is required that what strikes the air should be something alive, or with a soul, and also, accompanying this, that an image be present which is meant to signify something. For voice must be a <i>significant</i> sound,—significant either by nature or conventionally. Hence the statement that vocal impact proceeds from the <i>soul</i> ; for operations proceeding from imagination can be said to be from the soul. It is clear, then, that voice is not the mere impact bf breath such as occurs in coughing; and that the principal cause of the production of voice is the soul, using this air, i.e. air inhaled, to force against the windpipe the air within it. Not air, then, is the principal factor in the formation of voice, but the soul, which uses air as its instrument.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit signum autem ostendit aliam partem definitionis, scilicet quod vox sit percussio aeris respirati: et dicit, quod signum huius est duplex. Unum, quia animal non potest formare vocem, neque dum attrahit aerem respirando, neque dum expellit expirando, sed dum retinet aerem: quia dum retinet, isto aere retento, et percutiente aerem existentem in vocali arteria, causat motum ad formationem vocis. Aliud signum est, quod pisces non habent vocem; non enim habent guttur, idest vocalem arteriam; et hanc partem non habent, quia non recipiunt aerem, neque respirant. Sed qui dicunt hoc, quod pisces respirant, peccant. Quare autem pisces non respirant, alia ratio est; pertinet enim ad scientiam, in qua considerantur particularia accidentia animalium.
          <td>478. Then, at ‘A sign of this’, he explains the other element in his definition, namely that voice is the impact of breath, saying that there are two signs of this. One sign is that no animal can produce voice either while inhaling air, or while expelling it, but only while it retains air; because while it retains air, this air, being withheld and striking against the air in the windpipe, causes a movement that results in voice. Another sign is that fishes have no voice; for they have no windpipe or vocal passage, and this because they neither inhale nor exhale air. Those who say that fishes breathe are mistaken; but why they do not breathe is another matter, belonging to the science which deals with the particular attributes of animals.

            <td>It is not so easy to come to conclusions about odour and the odorous as about the sense-objects already discussed. What odour is is less obvious than what sound is, or the visible or light; the reason being that our sense of smell lacks precision; it is inferior to that of many animals. For man smells but feebly, discerning nothing odorous save with some special pleasure or disgust, as though our organ for the perception of smells were defective. It is arguable indeed that, as hard-eyed animals see colour, yet so that delicate differences are not sharply defined to them, except as these cause fear or not, so are smells to the human species. §§ 479-80

            <td>For it seems that while smell has an analogy with taste, and the species of savour with odours, yet we have a sharper perception of taste, because this is a sort of touch,—the sense which man possesses to the highest degree of precision. Whereas in the other senses he is inferior to many animals, by touch he can discriminate with exactness far beyond the rest of the animal world. Hence man is the most sagacious of animals. A sign of this is that within the human race, men are gifted or not intellectually in virtue of this sense, and of no other. For coarse-bodied people are mentally inert, whilst the tenderly-fleshed are quick of understanding. §§ 481-6

            <td>As some flavours are sweet, some bitter, so with odours. But some things are analogously endowed with savour and odour: I mean, have a pleasant taste and pleasant smell. In others, however, these qualities are contrary. Likewise odours are pungent, harsh, sharp or oily: but since, as we have said, odours are not very distinct, whereas flavours are, they take their names from the latter, according to resemblance. For a sweet smell comes from saffron and honey: a pungent smell from thyme; and so in other cases. §§ 487-9

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de visibili et audibili, nunc tertio determinat de odorabili. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima determinat de odorabili, ut sic: in secunda determinat de odorabili secundum quod immutat sensum olfactus, ibi, est autem olfactus. Circa primum duo facit. Primo determinat de odorabili secundum se. In secunda de non odorabili secundum quod odoratu percipitur, ibi, adhuc autem. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit difficultatem determinandi de odorabili. Secundo ostendit quomodo accipiatur cognitio odorabilium, ibi, videtur enim et analogia.
          <td>479. Having dealt with the visible and the audible, the Philosopher now considers smell and its object. His treatment has two parts: he first examines this object as such, and then at ‘Smelling also’ the manner in which it impinges upon the sense. And as to the object as such, having considered it in itself, he turns, at ‘Furthermore, as hearing’ to consider a certain odourless object which falls within the range of smell. The former consideration again subdivides: first, he shows the difficulty of reaching definite conclusions about smell; secondly, he explains how we can come to know about the odorous, at ‘For it seems that smell has an analogy’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod non ita bene determinari potest de odore et odorabili, sicut de praedictis sensibilibus, scilicet audibili et visibili; quia non manifestum est nobis, quid sit odor, sicut quid est sonus, aut quid est visibile, aut lumen, vel aliquid huiusmodi.
          <td>First then he observes that it is harder to reach conclusions about smell and its object than about the sense-objects discussed hitherto, the audible and the visible. For whit odour is is not as clear to us as what sound is, or the visible, or light, or other things of that sort.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

Cuius ratio est, quia cum instrumentum sensus debeat esse proportionatum suo sensibili, sicut odor causatur ex calido et sicco, ita ad bonitatem instrumenti odoratus exigitur victoria calidi et sicci. Homo autem habet cerebrum, in cuius vicino positum est instrumentum olfactus, maius omnibus aliis animalibus secundum proportionem sui corporis, ut philosophus dicit in libro de animalibus: unde, cum cerebrum sit humidum et frigidum in se consideratum, impeditur in homine bonitas olfactus; et propter hoc prave odorat homo, et nihil odorabilium percipit nisi quod est secundum aliquam excellentiam inducens delectationem aut contrarium: quod contingit propter sensum, qui non est perspicax ad certitudinaliter discernendum de suo obiecto. Unde rationabile est, quod hominum genus sic se habeat ad percipiendos odores, sicut se habent animalia habentia duros oculos, ut locustae, et quidam pisces, ad percipiendos colores: quos propter debilitatem visus, ex ineptitudine organi, non percipiunt nisi in quadam excellentia, prout ex eis ingeritur eis aliquis terror, vel eius contrarium.

The reason, he says, is that our sense of smell is not so strong that we can distinctly and unerringly discern its object; for this sense is weaker in us than in many other animals; the reason being that, as the sense-organ corresponds to the sense-object, and as smell is produced by the warm and dry, therefore a good organ of smell will be predominantly a warm, dry organ. Now the brain of man, close to which lies the organ of smell, is, as the Philosopher says in the <i>De Animalibus</i> , larger in proportion to his body than that of any other animal; and since the brain itself is cold and moist, the human sense of smell is proportionately the less. Man smells weakly—indeed only what is strongly odorous and causes pleasure or disgust; and this because his sense of smell is lacking in a keen and exact discernment of its object. Hence one may reasonably opine that human beings stand with respect to odours in the same case as hard-eyed animals, such as locusts and certain types of fish stand with respect to colours; for these animals, on account of their weak vision and ill-disposed organs, see only what is very obviously visible and as such is apt to frighten them, or the contrary.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit videtur enim ostendit quomodo innotescant nobis differentiae odorum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod differentiae odorum nobis innotescunt per comparationem ad differentias saporum. Secundo ostendit quomodo respondent differentiae odorum differentiis saporum, ibi, est autem sicut humor.
          <td>481. Then at ‘For it seems that’, he shows how differences of odour are made known to us. First, he shows how differences of odour arc brought home to us by comparison with differences of taste. Secondly, he shows how differences of odour correspond to differences of taste, at ‘As some flavours’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod sensus olfactus in homine videtur habere quamdam convenientiam et proportionem ad gustum; similiter species humorum, idest saporum, ad species odoris. Unumquodque autem ignotum cognoscitur per id quod est magis manifestum. Unde, cum species saporum sint nobis maxime manifestae, species odorum, quae sunt nobis ignotae, et habent affinitatem ad species saporum, sub eorum similitudine a nobis cognoscuntur.
          <td>First, then, he remarks that the sense of smell in man seems to have some relation and correspondence to taste; and, likewise, the varieties of flavour (i.e. savour) to those of odour. Now things hidden become known through what is more evident. Since, then, the varieties of flavour are clearly evident to us, those of smell, which are not so, but which have a certain affinity to those of flavour, are brought home to us through this resemblance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Species autem saporum sunt nobis manifestae, quia sensum gustus habet homo certiorem quam alia animalia, quia gustus est tactus quidam: tactum autem habet certissimum aliis animalibus, licet in aliis sensibus deficiat a quibusdam animalibus. Sunt enim quaedam animalia, quae melius vident, audiunt et olfaciunt, quam homo; sed homo secundum tactum, multum differt in certitudine cognitionis ab aliis animalibus.
          <td>482. Now the varieties of flavour are especially evident to us because man has a more acute sense of taste than other animals, taste being a modality of touch and touch being possessed by man at a far higher degree of precision than by any other animal; although in respect of the other senses man falls short of some animals. For certain animals see and hear and smell better than man: but the touch of man is far superior to that of other animals in exactitude of apprehension.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde, quia homo habet optimum tactum, sequitur quod sit prudentissimum omnium aliorum animalium. Et in genere hominum ex sensu tactus accipimus, quod aliqui ingeniosi sunt, vel non ingeniosi: et non secundum aliquem alium sensum. Qui enim habent duram carnem, et per consequens habent malum tactum, sunt inepti secundum mentem: qui vero sunt molles carne, et per consequens boni tactus, sunt bene apti mente. Unde etiam alia animalia habent duriores carnes quam homo.
          <td>483. This pre-emminence of touch in man is the reason why man is the wisest of animals; moreover, among men it is in virtue of fineness of touch, and not of any other sense, that we discriminate the mentally gifted from the rest. Those whose bodily constitution is tough, and whose sense of touch is therefore poor, are slow of intellect; whilst those of a delicately balanced constitution with, in consequence, a fine sense of touch are mentally acute. This too is why the other animals have flesh of a coarser texture than man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed videtur, quod aptitudo mentis magis respondeat bonitati visus, quam bonitati tactus: quia visus est spiritualior sensus, et plures differentias rerum demonstrat. Sed dicendum est, quod duplici ex causa, bonitas mentis respondet bonitati tactus. Prima ratio est, quod tactus est fundamentum omnium aliorum sensuum: manifestum est enim, quod organum tactus diffunditur per totum corpus, et quodlibet instrumentum cuiuscumque sensus est etiam instrumentum tactus; et illud, ex quo aliquid dicitur esse sensitivum, est sensus tactus. Unde ex hoc quod aliquis habet meliorem tactum, sequitur quod simpliciter habet meliorem sensitivam naturam, et per consequens, quod sit melioris intellectus. Nam bonitas sensus est dispositio ad bonitatem intellectus. Ex hoc autem, quod aliquis habet meliorem auditum vel meliorem visum, non sequitur quod sit melius sensitivus, vel melioris sensitivae simpliciter, sed solum secundum quid.
          <td>484. Yet it might seem that mental capacity corresponded rather to excellence of sight than of touch, for sight is the more spiritual sense, and reveals better the differences between things. Still, there are two reasons for maintaining that excellence of mind is proportionate to fineness of touch. In the first place touch is the basis of sensitivity as a whole; for obviously the organ of touch pervades the whole body, so that the organ of each of the other senses is also an organ of touch, and the sense of touch by itself constitutes a being as sensitive. Therefore the finer one’s sense of touch, the better, strictly speaking, is one’s sensitive nature as a whole, and consequently the higher one’s intellectual capacity. For a fine sensitivity is a disposition to a fine intelligence. But an exceptionally good hearing or sight does not imply that the sensitivity as a whole is finer, but only that it is so in one respect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alia ratio est, quia bonitas tactus consequitur bonitatem complexionis sive temperantiae. Cum enim instrumentum tactus non possit esse denudatum a genere tangibilium qualitatum, eo quod est ex elementis compositum, oportet quod sit in potentia ad extrema saltem per hoc, quod est medium inter ea. Ad bonam autem complexionem corporis sequitur nobilitas animae: quia omnis forma est proportionata suae materiae. Unde sequitur, quod qui sunt boni tactus, sunt nobilioris animae, et perspicacioris mentis.
          <td>485. The other reason is that a fine touch is an effect of a good bodily constitution or temperament. For as the organ of touch is itself necessarily endowed with tangible qualities (being composed of the elements) it needs to be in a condition of potency to extremes of the tangible at least by itself constituting a mean between them. Now nobility of soul follows upon a well-balanced physical constitution; because forms are proportionate to their matter. It follows that those whose touch is delicate are so much the nobler in nature and the more intelligent.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quaeritur autem iterum, cum tactus sit certissimus sensuum, quare species odorum denominantur magis a speciebus saporum, quam a qualitatibus tangibilibus. Et dicendum, quod odor et sapor causantur ex determinata commixtione qualitatum elementarium; et ideo species odoris magis correspondent speciebus saporis, quam simplicibus qualitatibus tangibilibus.
          <td>486. Another question that arises is why the differentiations of odour are named after those of taste, if it is touch that is the most exact of the senses. I answer that both the odorous and the tasty are caused to be so by some special combination of elemental qualities; consequently the former corresponds to the latter more than to the simple qualities which are the object of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem ostendit quomodo species odoris correspondent speciebus saporis: et dicit, quod sicut humor, idest sapor, quidam est dulcis, et quidam amarus, sic etiam et odores distinguuntur. Sed sciendum est, quod quaedam habent proportionalem odorem et saporem, scilicet dulcem odorem et dulcem saporem; quaedam vero per contrarium, scilicet suavem saporem, et non suavem odorem, vel e converso.
          <td>487. Next, when he says ‘As some flavours are sweet etc.’, I he explains how the kinds of odour correspond to the kinds of flavour or taste, observing that as we distinguish these as sweet or bitter, so do we also with odours. But notice that, while some things reveal a harmony of flavour and odour, that is to say, they are sweet in both, others on the contrary have an agreeable flavour but a disagreeable smell, or the converse.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius ratio est, quia sapor consistit in humido aqueo aliqualiter digesto; odor autem consistit in sicco aereo, aliqualiter contemperato. Contingit autem quandoque utramque substantiam, scilicet subtilem aeream, et aqueam grossiorem, secundum debitam proportionem commistam esse, et sic est suavitas saporis et odoris. Si vero sit debita proportio in uno et non in altero, erit in uno suavitas, et in alio non.
          <td>488. The reason for this is that flavour pertains to an aqueous liquid partially digested; and odour to a dry gaseous matter partially modified by the surrounding atmosphere. Now it sometimes happens that both substances, the subtle gas and the grosser liquid, are each combined in a nice proportion; and then both odour and flavour are pleasing. But if in one this balance is found, and not in the other, then the one will be pleasing but the other not so.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sicut dictum est de dulci et amaro, quae sunt extrema in saporibus, quae transferuntur ad odores, ita etiam et acetosum et austerum, idest stipticum, aut Ponticum, et acutum, et pingue, odoribus attribuuntur.
          <td>And what has been said of sweet and bitter, the extremities in flavour, can be applied also to the sour, the pungent, i.e. astringent or harsh, the acid and the oily: these flavour-qualities can be transferred to the odorous.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed licet non semper in omnibus correspondeant odores saporibus, tamen, sicut dixi, propter hoc quod odores non sunt multum manifesti, sicut sapores, acceperunt nomina odores a saporibus, secundum similitudinem rerum; quia ut in pluribus, odores respondent saporibus. Dulcis enim odor et sapor causatur a croco et melle. Acer autem a thymo et a similibus. Et similiter de aliis odoribus et saporibus.
          <td>489. And although odours and flavours do not always and in all respects correspond, nevertheless because odours are, as I have said, only imperfectly distinct and evident, they are named after their resemblance to flavours; for on the whole there is a correspondence. Thus saffron and honey have both a sweet taste and a sweet smell, and thyme and suchlike have a pungent taste and smell; and so with other flavours and odours.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit adhuc autem ostendit etiam quomodo non odorabilia odoratu percipiuntur; et dicit quod sicut auditus est audibilis et non audibilis, et visus est visibilis et non visibilis, cum sit eadem potentia cognoscitiva oppositorum, et privatio non cognoscatur nisi per habitum, similiter olfactus est odorabilis et non odorabilis. Sed non odorabile dicitur dupliciter. Aut quod omnino non potest habere odorem, sicut corpora simplicia. Aut quod habet parum de odore, aut malum odorem. Et similiter intelligendum est de gustabili et non gustabili.
          <td>490. Then, at ‘Furthermore, as hearing’ he shows how odourless things are perceptible to smell. As hearing, he says, is of the audible and inaudible, and sight of the visible and invisible (because opposites are known by one and the same faculty, and a lack only by means of what is lacking), so smell is of the odorous and the odourless. There are two senses of the term odourless: it can mean what has no smell at all, such as all simple (i.e. uncompounded) bodies, or what has a little or a faint smell. And the same is true of the tasty and the tasteless.

            <td>Smelling also takes place through a medium, which is either air or water. For aquatic animals seem also to perceive odours, both those with blood and those without, like animals that live in the air; for some of them traverse long distances for their food, being drawn to it by smell. §§ 491-5
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>6. διὸ καὶ ἄπορον φαίνεται εἰ πάντα μὲν ὁμοίως ὀσμᾶται, ὁ δ' ἄνθρωπος ἀναπνέων μέν, μὴ ἀναπνέων δὲ ἀλλ' ἐκπνέων ἢ κατέχων τὸ πνεῦμα οὐκ ὀσμᾶται, οὔτε πόρρωθεν οὔτ' ἐγγύθεν, οὐδ' ἂν ἐπὶ τοῦ μυκτῆρος ἐντὸς τεθῇ· καὶ τὸ μὲν ἐπ' αὐτῷ τιθέμενον τῷ αἰσθητηρίῳ ἀναίσθητον εἶναι κοινὸν πάντων, ἀλλὰ τὸ ἄνευ τοῦ ἀναπνεῖν μὴ αἰσθάνεσθαι ἴδιον ἐπὶ τῶν ἀνθρώπων· δῆλον δὲ πειρωμένοις· ὥστε τὰ ἄναιμα, ἐπειδὴ οὐκ ἀναπνέουσιν, ἑτέραν ἄν τιν' αἴσθησιν ἔχοι παρὰ τὰς λεγομένας.
            <td>So there seems to be a difficulty. If operations of smell are of the same type, yet man smells by inhaling: when exhaling or holding his breath he smells nothing, neither from a distance, nor close at hand, not even if the object is placed inside the nose. (That a thing should be imperceptible when placed on the very organ of sensation, is indeed common to all, but to be unable to perceive without breathing is peculiar to man. This is evident to those who. make the experiment). Since then, bloodless animals do not breathe, they would seem to have some other sense besides those which have been spoken of. § 496
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>ἀλλ' ἀδύνατον, εἴπερ τῆς ὀσμῆς αἰσθάνεται· ἡ γὰρ τοῦ ὀσφραντοῦ αἴσθησις καὶ δυσώδους καὶ εὐώδους ὄσφρησίς ἐστιν. ἔτι δὲ καὶ φθειρόμενα φαίνεται ὑπὸ τῶν ἰσχυρῶν ὀσμῶν ὑφ' ὧνπερ ἄνθρωπος, οἷον ἀσφάλτου καὶ θείου καὶ τῶν τοιούτων. ὀσφραίνεσθαι μὲν οὖν ἀναγκαῖον, ἀλλ' οὐκ ἀναπνέοντα.
            <td>But this is impossible, if it is odour they perceive. For the sense for odours, good odours or bad, is smell. Furthermore, they seem to be overcome by the same strong odours as man, such as asphalt; brimstone and the like. Therefore, even if they do not breathe, they must smell. §§ 497-8
          <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
            <td>7. ἔοικε δὲ τοῖς ἀνθρώποις διαφέρειν τὸ αἰσθητήριον τοῦτο πρὸς τὸ τῶν ἄλλων ζῴων, ὥσπερ τὰ ὄμματα πρὸς τὰ τῶν σκληροφθάλμων-τὰ μὲν γὰρ ἔχει φράγμα καὶ ὥσπερ ἔλυτρον τὰ βλέφαρα, ἃ μὴ κινήσας μηδ' ἀνασπάσας οὐχ ὁρᾷ· τὰ δὲ σκληρόφθαλμα οὐδὲν ἔχει τοιοῦτον, ἀλλ' εὐθέως ὁρᾷ τὰ γινόμενα ἐν τῷ διαφανεῖ-οὕτως οὖν καὶ τὸ ὀσφραντικὸν αἰσθητήριον τοῖς μὲν 422a ἀκαλυφὲς εἶναι, ὥσπερ τὸ ὄμμα, τοῖς δὲ τὸν ἀέρα δεχομένοις ἔχειν ἐπικάλυμμα, ὃ ἀναπνεόντων ἀποκαλύπτεται, διευρυνομένων τῶν φλεβίων καὶ τῶν πόρων. 8. καὶ διὰ τοῦτο τὰ ἀναπνέοντα οὐκ ὀσμᾶται ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ· ἀναγκαῖον γὰρ ὀσφρανθῆναι ἀναπνεύσαντα, τοῦτο δὲ ποιεῖν ἐν τῷ ὑγρῷ ἀδύνατον.
            <td>Now this sense seems to differ as between man and other animals, as human eyes differ from the hard eyes of some animals. The former have a covering or protection, the eye-lids, and unless these are moved or withdrawn, one does not see. Hard-eyed animals have nothing like, this; they see at once whatever happens to be present in the transparent medium. In the same way, then, the organ of smell is in some animals like an eye with no covering; in others, which inhale air, it has a covering that is withdrawn when they respire and so distend the veins and pores. And for this reason animals that breathe do not smell in water. For they must respire if they are to be affected by odour, and they cannot do this in a liquid. § 499

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de odorabili, hic determinat de immutatione odoratus ab ipso. Et primo quantum ad medium. Secundo quantum ad organum sensus, ibi, est autem odor sicci. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit quid sit medium instrumenti odoratus. Secundo movet quamdam quaestionem circa determinata, ibi, unde dubium.
          <td>491. After concluding about the odorous as such, the Philosopher now deals with its impact on the sense; and first, as to the medium; secondly, at ‘Odour is of dry things’, as to the organ of the sense of smell. As to the former point he does two things. First, he indicates the medium of the organ of smell; next, at ‘So there seems to be a difficulty’ he raises a question about the conclusion reached.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod sensus olfactus immutatur ab odorabili per medium, scilicet aerem, aut aquam. Et quod aer sit medium in olfactu, manifeste apparet, quia nos per aerem odoramus; unde oportuit manifestare aquam esse medium in olfactu. Quod quidem ostendit per hoc, quod animalia aquatica odorem sentiunt, non solum illa quae habent sanguinem, sed etiam illa quae sanguine carent, sicut et animalia quae vivunt in aere. Quod apparet ex hoc, quod quaedam eorum de longinquo veniunt ad alimentum; quod non posset esse nisi inquantum provocantur ab odore; sicut patet de vulturibus, qui ex multis diebus dicuntur ad cadavera convenire. Quomodo autem odor ad tam remota spatia diffundatur, dubitatio est.
          <td>First then he observes that the organ of smell is affected by the odorous through a medium, i.e. air or water. That air is a medium of smell is obvious, for we smell through the air. So we need only prove that water is such a medium. This he shows by the fact that aquatic animals, and not only the sanguineous but the non-sanguineous also, perceive odours, like animals that live in the air. A sign of this is that some of them travel a long distance for their food, which could not happen unless they were attracted by smell—like vultures which are said to come long journeys to carrion: But just how smell is diffused to such a distance in space is not certain.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum itaque est quosdam posuisse omnes sensus quodam perfici tactu. Dicebant enim oportere, quod sensus sensibile contingat ad hoc quod sentiatur. Aliter tamen aestimabant hoc accidere in visu, et in aliis sensibus. Dicebant enim, quod ex visu egrediebantur lineae visuales progredientes usque ad rem visam, et ex earum contactu visibile videbatur. In aliis autem sensibus dicebant, quod e converso sensibile perveniebat ad sensum. Et quod in tactu et gustu hoc manifeste videtur accidere. Nam tangibile et gustabile quodam contactu sentiuntur; in auditu etiam idem videtur esse. Nam aer motus usque ad auditum pertingit. Circa olfactum etiam idem esse dicebant. Ponebant enim quod a corpore odorabili resolvatur quaedam fumalis evaporatio, quae est subiectum odoris, et perveniebat usque ad sensum olfactus.
          <td>492. An opinion which some have maintained should be noted here, that all sensation is consummated in a kind of touch: a contact, they said, must occur of sense and sense-object; but not in the same way in sight as in the other senses. For they said that from sight to the object seen certain ‘visual lines’ proceed; and that when these touch the object it is seen; whereas in the case of the other senses a reverse process takes place, and the sense-object comes to the faculty. This (they said) is particularly obvious in tasting and touching, which perceive by a sort of contact; and would seem to occur also in hearing, which implies a movement of air to the ear; and also in smelling;—for they maintained that odours are conveyed to the sense of smell by a kind of fume that bodies give off by evaporation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Causa enim huius diversitatis haec esse videtur, quia antiqui non ponebant nec percipiebant aliquid de immutatione spirituali medii, sed solum de immutatione naturali. In aliis autem sensibus apparet quaedam immutatio naturalis in medio, sed non in visu. Manifestum est enim, quod soni et odores deferuntur per ventos vel impediuntur, colores autem nullo modo. Manifestum est etiam, quod contrariorum colorum species per eamdem partem aeris deferuntur ad visum, sicut cum unus videt album, alius nigrum, simul existens in eodem aere, et eodem aere utentes pro medio. Quod quidem in olfactu non accidit. Nam contrarii odores etiam in medio se impedire inveniuntur. Et ideo non percipientes immutationem, qua medium immutatur a visibili, posuerunt quod visus defertur usque ad rem visam. Sed quia percipiebant immutationem qua medium immutatur ab aliis sensibus credebant, quod alia sensibilia deferrentur ad sensum.
          <td>493. The cause of their drawing this distinction between two modes of sensation seems to have been that these early thinkers had no theory or perception of a spiritual modification of a medium, but only of a material one. Now a material modification of the medium is evident in all mediated sensations other than sight: for, obviously, odours and sounds are carried or impeded by the wind; which is certainly not the case with colour. Also, in one and the same section of air contrary colours can appear, as when one man sees white and another black at the same time and through the medium of the same air; which is not the case with odour, for contrary odours impede one another, even in the medium. Therefore, knowing nothing about the way the visible object affects the medium, these philosophers maintained that sight was conveyed to the thing seen; whereas, observing in other sensations the changes that took place in the medium, they believed that in these cases the sense-objects came to the sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed manifestum est, quod hoc in olfactu non potest accidere. Cum enim odor cadaveris usque ad quingenta milliaria, vel amplius, a vulturibus sentiatur, impossibile esset, quod aliqua corporalis evaporatio cadaveris usque ad tantum spatium diffunderetur, praecipue cum sensibile immutet medium undique secundum eamdem distantiam, nisi impediatur. Non autem sufficeret ad occupandum tantum spatium, etiam si totum cadaver resolveretur in fumalem evaporationem, cum sit certus terminus rarefactionis ad quem corpus naturale pervenire potest, qui est raritas ignis; et praecipue cum per huiusmodi odorem cadaver non appareat sensibiliter immutatum.
          <td>494. But it is clear that this cannot occur in smelling. When vultures smell carrion at a distance of fifty miles or more, this cannot be due to any bodily evaporation from the carrion being diffused over so great a space. This is the more evident if we consider that a sense-object affects its medium for the same distance in all directions, if not impeded. There would not be enough of the object to occupy so much space, even if the whole corpse were to evaporate; for there is a fixed limit of rarification for all natural bodies,—the rarity of fire; and in any case, and especially, the corpse can smell and be smelt in this way without being sensibly altered.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo dicendum est, quod ab odorabili resolvi quidem potest fumalis evaporatio, quae tamen non pertingit usque ad terminum ubi odor percipitur, sed immutatur medium spiritualiter, ultra quam dicta evaporatio pertingere possit. Quod autem spiritualis immutatio fit a visibili magis quam ab aliis sensibilibus, ratio est, quia visibiles qualitates insunt corruptibilibus corporibus, secundum quod communicant cum corporibus incorruptibilibus; unde habent esse formalius et nobilius quam reliqua sensibilia, quae sunt propria corruptibilium corporum.
          <td>495. We are therefore compelled to say that whatever gaseous vapour may come from an odorous substance, it does not reach as far as the point where the odour is perceived; but that beyond the point reached by this vapour the substance affects the medium ‘spiritually’. That such ‘spiritual’ modification of the medium is effected by the object of sight more than by that of the other senses is due to the fact that by their visible qualities corruptible bodies participate in the mode of being of incorruptible bodies; hence these qualities exist in a more formal and noble manner than do the other sense-objects which are proper to bodies precisely as corruptible.

          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum etiam aquatica odorent per aquam, dubium videtur, si omnia similiter odorent, quasi habentia eumdem sensum. Et videtur quod non: quia homo odorat dum attrahit aerem respirando; quando autem non respirat attrahendo aerem, sed emittendo ipsum, expirat, aut retinet spiritum, non odorat, neque de longe neque de prope, etiam si poneretur odorabile intus in naso. Sed hoc quod sensibile positum supra sensum non sentiatur, commune est omnibus aliis sensibus, vel animalibus. Sed quod odor non sentiatur sine respiratione, hoc est proprium hominibus. Et hoc manifestum est si quis tentare voluerit. Unde, cum animalia non habentia sanguinem, non respirent, videtur quod habeant alium sensum praeter olfactum et alios sensus, qui dicti sunt in homine.
          <td>First, then, he observes that it is doubtful whether all animals smell in the same way, as having identically the same sense of smell (aquatic animals, for instance, smell through water). It would seem not indeed. Man smells when he breathes in air, but when he is exhaling air or holding his breath he cannot smell at all either at a distance or close to the object, even if the latter is put into his nose. Now, that the object is imperceptible if it is placed right against the sense-organ is of course common to all the senses in all animals; but that odours are imperceptible without respiration is peculiar to man, as experience shows. And as non-sanguineous animals do not breathe, it would seem to follow that they had some sense other than smell and the other senses attributed to man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sed impossibile obiicit in contrarium duabus rationibus. Prima ratio est, quia sensus distinguuntur secundum sensibilia. Unde cum sensus olfactus, sit sensus odorabilis, scilicet boni et mali odoramenti: et hoc communiter sentiatur tam ab homine quam animalibus aliis non respirantibus, sequitur quod idem sensus olfactus sit in homine et in aliis animalibus.
          <td>497. Then, at ‘But this is impossible, if it is odour that they perceive’, he adduces two arguments on the other side. (1) The senses are distinguished according to their objects; and since smell is the sense of odours, whether good or bad, and these are perceived both by the breathing and by the non-breathing animals, it follows that the sense of smell in man and these animals is the same.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alia ratio est, quia eiusdem sensus eadem sunt corruptiva: non enim visus patitur aliquid a sonis, neque auditus a coloribus. Sed sensus animalium non respirantium videntur corrumpi a gravibus odoribus et excellentibus, ex quibus sensus hominis corrumpitur, scilicet ab asphalto, quod est quaedam confectio ex succis herbarum, et a sulphure, et ab huiusmodi: ergo alia habent sensum olfactus, sicut homo, licet non respirent.
          <td>498. (2) The same things are destructive of the same senses: sight does not suffer from sounds nor hearing from colours. But the non-breathing animals seem to suffer in their senses from the same strong and oppressive odours as are grievous to man, e.g. from bitumen (a compound of the juice of herbs), sulphur and the like. Hence other animals, even if they do not breathe, have a sense of smell like man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit videtur autem solvit quaestionem; quia ista diversitas in modo respirandi, non est ex diversitate sensus, sed ex diversa dispositione organi. Organum enim olfactus in homine differt ab organis aliorum animalium, sicut oculi hominum differunt ab oculis duris quorumdam animalium. Oculi enim hominum habent quoddam phragma, idest pannum ad cooperiendum, scilicet palpebras, unde homo non potest videre nisi quodam motu palpebrae retrahantur; quod non accidit in animalibus habentibus duros oculos, sed statim vident ea quorum species fiunt in diaphano. Ita etiam et in animalibus non respirantibus, organum odoratus est sine operculo; sed in animalibus respirantibus habet quoddam cooperculum, quod oportet aperiri, ampliatis poris per respirationem. Et ideo animalia respirantia non odorant in aqua, quia oportet quod patiantur ab odore respirando, quod non potest fieri in aqua.
          <td>499. Next, at ‘Now this sense seems to differ’, he proposes his solution: this diversity in the mode of breathing is due, he says, not to a difference in the senses, but to different constitutions of the organ; the organ of smell in man being different from that it) other animals, as a man’s eyes differ from the hard eyes of certain beasts. The human eye has a protective covering or envelope called the eyelid, which must be withdrawn before a man can see. This is not the case with hard-eyed animals; they see at once whatever appears in the transparent medium. And so it is with non-breathing animals; their olfactory organ is uncovered; whereas that of breathing animals is covered over until the pores are dilated in the act of respiration. The latter therefore cannot smell through water; for they cannot breathe in it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem determinat de instrumento olfactus: et dicit quod odor fundatur in sicco, sicut sapor in humido. Organum autem odoratus oportet esse in potentia ad odorem et ad siccum, sicut organum visus est in potentia ad colores et ad lucem.
          <td>500. Then at ‘Odour is etc.’, he indicates the organ of smell, saying that as the basis of odour is dryness (as that of taste is moisture) the organ of smell must be in potency to odour and dryness (as that of sight is to colours and light).

(‘Invisible’ indeed can mean either what is absolutely such, or [the term may also be used] as in other cases of ‘the impossible’ where [this concept] is applied both to what lacks what it ought to have by nature, and to what has this defectively,—as we say of a footless [animal] that it is motionless.) So, in the same way, taste is of the savourable and the non-savourable, the latter being what has either only a faint savour, or one altogether destructive of the taste. It would seem that the principle of this is the drinkable or the non-drinkable; and taste is of both, but the latter as either a faint taste or one that destroys the sense: whilst the ‘former is according to nature. The drinkable is common to taste and touch. §§ 509-11

          LECTIO 21</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de visibili, et audibili, et olfactibili, hic quarto determinat de gustabili. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima determinat de gustabili in communi. In secunda de speciebus gustabilis, idest saporis, ibi, species autem. Circa primum tria facit. Primo inquirit an gustabile percipiatur per medium. Secundo ostendit quid percipiatur per gustum, quia gustabile et non gustabile, ibi, sic autem. Tertio quale oporteat esse organum sensus gustus, ibi, quoniam autem humidum. Haec enim tria circa alios sensus tractavit, scilicet medium, in quo sentitur: id quod sensu percipitur: et organum sensus: quae in gustu, ut videbitur, oportet esse. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ostendit, quod gustabile non percipitur per medium extraneum. Secundo excludit quamdam obiectionem, ibi, unde etsi in aqua. Tertio ostendit quid requiratur ad hoc, quod gustabile percipiatur, ibi, non autem facit.
          <td>501. Having dealt with the visible, the audible and the odorous, the Philosopher now treats of the tasteable; and this in two parts, first considering the tasteable in general, and then, at ‘The species of savour’, its division into flavours. As to the former point he does three things. First, he asks whether the tasteable is perceived through a medium; then he explains what is perceived by taste, i.e. the tasteable and the non-tasteable, at ‘As sight etc.’; and thirdly, what is the organ of taste, at ‘Since what is tasteable is liquid’. For he has explained these three points with regard to the other senses, namely the medium, the object sensed and the sense organ. As regards the medium, he first shows that the tasteable is not perceived through any extraneous medium; then, at ‘Hence, if we were in water’, he answers an objection; and thirdly, at ‘It causes no sensation’, he shows us the necessary condition of actual tasting.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod gustabile est quoddam tangibile, idest quod tactu discernitur. Et haec est causa, quare non sentitur per medium quod sit corpus extraneum. Et dicitur extraneum, quod non est pars animalis. Sentiuntur enim sensibilia, de quibus prius dictum est, per aerem aut aquam, quae non sunt partes animalis. Sed tactus non sentit suum obiectum per medium extraneum, sed per medium coniunctum. Nam caro est medium in sensu tactus, in infra patebit. Et ideo, cum gustus sit quidam tactus, et gustabile sit quoddam tangibile, non percipietur gustabile per medium extraneum.
          <td>502. First, then, he says that the tasteable is something tangible, i.e. discerned by touch. That is why it is not sensed through a medium extraneous to the body, i.e. which is not part of the living body—differing in this from the sense-objects hitherto treated of, which are perceived through air or water outside the animal’s body. Touch does not perceive through an extraneous medium, but through one that is conjoined with the subject, i.e. through flesh, as we shall see. Therefore, as taste is a kind of touch, the tasteable is not perceived through any extraneous medium.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem gustabile sit quoddam tangibile, ostendit per hoc quod humor, idest sapor, qui est gustabile, radicatur in humido, sicut in materia propria. Humidum autem est quoddam tangibile. Unde manifestum est, quod gustabile est quoddam tangibile.
          <td>503. That the tasteable is a sort of tangible he shows thus: flavour or savour exists in moisture as in the matter proper to it; and moisture is tangible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed si gustus est quidam tactus, videtur quod non debeat distingui contra tactum, cum species non dividatur ex opposito contra genus: et sic sequitur, quod non sunt quinque sensus, sed tantum quatuor. Sed dicitur, quod gustus et tactus possunt considerari dupliciter. Uno modo quantum ad modum sentiendi; et sic gustus est quidam tactus. Nam in tangendo, suum obiectum percipit. Alio modo quantum ad obiectum; et ita oportet dicere, quod sicut se habet obiectum gustus ad obiectum tactus, sic se habet sensus gustus ad sensum tactus. Manifestum est autem, quod sapor, qui est obiectum gustus, non est aliqua qualitas de qualitatibus simplicium corporum, ex quibus animal constituitur, quae sunt propria obiecta sensus tactus; sed causatur ab eis, et fundatur in aliquo eorum, sicut in materia, scilicet in humido. Unde manifestum est, quod gustus non est idem quod sensus tactus, sed quodammodo radicatur in eo. Unde et consuevit de gustu distingui, quod potest accipi gustus prout est discretivus saporum, et potest accipi ut est tactus quidam, prout discernit qualitates tangibiles, scilicet alimenti, cuius sensus est tactus, ut supra dictum est. Unde philosophus dicit in tertio Ethicorum, quod circa delectationes gustus prout accipitur primo modo non est temperantia, sed solum prout accipitur secundo modo.
          <td>504. But if taste is a kind of touch, it would seem that it ought not to be placed in contrast to touch (for no species is opposed to its genus); and if so, then there are not five senses but only four. But, in truth, touch and taste can be considered in two ways: with regard to the mode of perception, and thus taste is a kind of touch, for it apprehends by contact; and with regard to the object, and then we have to maintain that as the object of taste is to the object of touch, so the sense of taste is to the sense of touch. For flavour (the object of taste) is evidently not one of the qualities of those elemental bodies of which the animal is composed, which constitute the specific object of the sense of touch; yet it is caused by them, and exists in one of them as in its matter, i.e. in moisture. Clearly then, taste is not the same as touch, but is somehow founded on touch. So a distinction is commonly drawn between taste, as discriminative of flavours, and taste as a kind of touch discerning certain tangible qualities, namely those of nourishment, of which touch is the sense, as has been pointed out. Hence Aristotle’s remark in the <i>Ethics</i> (Bk. III) that there is no such thing as temperance in the pleasures of taste understood in the former of these senses, but only as understood in the latter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit unde etsi in excludit quamdam obiectionem. Manifestum est enim quod si aliquod corpus saporosum dissolubile per aquam, in aqua ponatur, utpote mel, vel aliquid huiusmodi, et nos essemus in aqua, quamvis distantes ab illo corpore saporoso saporem tamen eius sentiremus in aqua: et sic videtur, quod gustus suscipiat suum obiectum per aquam, quod est medium extraneum.
          <td>505. Next, at ‘Hence, if we were in water’, he answers an objection. For it is obvious that if something tasty and soluble were placed in water (say, honey, or something of that kind) and we were in the water also, we would be aware of the thing’s flavour, even though at a distance from it. Taste, then, apparently perceives its object through an extraneous medium, water.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo ad excludendum hanc obiectionem, concludit ex dictis, quod cum gustabile non percipiatur per medium extraneum, sequitur, quod si essemus in aqua sentiremus utique corpus dulce appositum in aqua, distans a nobis; non tamen esset nobis sensus per medium, sed ex eo, quod sapor ille permiscetur aqueo humido, ut accidit in potu; puta cum permiscetur, aquae, vel vino, mel, vel aliquid huiusmodi: ipsa enim aqua immutatur naturali immutatione a corpore saporoso. Unde gustus non percipit saporem corporis distantis; ut est talis corporis sapor, nisi secundum quod aqua est immutata tali corpore.
          <td>506. To dispose, then, of this objection, Aristotle, arguing from the principle already stated, that taste does not use an extraneous medium, says that if we were in the water in the way described we should certainly perceive the sweet. thing in the water at a distance from us, but that the sensation would not in fact reach us through a medium; for the flavour would be mixed with the liquid as in a drink (as when honey or the like is mixed with water or wine) and the water itself would be affected by the sweet object. Taste then would not perceive the thing’s flavour at a distance except in so far as the water was affected by the thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius signum est, quod gustus non immutatur ab aqua sic intense, sicut natus est immutari a sapore corporis distantis, eo quod sapor ille debilitatur per admixtionem aquae. Sed color non sic videtur per medium, quod scilicet corpus coloratum admisceatur medio, aut aliquid eius defluat ad visum, ut Democritus ponebat; sed per spiritualem immutationem medii. Unde visus non percipit colorem ut aeris, vel ut aquae, sed ut corporis colorati distantis, et secundum eamdem mensuram. Si ergo velimus comparare gustum ad visum, nihil est quod sit medium in gustu, sicut illud quod est medium in visu. Sed sicut color est visibile, idest obiectum visus, sic humor, idest sapor, est gustabile, id est obiectum gustus.
          <td>507. A sign of which is that the taste is not so strongly affected by such water as it naturally would be by the flavour of the thing that is at a distance, because the flavour is weakened by mixing with water. Colour, on the other hand, is not seen through its medium in such a way that the coloured body is mixed with the medium, or that anything from it flows to the eye, as Democritus supposed; it is seen rather through a spiritual modification of the medium. Hence, sight does not perceive colour as colour of the air or of water, but as colour of a distant coloured body, and to the same degree of intensity. Comparing, then, taste with sight, we cannot say that the medium of taste is like that of sight, but we can say that just as colour is the visible, i.e. the object of vision, so flavour is the tasteable, i.e. the object of taste.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non autem ostendit quid requiratur ad gustum, ex quo medium non requiritur: et dicit, quod nullum saporosum facit sensum sui humoris, idest saporis, sine humiditate. Nam sicut color fit actu visibilis per lumen, ita sapor fit actu gustabilis per humidum. Et propter hoc oportet, quod gustabile, vel actu habeat humiditatem aqueam, sicut vinum vel aliquod huiusmodi, aut sit potentia humectabile, sicut quod sumitur per modum cibi. Et ideo oportet, ut sit saliva in ore, quae est bene liquida, et liquefactiva linguae, per quam ea quae sumuntur, humectantur, ut eorum sapor percipi possit.
          <td>508. Then at ‘It causes no sensation of taste’, he shows what is required for taste in the place of a medium, observing that nothing tasty is tasted without moisture. As colour becomes actually visible in light, so flavour becomes actually tasteable in moisture; for which reason all that is tasteable is either actually liquid already, like wine, or is potentially liquid, like things taken as food. Hence the necessity of saliva in the mouth; being very liquid it moistens the palate, so that what is eaten may be liquefied and its savour perceived.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sicut autem ostendit quid percipiatur per gustum; et dicit quod sicut est de visu et auditu, sic est de gustu. Visus enim cognoscit visibile et invisibile, ut supra dictum est. Invisibile enim est tenebra, de qua visus iudicat. Et similiter illud quod est valde splendidum, ut sol, dicitur invisibile, sed alio modo quam tenebra. Nam tenebra dicitur invisibile, propter defectum luminis; splendidum autem propter abundantiam corrumpentis sensum. Et similiter auditus est audibilis, scilicet soni, et non audibilis, ut silentii, quod est privatio soni, et etiam non audibilis, idest soni male audibilis, qui vel propter sui excellentiam corrumpit sensum, vel propter sui parvitatem, non sufficienter sensum immutat. Sic etiam est in omnibus quae secundum potentiam et impotentiam dicuntur.
          <td>509. Next, at ‘As sight is of the visible’, he treats of the object perceived by taste, comparing taste with sight and hearing. For sight perceives both the visible and the invisible, as has been said; the invisible being darkness, which is apprehended by sight. Also what is extremely bright, like the sun, is described as invisible, though in quite another way. For darkness is called invisible because of a lack of light, but brilliant objects on account of an excess of light which overcomes the sense. Similarly hearing is of the audible, i.e. sound, and of the inaudible, i.e. silence (the privation of sound) and also of the inaudible in the sense of what is heard with difficulty, either because of its excessive loudness or because it is too faint to affect the hearing sufficiently. And so it is with all things involving capacity and incapacity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nam impossibile dicitur in omnibus, aut quod non habet quod natum est habere, aut quod prave habet. Sicut non gressibile dicitur animal, et quod penitus caret pedibus, et quod est claudum, aut debile pedibus. Similiter autem et gustus, et gustabilis, et non gustabilis. Non gustabile autem dicitur dupliciter: quod aut parum habet de sapore, aut malum saporem, aut nimis violentum ad corrumpendum sensum.
          <td>510. For one can say of a thing that it is incapable, meaning either that it has not what it ought to have by nature, or that it has it only defectively, Thus an animal is described as unable to walk either because it lacks legs or because it is weak on its legs. And so it is with taste and the tasteable and non-tasteable. The latter means either what has little or poor flavour, or what is so violently flavoured as to overcome the sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia gustabile est humidum aqueum, quod est potabile, et hoc est principium saporis, scilicet humidum aqueum, videtur quod potabile et non potabile, sit principium eorum quae gustu percipiuntur. Gustus enim percipit ambo; sed unum ut pravum et corruptivum sensus, scilicet non potabile; aliud autem ut conveniens secundum naturam, scilicet potabile. Sicut autem gustabile percipitur gustu, prout gustus est quidam sensus discretus a tactu, ita potabile et non potabile, percipitur a gustu prout gustus est quidam tactus. Nam potabile est commune et tactus et gustus. Tactus quidem, inquantum est humidum; gustus autem, inquantum est humidum saporabile.
          <td>As the tasteable pertains to moisture, i.e. the drinkable, and moisture is the basis of savour, it would appear that the drinkable and the non-drinkable are fundamental in the process of tasting. For taste perceives both, the one, i.e. the non-drinkable, as bad and destructive of taste, but the other, i.e. the drinkable, as appropriate and congenial to taste. Yet while the tasteable is perceived by taste, precisely as a sense distinct from touch, the drinkable and non-drinkable are perceived by it inasmuch as it is a species of touch. For the drinkable is common to touch and taste, to touch in so far as it is liquid, to taste so far as it has savour.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est ergo, quod delectationes quae sunt in cibis et potibus inquantum sunt sensibilia et potabilia, pertinent ad gustum, inquantum est tactus quidam, ut dicitur in tertio Ethicorum.
          <td>511. Obviously then, the pleasures afforded by food and drink, in so far as these are things perceptible and drinkable, accompany taste inasmuch as it is a kind of touch (see Book III of the <i>Ethics</i> ).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem ostendit quale debeat esse instrumentum gustus. Et primo ponit veritatem. Secundo manifestat eam per signum, ibi, signum autem.
          <td>512. Then at ‘Since what is tasteable is liquid’ he examines the organ of taste, first stating the fact and then, at ‘There is a sign of this’, pointing out a sign of its truth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod quia illud quod est gustabile, oportet esse humidum et saporosum, necesse est organum gustus, neque esse humidum actu, neque saporosum secundum seipsum; neque esse tale, quod non possit fieri humidum: sicut instrumentum visus est, quod non habet colorem, sed est susceptivum coloris. Et hoc ideo est, quia gustus patitur aliquid a gustabili, secundum quod est gustabile, sicut quilibet sensus a sensibili. Unde, cum gustabile inquantum gustabile sit humidum, necesse est, quod organum gustus, inquantum est iam passum, sit humectatum; et tamen salvatur in sua natura, ut sit gustativum, idest potens gustare, cum possibile est humectari, non tamen est humidum actu.
          <td>First, then, he says that because the tasteable is liquid and has savour, the organ of taste must itself be neither actually moist nor actually flavoured. Yet it must be able to become moist—like the organ of sight, which must be colourless, but able to receive colour. This is because the taste is affected by the tasteable precisely as such, as any other sense by its proper object. Since then the tasteable as such is liquid, the organ of taste, in the act of receiving the savour, must become moist; and yet preserve its quality of being able to taste, when it is not actually, but only potentially, moist.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit signum autem ostendit quod dixerat, per signum; dicens, quod signum praedictorum est quod neque lingua existens sicca potest sentire, neque existens multum humida: quia cum existit valde humida a praecedente dominante humiditate, sic enim fit in ea tactus et sensus praecedentis humidi, et non supervenientis; sicut cum aliquis ante gustaverit aliquem fortem saporem, postea si gustet alterum, non percipiet ipsum, quia adhuc manet sensus primi humoris in lingua. Et similiter laborantibus, idest febricitantibus, omnia videntur esse amara, propter hoc quod sentiunt per linguam plenam humiditate huiusmodi, scilicet cholera, quae est amara.
          <td>513. Next, at ‘There is a sign’, he observes that an indication of the truth of the foregoing is that the tongue is able to taste nothing when it is either quite dry, or extremely liquid; for when it is excessively liquid through the presence and predominance of some liquid already tasted, then for the time being no new moisture can be tasted; as when after tasting a strong flavour one can taste nothing else, because the sensation of the former flavour remains on the tongue. Similarly to the ‘burdened’ or sick, all things taste bitter because their tongues are covered with a feverish or bitter moisture.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit species autem determinat de speciebus saporum: et dicit quod sicut in coloribus simplices colores sunt contrarii, ut album nigro, sic in saporibus simplices sunt contrarii, ut dulce et amarum. Species autem saporum habitae, idest immediate consequentes simplices species, sunt pingue, quod sequitur dulce, et salsum, quod sequitur amarum. Media autem horum sunt acetosum et austerum et Ponticum, et acutum quae duo in idem reducuntur. Ad has autem septem species saporum fere videntur reduci omnes aliae.
          <td>54. Then at ‘The species of savour’ he concludes about the species of taste, observing that, as in the case of colour simple colours are contrary, such as white and black, so in flavours the simple are contrary, as the sweet and the bitter. Those ‘adjoining’, that is, those immediately following upon the simple species, are the succulent following on the sweet, and the salty following on the bitter. Intermediary are the sour, the pungent, the astringent and the acid, which two last are reducible to the same. To these seven species of flavour most of the others seem to be reducible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est autem circa has species, quod quamvis sapores causentur a calido et frigido, et humido et sicco, et contraria sunt quae maxime distant, non tamen secundum maximam distantiam calidi et frigidi, et humidi et sicci attenditur contrarietas in speciebus saporum; sed secundum ordinem ad gustum, prout natus est immutari a sapore, vel cum horrore, vel cum suavitate. Unde non est necessarium, quod dulce vel amarum sit maxime vel calidum vel frigidum, vel humidum vel siccum; sed maxime se habeat in tali dispositione, per quam comparatur ad sensum gustus. De generatione autem saporum in libro de sensu et sensato determinatur.
          <td>515. Note, with regard to these species, that whilst flavours are caused by the hot and the cold, the moist and the dry, and although contraries connote terms furthest apart, yet the contraries in the species of flavour do not follow the maximum differences of hot and cold or of moist and dry, but are related precisely to the natural capacity of the sense of taste to be affected by savour either to disgust or to delight. There is no need then for the sweet or the bitter to be particularly hot or cold or moist or dry, but much that it be in a state that corresponds somehow to the sense of taste. As for the origin of flavours, that is explained in the <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo autem concludit, quod gustativum, idest sensus gustus, vel organum eius, est in potentia ad saporem et species eius; gustabile autem est, quod potest reducere ipsum de potentia in actum.
          <td>50. He concludes, finally, that taste, i.e. the sense of taste, or its organ, is in potency to savour and the species of savour; and that the tasteable is what can bring it into act.

            <td>Therefore it appears that the relation of this part of the body [to the whole] is comparable to that which air would have if it formed a natural covering that grew all round our bodies. For then it would appear that we perceived sound and odour and colour through some one common medium, and even that there were but one sense for hearing, seeing and smelling. Since in fact, however, there exists something definite through which the motions [of these senses] are produced, it is evident that each of these senses is diverse. But in the case of touch, this is still far from clear. It is impossible that an animated body be constituted from air or water, for it must be solid. It can, then, only be a mixture from earth and the other elements, as flesh (or its counterpart) requires. Wherefore it is necessary that the medium of touch be a body conjoined [to the organism] through which its sensations, which are several, may come about. §§ 527-8

          LECTIO 22</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam determinavit philosophus de sensibilibus secundum alios sensus, hic determinat ultimo de sensibili secundum tactum: quia tactus inter alios sensus videtur esse minus spiritualis, licet sit omnium aliorum sensuum fundamentum. Dividitur autem haec pars in duas partes. In prima determinat quasdam dubitationes circa sensum tactus. In secunda ostendit veritatem circa hunc sensum, ibi, omnino autem videtur. Circa primum duo facit. Primo movet quaestiones. Secundo determinat eas, ibi, omnis etenim sensus.
          <td>517. Having considered the objects of the other senses, the Philosopher finally treats of the object of touch, examining this ,sense last of all because it appears to be the least spiritual of the senses, though it is the foundation of all the others. This section divides into two parts: first he settles certain questions about touch; after which he states the truth about it, at ‘It would seem then in general’. The first part again divides into, first a statement, and, secondly, a solution, at ‘For every sense’, of the problems in question.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod quantum ad ea de quibus inquirendum est, eadem ratio est, sive loquamur de tangibili, sive de tactu. Quod enim dicitur de uno, oportet dici de altero: quia si tactus non est unus sensus, sed plures, necesse est quod tangibilia non sint unum genus sensibilium, sed plura. Ideo autem hoc dicit, quia intentio sua est primo determinare de sensibilibus, postmodum determinabit de sensu. Quia vero in his quae circa tangibile et tactum dicenda sunt, circa sensum tactus quaestiones movebit propter hoc quod commodius possunt pertractari quaestiones istae circa tactum, quam si moveantur circa tangibile, idcirco hanc excusationem praemittit, ostendens, quod non refert utrum de tactu, vel tangibili loquamur.
          <td>He observes then, first, that in the matters to be examined, the same reasoning holds whether we treat of the tangible or of touch. What is said of one holds good of the other; and if touch is not one sense but several, then the tangible must be, not one kind of sense-object, but several. This he says because, while his intention in general is to define the sense-object first, and after that the sense itself, in the case of touch he is going first to enquire into the sense; and this because the questions he wants to answer are more conveniently dealt with in this way than by treating first of the tangible object. So he prefaces his remarks with a kind of explanation, asserting that it does not matter whether we speak of the tangible or of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Movet ergo duas quaestiones circa tactum et tangibile. Quarum prima talis est. Utrum sint plures sensus tactus, an unus tantum. Secunda dubitatio est quid est sensitivum, idest organum sentiendi in tactu: utrum scilicet caro sit organum sensus tactus in animalibus habentibus carnem, quae sunt animalia habentia sanguinem, et in aliis quae carent sanguine aliquid proportionabiliter respondens carni. Aut non est ita, sed caro quidem et illud quod proportionabiliter ei respondet, est medium in sensu tactus, sed primum organum sensus tactus est aliquid intrinsecum circa cor, ut dicitur in libro de sensu et sensato.
          <td>518. Of the two questions about touch and the tangible, the first is whether there are several senses of touch or only one; and the second is, what is the place or organ of feeling in touch? i.e. whether flesh is the touch-organ in animals that have flesh (which are those that have blood), and, in those that lack blood, something analogous to flesh; or, on the contrary, is flesh, or what corresponds to flesh, merely the medium of the sense of touch, while its primary organ is something internal, close to the heart? The second opinion is the one maintained in the <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit omnis etenim determinat praemissas dubitationes. Et primo primam. Secundo secundam, ibi, utrum autem. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ostendit, quod non est unus sensus tactus, sed plures. Secundo solvit positam rationem, ibi, habet autem solutionem. Tertio improbat solutionem, ibi, sed quod sit. Ratio autem, quam primo ponit, talis est. Omnis enim unus sensus videtur esse unius contrarietatis, sicut visus albi et nigri, auditus gravis et acuti, gustus amari et dulcis. Sed in tangibili, quod est obiectum tactus, sunt multae contrarietates; scilicet calidum et frigidum, humidum et siccum, durum et molle, et quaedam alia huiusmodi, et grave et leve, et acutum et hebes, et similia: ergo tactus non est unus sensus, sed plures.
          <td>519. Next, at ‘For every sense seems’, he begins to answer these questions. With regard to the first he does three things: (a) he gives an argument for the view that there are several senses of touch; (b) he presents a solution of the problem at ‘Here is a partial solution’; and (c) he criticises this solution at ‘But it is not’. The preliminary argument runs as follows: each single sense appears to bear upon a single pair of contraries, as sight upon white and black, hearing upon high and low, taste upon sweet and bitter; but included in the object of touch are several such pairs, hot and cold, moist and dry, hard and soft, and others of the same kind, besides heavy and light, sharp and blunt and so on. Therefore touch is not one sense, but several.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit habet autem ponit quamdam apparentem solutionem ad praedictam dubitationem: et dicit, quod aliquis potest habere solutionem ad praedictam dubitationem per hoc, quod in aliis sensibus videntur esse plures contrarietates, sicut in auditu. Nam circa vocem audibilem non solum potest attendi contrarietas acuti et gravis, sed etiam magnitudo et parvitas vocis, et lenitas et asperitas eius, et aliqua alia similia. Et similiter circa colorem possunt inveniri aliquae aliae differentiae praeter contrarietatem albi et nigri; sicut quod aliquis color est intensus, et alius remissus; aliquis pulcher, et aliquis turpis: et tamen per hoc non tollitur, quin auditus sit unus sensus, et similiter visus. Unde multiplex contrarietas tangibilium non videtur impedire, quominus tactus sit unus sensus.
          <td>520. Then, at ‘Here is etc.’, he gives what might seem to be a solution, saying that one might answer that even in the other senses there appear to be several contrarieties; e.g. in hearing; for in the voice one can observe not only the contrariety of high and low, but that also of loud and soft, rough and smooth, and the like. Similarly colour presents various differences besides the contrariety of black and white, as that one colour is intense, another dull, one beautiful, another ugly. Yet these facts do not mean that either vision or hearing is not a single sense; nor then need the tangible’s many contrarieties imply that touch is not a single sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sed quod excludit positam solutionem: et dicit quod omnium contrarietatum, quae sunt circa audibilia, est unum subiectum, scilicet sonus, et similiter color circa visibilia. Sed non potest inveniri aliquid unum, quod sit commune subiectum omnium contrarietatum quae sunt circa tangibilia: et propter hoc non videtur esse unum genus tangibilium, unde neque unus sensus tactus.
          <td>521. Then, at ‘But it is not clear’, he sets aside this solution, saying that all the contraries found in the audible have but one subject, sound; and so too with colour in the visible. But no common subject can be found of all the contraries connected with touch; hence there does not seem to be one genus of tangible, and one sense of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad evidentiam autem eorum quae hic dicuntur, considerare oportet, quod distinctio potentiarum et obiectorum proportionabilis est. Unde, cum unus sensus sit una potentia, oportet quod et sensibile correspondens sit unum genus. Ostensum est autem in decimo metaphysicae, quod in uno genere est una prima contrarietas. Unde oportet, quod circa obiectum unius sensus, attendatur tantum una prima contrarietas. Et ideo hic dicit philosophus, quod unus sensus est unius contrarietatis.
          <td>522. To understand this passage we must consider that there is a proportion involved in the distinction between potencies and objects: if a single sense is a single potency, the corresponding object must be a single genus. Now it is shown in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Book X, that each genus includes one primary contrariety. Hence there must be one primary contrariety in the object of any one sense; and that is why the Philosopher says here that one sense is of one contrariety.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Possunt tamen in uno genere esse plures contrarietates post primam, vel per modum subdivisionis, sicut in genere corporum prima contrarietas est animati et inanimati. Et quia animatum corpus dividitur per sensibile et insensibile, et ulterius sensibile per rationale et irrationale, multiplicantur contrarietates in genere corporis. Vel sunt plures contrarietates unius generis per accidens; sicut in genere corporis est contrarietas albi et nigri, et secundum omnia, quae corpori accidere possunt. Et per hunc modum intelligendum est, quod circa sonum et vocem, praeter primam contrarietatem gravis et acuti, quae est per se, sunt aliae contrarietates quasi per accidens.
          <td>523. However, it is possible for one genus to include several contrarieties beside the primary one, and this either by a process of subdivision—as in the genus body, the first contrariety is between animate and inanimate; and since animate bodies are divided into the sensitive and insensitive, and the sensitive yet again into rational and irrational, contrarieties multiply in the genus body;—or incidentally, as, to take the genus body again, we find the contrariety of white and black, not to mention all the other corporeal accidental qualities. It is thus therefore that we must understand, as regards sound and voice, that, besides the primary contrariety of high and low, which is essential, there are other accidental contrarieties.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In genere autem tangibilium sunt plures primae contrarietates per se, quae tamen omnes quodammodo reducuntur ad unum subiectum, et quodammodo non: potest enim uno modo accipi subiectum contrarietatis ipsum genus, quod comparatur ad differentias contrarias, sicut potentia ad actum. Alio modo potest accipi subiectum contrarietatum substantia quae est subiectum generis, cuius sunt contrarietates: sicut si dicamus, quod corpus coloratum est subiectum albi et nigri. Si igitur loquamur de subiecto quod est genus; manifestum est, quod non est idem subiectum omnium qualitatum tangibilium. Si autem loquamur de subiecto quae est substantia, unum subiectum est omnium eorum, scilicet corpus, pertinens ad consistentiam animalis. Unde infra dicit philosophus, quod tangibiles qualitates sunt corporis secundum quod est corpus, quibus scilicet elementa corporis distinguuntur abinvicem. Horum enim est sensus tactus discretivus, quae ad consistentiam corporis animalis pertinent. Unde formaliter loquendo, et secundum rationem, sensus tactus non est unus sensus, sed plures; subiecto autem est unus.
          <td>524. Now in the genus of tangible things, there are several essential primary contrarieties, which can all in one way be reduced to a single subject, but in another way not; for in one way the subject of the contrariety can be found in the genus, which is related to the various contrary differences as potency to act. In another way the subject of the contraries can be found in the substance, which is itself the subject of the genus in which the contraries are included,—as when we call coloured body the subject of black or white. Speaking then of the subject which is the genus, it is plain that there is no one same subject of all tangible qualities. But speaking of the subject which is substance there is one subject of all these, i.e. the body that pertains to the substance of a given animal. And therefore Aristotle will say that tangible qualities belong to body precisely as body, i.e. they are the qualities by which the elements of body are distinguished from one another. For the sense of touch discriminates among the factors that combine to constitute the animal body. Hence, formally speaking and in the abstract, the sense of touch is not one sense, but several; but it is one substantially.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit utrum autem pertractat secundam quaestionem. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo docet veritatem. Secundo concludit quoddam quod pertinet ad manifestationem primae quaestionis, ibi, propter quod talis pars. Circa primum sciendum est, quod posset alicui videri, quod caro esset organum sentiendi secundum tactum hac ratione, quia statim ad tactum carnis sentimus tangibilia.
          <td>525. Next, at ‘It is not evidence’, he deals with the second question; and this in two stages. First, he states the true answer; secondly, he comes to a conclusion that throws some light on the former question, at ‘Therefore it appears’. Note then, in the first place, that it might appear that flesh was the organ of sensation in touch, because we feel tangible things on the instant of contact.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo, ad excludendum hanc rationem, quod ad iudicandum utrum organum tactus sit intus, vel non, sed statim caro sit organum tactus, non videtur esse sufficiens signum hoc, quod simul cum caro tangitur fit sensus tangibilis, idest sentitur; quia et nunc si aliquis supra carnem extenderet aliquam pelliculam aut telam subtilem, statim ad tactum ipsius quod super extenderetur carni, sentiretur tangibile. Sed tamen constat, quod organum sensus tactus non esset in illa pelle super extensa. Et iterum manifestum est, quod si illa pellis superextensa fieret connaturalis homini, citius per eam sentiretur. Unde, licet ad tactum carnis, quae est homini connaturalis, statim tangibile sentiatur, non tamen sequitur quod caro sit organum tactus, sed est quoddam medium connaturale.
          <td>526. But, setting this argument aside, he remarks that to decide whether the organ of touch be interior or not (in the latter case the flesh would be the immediate organ of touch) it does not seem sufficient proof that, as soon as the flesh is touched, there occurs a tactual sensation, i.e. one feels; because if one were to extend a skin or tenuous web over the flesh the tangible would be felt immediately on contact with it; yet obviously the organ of touch would not be in the covering membrane. And again, if this web could become a part of one’s nature, one would feel all the sooner through it. Hence though at the touch of natural flesh the tangible is felt at once, still it does not follow that the flesh is the organ of touch, but only that it is a natural medium for it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit propter quod concludit quoddam, quod valet ad manifestationem primae quaestionis: et dicit quod quia caro est sicut medium connaturale in sensu tactus, videtur quod haec pars corporis sic se habeat ad sensum tactus, sicut si aer, qui est circa nos, esset connaturalis nobis. Videretur enim tunc quod aer ille esset organum in visu, auditu et olfactu, quamvis sit medium; et ita videremur uno organo sentire sonum et odorem et colorem, et per consequens videretur esse unus sensus auditus, visus et olfactus. Sed nunc quia medium, per quod fiunt motus dictorum sensibilium, est determinatum, idest distinctum a nobis: manifestum est, quod non est organum. Et item manifestum est, quod diversa sunt organa trium sensuum dictorum, et per consequens, quod sunt diversi sensus. Sed in tactu hoc non est manifestum, quia medium est connaturale nobis.
          <td>527. Next, at ‘Therefore, it appears’ he comes to a conclusion that throws light on the first question, saying that, flesh being a medium adapted to the sense of touch, it would seem that this part of the body has the same sort of relation to sensation as the air around us would have if it were a natural part of us. For though this air is but the medium of sight, smell and hearing, it would appear in that case to be the organ of these senses; and thus it would seem to us that we saw and smelled and heard by a single organ and with a single sense. But in fact just because, as a medium for such sensations, it is ‘definite’. i.e. distinct from ourselves, we see clearly that it is not an organ. Moreover there are obviously diverse organs for the three senses aforesaid, and therefore a clear distinction of three senses. But it is not so clear in the case of touch; for here the medium is a natural part of us.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et huius diversitatis rationem assignat. Aer enim et aqua, quae sunt media aliorum sensuum, non possunt esse connaturalia nobis, quia impossibile est, quod ex aere puro et ex aqua pura consistat animatum corpus. Cum enim sint corpora humida et fluxibilia, non sunt firma neque bene terminabilia in seipsis, sed solum termino alieno. Corpus autem animatum oportet esse firmum et in se terminatum: unde oportet quod sit mixtum ex terra et aere et aqua, sicut vult se habere, idest sicut exigit caro in animalibus habentibus carnem, et illud quod proportionale est, in animalibus non habentibus carnem. Et sic illud corpus, quod est medium in tactu, scilicet caro, potest esse adnatum, id est naturaliter unitum tactui, ita quod per ipsum sicut per medium connaturale, fiant plures sensus tactus.
          <td>528. And he gives a reason for this difference. Air and water, the media of the other senses, could not be a natural part of us, for a living body cannot be constituted of pure air or pure water. These substances, being watery and fluid, are not solid or definite by themselves; they need to be terminated by other things, whereas a living body must be solid and self-contained. Hence the latter needs to be composed of earth and air and water, as required, i.e. as flesh requires in animals that have flesh, and correspondingly for those that have it not. So the body which serves as the medium in touch, i.e. flesh, is able to be naturally conjoined or united with touch in such a way as to transmit the manifold sensations of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit demonstrat autem ponit quoddam aliud ad idem manifestandum: et dicit, quod hoc idem demonstratur per hoc, quod in lingua fiunt plures tactus. Sentimus enim per linguam omnia tangibilia, qua sentimus per alias partes corporis, et ulterius per ipsam sentimus humorem idest saporem, quem non sentimus per aliquam aliam partem corporis. Si autem alia caro sentiret saporem, non discerneremus inter gustum et tactum; sicut nunc non discernimus inter tactum qui est discretivus calidi et frigidi, et tactum qui est discretivus humidi et sicci. Sed nunc apparet, quod gustus et tactus sunt duo sensus, quia non convertuntur adinvicem; non enim per quamcumque partem fit sensus tactus, fit et gustus. Ratio autem quare non per quamcumque partem fit gustus, per eam fit tactus, est quia sapores non sunt qualitates elementorum, ex quibus corpus animalis constat: unde nec pertinent ad consistentiam animalis, sicut qualitates tangibiles.
          <td>529. Then at ‘That they are several’, he states another fact in support of this. By the tongue also, he says, we obtain several tactile sensations; for by it we feel all the objects of touch that are felt in other parts of the body, and we feel, besides, the flavour or savour that is not perceived in other parts of the body. If the other parts of flesh perceived savours, we should not discriminate between taste and touch, just as we do not in fact discriminate between the touch that discerns hot and cold and that which discerns wet and dry. But it is quite clear that touch and taste are two senses, because they are not mutually transferable: taste does not occur in every part where touch can occur. And the reason why taste is not to be found wherever there is touch is that savours are not qualities of those elements which constitute the bodies of animals; hence they are not, like tangible qualities, of the very substance of an animal.

            <td>A Problem arises, on the assumption that every body has depth, that is, the third dimension. Bodies having [between them] a medium which is a body cannot touch one another. Now every liquid involves body, and so does everything moistened; it must either be water or contain water. But things in contact with one another in water must necessarily have water as a medium covering their extremities, unless these last be dry. If this is true, it is impossible for one body to touch another in water. The same holds good of air (for air is to the things that are in it as water to things in water) although this fact is less evident to us, just as animals that live in water are unaware that bodies that touch in water are all wet. §§ 530-40

            <td>The question then is, whether there is one way of sensing for all objects of sense, or different ways for diverse objects. The latter at first sight seems to be the case,—taste and touch being effected by contact, the others from a distance. But this is not so: we perceive the hard and the soft through something intervening, just as we do the audible and the visible and the odorous. But of these objects, some operate at a distance, others close at hand. That is why the fact escapes us: we do perceive everything through a medium, but the fact is not evident in the latter cases. Indeed, as we said before, if we were to perceive all tangible objects through a membrane, not knowing what was interpolated, we should think we touched the objects themselves, as we now do in air and water: for in these cases we think we touch the objects and that there is no medium. §§ 541-2

Hence the organ of the tangible is internal; for the same thing happens in this sense as in the others; what is placed on the organ they do not perceive. What, however, is placed on the flesh they do perceive; flesh, then, is the medium of touch. § 545

            <td>Tangible objects vary therefore with differences, of body as is such—I mean the differences by which the elements are distinguished, as hot and cold, wet and dry, as is stated in our work on the elements. The sense organ for these, the tactile, in which the sense called touch is principally lodged, is the part in potency to these qualities. For to perceive is to receive an impression. Hence whatever makes the organ to be such as itself is actually, does so, the organ being in potency thereto. Hence we do not perceive what has heat, or cold or hardness or softness to an exact similitude of our own heat, and so forth, but rather the extremes of these: the sense being, as it were, in a mean state between the contrary extremes in the objects perceived; which is how it discriminates between them. For a mean is discriminative; in the presence of either extreme it becomes the contrary one. Hence, as whatever is to perceive black or white must have neither of these in itself actually, but both potentially (and so with the other sense-objects), so touch must be actually neither hot nor cold. §§ 546-8

          <td>Ostenso quod in sensu tactus requiritur medium connaturale, hic inquirit philosophus utrum requiratur in eo medium extraneum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quod tactus non fit sine medio extraneo. Secundo ostendit in quo differant tactus et gustus ab aliis sensibus, qui per medium extraneum sentiunt, ibi, utrum igitur.
          <td>530. Having shown how the sense of touch requires a medium that is of the nature of the one who touches, the Philosopher goes on to ask whether it needs an extraneous medium. And his answer contains two points: first, he shows that touch does not occur without an, extraneous medium; next, at ‘The question, then, is whether’, he shows how touch and taste differ from other senses which perceive through an extraneous medium.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod circa tactum potest aliquis dubitare, utrum scilicet habeat medium extraneum, cum ostensum sit quod habeat medium connaturale. Et ista dubitatio procedit si omne corpus habet profundum, quod est tertia dimensio. Manifestum est enim omne corpus tres dimensiones habere, scilicet longitudinem, latitudinem et profunditatem. Ex quo sequitur, quod inter quaecumque corpora est aliquod corpus medium, ipsa non tangunt seinvicem immediate. Distant enim abinvicem, ex quo aliqua dimensio est inter ea.
          <td>First, then, he remarks that in the case of touch one might doubt whether it has an extraneous medium, since we have seen that the medium of touch is a natural part of us. The doubt assumes that every body has depth, i.e. a third dimension. And indeed it is clear that every body has three dimensions, length, breadth and depth; whence it follows that whenever two bodies have another between them, the former bodies are not in direct contact; they must be divided by a dimension.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est etiam quod ubicumque est medium humidum vel humectatum, oportet esse aliquod corpus. Humiditas enim cum sit qualitas quaedam, non est nisi in subiecto corpore. Aut igitur inest alteri corpori secundum seipsum, et tunc est humidum sicut aqua; aut habet humiditatem secundum aliquod corpus sibi adveniens, et sic dicitur humectatum, ex hoc quod habet aquam in superficie tantum, vel in superficie et profundo. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod necesse est omne corpus humidum vel humectatum, esse aquam, aut habere aquam. Manifestum est autem, quod corpora, quae tanguntur in aqua adinvicem, necesse est, quod habeant inter se aquam medium, qua repleta sunt ultima eorum; nisi forte dicatur, quod sint sicca in aqua existentia, quod est impossibile. Necesse est enim, quod ea quae in aqua sunt, sint humectata, ita quod habeant aquam in superficie; et sic relinquitur, quod inter duo tangentia se in aqua, sit aqua medium. Et si hoc verum est, sequitur, quod impossibile sit, quod aliquod corpus tangat aliud in aqua immediate. Et similiter eodem modo se habet de aere, qui est humidus naturaliter, sicut et aqua.
          <td>531. It is also evident that wherever there is a liquid or wet medium, there must be a body of some sort. For wetness is a quality and must exist in a body as its subject. Either then it resides in a body essentially, and then there is a liquid., e.g. water; or it exists in virtue of some adventitious body, in which case there is something that is wet, i.e. having water either on its surface only, or on its surface and throughout as well; so he says that every humid or wet body must either be liquid or ‘contain’ liquid. Now it is clear that bodies which touch in water have water as a medium between them covering their outer surfaces—otherwise they would be dry in water, which is impossible; for whatever things are in water must be wet, in the sense that water covers their surfaces. Water, then, is the medium between two things touching in water; whence it follows that it is impossible that one body should touch another in water immediately. And the same holds good for air, which is a fluid like water.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Similiter enim se habet aer ad humectanda ea quae sunt in aere, sicut habet aqua ad humectanda ea quae sunt in aqua. Sed magis latet nos de aere, quod sit medium, quam de aqua, propter hoc, quod continue sumus in aere, et sic imperceptibiliter inhaeret nobis. Et similiter animalia, quae sunt in aqua, latet, si duo corpora humectata per aquam, tangant; quia enim continue sunt in aqua, non percipiunt aquam, quae est inter ipsa, et corpora tangentia. Est autem et alia ratio, quare magis latet nos de aere, quam de aqua, quia aer est subtilior, et minus sensu perceptibilis. Relinquitur ergo, quod semper quando tangimus aliquid, est medium inter nos et res contactas, aer vel aqua.
          <td>532. For the air flows round the things that are in the air as water around things which are in water; but it is much less noticeable to us that air is a medium of this kind than that water is, on account of our being continually in the air so that it envelops us imperceptibly. In the same way, animals that live in water are not aware that when two bodies touch one another their surfaces are wet; for, being habitually in water, they do not notice the water between them and the bodies they are touching. There is also this other reason why the fact is less evident to us in the case of air than water: that air is more subtle and less perceptible to sense. Whenever, then, we touch anything there is always a medium between ourselves and the thing touched, whether air or water.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dubitatio hic accidit. Oportet enim illud quod est medium in aliquo sensu, esse denudatum a qualitatibus sensibilibus secundum illum sensum; sicut diaphanum nullum habet colorem. Manifestum est autem quod aer et aqua habent tangibiles qualitates; non igitur mediantibus eis potest fieri sensus tactus.
          <td>533. But a question suggests itself. The medium for any sense should be lacking in the sensible qualities perceived by it,—like the colourless diaphanum. But obviously air and water have tangible qualities; so it seems they cannot be the medium for touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Respondet autem ad hoc Averrois, quod nos non patimur a puro aere vel aqua. Nihil enim patitur nisi a suo contrario secundum principium passionis. Aer autem et aqua non contrariantur nobis, sed sunt nobis similia: comparantur enim ad nos, sicut locus ad locatum: unde tactus noster non patitur a qualitatibus aeris vel aquae, sed ab extraneis qualitatibus. Quod enim sentitur de qualitatibus tangibilibus in aere et in aqua, est de admixtione extraneorum corporum, ut ipse dicit: quia sicut ignis numquam amittit calorem suum, ita nec aqua amittit suam qualitatem. Sed quod aliquando sentimus calidum, hoc est ex permixtione extranei.
          <td>534. Averroes answers that we are not affected by pure air or pure water. Nothing is passively affected, he says, save by its opposite, in accordance with the principle of passivity; but air and water are not contrary to us, they are indeed akin to us, in the same way as place to what is located in it. Hence our touch is not affected by air and water, but by qualities extraneous to them. What tangible qualities are perceived in air and water are due to their combination with extraneous bodies. As fire never loses its heat, so water never loses the quality proper to water; and if we ever perceive heat, this is due to the admixture of some extraneous body.

Elementa autem in suis extremitatibus se alterant, ut patet per philosophum in primo Meteororum: corpus ergo nostrum ab elementis natum est alterari.
          <td>535. Now this reply contains several errors. First, it is false to assert that air and water do not affect our bodies, as being akin to these in the manner of a locality to what is placed in it. For, clearly, our bodies get their place in nature, as also their natural movement, from the element that predominates in them; and, consequently, are related to locality and material environment as elements located to elements locating. But contiguous elements mutually affect one another at the points of contact, as is shown in the <i>Meteorologica</i> , Book I. Our bodies therefore are naturally subject to the influence of the elements.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item omne quod est in potentia, natum est pati ab eo quod est in actu. Corpora autem nostra, cum sint in quadam medietate constituta inter extremitates tangibilium qualitatum, quae sunt in elementis, habent se ad qualitates elementares ut potentia ad actum. Medium enim est in potentia ad extrema, ut infra dicetur. Manifestum est igitur, quod corpora nostra nata sunt immutari a qualitatibus elementorum, et sentire eas.
          <td>536. Again, everything in potency is, as such, disposed to receive the influence of what is in act; and our bodies, being in a mean state between the extremes of the tangible qualities in the elements, are related to these qualities as potency to act. For, as we shall see, a mean is in potency to extremes. It is evident, then, that our bodies are disposed to be influenced by the elemental qualities, and to perceive them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Provenit ergo hic error ex eo, quod nescivit distinguere inter elementa secundum quod sunt sibi invicem contraria, et secundum quod sunt se continentia et sibi similia ut locus locato.
          <td>537. This error of Averroes comes from his failing to distinguish between the elements as contrary to, and as akin to and containing (as the locality contains the located), one another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum est igitur, quod elementa possunt dupliciter considerari. Uno modo secundum qualitates activas et passivas: et sic contrariantur adinvicem, et se invicem immutant in suis extremis. Alio modo secundum formas substantiales, quas consequuntur ex impressione corporis caelestis. Unde, quanto corpus elementale est propinquius corpori caelesti, tanto plus habet de forma. Et quia ad formam pertinet continere, et quod se habeat in ratione totius; inde est quod corpus superius continet inferius, et comparatur ad ipsum sicut totum ad partem divisam, quae est comparatio loci ad locatum. Unde et vis locantis et continentis derivatur ad elementa ex primo continenti, scilicet corpore caelesti. Et propter hoc, locus et motus localis non attribuuntur elementis secundum qualitates activas et passivas, sed consequuntur formas substantiales elementorum.
          <td>538. Note then that the elements can be considered in two ways: in one way, in terms of active and passive qualities, and in this sense they are contrary to one another and act upon one another at their points of contact; but in another way, in terms of their substantial forms derived from the influence of the heavenly bodies. Now the elements are formal in the degree that they are akin to the heavenly bodies; and since it is of the essence of form to have the character of an inclusive whole, it follows that a superior body as such contains its inferior, and stands to the latter as a whole to a part which, though a part, is yet a distinct being; which is precisely the relation of locality to the located. And therefore the function of locating and containing is derived to the elements from the primary locating principle, the heavenly body. Whence it follows too that locality and local motion pertain to the elements in virtue of their substantial forms, not of their active and passive qualities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alius est error in hoc quod dicit, quod aqua et aer non alterantur nisi per admixtionem extranei. Manifestum est enim quod aer et aqua secundum partem sunt corruptibilia. Corruptio autem et generatio in elementis potest fieri sine mixtione, et sequitur alterationem, ut patet in libro de generatione. Unde manifestum est, quod adhuc durante specie aquae, potest immutari aqua a sua naturali qualitate, absque admixtione extranei. Ignis autem, cum sit formalior, est magis activus inter elementa, quae omnia comparantur ad ipsum sicut materialia, ut dicitur quarto Meteororum. Unde non est simile de ipso et de aliis.
          <td>539. Another error is this, that he says that air and water undergo no changes save by mixing with something extraneous. For it is evident that air and water are in some degree destructible; but destruction and, generation can take place in the elements without any mixing and yet involve change, as is proved in the <i>De Generatione</i> . Therefore, so long as water remains water, its natural quality can be changed without the admixture of anything extraneous. The case of fire is quite different; being the most formal and active of the elements, the rest are material in relation to it, as Aristotle says in Book IV of the <i>Meteorologica</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum est igitur, quod quia aer et aqua sunt facile mutabilia ab extraneis qualitatibus, et praecipue quando sunt modicae quantitatis, sicut accidit in aqua vel aere, quae sunt inter alia duo corpora se tangentia; propter hoc non impeditur sensus tactus, quin per medium aerem et aquam fieri possit. Et minus etiam impedit aer quam aqua; quia aer habet qualitates tangibiles parum sensibiles. Unde, si intendantur qualitates tangibiles aeris vel aquae, magis impeditur tactus, utpote cum aer vel aqua intensam frigiditatem vel caliditatem habuerint.
          <td>540. It may be said, then, that air and water are easily changeable by extraneous qualities, especially in small quantities such as the amount of air and water between two bodies that touch one another. This is why the sense of touch is not impeded by the medium of water or air. And, of the two, air is less an impediment than water, for its tangible qualities are scarcely perceptible at all. But an intensification of the tangible qualities of air or water, as when they become extremely hot or cold, does of course impede the sense of touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit utrum igitur ostendit differentiam inter tactum et gustum et alios sensus. Et primo excludit quamdam differentiam aestimatam. Secundo ponit differentiam veram, ibi, sed differt. Dicit ergo primo, quod ex quo tactus habet medium extraneum, considerandum est, utrum omnium sensibilium fiat similiter sensus, aut diversorum diversimode: sicut in promptu videtur haec esse differentia, quod gustus et tactus sentiant ex eo quod immediate tangant, alii autem sensus sentiant a longe sua sensibilia non tangendo ipsa.
          <td>541. Then, when he says ‘The question, etc.’, he shows the difference between touch and taste on the one hand, and the rest of the senses on the other: first rejecting a supposed ground of differentiation; secondly, stating the true difference, at ‘But the tangible differs.’ In the first place, then, he says that this question of the extraneous medium of touch leads one to ask whether the sensation of all sense objects occurs in the same way, or diversely for diverse objects—as, at first sight, it does seem that touch and taste perceive by immediate contact, whilst the other senses apprehend their objects at a distance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc verum non est, quod sic differant; sed durum et molle et alias qualitates tangibiles sentimus per altera, idest per media extranea, sicut et obiecta aliorum sensuum, sicut sonabile, visibile et odorabile. Sed ista sensibilia sunt a longe quandoque a sensu, gustabilia autem et tangibilia sunt de prope, intantum quod medium est quasi imperceptibile propter parvitatem, et ideo medium latet. Omnia enim sensibilia sentimus per medium extraneum: sed in gustabilibus et tangibilibus latet: quia sicut prius diximus, si per aliquam pellem nobis circumpositam, omnia tangibilia sentiremus, ignorato, quod aliquid esset prohibens, similiter nos haberemus ad sentiendum per medium, sicut et nunc nos habemus sentientes in aqua et aere. Putamus enim nunc quod tangamus sensibilia ipsa, et nihil sit medium.
          <td>542. But this difference is illusory; we do in fact perceive the hard and the soft and other tangible qualities , ‘through something intervening’, an extraneous medium, like the objects of other senses, the audible, the visible and the odorous. But whilst the latter objects are sometimes a long way from the sense, the tasteable and tangible are so close that the medium is practically imperceptible and passes unnoticed. We perceive all sense-objects through an extraneous medium, but this is not noticeable in taste and touch; to repeat what we said before, if the medium of touch were a membrane that covered us without our noticing it, we should feel through a medium in a manner similar to the way we do actually feel in air or water. For as it is, we fancy we touch the sense objects themselves, and that there is no medium.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sed differt exclusa falsa differentia ponit veram; et dicit, quod tangibilia differunt a visibilibus et sonativis, ex eo quod illa sensibilia sentimus per hoc quod movent medium, et iterum medium movet nos; sed tangibilia sentimus per medium extraneum, non quasi moti a medio extraneo, sed simul cum medio movemur a sensibili. Sicut patet de eo, qui percutitur per clypeum. Non enim accidit sic, quod clypeus percussus percutiat; sed quia simul accidit utrumque percuti.
          <td>543. Then at ‘But the tangible differs’, having rejected the false difference he states the true one, observing that tangible objects differ from visible and audible in that, whereas we perceive the latter because they set in motion the medium, and the medium in turn moves us, we perceive tangible objects, not because the medium has first moved us, but as being moved simultaneously with the medium, by the sense-object. It is as when a man is struck on his shield; the shield, being struck, does not then strike the man; man and shield are struck simultaneously.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem quod dicitur simul non est intelligendum secundum ordinem temporis tantum; quia etiam in visu simul movetur medium ab obiecto, et sensus a medio; fit enim visio sine successione. Perceptio autem soni et odoris, cum successione aliqua, ut in libro de sensu et sensato dicitur: sed hoc referendum est ad ordinem causae. In aliis enim sensibus, immutatio medii est causa quod immutetur sensus, non autem in tactu. Nam in aliis sensibus medium est ex necessitate, in tactu autem quasi per accidens, inquantum accidit corpora se tangentia esse humectata.
          <td>544. Nor is this simultaneity to be understood in the order of time only; for in sight the medium is affected by the visible and the eye by the medium, and yet sight occurs without succession in time. Smelling and hearing, however, take place with some temporal succession, as it is said in the <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> . The succession is due to the way the cause of the action operates; for whereas in the other senses a change in the medium is itself the cause of the sense being affected, it is not so in touch; for in other sensations the medium is present of necessity, whilst it is only as it were an accidental accompaniment of touch, due to the fact, for example, that the bodies in contact are moist.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit omnino autem determinat de sensu tactus secundum veritatem. Et primo quantum ad medium. Secundo quantum ad qualitatem organi, ibi, tangibiles quidem. Tertio quantum ad obiectum quod percipitur sensu, ibi, amplius autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod ita videtur se habere caro et lingua ad organum sensus tactus, sicut se habent aer et aqua ad organum visus, auditus et olfactus. In nullo enim istorum sensuum potest fieri sensus, si tangatur organum: ut si quis ponat aliquod corpus album in superficie oculi, non videtur. Unde manifestum est, quod organum sensitivum in sensu tactus, sit intus. Sic enim accidit in hoc sensu, sicut et in aliis. Non enim sentiunt animalia sensibilia apposita super organum sensus. Sentiunt autem sensibilia posita super carnem: quare manifestum est, quod caro non est organum sensus, sed medium.
          <td>545. Next, when he says ‘It would seem in general’, he concludes to the truth about the sense of touch: with regard (a) to the medium; (b) to the organ, at ‘Tangible objects vary’, and (c) to the object apprehended by this sense, at ‘Further: as sight etc.’ First, then, he observes that the flesh and the tongue seem to be related to the organ of touch as air and water to the organs of sight, hearing and smell. Now in none of these latter senses can sensation occur if the organ itself is touched; thus a white body placed on the surface of the eye is invisible. Whence it follows that the organ of touch is within; for this sense works in the same way as in others; and if animals can perceive sense-objects placed on their flesh, it is evident that if flesh is not precisely a sense-organ it is certainly a medium of sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit tangibiles quidem ostendit quale sit organum tactus: et dicit, quod tangibiles qualitates sunt differentiae corporis, secundum quod est corpus; idest differentiae, quibus elementa distinguuntur abinvicem, scilicet calidi, frigidi, humidi et sicci, de quibus dictum est in his quae sunt de elementis, idest in libro de generatione et corruptione.
          <td>546. Then, at ‘Tangible objects’, he explains the nature of the organ of touch. Tangible qualities, he says, are the differentiations of body precisely as body, i.e. those differences which diversify the elements, namely dry and wet, hot and cold, of which Aristotle treats in his work on the elements, the <i>De Generatione et Corruptione</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est autem, quod organum tactus, et in quo primo fundatur sensus qui dicitur tactus, est quaedam pars, quae est in potentia ad huiusmodi qualitates. Organum enim sensus patitur a sensibili, quia sentire est pati quoddam: unde sensibile, quod est agens, facit ipsum esse tale in actu, quale est sensibile, cum sit in potentia ad hoc. Et propter hoc, organum tactus, non sentit illam qualitatem secundum quam est in actu. Non enim sentimus id quod est calidum aut frigidum, durum aut molle, secundum illum modum quo haec insunt organo tactus; sed sentimus excellentias tangibilium, quasi organo tactu constituto in aliqua medietate inter contrarias tangibiles qualitates. Et propter hoc organum tactus discernit extrema tangibilium: medium enim est discretivum extremorum: potest enim pati ab utroque extremorum, eo quod dum comparatur ad unum habet in se rationem alterius; sicut tepidum in comparatione ad calidum, est frigidum; in comparatione ad frigidum, est calidum: unde medium patitur ab utroque extremorum, cum sit quodammodo utrique contrarium. Et oportet quod, sicut organum, quod debet sentire album et nigrum, neutrum ipsorum habet actu, sed utrumque in potentia, et eodem modo in aliis sensibus; sic etiam se habeat in sensu tactus; scilicet organum, neque sit calidum, neque frigidum actu, sed potentia utrumque.
          <td>547. For it is clear that the organ of touch, wherein the sense called touch primarily resides, is a part of the body in potency to these differentiations. Every sense-organ is passive to its object, because sensation is a kind of receiving; if the sense-object, which is the agent in the operation, reduces the sense to a condition similar to itself, the sense was previously potentially such. This is why, in the degree that the organ of touch already actually has any quality, it does not perceive this quality. We do not feel a thing as hot or cold, hard or soft, in so far as these qualities are already present in the organ of touch; rather, we perceive such tangible qualities as exceed that mean state between contrasted tangibles in which this sense properly consists. For as a mean is potential to extremes, so the organ of touch can discern the extremes of tangible qualities. It can be affected by either extreme because, as compared with either, it has the nature of the other: e.g. as compared with heat the tepid is cool, but as compared with cold it is warm. Thus the mean is passive to both extremes, being in a way the opposite of each. As the organ that knows white and black has neither of these actually and both of them potentially (and the like is true of the other senses) so also is it, and necessarily, in the sense of touch: its organ is neither hot nor cold, but in potency to both.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aliter tamen accidit hoc circa tactum, et circa alios sensus. Nam in visu organum visus est in potentia ad album et nigrum, denudatum a toto genere albi et nigri: est enim penitus carens colore. Sed organum et medium tactus non potest denudari a toto genere calidi et frigidi, humidi et sicci: componitur enim ex elementis, quorum hae sunt propriae qualitates. Sed sic fit in potentia organum tactus ad sua obiecta, inquantum est medium inter contraria. Medium enim est in potentia ad extrema. Et propter hoc, quanto animal habet complexionem magis reductam ad medium, tanto habet meliorem tactum. Unde homo inter omnia animalia est melioris tactus, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>548. But this occurs in a special way in touch. In sight, for instance, the organ in potency to black and white is quite free from both black and white, for it is quite colourless. But in the case of touch the organ cannot be completely deprived of heat and cold, moisture and dryness, for it is composed of elements having these qualities essentially. Rather, the organ of touch is in potency to its objects as a mean between extremes, potential to either extreme. Whence it follows that the closer an animal’s composition approaches the state of perfect balance, the finer will be its sense of touch; and that is why man, of all animals, has the finest touch, as we have seen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit amplius autem determinat de eo quod percipitur per tactum: et dicit quod sicut est visus quodammodo visibilis et invisibilis, et sicut alii sensus sunt oppositorum ut auditus soni et silentii, sic tactus est tangibilis et intangibilis. Intangibile autem dicitur dupliciter: aut illud, quod habet excellentiam, ita quod corrumpit sensum, sicut ignis: aut illud quod habet parum de qualitate tangibili, sicut aer. Utrumque enim dicitur intangibile, quasi male perceptibile, sensu tactu.
          <td>549. Next, at ‘Further: as sight’, he concludes about the object of touch. As sight, he says, is of the visible and invisible, and the other senses are also of opposites (as hearing of sound and silence), so touch is of both the tangible and the intangible. ‘Intangible’ is said in two ways: either of that which has a tangible quality to an excess which destroys the sense, like fire; or of that which has very slight tangibility, like air. Both are called intangible because both are hard to perceive by touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo autem quasi epilogando concludit, quod figuraliter, idest in quadam summa dictum est de sensibilibus, secundum unumquemque sensum. De eis enim specialiter in libro de sensu et sensato determinatur.
          <td>550. Summing up, he says that he has treated ‘in outline’, that is, in a summary manner, of each of the several senses. For he deals with them more in detail in the <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> .

            <td>It must be taken as a general rule that all sensation is the receiving of forms without matter, as wax receives a seal without the iron or gold of the signet-ring. It receives an imprint of the gold or bronze, but not as gold or bronze. Similarly the sense of any sense-object is acted upon by a thing having colour or flavour or sound; not, however, in respect of what each, is called as a particular thing, but in so far as each has a certain quality and according to its informing principle. §§ 551-4

            <td>It is clear from these facts why the excess of sensible qualities destroys the sense-organs. For if the change is too violent for the sense-organ, the ratio [of the latter] is lost,—which [ratio] is the sense. It is as with tone and harmony when the strings are violently struck. Also it is plain why plants have no sensation, though they have some share in soul, and are affected by tangible objects to become hot or cold. The reason is that they lack a mean or principle of this kind, able to receive the forms of sense-objects; they are acted upon materially. §§ 556-7

          <td>551. Having examined each of the senses separately the Philosopher proceeds now to conclusions about sensitivity in general; and this in three stages: first he explains the nature of sense; then, at ‘It is clear’, he solves certain problems connected with that explanation; and thirdly, at ‘It might be asked’ he raises certain questions touching the way a sense is affected by its object. As regards the first point he explains (a) the nature of sense, and (b) the nature of sense-organs, at ‘The primary sensitive part’.

          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod hoc oportet accipere, universaliter et communiter omni sensui inesse, quod sensus est susceptivus specierum sine materia, sicut cera recipit signum anuli sine ferro et auro. Sed hoc videtur esse commune omni patienti. Omne enim patiens recipit aliquid ab agente secundum quod est agens. Agens autem agit per suam formam, et non per suam materiam: omne igitur patiens recipit formam sine materia. Et hoc etiam ad sensum apparet: non enim aer recipit ab igne agente, materiam eius sed formam: non igitur videtur hoc proprium esse sensus, quod sit receptivus specierum sine materia.
          <td>First, then, he says that it must be maintained in general, as true of all the senses without exception, that the senses receive forms without matter, as wax receives the mark of a rig without the iron or gold. This, however, would seem to be common to all cases of passive reception; every passive thing receives from an agent in so far as the agent is active; and since the agent acts by its form, not its matter, every recipient as such receives form without matter. Which indeed is sensibly apparent; e.g. air does not receive matter from fire acting upon it, but a form. So it would seem not to be peculiar to sensation that it receives form without matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum igitur, quod licet hoc sit omni patienti, quod recipiat formam ab agente, differentia tamen est in modo recipiendi. Nam forma, quae in patiente recipitur ab agente, quandoque quidem habet eumdem modum essendi in patiente, quem habet in agente: et hoc quidem contingit, quando patiens habet eamdem dispositionem ad formam, quam habet agens: quodcumque enim recipitur in altero secundum modum recipientis recipitur. Unde si eodem modo disponatur patiens sicut agens, eodem modo recipitur forma in patiente sicut erat in agente; et tunc non recipitur forma sine materia. Licet enim illa et eadem materia numero quae est agentis, non fiat patientis, fit tamen quodammodo eadem, inquantum similem dispositionem materialem ad formam acquirit ei quae erat in agente. Et hoc modo aer patitur ab igne, et quicquid patitur passione naturali.
          <td>552. I answer that, while it is true that every recipient receives a form from an agent, there are different ways of receiving form. Form received in a patient from an agent sometimes has the same mode of existence in the recipient as in the agent; which occurs when the patient is disposed to the form in the same way as the agent. For whatever is received is received into the being of the recipient; so that, if the recipient is disposed as the agent is, the form comes to be in the recipient in the manner in which it exists in the agent. And in this case the form is not imparted without the matter. For although the numerically one and the same division of matter that is in the agent does not become the recipient’s, the latter becomes, in a way, the same as the material agent, inasmuch as it acquires a material disposition like that which was in the agent. And it is in this way that air receives the influence of fire, and any other passive thing in Nature the action that alters its natural quality.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quandoque vero forma recipitur in patiente secundum alium modum essendi, quam sit in agente; quia dispositio materialis patientis ad recipiendum, non est similis dispositioni materiali, quae est in agente. Et ideo forma recipitur in patiente sine materia, inquantum patiens assimilatur agenti secundum formam, et non secundum materiam. Et per hunc modum, sensus recipit formam sine materia, quia alterius modi esse habet forma in sensu, et in re sensibili. Nam in re sensibili habet esse naturale, in sensu autem habet esse intentionale et spirituale.
          <td>553. Sometimes, however, the recipient receives the form into a mode of existence other than that which the form has in the agent; when, that is, the recipient’s material disposition to receive form does not resemble the material disposition in the agent. In these cases the form is taken into the recipient ‘without matter’, the recipient being assimilated to the agent in respect of form and not in respect of matter. And it is thus that a sense receives form without matter, the form having, in the sense, a different mode of being from that which it has in the object sensed. In the latter it has a material mode of being, but in the sense, a cognitional and spiritual mode.

          <td>Et ponitur conveniens exemplum de sigillo et cera. Non enim eadem dispositio est cerae ad imaginem, quae erat in ferro et auro. Et ideo subiungit, quod cera accipit signum idest imaginem sive figuram auream aut aeneam, sed non inquantum est aurum aut aes. Assimilatur enim cera aureo sigillo quantum ad imaginem, sed non quantum ad dispositionem auri. Et similiter sensus patitur a sensibili habente colorem aut humorem, idest saporem aut sonum, sed non inquantum unumquodque illorum dicitur, idest non patitur a lapide colorato inquantum lapis, neque a melle dulci inquantum mel: quia in sensu non fit similis dispositio ad formam quae est in subiectis illis, sed patitur ab eis inquantum huiusmodi, vel inquantum coloratum, vel saporosum, vel secundum rationem, idest secundum formam. Assimilatur enim sensus sensibili secundum formam, sed non secundum dispositionem materiae.
          <td>554. Aristotle finds an apt example of this in the imprint of a seal on wax. The disposition of the wax to the image is not the same as that of the iron or gold to the image; hence wax, he says, takes a sign, i.e. a shape or image, of what is gold or bronze, but not precisely as gold or bronze. For the wax takes a likeness of the gold seal in respect of the image, but not in respect of the seal’s intrinsic disposition to be a gold seal. Likewise !he sense is affected by the sense-object with a colour or taste or flavour or sound, ‘not in respect of what each is called as a particular thing’, i.e. it is not affected by a coloured stone precisely as stone, or sweet honey precisely as honey, because in the sense there is no such disposition to the form as there is in these substances; but it is affected by them precisely as coloured, or tasty, or as having this or that ‘informing principle’ or form. For the sense is assimilated to the sensible object in point of form, not in point of the disposition of matter.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit sensitivum autem determinat de organis sensus. Quia enim dixerat quod sensus est susceptivus specierum sine materia, quod etiam intellectui convenit, posset aliquis credere, quod sensus non esset potentia in corpore, sicut nec intellectus. Et ideo ad hoc excludendum, assignat ei organum: et dicit quod primum sensitivum, idest primum organum sensus est in quo est potentia huiusmodi, quae scilicet est susceptiva specierum sine materia. Organum enim sensus, cum potentia ipsa, utputa oculus, est idem subiecto, sed esse aliud est, quia ratione differt potentia a corpore. Potentia enim est quasi forma organi, ut supra traditum est. Et ideo subdit quod magnitudo, idest organum corporeum est, quod sensum patitur, idest quod est susceptivum sensus, sicut materia formae. Non tamen est eadem ratio magnitudinis et sensitivi sive sensus, sed sensus est quaedam ratio, idest proportio et forma et potentia illius, scilicet magnitudinis.
          <td>555. Next, at ‘The primary sensitive part’, he concludes about the organ of sense. Since from his teaching that sense receives forms into cognition immaterially, which is true of the intellect also, one might be led to suppose that sense was an incorporeal faculty like the intellect, to preclude this error Aristotle assigns to sense an organ, observing that the ‘primary sensitive part’, i.e. organ of sense, is that in which a power of this sort resides, namely a capacity to receive forms without matter. For a sense organ, e.g. the eye, shares the same being with the faculty or power itself, though it differs in essence or definition, the faculty being as it were the form of the organ, as was said above. So he goes on to say ‘an extended magnitude’, i.e. a bodily organ, is what receives sensation’, i.e. is the subject of the sense-faculty, as matter is subject of form; and yet the magnitude and the sensitivity or sense differ by definition, the sense being a certain ratio, i.e. proportion and form and capacity, of the magnitude.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit manifestum autem ex praemissis concludit solutionem quamdam duorum quae possunt quaeri: et dicit quod manifestum est ex praedictis, propter quid excellentia sensibilium corrumpat organa sensuum. Oportet enim in organis sentiendi, ad hoc quod sentiatur, esse quamdam rationem, idest proportionem, ut dictum est. Si ergo motus sensibilis fuerit fortior quam organum natum sit pati, solvitur proportio, et corrumpitur sensus, qui consistit in quadam proportione organi, ut dictum est. Et est simile, sicut cum aliquis fortiter percutit chordas, solvitur symphonia et tonus instrumenti, qui in quadam proportione consistit.
          <td>556. Then, when he says ‘It is clear etc.’, he infers from these premises a reply to two questions which might arise. What has been said, he observes, explains why an excess in the object destroys the sense-organ; for, if sensation is to take place there must pre-exist in the organ of sense ‘a certain ratio’ or, as we have termed it, proportion. But if the impact of the sense-object is stronger than what the organ is naturally able to bear, the proportion is destroyed and the sense itself, which precisely consists, as has been said, in the formal proportion of the organ, is neutralised. It is just as though one were to twang cords too violently, destroying the tone and harmony of the instrument, which consists in a certain proportion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifesta est etiam ex praedictis ratio alterius quaestionis propter quid scilicet plantae non sentiunt, cum tamen habeant quamdam partem animae, et patiantur a quibusdam sensibilibus, scilicet a tangibilibus. Manifestum est enim quod calescunt et infrigidantur. Causa igitur, quare non sentiunt, est quia non est in eis illa proportio, quae requiritur ad sentiendum. Non enim habent medietatem secundum complexionem inter tangibilia, quae requiritur ad organum tactus, sine quo nullus sensus esse potest: et ideo non habent in se huiusmodi principium, quod potest recipere species sine materia, scilicet sensum. Sed accidit ei pati cum materia, scilicet secundum materialem transmutationem.
          <td>557. His analysis also gives us the answer to another question, namely why plants do not feel, though they have some share in soul and are affected by certain sense-objects, i.e. tangible things, as well as by heat and cold. The reason why they do not feel is that they lack the proportion needed for sensation, in particular that balance between extremes of the tangible qualities which is a prerequisite of the organ of touch, apart from which there can be no sensation. Hence they have no intrinsic principle for receiving forms ‘apart from matter’, that is to say, no sense. They are affected and undergo changes only materially.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit dubitabit autem movet quamdam dubitationem circa passionem a sensibilibus. Quia enim dixerat, quod plantae patiuntur a quibusdam sensibilibus: primo movet dubitationem utrum ab aliis sensibilibus aliquid possit pati, quod non habet sensum: puta ab odore, quod non habet olfactum; a colore, quod non habet visum; a sono, quod non habet auditum.
          <td>558. Next, when he says ‘It might be asked’, he raises a question touching the sense-object’s action on the senses. Having just remarked that plants are affected by certain sense-objects, he raises the question whether a subject can ever be affected by objects other than those of which it possesses the sense; say, by odour if it has no smell, or by colour, if it has no sight, or by sound, if it is without hearing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi si autem inducit duas rationes ad ostendendum, quod non: quarum prima talis est. Quia proprium olfactibilis est facere olfactum: odor autem est olfactibile: ergo, si aliquid facit olfactum, facit per odorem. Vel secundum aliam literam, odor facit olfactum. Propria igitur actio odoris, inquantum odor, est quod facit olfactum, sive olfacere. Ex quo sequitur, quod suscipiens actionem odoris, in quantum odor, habet sensum olfactus: quod ergo non habet sensum olfactus, non potest pati ab odore. Et eadem ratio videtur de aliis, quod non sit quorumcumque, posse pati a sensibilibus, sed solum habentium sensum.
          <td>559. Then, at ‘But if what can be smelt is odour’, he brings two reasons against this suggestion. In the first place, it is proper to what can be smelt to cause smell; but odour is such; therefore if anything causes smell, it causes it by odour (or, according to another reading, odour causes smell). The proper action of odour as such is to cause a smell or occasion a smelling. Whence it follows that whatever receives the activity of odour as such has a sense of smell; and whatever lacks a sense of smell cannot be affected by odour. And the same argument holds of other beings that it is impossible that anything whatever might be affected by sense-objects; this can only happen in things endowed with sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit simul autem et dicit, quod hoc quod prima ratio concludit, manifestum est per experimentum: quia lumen et tenebra, et odor, et sonus, nullum effectum faciunt in corpora sensibilia, nisi forte per accidens, inquantum corpora habentia huiusmodi qualitates, aliquid agunt: sicut aer, qui quando est tonitruum, scindit lignum. Lignum enim patitur non a sono, per se loquendo, sed ab aere moto.
          <td>560. At ‘The same is evident thus’, he states the second reason, as follows. The above argument is confirmed by experience. Light and darkness, smell. and sound, produce no effect on sensible bodies, except incidentally, inasmuch as the bodies with those qualities do something, like the air that cleaves wood when it thunders; for it is not this sound that affects the wood, but the moving air.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi sed tangibilia ostendit aliter esse de qualitatibus tangibilibus: et dicit quod tangibilia et humores, idest sapores, faciunt quemdam effectum in sensibilibus. Sed hoc intelligendum est de saporibus, non inquantum sapores sunt, sed inquantum gustabile est quoddam tangibile, et gustus est quidam tactus. Si enim corpora insensibilia non paterentur a qualitatibus tangibilibus, non esset ponere a quo paterentur et alterarentur corpora inanimata. Nam tangibilia sunt qualitates activae et passivae elementorum, secundum quas accidit universaliter alteratio in corporibus.
          <td>561. Then at ‘But things tangible and savours’ he shows that it is otherwise with tangible qualities; tangible things and ‘savours’, i.e. flavours, do indeed produce, he says, an effect on sensible objects. But this is to be understood of the flavours, not precisely as such, i.e. as tasteable, but just in so far as the tasteable is something tangible, and taste a kind of touch. For if (insensible) bodies were not affected by tangible qualities, there would be no question of inanimate bodies being affected and altered at all, these tangibles being the elemental active and passive qualities in virtue of which all bodily alterations take place.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quarto ibi ergo ne et ostendit etiam quod alia sensibilia agunt in quasdam res inanimatas, licet non in omnes: dicens ergo ne et illa, scilicet sensibilia alia, faciunt aliquem effectum et olfactum, in res inanimatas? Quasi dicat: sic. Sed tamen non omne corpus passivum est ab odore et sono, sicut omne corpus passivum est a calore et frigore; sed ab istis sensibilibus pati possunt sola corpora indeterminata, et quae non manent, ut aer et aqua, quae sunt humida, et non bene determinabilia termino proprio. Et quod aer possit pati ab odore, manifestum est quia aer foetet sicut aliquid patiens ab odore. Alia litera habet feret quia, scilicet mediantibus aliis sensibilibus deferuntur species ad sensum. Ratio autem huius diversitatis est, quia qualitates tangibiles sunt causae aliorum sensibilium, et ideo habent plus de virtute activa, et possunt agere in quaecumque corpora. Sed alia sensibilia, quae habent minus de virtute activa, non possunt agere nisi in corpora valde passibilia. Et similis etiam ratio est de luce corporum caelestium, quae alterant inferiora corpora.
          <td>562. Next, at ‘Therefore, do not also’, he shows that other sense-objects act on inanimate things, though not on all. For in asking: Therefore, do not other sense-objects affect inanimate things as odour does?, he implies that they do. Yet not every body is affected by odour and sound, though all are by heat and cold. By such sense-objects are affected only unstable, impermanent bodies, such as air and water, which, being fluid, are not very self-contained; and that air can be affected by odour is obvious enough when it stinks. Another reading says ‘bears’, meaning that the phenomenon is carried or borne to the sense by sensible objects other than itself. The reason for this difference is that, as tangible qualities are productive of the other sensible qualities, they have more active power than the others, and can operate on bodies in general, whereas the other sense-objects, having less active power, can act only on things that are especially impressionable. The same principle applies to the light of the heavenly bodies, with its effect on terrestrial ones.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quinto ibi quid igitur solvit rationem supra positam; dicens, quod si aliquid patitur ab odore, quod non odorat, quid est odorare, nisi pati aliquid ab odore? Et respondet, quod odorare, est sic aliquid pati ab odore, quod sentiat odorem. Aer autem non sic patitur ut sentiat, quia non habet potentiam sensitivam; sed sic patitur ut sit sensibilis, inquantum scilicet est medium in sensu.
          <td>563. Lastly, at ‘What then is to smell?’, he solves the problem raised by the argument stated above. If a thing, he asks, can be affected by odour and yet not smell it, what is there in smelling odour other than just being affected by it? And he answers that smelling happens when a thing is affected by odour in such a way as to perceive it. But air is not affected in this way, since it has no sensitive potency; it is affected only so as to become a sense-object, inasmuch as it affords a medium for sensation.

But whatever we perceive through a medium and without contact is perceived through intervening simple elements (I mean such as air and water); and [in this case] things are so disposed that if several sense-objects, differing generically from one another, are perceptible through one medium, then, necessarily, what has a sense-organ of this kind can perceive either object—e.g. if the organ is constituted of air, then air is medium for both colour and sound. But if there are several media for the same sense object, as air and water are for colour (both being transparent), what is possessed of either [medium] alone will perceive what comes through either or both. §§ 568-70

            <td>The situation would, in that case, be as when we perceive what is sweet by sight. This happens because we take account of the sensation of both these, so that when they coincide we are aware of it. if it were not so, we should perceive this only incidentally, as when we see the son of Cleon not as the son of Cleon but as something white; with which object there happens to coincide the fact of being the son of Cleon. But we have a general sense for common qualities, And this not merely incidentally. Hence, there is not a proper sense [for them]. [If there were] we should never perceive them except in the way we have said that we see the son of Cleon. The senses perceive incidentally what is proper to one another; [perceiving] not in their specific capacity, but in so far as they form one sense,—as in the perception of bile as both reddish in colour and bitter. It does not pertain to either sense to judge that these are qualities of one thing. Hence arises the mistaken view that, if a thing is reddish, it is bile. §§ 579-81

          <br>
          LECTIO 1</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hic incipit liber tertius apud Graecos. Et satis rationabiliter. Ex hinc enim Aristoteles ad inquirendum de intellectu accedit. Fuerunt enim aliqui, qui posuerunt sensum et intellectum esse idem. Manifestum est autem, quod intellectus non est aliquid de sensibus exterioribus, de quibus iam dictum est, ex eo quod non coarctatur ad unum genus sensibilium cognoscendum: unde restat inquisitio, utrum in parte sensitiva sit aliqua alia potentia cognoscitiva, ut ex hoc possit accipi, utrum intellectus sit aliquo modo sensus.
          <td>564. Here begins Book III in the Greek text; for the good reason, apparently, that it is here that Aristotle begins to examine the intellect. Now there have been philosophers who denied all difference between intellect and senses. But clearly, the intellect cannot be any one of the exterior senses already considered; for its apprehension is not restricted to any one particular class of sense-objects. So the question is whether sensitivity includes any other cognitive faculty such as might lend support to the view that intellect is somehow one of the senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dividitur ergo pars ista in partes tres. In prima inquirit, an sit aliquis alius sensus, praeter quinque sensus exteriores, de quibus iam dictum est. In secunda ostendit, quod intellectus et sensus nullo modo sunt idem, ibi, quoniam autem duabus. In tertia ostenso, quod intellectus non sit sensus, determinat de parte animae intellectiva, ibi, de parte autem animae. Prima dividitur in duas partes. In prima ostendit, quod non est alius sensus proprius praeter quinque iam dictos. In secunda ostendit praeter sensus proprios, esse sensum communem, ibi, quoniam autem sentimus. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod non sit alius sensus, praeter quinque. Secundo ostendit, quare sunt plures, et non unus tantum, ibi, inquirit autem. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod non sit alius sensus praeter quinque, qui sit cognoscitivus sensibilium propriorum. Secundo ostendit, quod non est alius sensus praeter quinque, cuius obiectum sunt sensibilia communia, ibi, at vero neque.
          <td>565. This section divides into three. First, he asks whether there is any other sense besides the five exterior senses. Next, at ‘Now, if the soul is defined’, he proves that the intellect is entirely distinct from the senses. Thirdly, at ‘As to the part of the Soul’, he examines the intellectual part of the soul, by now dearly distinguished from the senses. The first of these sections has two parts: (a) he shows that there are no other particular senses besides the five exterior ones; and (b) he shows that, besides these, there is a common sense,—this comes at ‘Since we perceive that we see’. With regard to (a), after proving that there are only five particular senses, he shows why there are several of them and not one only. The former proof itself divides into two: first he shows that only the five senses apprehend particular ‘sensibles’; and then at ‘But there cannot be’, that the same five are the only senses to apprehend common ‘sensibles’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa primum utitur tali ratione. Quicumque habet aliquod organum sensus, per quod nata sunt cognosci aliqua sensibilia, cognoscit omnia illa sensibilia per organum illud: sed animalia perfecta habent omnia organa sensus: ergo cognoscunt omnia sensibilia. Cum igitur non habeant nisi quinque sensus, non erit alius respectu propriorum sensibilium, praeter quinque sensus.
          <td>566. To prove the first of these two points he argues thus. If a subject has a sense-organ in virtue of which a certain definite range of sensible objects is naturally perceptible, this organ is the medium by which it perceives those objects. But the higher animals are endowed with all the organs of sense; therefore they can perceive the entire range of sensible objects; and as these organs are only five in number, the whole range of particular sensible objects is covered by the five organic senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa hanc rationem hoc modo procedit. Primo proponit quod intendit; dicens, quod ex his quae sequuntur, potest aliquis sufficienter ad credendum moveri, quod non sit sensus praeter quinque iam dictos.
          <td>567. In proposing this argument Aristotle begins by stating his purpose in using it, i.e. to convince anybody that there are no other senses besides the five aforesaid.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi si enim ostendit primam propositionem rationis inductae; scilicet hanc, quod animal habens aliquod organum sensus, cognoscit omnia sensibilia, quae possunt sentiri per illud organum. Et hoc quidem manifestat ex sensu tactus, eo quod manifestum est quod sunt qualitates tangibiles. Dictum enim est supra, quod qualitates tangibiles sunt differentiae corporis elementati, inquantum huiusmodi; quae quidem manifestae sunt ex his quae determinata sunt ex elementis; unde manifestum nobis potest esse, quod nos sentimus omnes qualitates tangibiles.
          <td>568. Next at ‘For if’, he explains the major premise of the argument: that a subject possessed of any sense organ can know all that can be known by that organ. This he shows from the sense of touch. There are obviously certain tangible qualities, namely (as has been said), the various modifications of elemental bodies as such; for what has been said about the four elements has made it clear that there are such modifications. And all these tangible qualities, as such, fall within the range of our sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ex hoc concludit per simile in aliis, quod si habemus aliquod organum, quod habemus sensum illorum sensibilium, quae nata sunt cognosci per illud organum. Hoc est ergo quod dicit: quod si nos habemus sensum omnis sensibilis, cuius tactus est perceptivus quod ex hoc apparet quod omnes passiones tangibiles, inquantum huiusmodi, a nobis sentiuntur; necesse est universaliter dicere, quod si deficit nobis aliquis sensus aliquorum sensibilium, quod deficiat nobis aliquod organum, quo nata sunt cognosci illa sensibilia: quia si habemus organum, cognoscimus sensibilia. Et hoc quod universaliter dictum est, manifestat exemplificando per singula.
          <td>569. He then applies the same principle—that we are aware of precisely such objects as correspond to a given sense-organ in us—to the other senses. So he says: if we sense anything tactually perceptible, so that all tangible qualities, as such, are sensed by us, we can go on to argue in general that, if we do not in fact perceive a sensible quality, the reason must be that we lack the senseorgan to which it corresponds; precisely because if we have a sense-organ we do perceive certain sensible qualities. And this generalisation he then supports with particular examples.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et primo quantum ad ea quae cognoscuntur absque medio extraneo. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod quaecumque nos sentimus tangentes, idest absque medio extraneo, possunt sentiri per organum tactus, sub quo intelligitur gustus, quem habemus. Sed circa illa sensibilia, quae sentimus per media extranea, quae sunt simplicia corpora, scilicet aer et aqua, et non sentimus ea tangendo, illa sic se habent ut dicam: videlicet, quod si per unum organum plura sensibilia diversa genere adinvicem sentiri possunt, necesse est quod qui habet huiusmodi organum, sentiat utrumque genus. Puta, quod si aliquod organum est ex aere, et aer potest immutari a colore et sono, sequitur quod qui habet huiusmodi organum, potest et sonum et colorem percipere. Si vero e converso, plura organa sunt susceptiva eiusdem sensibilis, sicut aer et aqua, quorum utrumque est diaphanum, sunt perceptiva coloris, sequitur quod animal habens aliquod horum potest percipere quod est perceptibile per utrumque, sicut per media, aut ab ambobus sicut ab instrumentis. Quod ideo dicit, quia in sensibus, qui sentiunt per medium extraneum, organa sunt conformia mediis. Has autem conditiones ideo posuit, quia idem sensibile sentitur ab aliquo animali per aquam, et ab aliquo per aerem, sicut patet de odore.
          <td>570. And first with respect to things we apprehend without any extrinsic medium; for he says that whatever we sense ‘by contact’, i.e. without an extrinsic medium, is reached by the organ of touch (under which he includes taste). But where, as in the other senses, certain extrinsic media, simple substances like air and water, come between us and the object, it is relevant to observe that one and the same organ may convey apprehensions of several objects different in kind; and in that case, the subject having the organ apprehends things different in kind. For example, if a senseorgan contains air, and air naturally retains and conveys both colour and sound, then a subject with an air-containing organ will be able to sense both colour and sound. If, on the contrary, several different organs can attain the same sensible object—as happens in the case of organs composed, the one of air, the other of water, which are both transparent and therefore both receptive of colour,—then a subject with any one of such organs is able to perceive whatever is perceptible through, or by means of, all of them. The reason for his saying this is that the sense-organs which function through an extrinsic medium always correspond to that medium; and the fact is that the same sensible object, for instance odour, can reach different animals through different media, e.g. through water as well as air.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi simplicium autem ponit secundam propositionem cum sua manifestatione; scilicet quod omnia organa sentiendi habentur ab animalibus perfectis. Dicit ergo, quod organa sentiendi nata sunt constare ex solis duobus simplicium corporum, scilicet ex aere et aqua, quia ista sunt magis passibilia, et hoc requirit conditio organi sensus, ut facile immutetur a sensibili. In pupilla enim est aqua, quia per humorem aqueum in pupilla existentem, recipit oculus speciem visibilis. In organo autem auditus est aer, ut supra dictum est. Olfactus autem in quibusdam attribuitur aeri, in quibusdam aquae, ut supra dictum est: ignis autem secundum se nullius sensus organum est, quia ignis est maxime activus et minime passivus. Sed secundum participationem suae qualitatis est communis omnibus sensibus. Nihil enim est sensitivum sine calore, sicut nec vivens, cum nihil sentiat nisi vivens.
          <td>571. Thirdly, at ‘The sense-organs are formed’, he makes and explains a further statement: that the higher animals possess all the organs of sense. These organs, he says, are by nature composed of only two of the simple bodies, namely air and water, these being the two most passive simple bodies, and a ready passivity to the sensible object being the condition required in a sense-organ. Thus the pupil of the eye contains water, enabling the eye to receive a likeness of the thing it sees; the organ of hearing contains air (as we have noted already); whilst the sense of smell is related by some to air and by some to water. Fire, on the other hand, by reason of its extreme activity, plays no part in the organs of sense, though in a certain way its presence is felt in all the senses; for sensitivity always presupposes warmth because it always presupposes life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Terra vero pura, nullius sensus est organum, inquantum ipsum organum est sensitivum; sed per commistionem appropriatur tactui, quia organum tactus oportet esse mediae complexionatum, ut supra dictum est; et per consequens oportet, quod sit quasi compositum ex omnibus elementis. Unde relinquitur, quod nullum organum sensus est praeter aerem et aquam. Haec autem organa aeris et aquae, habent quaedam animalia, scilicet animalia perfecta. Unde concludit, quod omnia organa sensus habentur ab animalibus non imperfectis secundum suam naturam, sicut sunt imperfecta animalia immobilia, quae habent solum tactum.
          <td>572. Whilst earth as such has nothing to do with the senseorgans as such, it is in a special way a condition of touch: for it is mixed in with the body in a certain definite proportion which itself determines that mean between tangible extremes which gives the body a sense of touch at all; whence it follows that the organ of touch contains all the elements mixed in a certain proportion. But precisely as sensitive the sense-organs are made of air and water and of these only; and the air or water-composed organs are found in those animals we call ‘higher animals’. So he concludes by saying that, apart from naturally inferior organisms, such as the immobile animals which have only the sense of touch, all animals are endowed with all the organs of sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et animalibus non orbatis, idest non carentibus aliquo sensu, ex aliqua causa innaturali, sicut homines caeci vel surdi. Unde et talpa, quae est de genere perfectorum animalium, videtur habere oculos sub pelle, ut assimiletur suo generi. Sed propter hoc quod conversatur sub terra, non fuit ei necessarius visus, et terra, si haberet oculos discoopertos, eius oculos offenderet.
          <td>573. Apart, too, from the ‘defective’, i.e. animals lacking a sense which should be theirs by nature, like blind or deaf men. But moles, for example, are ‘higher animals’, having eyes under their skin. Living underground they do not need sight; and if their eyes were uncovered the soil would aggravate them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Procedit autem haec ratio, ut manifeste apparet, ex determinato numero elementorum, ex quo probavit, quod organa sensuum, qui sunt per media exteriora, fiunt per aerem et aquam solum. Et iterum ex determinatione passionum elementorum, quae sunt qualitates tangibiles: unde per eas fit notum, quod omnes qualitates tangibiles cognoscimus. Et ideo concludit quod nullus sensus deficit nobis; nisi aliquis dicere velit quod sit aliquod corpus elementale, praeter quatuor elementa; et quod sunt aliae passiones, quae possunt tactu discerni, quae sunt aliquorum corporum hic existentium, et nobis notorum. Et hoc videtur inconveniens. Unde relinquitur, quod sint quinque sensus tantum, qui a nobis habentur.
          <td>574. Clearly this argument assumes a definite number of elements. It infers that, because there are only so many elements, the sense-organs that reach their objects through an exterior medium must be composed exclusively of air and water. Again, it presumes a fixed number of elemental qualities which are also the tangible qualities; and infers that all the latter are known to us; and that therefore we are equipped with all the sense faculties that exist. These conclusions could only be disproved by showing, either that there was some other corporeal element besides the four known to us, or that there were other tangible qualities (in the things around us and known to us), other than those which we do in fact perceive by touch. But there is no need to entertain such hypotheses, and we can safely conclude that the five senses we possess are the only senses that exist.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero quia posset aliquis dicere, quod est aliquis alius sensus cognoscitivus sensibilium communium: excludit hoc tali ratione. Quicquid cognoscitur ab uno sensu, ut proprium sensibile eius, non cognoscitur ab aliis sensibus, nisi per accidens: sed sensibilia communia non sentiuntur per accidens ab aliquo sensuum, sed per se a pluribus: sensibilia igitur communia non sunt proprie obiecta alicuius sensus.
          <td>575. Then where he says, ‘But there cannot be’, he rejects the suggestion that the ‘common sensibles’ are the object of another and distinct sense. For the proper and direct object of any one sense is only known indirectly by any other sense; but the common sensibles are not known indirectly by any sense at all; rather, they are each directly known by several senses. Therefore they cannot be the proper objects of any one sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa rationem hanc, hoc modo procedit. Primo ponit conclusionem; dicens, quod non potest esse aliquod proprium organum sensus, cognoscitivum communium sensibilium, quae sentimus unoquoque sensu per se, et non per accidens, quae sunt motus, et status, et cetera.
          <td>576. Note how this argument proceeds. Aristotle first states the conclusion, that there cannot be any one organ specially adapted to the perception of the ‘common sensibles’ perceived directly, not indirectly, by all the senses, namely movement, rest and so forth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi haec enim probat, quod ista sensibilia communia sentiantur per se, et non secundum accidens. Quaecumque enim sentiuntur per hoc quod immutant sensum, sentiuntur per se et non secundum accidens. Nam hoc est per se sentire, pati aliquid a sensibili. Sed omnia haec sensibilia, per immutationem quamdam sentiuntur. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod haec omnia sentimus motu, idest quadam immutatione. Manifestum est enim quod magnitudo immutat sensum, cum sit subiectum qualitatis sensibilis puta coloris aut saporis, et qualitates non agunt sine suis subiectis. Ex quo apparet, quod figuram etiam cognoscimus cum quadam immutatione, quia figura est aliquid magnitudinis, quia consistit in conterminatione magnitudinis. Est enim figura quae termino vel terminis continetur, ut dicitur in primo Euclidis.
          <td>577. Then, at ‘For we know’, he shows that these common sensibles are directly, not indirectly, perceived. What enters sensation precisely by disturbing the sense-organ is directly, not indirectly, sensed; for to sense directly -is simply to receive an impression from a sensible object. Now all these common sensibles are sensed in this way, which is why he says that we apprehend them by ‘motion’, i.e. through some disturbance of the organ. Size, for example, is obviously sensed in this way: it is the subject of such sensible qualities as colour or savour, and no quality is able to act in separation from its subject. From which it follows that shape also is known in this way, for shape is an aspect of size; it is size as terminated. As Euclid says, shape is what is contained in a limit.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est etiam, quod quies comprehenditur ex motu, sicut tenebra per lucem. Est enim quies privatio motus. Numerus etiam cognoscitur per negationem continui, quod est magnitudo. Numerus enim rerum sensibilium, ex divisione continui causatur; unde et proprietates numeri per proprietates continui cognoscuntur. Quia enim continuum divisibile est in infinitum, et numerus in infinitum crescere potest, ut patet ex tertio physicorum. Manifestum etiam quod unusquisque sensus per se cognoscit unum, ut immutatus ab uno obiecto. Unde manifestum est, quod ista sensibilia communia sentiuntur per se, et non per accidens. Unde ex hoc concluditur, quod impossibile est esse proprium sensum alicuius horum.
          <td>578. Rest also is perceived by means of movement, as darkness by means of light, for rest is the lack of movement. Number also, since it comes from dividing a continuum or continuous magnitude, is apprehended as the latter’s negation, and its properties are known through those of the continuum; for as the continuum is infinitely visible, so numbers can go on to infinity, as is shown in Book III of the <i>Physics</i> . Now it is clear that all the objects of any sense go to make up one single direct object of that sense, in so far as they concur in affecting the organ of that sense; whence it follows that these ‘common sensibles’ belong to the direct, not the indirect, objects of sensation; and further, that no one of them is the object of any distinct and special sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi sic enim ostendit quod si sentirentur proprie ab aliquo sensu, quod essent sensibilia per accidens. Et hoc est quod dicit quod sic esset de sensibilibus communibus, si essent propria obiecta alicuius sensus, sicut nunc est, quod visu sentimus dulce. Hoc enim est, quia nos habemus sensum utriusque, scilicet albi et dulcis. Et ideo, quando coincidunt in unum, illud quod est unius sensus, per se cognoscitur ab illo sensu, per accidens autem ab alio. Ideo videndo album per se, videmus dulce per accidens.
          <td>579. Then, at ‘The situation etc.’, he shows that if they were the object of any special sense they would be also ‘indirectly sensed. This is what he means by saying that the hypothesis -in question would imply that we perceived the common sensibles in the same way as we see sweetness. For sweetness and (e.g.) whiteness each answer to a distinct and special sense; hence, when both qualities are found in the same thing each is known directly by its own special sense and indirectly by that of the other. By sight we know whiteness directly, sweetness indirectly.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem non sit sensibile proprie ab aliquo sensu, numquam hoc erit quod sentiatur per accidens ab aliquo alio sensu ex coincidentia duorum sensuum vel sensibilium in idem; sed omnino secundum accidens sensibile est, ut supra dictum est; sicut filium Cleonis secundum accidens sentimus, non quia filius Cleonis est, sed quia albus, cui accidit esse filium Cleonis. Hoc autem, scilicet esse filium Cleonis, non ita est sensibile visu per accidens, quod sit aliquo alio sensu sensibile per se, sicut erat de dulci, communium autem sensibilium habemus sensum communem non secundum accidens, id est communia sensibilia communiter sentiuntur a diversis sensibus per se, et non secundum accidens. Unde sequitur, quod non sit aliquis proprius sensus eorum; quia tunc non sentiremus ea per se aliis sensibus, sed sentiremus ea per accidens, sicut sentimus filium Cleonis.
          <td>580. But if an object is not directly perceived by any special distinct sense it can never become the indirect object of any other sense through the concurrence of two senses or sensibles in the same thing; it must always, in every respect, be indirectly perceived. Thus I perceive indirectly that so and so is Cleon’s son, not because he is Cleon’s son, but because he is white; whiteness as such only happens to be connected with Cleon’s son. Being the son of Cleon is not (like sweetness) indirectly visible in such a way as to imply its being directly perceived by some other sense. On the other hand the common sensibles are not indirectly sensible at all; they are a common yet direct object of several distinct senses. It follows that they answer to no special and distinct sense; if they did, they would be indirectly sensed, like the fact that so and so was Cleon’s son.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sentiunt enim sensus propria sensibilia adinvicem secundum accidens, ut puta visus sensibile auditus, et e converso. Non enim visus cognoscit sensibile auditus, neque auditus sensibile visus, secundum quod ipsa sunt; quia visus nihil patitur ab audibili, nec auditus a visibili. Sed secundum quod fit unus sensus, id est una sensatio secundum actum, ut ita loquar, in eodem sensibili. Et dico eumdem sensum actu, ex eo quod simul fit actio utriusque sensus respectu eiusdem sensibilis; sicut cholera simul percipitur per gustum quod sit amara, et per visum quod sit rubicunda; et ideo statim ad aspectum rubicundi iudicamus aliquid esse amarum. Non est autem aliquis alius sensus cuius proprium sit cognoscere quod album et amarum sunt unum. Haec enim unitas non est nisi per accidens; et quod est per accidens tantum, non potest esse obiectum alicuius potentiae. Et ideo quia visus non percipit illud quod est gustus, nisi per accidens, frequenter in talibus decipitur sensus, et iudicamus quod si aliquid sit rubeum, quod sit cholera.
          <td>581. For the senses perceive each other’s special objects indirectly, as sight that of hearing, and vice versa. Sight does not perceive the audible as such, nor hearing the visible as such (for the eye takes no impression from the audible, nor the ear from the visible) but both objects are perceived by each sense only in so far as ‘one sense’, i.e. one actual sensation so to say, bears upon an object which contains both. I mean that both the senses in question are exercised at once upon one and the same sensible thing, as when bile is at once seen as red and tasted as bitter; so that as soon as we see that this thing is red we judge that it is bitter. But there is no special sense of the conjunction of redness and bitterness, for this conjunction is quite incidental, and what is incidental cannot be the object of any special faculty. And the fact that sight only indirectly knows savour helps us to understand why we are so often deceived in such cases, and jump to the conclusion that because a certain thing is, for example, red, it is therefore bile.

Secus autem de accidentibus individui, quorum assignanda est ratio ex parte materiae, vel agentis. Unde et hic assignat causam finalem. Dicit ergo, quod aliquis potest quaerere, cuius causa habemus plures sensus, et non unum tantum. Et est responsio ad hoc, ut nos non lateant ea quae consequuntur ad sensibilia propria, et sunt communia diversis sensibilibus, sicut motus et magnitudo et numerus. Si enim esset solus sensus visus; cum ipse coloris tantum sit, et color et magnitudo se consequantur, quia simul cum colore immutatur sensus a magnitudine; inter colorem non possemus discernere et magnitudinem, sed viderentur esse idem. Sed nunc quia magnitudo sentitur alio sensu quam visu, color autem non, hoc ipsum manifestat nobis quod aliud est color et magnitudo. Et simile est de aliis sensibilibus communibus.
          <td>582. Then at ‘One might ask’ he goes on to enquire why there are many senses. As this is a question about a species as a whole it must be answered in terms of final causality (as he explains towards the end of the <i>De Generatione Animalium</i> ); not, like questions about individual peculiarities, in terms of material or efficient causality. So here he introduces the idea of purpose. The question might arise, he says, why we have several senses ,instead of only one; and he answers that it is to enable us to discern such things as movement, size and number, which are at once accompaniments of each distinct and proper sensible object and also common to them all. For suppose there were only the sense of sight, whose proper object is simply colour; then, since the impression of colour on the sense-organ immediately involves an impression of size, so that the two objects are inseparable, we should never be able to distinguish between colour [and size; they would appear to us as exactly the same. But the fact that size is also perceived by a sense other than sight, whilst colour is not, is enough to show us that size and colour are not the same. And the same holds good for the other common sensibles.]

          <td>Potest autem et haec ratio assignari distinctionis sensuum. Manifestum est enim quod cum potentia dicatur ad obiectum, oportet quod secundum differentiam obiectorum, diversificentur potentiae sensitivae. Obiectum autem sensibile est, prout est immutativum sensus: unde secundum diversa genera immutationum sensus a sensibili, oportet esse diversos sensus. Immutatur autem sensus a sensibili uno modo per contactum, et sic est sensus tactus, qui est discretivus eorum ex quibus constat animal, et sensus gustus, qui est perceptivus qualitatum quae designant convenientiam nutrimenti, quo conservatur corpus animalis. Alio modo immutatur sensus per medium. Et haec quidem immutatio, aut est cum alteratione sensibilis, et sic odor immutat sensum cum aliqua resolutione odorabilis. Aut cum aliquo motu locali, et sic immutat sonus. Aut absque immutatione sensibili, sed per solam immutationem spiritualem medii et organi, et sic immutat color.
          <td>583. To this one might add also the following reason. Since every potency as such implies an object, there must be a diversity of sensitive potencies if, and in the manner that, there is a diversity of sensible objects. But objects become sensible by impressing a sense-organ; hence to the different kinds of such impressions win correspond a diversity of sensitive potencies. Now one way in which the sense-organ is impressed by objects is by physical contact, whence arise both the sense of touch, perceiving what composes the physical constitution of an animal, and the sense of taste, perceptive of those qualities which indicate the suitability of an animal’s nourishment for keeping its body in being. And another way by which the sense-organ can receive its impression is through a medium; and this involves either an intrinsic change in the object itself, as in the case of smell. which implies a certain disintegration of the thing smelt; or a change of place, as in the case of sound; or no change at all in the sensible object, but simply a spiritual impression upon the medium and the sense-organ, such as is made by colour.

            <td>Moreover, that which sees is, in a way, coloured; for each sensitive faculty is receptive of the sense-object without its material concomitant. Hence, in the absence of the sense-objects there remain sensation’s and phantasms in the sense-powers. The act of the sense-object and the sensation are one and the same: but these—I mean, for instance, sound in act or sight in act—are not identical in their being. For it happens that what has hearing does not hear all the time, and what has sound is not always sounding. But when that which is able to hear operates, and that which is able to sound sounds, both hearing in act and sound in act arise simultaneously. (of which two, one might call one ‘hearing’, the other ‘sounding’.) §§ 589-91

            <td>If then movement and action and passion are in that which is acted upon, it follows that sound and hearing in act reside in that which is these potentially. For the act of what moves or causes is realised in the recipient; hence it is not necessary that what moves be itself in motion. The act of the sound-producing is therefore sound or a sounding; and of the hearing faculty, is hearing or audition. For ‘hearing’ ‘and ‘sounding’ are both twofold. And the same reasoning applies to the other senses and their objects. For as the action and the reception are in the recipient, not in the agent, so the act of the sense-object and of the sense faculty are in the sensitive recipient. However, whereas both are named in some cases (as sounding and audition) in others one or the other is nameless. Vision is the act of seeing, but that of colour has no name; and tasting is the act of the tasting faculty, but the act of savour has no name. §§ 592-3

For this reason anything excessively shrill or deep destroys the hearing; and the same in flavours destroys the taste; and in colours, the sight, whether the excessively brilliant or the dark; and in smell, a strong odour, whether sweet or bitter; as if the sense were a certain proportion. Hence, too, those [savours] become delectable which, from having been pure and unmixed (e.g. the bitter or sweet or saline) are brought into a proportion. Then indeed they give pleasure. And in general what is compounded is more of a harmony than the sharp or low [sounds] alone; or in the case of touch, what can be both heated and chilled. Sense is a ‘proportion’ which is hurt or destroyed by extremes. § 597-8

          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit quod non sit alius sensus proprius, praeter quinque, procedit ad inquirendum, utrum sit aliqua potentia sensitiva communis his quinque sensibus. Et hoc quidem investigat ex quibusdam actionibus, quae non videntur alicuius sensus propriae esse, sed videntur exigere aliam potentiam sensitivam communem. Huiusmodi autem actiones sunt duae. Una est secundum quod nos percipimus actiones propriorum sensuum, puta quod sentimus nos videre et audire. Alia est secundum quod discernimus inter sensibilia propria diversorum sensuum, puta quod aliud sit dulce, et aliud album. Primo ergo inquirit cui sit attribuenda prima harum actionum. Secundo, cui sit attribuenda secunda, ibi, uniuscuiusque quidem igitur. Circa primum tria facit. Primo movet quaestionem, dicens: quoniam sentimus quod videmus, et similiter sentimus quod audimus, et sic de unoquoque sensibilium; necessarium est aut per visum sentire quod ipse visus videt, aut per aliam virtutem; et sic de aliis sensibus.
          <td>584. Having shown that there are no more than five particular senses, the Philosopher next proceeds to ask whether these five senses spring from any one common potency. He is led to ask this by observing two activities which do not seem to be peculiar to any one sense, but to spring from some more general potency: for (a) we have some perception of the activities of the particular senses, e.g. we sense our own seeing and hearing; and (b) we distinguish between the objects proper to each of the different senses, between, for instance, sweet and white. So he enquires into the source of these two activities, first of the former, arid then, at ‘Each of the senses, then’, of the latter. The former enquiry divides into three parts. First, he states the problem, saying that the fact that we do perceive our own seeing and hearing and so forth implies either that sight (for example) is able to see its seeing, or that some other faculty has this power; and so also with the other senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo obiicit ad utramque partem, ibi si autem et primo inducit, ad ostendendum quod visus videat se videre, duas rationes. Quarum prima talis est. Si homo sentit se videre altero sensu quam visu; aut hoc erit quia illo alio sensu homo videt colorem; aut omnino alio sensu videt colorem, et sentit visionem coloris. Si vero eodem sensu quo sentit colorem et sentit visionem coloris; sequitur, quod unus et idem erit sensus secundum actum apprehensivus ipsius visionis et subiecti coloris. Quare sequitur alterum duorum: quia, si iste sensus, qui sentit visionem et colorem, sit alius sensus a visu, oportebit quod duo sensus sint unius subiecti, scilicet coloris. Aut si iste sensus, quo sentimus visionem et colorem, est idem cum sensu visus, sequitur quod sit idem eiusdem, id est quod visus sit sensus suiipsius, quod a principio negabatur. Dicere vero, quod ille alter sensus, quo quis sentit se videre, non sentiat colorem, est omnino irrationabile: quia si non cognosceret colorem, non posset cognoscere quid esset videre, cum videre nihil aliud sit, quam sentire colorem.
          <td>585. Next, at ‘And if, etc.’, he brings objections against both these alternatives. But first he proposes two arguments to show that it is sight that sees its own seeing. (1) If one perceives one’s seeing by a sense other than sight, then either that sense is a sense of colour, or the sense of colour and the sense of seeing colour are quite distinct. But if one and the same sense knows colour and the sight of colour, then the act of one and the same sense bears at once upon the sight of colour and the coloured thing. Whence follows one of two consequences. For if this sense of seeing and of colour is not the sense of sight, then there are two senses with the same object, namely the coloured thing; but if it is the same as sight, then sight is, after all, what perceives seeing-which is contrary to the hypothesis. Nor could it possibly be maintained that the perception of seeing is not a perception of colour; without perceiving colour one cannot possibly perceive seeing, for seeing is only sensing colour.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi amplius autem quae talis est. Si sensus, id est visionis, quo scilicet sentimus nos videre, sit alter a visu, iterum quaerendum est de illo sensu: utrum, scilicet ille sensus sentiat se sentire; et si non, oportebit quaerere tertium sensum, qui sentiat illum sentire. Aut igitur hoc procedit in infinitum, quod est impossibile, cum impossibile sit compleri actionem quae dependet ab actionibus infinitis, neque etiam unius rei possint esse potentiae infinitae: aut oportebit quod deveniatur ad aliquem sensum, qui sit iudex suiipsius, id est percipiat se sentire. Eadem ergo ratione poterat fieri in primo sensu, ut scilicet visus sentiret se videre. Non est ergo alius sensus, qui percipiat colorem, et qui percipit visionem coloris.
          <td>586. (2) The second argument begins at ‘Further, if’. If the sense of seeing is other than sight, then the further question arises whether that sense of seeing also senses its own activity; and if it does not, then there must be a third sense which does this. And either this series goes on to infinity—which is impossible, both because no action could ever be completed which depended on an infinity of actions, and because no single subject can possess an infinite number of faculties—or we have to posit a sense which really does take account of itself, i.e. perceive its own sensation. But, by the same reasoning, there is no need to go beyond the first sense of all; there is no reason why sight should not sense its seeing. Therefore the sense of colour is the same as the sense of seeing colour.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit habet autem obiicit ad partem contrariam. Et quia primae rationes aliqualiter concludunt verum, haec ratio per modum dubitationis proponitur, unde et eam solvit. Est autem ratio talis. Si visu sentimus nos videre; sentire autem visu, nihil est aliud quam videre; ergo videmus nos videre. Sed nihil videtur nisi color tantum, aut habens colorem. Si igitur aliquis videt se quod sit videns, sequitur quod primum videns, quod secundo fuit visum, sit habens colorem; quod videtur inconveniens. Nam dictum est supra, quod visus, cum sit susceptivum coloris, est absque colore.
          <td>587. Then at ‘Here is a problem’ he puts an objection from the other side in the form of a difficulty, which he proceeds to answer at once, because he has already, with the arguments given above, gone a long way towards settling the whole question. The objection runs thus. If it is by sight that we sense our seeing, then we simply see our seeing. Now nothing is seen except colour or coloured things; if then one sees that one sees, the first seeing (that which is subsequently seen), must itself be coloured; which would seem to be false in view of the principle already laid down, that sight receives colour precisely in so far as it is colourless.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit manifestum igitur solvit tertio propositam dubitationem duobus modis. Primo concludens ex praedictis, quod sentire visu multipliciter dicitur. Ostensum est enim supra, quod visu sentimus nos videre. Item ostensum est, quod visu non sentimus, nisi colorem. Sentire ergo visu dupliciter dicitur. Uno modo, secundum quod visu sentimus nos videre. Alio modo, cum visu videmus colorem. Et quod visu sentire dicatur multipliciter; apparet ex hoc, quod aliquando dicimur sentire visu, cum visus praesentialiter immutatur a visibili, scilicet colore. Aliquando autem discernimus visu et tenebras et lumen etiam cum non videmus, per immutationem scilicet ab exteriori sensibili. Sed non similiter dicitur utroque modo, visu sentire. Redit ergo solutio ad hoc, quod actio visus potest considerari, vel secundum quod consistit in immutatione organi a sensibili exteriori, et sic non sentitur nisi color. Unde ista actione, visus non videt se videre. Alia est actio visus secundum quam, post immutationem organi, iudicat de ipsa perceptione organi a sensibili, etiam abeunte sensibili: et sic visus non videt solum colorem, vel sentit, sed sentit etiam visionem coloris.
          <td>588. Next, at ‘It is clear then’, he answers this difficulty in two ways. In the first place, it is clear from what has been said that to see can mean different things—a perception of our seeing and a perception of mere colour; and this gives two distinct senses of the word. To make this clearer, observe that when we say that we are seeing we sometimes mean that our sight is, at the present moment, actually being impressed by the visible object, namely colour; but we can also sometimes mean that we are aware of the difference, between light and dark even when we are not, at the moment, receiving an impression from an exterior sensible object. But ‘seeing’ does not mean the same in both cases. So what this solution comes to is this, that the act of seeing can be regarded either as the disturbance of a sense-organ by an exterior sensible object, and in this sense colour only is seen; or as the act by which, after the said disturbance, and even on the disappearance of the sensible object, we form a judgement on the reception of the object into the sense-organ; and in this sense not only colour is seen, but also the sight of colour.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit amplius autem ponit aliam solutionem: quae quidem necessaria est, eo quod color habet duplex esse: unum naturale in re sensibili, aliud spirituale in sensu. Secundum ergo primum esse coloris, processit prima solutio. Haec autem secunda procedit quantum ad secundum esse coloris. Circa hanc solutionem tria facit. Primo ponit solutionem. Secundo probat quoddam, quod in solutione supposuerat, ibi, si igitur est motus. Tertio ex hac solutione ostendit etiam quarumdam aliarum quaestionum solutionem, ibi, quoniam autem unus.
          <td>589. Then, with ‘Moreover, that which sees’, he proposes his second answer to the difficulty. This answer is required by the fact that colour has two modes of being: a material mode in the object, a spiritual mode in sensation. The former solution implied only the first of these modes; this one depends on the second. And here he does three things: (1) he sets out the solution; (2) at ‘If then there is movement’ he proves what the solution assumes; (3) at ‘Since the act’ he applies it to the solution of certain other problems.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum soluta sit prima dubitatio, sustinendo quod videns non sit coloratum, amplius potest solvi dicendo quod videns est tamquam coloratum, quia in vidente est similitudo coloris, unde videns est simile colorato. Unde illa potentia, quae videt aliquem esse videntem, non est extra genus potentiae visivae. Et quod videns sit quodammodo coloratum, probat per ea quae supra dicta sunt, quia unumquodque organum sensus est susceptivum speciei sensibilis sine materia, ut dictum est. Et ista est ratio, quare abeuntibus sensibilibus, fiunt in nobis sensationes et phantasiae, id est apparitiones, secundum quas aliquo modo sentiunt animalia. Et sic patet quod videns est tamquam coloratum, inquantum habet similitudinem coloris. Et non solum videns est tamquam coloratum, et simile colorato; sed etiam actus cuiuslibet sensus, est unus et idem subiecto cum actu sensibilis, sed ratione non est unus.
          <td>590. First, then, he says that while one solution of the difficulty was found by maintaining that the subject seeing colour was not coloured, another might be argued on the assumption that the subject seeing colour is in a certain sense coloured, inasmuch as, in seeing, it takes in a likeness of colour, becoming like the coloured object. This is why the power by which one sees one’s own seeing can still be strictly a power of sight. That the one who sees is, in a sense, coloured, he then proves from what was said above, i.e. that the sense-organ as such receives a form from the sensible object, but without matter; which is why, when the object passes away, we retain sensations and images, i.e. the appearances in and by which animals somehow sense things. So the one who sees becomes coloured in so far as he retains a likeness of colour and of the coloured thing; and not only sight, but any act of sense is identical in being with the act of the sensible object as such; although the mind can consider them apart.

          <td>Et dico actum sensus, sicut auditum secundum actum; et actum sensibilis, sicut sonum secundum actum. Non enim semper sunt in actu: quia contingit habentia auditum non audire, et habens sonum non semper sonare. Sed cum potens audire habet suam operationem, et potens sonare habet sonare, tunc simul fit sonus secundum actum qui vocatur sonatio, et auditus secundum actum, qui vocatur auditio. Cum igitur visus percipiat sensibile et actum eius, et videns sit simile sensibili, et actus videntis sit idem subiecto cum actu sensibilis, licet non ratione, relinquitur quod eiusdem virtutis est, videre colorem et immutationem quae est a colore, et visum in actu et visionem eius. Potentia ergo illa, qua videmus nos videre, non est extranea a potentia visiva, sed differt ratione ab ipsa.
          <td>591. I say, the act of <i>sense</i> , meaning, for instance, actual hearing; and the act of the sensible <i>object</i> , meaning actual sound. For the two are not always in act: the hearer is not always hearing, nor the thing heard always sounding; but when the former goes into the appropriate act and the latter begins to sound, then together take place an actual sound and an actual hearing. Since, then, sight perceives an object and its actuality, and the one who sees is assimilated to the object, so that his act of seeing is the same being as the actuality of the object (though the mind can distinguish them), it follows that one and the same power in us sees colour, and the impression of colour on the sense-organ, and the visible actuality of the thing seen, and our sight of it. The power, then, by which we see our seeing is not really other than sight itself, though it can be thought of as distinct.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit si igitur probat quod supposuerat; scilicet quod unus et idem sit actus sensibilis et sentientis, sed ratione differant, ex his quae sunt ostensa in tertio physicorum. Ibi enim ostensum est, quod tam motus quam actio vel passio sunt in eo quod agitur, id est in mobili et patiente. Manifestum est autem, quod auditus patitur a sono; unde necesse est, quod tam sonus secundum actum, qui dicitur sonatio, quam auditus secundum actum, qui dicitur auditio, sit in eo quod est secundum potentiam, scilicet in organo auditus. Et hoc ideo, quia actus activi et motivi fit in patiente, et non in agente et movente. Et ista est ratio, quare non est necessarium, quod omne movens moveatur. In quocumque enim est motus, illud movetur. Unde, si motus et actio, quae est quidam motus, esset in movente, sequeretur, quod movens moveretur. Et sicut dictum est in tertio physicorum, quod actio et passio sunt unus actus subiecto, sed differunt ratione, prout actio signatur ut ab agente, passio autem ut in patiente, ita supra dixit, quod idem est actu sensibilis et sentientis subiecto, sed non ratione. Actus igitur sonativi vel soni est sonatio, auditivi autem actus est auditio.
          <td>592. (2) Next, where he says ‘If then movement’, he proves his assumption that the sensible object and the sentient subject are actually identical though they can be thought of apart; making use here of Book III of the <i>Physics</i> , in which it is proved that movement and action and passion exist in that upon which the action in question bears, i.e. ‘in the thing that is moved by and passive to the action.’ Now hearing is obviously passive with respect to sound. Therefore, the actual sound, no less than the actual hearing, exists on the side of the potency, in the organ of hearing; and this because the act of an active mover comes to full existence in what is passive to it, not in the agent as such. This is why it is not necessary that every mover be itself moved; for that is moved which has the movement; so that if the movement or action (which is a sort of movement) came to full existence in the mover, the mover would also be moved. And as in the <i>Physics</i> it was laid down that action and passion are one single actuality of the same subject, though they differ in thought, so here he says that the sensible object and sentient subject are actually identified in one subject, though they differ to thought. Hence the act of sound or of the sounding thing is the sensation of sound, while that of the hearer is hearing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dupliciter enim dicitur auditus et sonus: scilicet secundum actum et secundum potentiam. Et quod de auditu et sono dictum est, eadem ratione se habet in aliis sensibus et sensibilibus. Sicut enim actio et passio est in patiente et non in agente, ut subiecto, sed solum ut in principio a quo, ita tam actus sensibilis quam actus sensitivi, est in sensitivo ut in subiecto. Sed in quibusdam sensibilibus et sensitivis, nominatus est uterque actus, et sensibilis ut sonatio, et sensitivi, ut auditio. In quibusdam autem unum tantum nominatum est, scilicet actus sensitivi. Visio enim dicitur actus visus, sed actus coloris non est nominatus. Et gustus, id est gustatio, est actus gustativi, sed actus saporis non est nominatus apud Graecos.
          <td>593. For both hearing and sound can be regarded either as in act or as in potency; and what has been said of them in this connection is true also of the other senses and sensible objects, namely that, as the <i>subject</i> of both action and passion is not the agent but the thing that receives the action—the agent being only the <i>source</i> of the action—so the act of the sensible object, no less than the act of the sense-faculty, exists in the latter as in its subject. But sometimes a distinct word is used for each act, as when the act of the object is called ‘sounding’ and that of the faculty ‘hearing’; while sometimes only the act of the faculty has a special name. Thus the act of sight is called vision, but that of colour is nameless; and the act of taste is called tasting, but that of savour has no name in Greek.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem ex praemissa solutione procedit ad demonstrandum veritatem duarum quaestionum: quarum prima est utrum sensus et sensibilia simul corrumpantur et salventur. Ad huius ergo solutionem dicit, quod quia actus sensibilis et sensitivi est unus subiecto, sed differunt ratione, ut dictum est; necesse est quod auditus dictus secundum actum, et sonus dictus secundum actum, simul salventur et corrumpantur: et similiter est de sapore et gustu, et aliis sensibilibus et sensibus. Sed si dicantur secundum potentiam, non necesse est, quod simul corrumpantur et salventur.
          <td>594. Then (3) at ‘Since the act’, he uses the foregoing solution to answer two more questions. (a) Do the sense-faculty and its object together cease and together remain in being? Answering which, he observes that, since the actualities of faculty and object are one actuality in one subject, though distinct to thought (as has been said), therefore actual hearing and actual sounding must together cease to be and together persist; and so also with savour and tasting and the rest. But the same is not necessarily true of the faculties and objects as in potency.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hac autem ratione excludit opinionem antiquorum naturalium, ibi, sed priores. Dicens, quod priores naturales non bene dicebant in hoc, quia opinabantur nihil esse album, aut nigrum, nisi quando videtur; neque saporem esse, nisi quando gustatur; et similiter de aliis sensibilibus et sensibus. Et quia non credebant esse alia entia, nisi sensibilia, neque aliam virtutem cognoscitivam, nisi sensum, credebant quod totum esse et veritas rerum esset in apparere. Et ex hoc deducebantur ad credendum contradictoria simul esse vera, propter hoc quod diversi contradictoria opinantur.
          <td>595. Which leads him to reject an opinion of some early natural philosophers. They were wrong, he says, in supposing that nothing was white or black except when it was seen; or had savour except when it was tasted; and so forth. And because they thought that nothing existed except what was sensible, and that the only knowing was sensation, they concluded that the whole being and truth of things was a mere appearance; and further, that contradictories could both be true at the same time, if and because they seemed true to different people.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicebant autem quodammodo recte, et quodammodo non. Cum enim dupliciter dicatur sensus et sensibile; scilicet secundum potentiam et secundum actum; de sensu et sensibili secundum actum accidit quod ipsi dicebant, quod non est sensibile sine sensu. Non autem hoc verum est de sensu et sensibili secundum potentiam. Sed ipsi loquebantur simpliciter, id est sine distinctione, de his quae dicuntur multipliciter.
          <td>596. Now this is partly true and partly false. Sense-faculty and sense-object can be taken in two ways, as in potency and as in act. From the point of view of act, what they said was correct: there is no sense-object without sensation. But it is not true from the point of view of potency. They made ‘assertions’, i.e. without distinguishing, in a matter which calls for distinctions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit si autem demonstrat ex praemissis solutionem alterius quaestionis: quare scilicet quaedam sensibilia corrumpant sensum, et quaedam delectant: et dicit quod cum symphonia, id est vox consonans et proportionata, sit vox quaedam, et vox quodammodo sit idem quod auditus, et symphonia sit quaedam proportio, necesse est quod auditus sit quaedam proportio. Et quia quaelibet proportio corrumpitur per superabundantiam, ideo excellens sensibile corrumpit sensum, sicut quod est excellenter grave et acutum corrumpit auditum, et excellens saporosum corrumpit gustum, et fortiter fulgidum vel obscurum corrumpit visum, et fortis odor corrumpit olfactum, quasi sensus sit quaedam proportio.
          <td>597. Then, where he says ‘Now if voice’, he applies these principles to solve another problem: (b) why are certain objects destructive of the senses, whilst others give, them pleasure? And he says that since every harmonious and well-balanced sound is, as a sound, identical somehow with the faculty of hearing, the fact that the sound is a kind of harmony implies that hearing is the same. Now harmony or proportion is destroyed by excess; an excessive sense-object is therefore destructive of the faculty. An excessively sharp or heavy sound can destroy hearing; an excessively tasty thing destroys taste; too much brightness or darkness destroys the sight; over-powerful smells destroy the sense of smell. As though the sense itself in each case were a kind of proportion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed si plura sensibilia deducuntur ad proportionatam mistionem, efficiuntur delectabilia: sicut in saporibus, quando aliquid secundum debitam proportionem est aut acutum, aut dulce, aut salsum; tunc enim sunt omnino delectabilia. Et omne, quod est mistum, est magis delectabile, quam quod est simplex; sicut symphonia, quam vox acuta tantum, vel gravis tantum. Et in tactu, quod est compositum ex calefactibili et frigidabili. Sensus enim delectatur in proportionatis, sicuti in sibi similibus, eo quod sensus est proportio quaedam. Sed excellentia corrumpit sensum, vel saltem contristat ipsum.
          <td>598. On the other hand, if several sensible objects are mixed in due proportion the effect is pleasant. Thus savours mingled to a due sourness or sweetness or saltiness are extremely enjoyable. There is always more pleasure to be gained from combinations than from simplicity. Harmony is more enjoyable than mere high notes or mere low notes. So too in touch, with the combinations of hot and cold. For the sense-faculty delights in proportion as in its like, being itself a kind of proportion.. But. excess destroys it, or at least is disagreeable to it.

          <td>Processit philosophus superius, ad investigandum sensum communem ex hac operatione, qua sentimus nos videre et audire. Ex hac autem operatione ad hoc deventum est, quod potentia visiva sentit visione, alio tamen modo quam sentiat sensibile exterius; sed nondum habetur, quod potentia iudicativa de actibus sensuum, sit una et communis. Et ideo procedit ulterius ad investigandum huiusmodi veritatem per aliam operationem, quae ostendit unam potentiam esse communem, habentem se quodammodo ad omnes quinque sensus; et haec operatio est discernere sensibilia abinvicem. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quantum se possit extendere discretio sensus proprii. In secunda inquirit de illa discretione sensibilium, quae excedit virtutem sensus proprii, ibi, quoniam autem album.
          <td>599. So far the Philosopher’s approach to an examination of the ‘common sense’ has been by way of our perception of our own seeing and hearing. But his scrutiny of this perception has so far only led him to the conclusion that seeing is itself perceived by the faculty of sight, though not in the same way as exterior objects are perceived. He has not yet decided that there is any one common faculty that takes account of the activities of the particular senses. But now he takes his enquiry a step further by pointing to another activity of the soul as evidence of the existence of a faculty with a common relationship to all the five senses: the activity of discriminating between various sense-objects. And here he does two things: first, he shows how far the particular senses can so discriminate; next, he investigates that discrimination of sensible objects which exceeds the scope of any particular sense (this begins at ‘Since we distinguish’).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod ex dictis manifestum est, quod unusquisque sensus est cognoscitivus sensibilis sui obiecti, cuius species fit in suo organo, inquantum est tale organum. Immutatur enim organum uniuscuiusque sensus a proprio obiecto sensus per se, non per accidens. Et unusquisque sensus discernit differentias proprii sensibilis, sicut visus discernit album et nigrum, gustus dulce et amarum, et similiter se habet in aliis sensibus.
          <td>600. He observes then, first, that we have seen that each sense is perceptive of its own proper object precisely in so far as a likeness of the object is formed within its own particular organ as such; for the organ of each sense is, directly, not indirectly, impressed by the proper object of that sense. And within this proper object each sense discerns its characteristic differences; sight, e.g. discerning white and black, taste sweet and bitter; and so with the others.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem ostendit cui sit attribuenda ista discretio, quae excedit primum sensum, scilicet discernere sensibile unius sensus a sensibili alterius. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo determinat veritatem. Secundo obiicit contra veritatem et solvit, ibi, at vero impossibile. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ostendit quod aliquis sensus est qui discernit inter album et nigrum, et dulce. Secundo, quod non sunt duae potentiae sensus, sed una, ibi, neque utique. Tertio, quod simul illa potentia percipit utrumque sensibile, inter quae discernit, ibi, quod autem neque. Dicit ergo primo, quod quia discernimus aliqua virtute, non solum album a nigro, vel dulce ab amaro, sed etiam album a dulci, et unumquodque sensibile discernimus ab unoquoque et sentimus quod differunt, oportet quod hoc sit per sensum; quia cognoscere sensibilia, inquantum sunt sensibilia, est sensus. Cognoscimus autem differentias albi et dulcis, non solum quantum ad quod quid est utriusque, quod pertinet ad intellectum, sed etiam quantum ad diversam immutationem sensus. Et hoc non potest fieri nisi per sensum.
          <td>600. Then, at ‘Since we distinguish’, he points out the faculty that discriminates, as the particular senses cannot discriminate, between the objects of the different senses. And here he does two things: first, he demonstrates his conclusion; then he puts and solves an objection (at ‘But it is impossible etc.’). The demonstration has three parts: (a) he shows that there is a sense that perceives the differences between black and white and sweet; (b) that this sense is one faculty, not two; and (c) that it simultaneously perceives both objects between which it discriminates. First, then, he observes that whereas we are able to distinguish not only between black and white, or sweet and bitter, but also between white and sweet, and indeed between any one sense-object and another, it must be in virtue of some sense that we do this, for to know sense-objects as such is a sensuous activity; the difference between white and sweet is for us not only a difference of ideas, which would pertain to the intellect, but precisely a difference between sense-impressions, which pertains only to some sense-faculty.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et si per aliquem sensum fit, hoc maxime videtur quod fiat per tactum, qui est primus sensuum, et quodammodo radix et fundamentum omnium sensuum; et ab hoc, animal habet, quod dicatur sensitivum. Unde manifestum est, quod caro non est ultimum organum sensus tactus: quia cum per sensum tactus fiat discretio, necesse esset quod ipso contactu carnis a tangibili, fieret discretio tangibilis ab aliis sensibilibus. Attribuitur autem ista discretio tactui non secundum quod tactus est sensus proprius, sed secundum quod est fundamentum omnium sensuum, et propinquius se habens ad fontalem radicem omnium sensuum, qui est sensus communis.
          <td>602. If this be true, the most likely sense-faculty would seem to be touch, the first sense, the root and ground, as it were, of the other senses, the one which entitles a living thing to be called sensitive. But clearly, if this discrimination were a function of touch, then the fundamental organ of touch would not be flesh; if it were, then by the mere contact of flesh and a tangible object, this object would be discriminated from all other sense-objects. Now this discrimination cannot be attributed to touch precisely as a particular sense, but only as the common ground of the senses, as that which lies nearest to the root of them all. the ‘common sense’ itself.

Hoc autem excludit dicens, quod non contingit discernere, quod dulce sit alterum ab albo, separatis potentiis, id est diversis; sed oportet ad discernendum ea, quod secundum aliquam unam potentiam manifestum sit nobis. Ita enim esset si diversis potentiis sentiremus dulce et album, sicut si diversi homines sentirent, unus dulce et alius album; puta si ego sentio hoc, et ille illud.

          <td>603. Then, at ‘Nor could etc.’, he shows that it is by one and the same sense that we distinguish white from sweet. For one might have supposed that we did it by different senses, by tasting sweetness and by seeing whiteness. But if this were true, he says, we could never perceive that white was other than sweet. If this difference is to appear it must appear to some one sense-faculty; so long as white and sweet are sensed by distinct faculties it is as though they were sensed by two different men, one perceiving sweet and another white; I this and you that. In this case sweet and white are obviously distinct, because I am impressed in one way by sweetness, and you in another by whiteness.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed tamen diversitas ista non erit nobis per sensum manifesta; sed oportet quod unus sit, qui dicat quod alterum est dulce ab albo. Hoc enim est aliquid unum verum, scilicet quod alterum sit dulce ab albo: ergo oportet quod illud unum ab eodem dicatur. Sed dictio est interpretatio interioris apprehensionis: ergo sicut est unus qui dicit, ita oportet quod unus sit qui intelligat et sentiat, alterum esse dulce ab albo. Dicit autem intelligat et sentiat quia nondum ostensum est, quod aliud sit intellectus a sensu, vel quia ista diversitas, ex sensu et intellectu cognoscitur. Sicut igitur oportet quod unus homo, qui dicit alterum esse album a dulci, sit qui cognoscit utrumque, ita oportet quod una potentia sit, qua agnoscitur utrumque. Nam homo non cognoscit nisi per aliquam potentiam. Et hoc est quod concludit ulterius, palam esse quod non est possibile iudicare separata idest quod aliqua sint diversa, separatis idest diversis; sed oportet quod sit eadem potentia, quae utrumque cognoscat.
          <td>604. But this would not show us their sensible difference. There must be one single faculty which ‘says’ that sweet is not white, precisely because this distinction is one single object of knowledge. The ‘saying’ is the expression of an inward knowing; and as the saying is a single act, it must spring from a single act of understanding and sensing that what is sweet is not white. He says ‘understands and senses’. either because he has not yet established the distinction between sense and intellect, or perhaps because both these powers know the difference in question. As then the man who judges white to be other than sweet must be one man aware of both objects, so he must do this by means of one faculty; for awareness is the act of a faculty. Hence Aristotle’s conclusion, that it is clearly impossible to perceive ‘separate objects’, i.e. that two things are distinct, by ‘separate’, i.e. by distinct, means; there must be one single power aware of both things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod autem ostendit quod oportet simul utrumque cognosci. Dicit ergo, quod ex his quae dicentur manifestum est quod neque in separato tempore, idest in diverso tempore cognoscit utrumque. Sicut enim ille qui iudicat aliqua esse diversa, dicit aliquid unum et idem, scilicet quod alterum sit bonum et malum, sic etiam dicit quando alterum sit. Dicit enim quod sit alterum tunc quando iudicat, et hoc ipsum quando sit alterum, non dicit secundum accidens, ita quod ly quando, referatur ad dicentem, ut puta quia nunc dicit quod est alterum, (si non diceret, quod nunc est alterum. Hoc enim esset per accidens respectu eius quod dicitur): sed sicut nunc dicit quod est alterum, ita dicit quod nunc sit alterum. Hoc autem non posset esse, nisi simul ea apprehenderet, idest in illo instanti, pro quo iudicat esse altera. Manifestum est ergo quod simul cognoscit utrumque. Ergo sicut est inseparabilis potentia, id est una et eadem quae cognoscit utrumque eorum inter quae iudicatur differentia, ita oportet quod in inseparabili tempore apprehendat utrumque.
          <td>605. Next, at ‘And the same’, he proves that this awareness is of both things simultaneously, not at ‘separate’, i.e. distinct, moments. This will appear, he says, from what follows; for as a judgement on the difference between things is single with respect to what is discerned, for example that good is distinct from bad, so is it single with respect to the time in which it is discerned. One judges that such and such a difference exists when one is judging. Nor is the time only accidentally connected with the difference itself, as it would be if ‘when’ referred to the subject judging and the meaning was ‘he <i>now</i> judges that a difference exists’ (and not ‘...that now a difference exists’); in which case the ‘now’ would be merely incidental to the object. But the judgement of difference is in the present in the sense that there is difference at present; which necessarily implies a simultaneous apprehension of the two different objects; they are both known in the same instant as they are known to be different. Obviously, then, they are known at once and together. Hence, as one undivided faculty perceives the object’s difference, so in one undivided moment both are apprehended.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero obiicit in contrarium. Et circa hoc quatuor facit. Primo ponit obiectionem talem. Impossibile est idem et indivisibile, simul moveri secundum contrarios motus simul et in indivisibili tempore: sed intellectus et sensus movetur a sensibili inquantum sentit, et intelligibili, inquantum intelligit. Diversa autem sensibilia et contraria, diversis et contrariis motibus movent; ergo impossibile est, quod eadem vis sensitiva aut intellectiva, simul cognoscat contraria diversa.
          <td>606. However, he now puts an objection to himself;—concerning which he does four things. First, he states the objection, as follows. One and the same indivisible thing cannot move in different directions in one and the same indivisible moment of time. Now intellect and sense are moved by their objects, the one by an intelligible thing to understand it, the other by a sensible thing, to sense it. But distinct and mutually exclusive sense-objects cause distinct and mutually exclusive movements; therefore one and the same sensitive or intellectual faculty cannot know several distinct and mutually exclusive objects at the same time.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi ergo simul ponit unam solutionem: et dicit quod illud quod iudicat differentiam inter contraria, est simul et numero indivisibile et inseparabile, id est unum subiecto, sed secundum esse separatum, id est ratione est diversum. Sic igitur quodammodo indivisibile sentit divisa, id est diversa. Alio autem modo divisibile sentit diversa, quia secundum esse est divisibile, id est ratione est diversum, sed loco et numero est indivisibile, id est subiecto est unum. Et dicit loco quia diversae potentiae inveniuntur in diversis partibus corporis organa habere.
          <td>607. Then, at ‘Therefore what’, he suggests the following solution. That which perceives the difference between mutually exclusive objects does so simultaneously and is numerically indivisible, i.e. it is one as a subject of actions; but in its essence, and therefore to thought, it is divided. So, then, it is in one way an indivisible subject which perceives ‘divided’, i.e. distinct objects; but in another way, the percipient subject is itself divisible, inasmuch as in essence, and to thought, it is divisible-even while it does not cease to be locally and numerically one indivisible subject of actions. He says ‘locally’ referring to the fact that different faculties are found in different parts of the body.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi aut non improbat hanc solutionem; dicens, quod non est possibile illam praedictam solutionem stare. Quod enim est idem et indivisibile subiecto, sed non secundum esse, idest secundum rationem, potest quidem habere contraria secundum potentiam; sed quod habet contraria in operari, id est secundum actum, oportet quod sit divisibile. Et impossibile est idem et indivisibile, simul et semel esse album et nigrum. Quare neque possibile est aliquod unum et idem indivisibile, simul pati species eorum; et ita neque intelligere et sentire, si intelligere et sentire est huiusmodi, id est pati quoddam.
          <td>608. Thirdly, at ‘But this is not possible’, he rejects this solution: because if a thing really is a self-identical and indivisible subject, even if it is not so in thought, it can indeed be in potency to diverse movements, but once it is actually ‘in activity’ or moving, it cannot do so in mutually exclusive ways; for this implies a real divisibility. One and the same indivisible thing cannot be white and black at the same time in the same respect; nor, for the same reason, can it receive simultaneous impressions from white and black objects. And the same is true of understanding and sensing, if these are a kind of reception of impressions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quarto ibi sed sicut ponit veram solutionem; et solutio ista sumitur ex similitudine puncti. Punctum enim quod est inter duas partes lineae, potest accipi ut unum et ut duo. Ut unum quidem, secundum quod continuat partes lineae ut communis terminus. Ut duo autem, secundum quod bis utimur puncto, id est ut principio unius lineae, et ut fine alterius. Sic etiam intelligendum est, quia vis sentiendi diffunditur in organa quinque sensuum ab aliqua una radice communi, a qua procedit vis sentiendi in omnia organa, ad quam etiam terminantur omnes immutationes singulorum organorum: quae potest considerari dupliciter. Uno modo prout est principium unum et terminus unus omnium sensibilium immutationum. Alio modo, prout est principium et terminus huius et illius sensus. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod sicut punctum est unum aut duo, sic divisibile est, inquantum simul bis utitur eodem signo id est principio sensitivo, scilicet ut principio et termino visus et auditus.
          <td>609. Fourthly, at ‘But it is just as’, he gives the true solution, using the simile of a point. Any point between the two ends of a line can be regarded either ‘as one or two’. It is one as continuing the parts of the line that lie on either side of it, and so forming the term common to both. It is two inasmuch as we use it twice over, to terminate one part and begin the other. Now sensitivity flows to the organs of all the five senses from one common root, to which in turn are transmitted, and in which are terminated, an the sensations occurring in each particular organ. And this common root can be regarded from two points of view: either as the common root and term of all sensitivity, or as the root and term of this or that sense in particular. Hence, what he means is that just as a point, under a certain aspect, is not one only but also two, or divisible, so the principle of sensitivity, if regarded as the root and term of seeing and of hearing, appears twice over under the same name, and in this way it is divisible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Inquantum igitur aliquis utitur principio sensitivo, quasi uno termino pro duobus, intantum duo iudicat, et separata sunt quae accipiuntur, sicut in separato idest divisibili principio cognoscuntur inquantum vero est unus in se, sicut in uno principio cognoscit differentiam utriusque, et simul. Habet igitur hoc principium sensitivum commune, quod simul cognoscat plura, inquantum accipitur bis, ut terminus duarum immutationum sensibilium; inquantum vero est unum, iudicare potest differentiam unius ad alterum.
          <td>610. In so far then as this single principle receives and ‘takes account of two distinct’ and separate ‘objects’, these are known ‘as in a separate’, i.e. as by a divisible ‘principle’ of knowledge; ‘but in so far as’ it is single in itself it is able to know these objects and their differences together and simultaneously. It is a common sensitive principle, aware of several objects at once because it terminates several organically distinct sensations; and as such its functions are separate. But just because it is one in itself it discerns the difference between these sensations.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Oportet autem illud principium sensitivum commune habere aliud organum, quia pars sensitiva non habet aliquam operationem sine organo. Cum enim organum tactus diffundatur per totum corpus, necessarium videtur, ut ibi sit organum huius principii sensitivi communis, ubi est prima radix organi tactus. Et propter hoc superius dixit, quod si caro esset ultimum organum tactus, quod tangendo secundum carnem, discerneremus unum sensibile ab alio.
          <td>611. Now all sensuous activity being organic, this common sensitive principle must have its organ; and since the organ of touch is all over the body it would seem to follow that, wherever the ultimate root of the organ of touch may be, there also is the organ of the common sensitive principle. It was with this in mind that Aristotle has said, that if flesh were the fundamental organ of touch, we should discriminate between various sense-objects by merely touching things with our flesh.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est etiam, quod licet hoc principium commune immutetur a sensu proprio, quia ad sensum communem perveniunt immutationes omnium sensuum propriorum, sicut ad communem terminum; non tamen sensus proprius est nobilior quam sensus communis, licet movens sit nobilius moto, et agens patiente; sicut nec sensibile exterius est nobilius quam sensus proprius, licet moveat ipsum. Est enim secundum quid nobilius, scilicet inquantum est actu album vel dulce, ad quod est sensus proprius in potentia. Sed sensus proprius simpliciter est nobilior propter virtutem sensitivam, unde et nobiliori modo recipit sine materia: omne enim recipiens aliquid, recipit illud secundum suum modum. Et sic sensus communis nobiliori modo recipit quam sensus proprius, propter hoc quod virtus sensitiva consideratur in sensu communi ut in radice, et minus divisa. Neque oportet, quod per aliquam actionem sensus communis species recepta in organo fiat in ipso: quia omnes potentiae partis sensitivae, sunt passivae; nec est possibile, quod una potentia sit activa et passiva.
          <td>612. We may note also that though this common principle is set in motion by the particular senses, all the impressions of which are transmitted to it as to their common term, this does not imply that the particular senses are nobler than the common sense; though certainly a mover or agent is, as such, nobler than what it moves or acts upon. Nor is the exterior sensible object nobler, strictly speaking, than the particular sense moved by it, though it is in a way nobler as having actually the white or sweet quality which the senses have only potentially; but of the two the sense is strictly the nobler thing, and this in virtue of sensitivity itself—hence in receiving the object immaterially it ennobles it, for things received take, as such, the mode of being of the receiver. And the common sense receives its object in a still nobler way because it lies at the very root of sensitivity, where this power has its point of greatest unity. Yet we must not suppose that the common sense appropriates actively the impressions received in the sense-organs; all sensitive potencies are passive; and no potency can be both active and passive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est etiam, quod sensus proprius habet discernere inter contraria sensibilia, inquantum proprius participat aliquid de virtute sensus communis, quia et ipse sensus proprius est unus terminus diversarum immutationum, quae fiunt per medium a contrariis sensibilibus. Sed ultimum iudicium et ultima discretio pertinet ad sensum communem.
          <td>613. Observe too that each particular sense is able to discriminate between contrary sense-objects in virtue of its share in the power of the ‘common sense’; each is one of the terminal points for the various influences which reach us from mutually exclusive exterior sense-objects through a medium. But the final judgement and discrimination belong to the ‘common sense’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo autem epilogando concludit, quod dictum est de principio, secundum quod dicitur animal esse sensitivum, vel potens sentire.
          <td>64. Concluding, he says that he has now discussed the principle according to which an animal is said to have, or be able to have, sensations.

          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit, quod duae operationes, de quibus dubium videbatur, percipere scilicet actus sensuum propriorum, et discernere inter sensibilia diversorum sensuum, non excedunt facultatem principii sensitivi, nunc vult inquirere, utrum sapere et intelligere excedant facultatem principii. Circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod sapere et intelligere, non pertinent ad sensum: quod est ostendere, sensum et intellectum non esse idem subiecto. Secundo, quod phantasia, quae pertinet ad sensum, non est idem cum opinione, quae pertinet ad intellectum, ibi, phantasia autem et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ponit opinionem ponentium sensum et intellectum esse idem. Secundo improbat eam, ibi, et tamen oportuit. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ponit opinionem. Secundo assignat causam opinionis, ibi, omnes enim hi. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ponit opinionem in communi. Secundo inducit quaedam verba quorumdam philosophorum, quae ad illud pertinere videntur, ibi, et antiquis sapere.
          <td>615. After showing that to perceive the acts of the particular senses, and to discriminate between their various objects, are activities not beyond the range of sensitivity as a whole, the Philosopher now addresses himself to the question whether rational judgement and understanding are beyond its range. And he does two things here: first, he proves that rational judgement and understanding are not activities of sense, which is the same as to show that sense and intellect are distinct faculties; secondly, at ‘For imagination is other etc.’, he shows that the image-forming faculty, which is a kind of sense, is other than the power to form opinions, which pertains to reason. The former argument subdivides into (1) a statement of the theory of the identity of sense and intellect, and (2) a refutation of this theory. To the statement itself he adds an explanation of the origin of this theory, and also some remarks of certain philosophers, which seemed relevant.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod quia antiqui philosophi definiebant animam secundum duo, scilicet secundum motum secundum locum, et cognitionem, quae includit intellectivam discretionem et sensum: videtur hoc, quod secundum eorum opinionem intelligere et sapere sit quoddam sentire: quia tam sentiendo quam intelligendo anima iudicat et cognoscit.
          <td>616. First, then, he says that as the early philosophers defined the soul especially in terms of local motion and knowledge—which includes rational discernment and sensation—it would seem to have been their view that understanding and judging were the same sort of activity as sensing; for in both there is discernment and knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et antiqui ostendit, quod non solum hoc sequitur ex hoc quod in communi dicebant; sed expresse antiqui dixerunt, quod idem sit sapere per intellectum et sentire. Ut autem intelligantur verba philosophorum, quae inducuntur, quomodo ad propositum faciunt, considerandum est, quod nullum corpus potest directe agere in id quod nullo modo est corporeum. Quia igitur potentiae sensitivae aliquo modo sunt corporeae, quia sunt virtutes in corporis organis, immutari possunt ex actione corporum caelestium; per accidens tamen, quia neque anima neque animae virtus movetur nisi per accidens moto corpore. Et propter hoc contingit, quod ex impressione corporis caelestis variatur et phantasia, et appetitus sensitivus. Unde et animalia irrationalia, quae solo appetitu sensitivo aguntur in suis motibus, ut plurimum insequuntur impressiones corporum caelestium. Ponere igitur, quod corpora caelestia habeant impressionem directe in partem intellectivam quantum ad intellectum et voluntatem, est ponere quod voluntas et intellectus sunt virtutes corporeae. Et hoc sonant verba quorumdam philosophorum antiquorum.
          <td>617. Next, where he says ‘The early philosophers’, he shows that this is more than a mere inference from their general teaching, and that they explicitly taught that sensation and rational understanding were identically the same. But in order to understand the words which he quotes here of these philosophers, and their relevance to the present argument, we have to consider that no body can act directly upon what is purely incorporeal. Now the sense-faculties are in part corporeal, because of the bodily organs in which they exist. Therefore they are subject to the influence of the heavenly bodies,—though, even so, only indirectly, for neither the soul itself nor any of its powers is directly subject to the action of corporeal matter. Consequently, the imagination and sense-appetite are modified in various ways by the influence of the heavenly bodies. Brute animals are generally governed by this influence, since they are led entirely by their senses. Hence to suppose that heavenly bodies act directly upon the intellect and will is to admit that these faculties are corporeal. And this is what some of the early philosophers seem to have said.

          <td>Dicit enim Empedocles quod tam in hominibus, quam in aliis animalibus, voluntas augetur, idest incitatur ad agendum ad praesens, scilicet secundum praesentis horae dispositionem, quae quidem dispositio dependet ex dispositione corporum caelestium. Unde praesens tempus vel hora eis idest hominibus, et aliis animalibus praestat semper sapere altera. Diversis enim horis et temporibus, diversa diversimode homo et alia animalia inveniuntur iudicare de rebus.
          <td>618. Empedocles, for instance, said that in man, no less than in other animals, the ‘will is increased’, i.e. prompted to act, ‘in the present moment’, i.e. according to its time-context; which itself depends on the disposition of the stars. It is the present moment that ‘always affords them’, i.e. to men and the other animals ‘new objects of knowledge’; for all the animals, men included, envisage things differently at different times.

          <td>Et ad idem pertinet illud verbum Homeri. Talis enim est intellectus in terrenis hominibus, qualem pater virorumque deorumque, idest sol, ducit in diem. Dicitur autem sol pater virorum, quia est aliqua causa humanae generationis. Homo enim generat hominem et sol. Dicitur autem pater deorum, vel propter corpora caelestia, quae antiqui deos appellabant, quae secundum astrologos quodammodo a sole regulantur, vel propter homines, quos deificari credebant, qui virtute solis generantur. Virtus autem solis est in die, quia in die nobis apparet, dum movetur in superiori hemisphaerio, unde et ab astrologis dicitur planeta diurnus. Voluit ergo Homerus dicere, quod homines terreni intellectum sortiuntur ex actione solis, et quod secundum diversitatem motus, et situs, et aspectus solaris, diversimode se habent in intelligendo.
          <td>619. To the same effect Homer speaks of the mind of mortal man being ‘such as the father of gods and men’ (i.e. the sun) ‘brings into light’. He calls the sun the ‘father of men’ because of the part it plays in human procreation; for man is born from man and the sun. And the sun he calls the ‘father of gods’, either following the old view that made gods of the other stars which, the astronomers tell us, are governed somehow by the sun, or following the view that certain men are divine because generated by solar influence. And the sun is, of course, strongest in the daytime while it is visible and is moving across the upper hemisphere; hence the name of ‘day planet’ given it by astronomers. So what Homer is saying is that the sun is the cause of understanding in men, and that their knowledge of things varies with the movement, situation and appearance of the sun.

Sed quia hic versus Homeri non erat notus apud Latinos, Boetius totum posuit.
          <td>620. In point of fact Aristotle quotes only the beginning of Homer’s line; neither the Greek text nor the Arabic gives us the rest of it. Aristotle relies on his readers remembering the whole of it from a part, as when one quotes the first words of a well-known verse of any author. But Boethius cites the whole of Homer’s line, for the sake of his Latin readers who were not familiar with that poet.

Indirecte vero impressio corporum caelestium potest pertingere ad intellectum vel voluntatem, prout intellectus et voluntas coniunguntur in sua operatione virtutibus sensitivis. Laeso enim organo phantasiae, impeditur intellectus in sua operatione; et ex appetitu sensitivo inclinatur voluntas ad volendum vel nolendum aliquid. Quia tamen voluntas non ex necessitate trahitur appetitu sensitivo, sed semper ei liberum manet sequi inclinationem appetitus sensitivi, vel non sequi; ideo corpora caelestia nullam necessitatem humanis actibus inducunt.
          <td>621. What has been said, then, makes it quite clear that if the stars do have a direct influence on the intellect and will, then there is no difference between the intellect and the senses. There is no difficulty, however, about admitting an indirect stellar influence upon intellect and will, in so far as these faculties act in conjunction with the faculties of sense. Thus any injury to the bodily organ of the imagination will impede the intellect; and the will is incited towards choosing or not choosing by sensuous desire. But since the will is never drawn of necessity, but remains free to follow or not the promptings of desire, human actions are never completely determined by astral influences.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit omnes enim ostendit causam positionis. Manifestum est enim quod remota differentia, qua aliqua abinvicem differunt, remanent idem; sicut si rationale auferatur ab homine, remanebit de numero irrationabilium animalium. Haec autem est differentia, qua differt cognitio intellectiva a sensitiva, quod sentire est aliquid corporeum. Non enim operatio sensus est sine organo corporali. Intelligere autem non est aliquid corporeum; quia operatio intellectus non est per organum corporeum, ut infra ostendetur. Ideo ergo antiqui ponebant sensum et intellectum, idem esse, quia opinabantur quod intelligere esset aliquid corporeum sicut et sentire.
          <td>622. Next, he states the reason why this opinion arose. If you take away that by which things differ, they are left the same; and if rationality is removed from man he is left simply an animal. Now the difference between intellectual and sensuous cognition is that the latter is corporeal. Sensation cannot occur apart from the act of a bodily organ, whereas understanding, as we shall prove later, does not take place by means of such an organ. But to the early philosophers understanding seemed a corporeal action like sensation; hence they supposed that intellect and sense were the same.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quomodo autem utrumque ponerent aliquid corporeum, consequenter ostendit per hoc, quod ponebant tam sapere secundum intellectum quam sentire, contingere per virtutem similitudinis, sicut in primo libro dictum est. Et intelligebant similitudinem secundum esse corporeum, puta quod per terram cognoscitur terra, et per aquam aqua, et sic de aliis. Unde sequebatur quod sentire et intelligere consequerentur naturam corpoream, et eodem modo. Et sic sentire et intelligere sequitur esse idem.
          <td>623. And how they thought of both activities as corporeal he next explains, I saying that they maintained that the acts of discernment in both intellect and sensation arose from the presence of a likeness of an object (as it was said in Book I) in the knowing subject; and they thought this likeness was essentially corporeal, so that earth was known by earth and water by water, and so on with other objects. And consequently, sensing and understanding were both conceived of as functions of corporeal nature, and therefore as fundamentally the same.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et tamen improbat praedictam positionem. Et primo quantum ad causam. Secundo quantum ad ipsam positionem, ibi, quod quidem igitur. Dicit ergo primo, quod philosophi assignantes causam cognitionis esse similitudinem cognoscentis ad cognitum, debuerunt assignare aliquam causam etiam deceptionis; quia deceptio videtur esse magis propria animalibus quam cognitio secundum conditionem suae naturae. Videmus enim quod homines ex seipsis decipi possunt et errare. Ad hoc autem quod veritatem cognoscant, oportet quod ab aliis doceantur. Et iterum pluri tempore anima est in deceptione quam in cognitione veritatis; quia ad cognitionem veritatis vix pervenitur post studium longi temporis. Et haec quidem ratio efficax est contra antiquos philosophos, qui ponebant cognitionem inesse animae ex sui natura, quasi anima ex hoc quod constituta est ex principiis, habeat quod non solum sit in potentia ad cognoscibilia, sed quod sit actu cognoscens.
          <td>624. He goes on now, at ‘But they ought’, to criticise this opinion, first with regard to the premise on which it depends, ,and then at ‘therefore it is evident’, directly in itself. So he remarks, first, that the philosophers who explained knowledge by the presence of a likeness should have also given some explanation of error; for error seems to be even more natural to animals, as they actually are, than knowledge. For experience proves that people easily deceive and delude themselves, whilst to come to true knowledge they need to be taught by others, Again, the soul is involved in error for a longer time than it spends in knowing truth, for to acquire this knowledge even a long course of study hardly suffices. (Now this argument is indeed valid against those early philosophers who regarded knowledge as natural to the soul in the sense that the soul, being constituted of the first principles of things, knew all that could be known, and knew it actually, not merely in potency.)
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Potest autem ad hoc dupliciter responderi. Uno modo, ut dicatur, quod antiqui philosophi non credebant aliquam deceptionem esse. Ponebant enim quod omnia quae videntur, sunt vera ut supra dictum est. Et ideo non oportebat, quod assignarent causam deceptionis.
          <td>625. But Aristotle’s objection might be answered in two ways. One might say that since the early thinkers did not admit the existence of error (their view being, as we have seen, that all that seemed to be true was true) they did not need to explain error.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alio modo potest responderi, quod ex hoc ipso, quod dicebant causam cognitionis esse ex hoc quod anima tangit id quod est sibi simile, datur intelligi quod causa deceptionis sit haec quod anima tangit sibi dissimile. Hoc est ergo quod concludit, quod quia antiqui philosophi non assignaverunt causam deceptionis animae, necesse est, quod aut omnia, quae videntur, vera sint, ut quidam dixerunt, aut quod tactus, quo anima tangit rem dissimilem, sit deceptionis causa. Tangere enim dissimile videtur esse contrarium ad cognoscere sibi simile.
          <td>626. Secondly, it might be answered that to explain knowledge as a contact of the soul with what is like itself is implicitly to explain error as the soul’s contact with what is unlike itself. Hence, from the fact that the early thinkers did not explicitly render an account of error, he infers that either they identified truth with appearances, or that they held that the soul went astray into error by touching things unlike itself; since to touch the unlike seems the opposite of knowing the like.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primum autem reprobatum est in quarto metaphysicae.
          <td>627. The first alternative is refuted in Book IV of the <i>Metaphysics</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde procedit ad inquirendum secundum, cum dicit videtur autem manifestum est enim, quod dissimile et simile sunt contraria: sed circa contraria eodem modo se habet homo ad cognitionem et deceptionem; quia qui cognoscit unum contrariorum, cognoscit et aliud et qui errat in uno, errat in alio. Et hoc est quod dicit quod scientia et deceptio videtur eadem esse contrariorum. Non ergo est possibile, quod tactus rei similis sit causa verae cognitionis, et tactus rei dissimilis sit causa deceptionis, quia tunc esset scientia de uno contrariorum, et deceptio de alio.
          <td>628. So he proceeds to examine the second alternative, at ‘it would appear’. The like and the unlike are obviously contraries. But in knowledge and in error the relation to either of two contraries is the same: if you know one, you know the other; if you err about one, you err about the other. Hence he says that knowledge and error are apparently the same with respect to contraries. It follows that touching a like thing cannot cause true knowledge if touching an unlike thing causes error; for in that case one would know one of a pair of opposites and be mistaken about the other.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod quidem improbat positionem, ostendens, quod neque sapere neque intelligere est idem, quod sentire: haec enim duo intellectivae cognitioni attribuuntur. Intellectus enim habet iudicare, et hoc dicitur sapere et apprehendere, et hoc dicitur intelligere. Primo ergo ostendit, quod sentire non sit idem quod sapere, tali ratione. Sentire inest omnibus animalibus; sapere autem non inest omnibus, sed paucis; ergo sapere non est idem quod sentire. Dicit autem quod sapere inest paucis animalium, et non quod insit solis hominibus, quia etiam quaedam animalia participant aliquid prudentiae et aliquid sapientiae, scilicet quod recte iudicant de agendis per aestimationem naturalem.
          <td>629. Then, at ‘Now it should be evident’ he attacks the theory in question directly, and shows that neither rational judgement nor understanding is the same as sensing; they belong to intellectual knowledge. Now the intellect as judging is said to have wisdom, whilst as apprehending it is said to understand. Showing therefore that rational judgement and sensation differ, he argues thus: sensation belongs to all animals, but wisdom is found in only a few; therefore they differ. And he allows wise judgement to ‘a few animals’, and not exclusively to man, because even certain brute animals have a sort of prudence or wisdom, in that they instinctively form correct judgements on what they need to do.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi sed neque probat quod intelligere non sit idem quod sentire, per duo media. Quorum primum tale est. Intelligere contingit recte et non recte. Recte quidem contingit intelligere secundum scientiam, quae est speculabilium et necessariorum, vel secundum prudentiam, quae est recta ratio contingentium agibilium, vel secundum opinionem veram, quae se habet ad utrumque, et non determinate ad alterum oppositorum, sicut scientia et prudentia, sed ad unum, cum formidine alterius. Non recte autem contingit intelligere, secundum eorum contraria, idest secundum falsam scientiam, et secundum imprudentiam et secundum opinionem falsam. Sentire autem non contingit nisi recte, quia sensus circa propria sensibilia semper verus est; ergo sentire et intelligere non sunt idem.
          <td>630. Secondly, at ‘Nor again’, he shows the difference between understanding and sensation; and this in two ways; the first being as follows. Understanding may be ‘correct or ‘incorrect’. ‘Correct’ understanding bears either upon speculative and necessary truths, and then it is called scientific; or upon a right ordering of practical action in the sphere of the contingent, and then it is part of prudence; or upon one of two alternatives, but without deciding finally in favour of this one, and while still admitting that the other might be the truth; in which. case it forms a reasonable opinion. ‘Incorrect’ understanding is in each case the opposite of correct understanding; it results in spurious science or imprudent decisions or foolish opinions. Sensation, on the other hand, can only be ‘correct’, for the senses are infallible with respect to their proper objects. Therefore sensation and understanding are different.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia posset aliquis dicere quod recte intelligere sit idem quod sentire, ideo adiungit aliud medium ad hoc excludendum, quod tale sentire inest omnibus animalibus intelligere autem non, sed solis illis, quibus inest ratio, scilicet hominibus, qui per inquisitionem rationis, apprehensionem veritatis intelligibilis consequuntur: quamvis substantiae separatae, quae sunt altioris intellectus, statim absque inquisitione veritatem intelligant: ergo et recte intelligere non idem est quod sentire.
          <td>631. And since it might be objected that ‘correct’ understanding, at least, is the same as sensation, he adds that sensation is found in ‘all animals’ whilst understanding is found only in rational animals, that is, in men. For it is proper to man to come to an understanding of intelligible truth by way of rational enquiry; whereas the immaterial substances, which are in a higher degree intellectual, apprehend truth immediately without having to reason about it. Therefore ‘correct’ understanding is not the same as sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit phantasia enim ostendit quod opinio, quae sequitur intellectum, sit aliud a phantasia, quae sequitur sensum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod phantasia non est opinio. Secundo inquirit quid sit phantasia, ibi, de eo autem quod est intelligere. Circa primum tria facit. Primo proponit quod intendit: et dicit, quod ex hoc etiam apparet quod sensus et intellectus differunt, quia phantasia aliud est a sensu et ab intellectu, et tamen phantasia non fit sine sensu, quia consequitur sensum, ut postea dicetur, et sine phantasia non fit opinio. Ita enim videtur se habere phantasia ad sensum, sicut opinio ad intellectum. In rebus autem sensibilibus, cum aliquid sentimus, asserimus sic esse. Cum autem secundum phantasiam aliquid videtur, non asserimus sic esse, sed sic videri vel apparere nobis. A visione enim vel apparitione sumitur nomen phantasiae, ut infra dicetur. Et similiter circa intelligibilia, cum aliquid intelligimus asserimus sic esse. Cum autem opinamur, dicimus sic videri, vel apparere nobis. Sicut enim intelligere requirit sensum, ita et opinari requirit phantasiam.
          <td>632. Next, when he says ‘For imagination’, he shows the difference between opinion, which is of the intellect, and imagining, which is of the senses. And here he does two things: first, he shows that imagining is not opinion; then he studies the nature of imagining, at ‘Concerning understanding’. The former subdivides into three parts. First he states his aim, saying that another way to grasp the difference between sense and intellect is to consider that imagining differs from both, yet presupposes sensation (as will be shown later), and itself is presupposed by opinion. For it seems that, as imagining is to the senses, so is opinion to the intellect. When we sense any sensible object we affirm that it is such and such; but when we imagine anything we make no such affirmation, we merely state that such and such seems or appears to us. The word ‘imagining’ itself is taken from seeing or appearing. Similarly, when we understand an intelligible object we affirm that it is such and such; but when we form opinions, we say that such and such seems or appears to us. For, as understanding depends upon sensing, so opinion depends on imagining.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi quod autem probat quod non sit idem opinio et phantasia, duabus rationibus; quarum prima talis est. Passio phantasiae est in nobis cum volumus, quia in potestate nostra est formare aliquid, quasi apparens ante oculos nostros, ut montes aureos, vel quicquid volumus, sicut patet de illis qui recordantur, et formant sibi idola eorum quae sibi videntur ad votum. Sed opinari non est in potestate nostra; quia necesse est, quod opinans habeat rationem, per quam opinetur, vel verum vel falsum; ergo opinio non est idem quod phantasia.
          <td>633. In the second place, at ‘It is evident’, he proves by two arguments the difference between opinion and imagination. The first is this. Images can arise in us at will, for it is in our power to make things appear, as it were, before our eyes-golden mountains, for instance, or anything else we please, as people do when they recall past experiences and form them at will into imaginary pictures. But we are not free to form opinions as we please; one cannot form an opinion without resting it on some reason, true or false. Therefore opinion is not the same as imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit cum dicit amplius autem quae talis est. Opinionem statim sequitur passio in appetitu; quia cum opinamur aliquid esse grave vel terribile, statim compatimur tristando vel timendo. Et similiter si sit aliquid confidendum, idest de quo aliquis debeat confidere et sperare, statim sequitur spes vel gaudium. Sed ad phantasiam non sequitur passio in appetitu; quia dum aliquid apparet nobis secundum phantasiam, similiter nos habemus, ac si consideremus in pictura aliqua terribilia vel sperabilia; ergo opinio non est idem quod phantasia.
          <td>634. The second argument at ‘Further, when’ is this. Opinion has an immediate effect on our affective nature; so soon as we opine that anything is disagreeable or frightening we feel sad or frightened. So also if anything is thought of as encouraging or promising, we at once feel hopeful or glad. But it is not so with imagining; for so long as anything appears merely imaginatively to us, it is as if we were merely looking at pictures of frightening or encouraging objects. Therefore opinion differs from imagining.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Huius autem differentiae ratio est, quia appetitus non patitur neque movetur ad simplicem apprehensionem rei, qualem proponit phantasia. Sed oportet quod apprehendatur sub ratione boni vel mali, convenientis vel nocivi. Et hoc facit opinio in hominibus, componendo vel dividendo, dum opinatur hoc esse terribile vel malum, illud autem esse sperabile vel bonum. Phantasia autem non componit neque dividit. Patitur tamen appetitus animalium ab aestimatione naturali, quae hoc operatur in eis, quod opinio in hominibus.
          <td>635. Now the cause of this difference is that our affective nature is not impressed or swayed by the mere vision of things brought about by imagining; but only by things regarded as good or evil, useful or harmful; and this, in man, presupposes opinion with its positive or negative judgements as to the evil and terrible or the desirable and encouraging. Mere imagining passes no judgement on things. In brute animals, however, the affective power is swayed by natural instinct; which plays the same part in them as opinion in man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi sunt autem dicit quod cum ad intellectualem acceptionem multa pertineant, scilicet scientia, prudentia, opinio et contraria horum, de horum differentia non est hic agendum, sed alibi, scilicet in sexto Ethicorum.
          <td>636. Thirdly, at ‘There are, besides’, he remarks that of the many forms of intellectual judgement, such as science, prudence and opinion, with their contraries, he does not intend to treat here. They are dealt with elsewhere, in the <i>Ethics</i> , Book VI.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit quod phantasia non est opinio, incipit inquirere quid sit. Et primo dicit de quo est intentio. Secundo prosequitur, ibi, si igitur phantasia. Dicit ergo primo, quod cum ostensum sit quod intelligere est aliud quam sentire, et ad unum horum pertineat opinio, scilicet ad intellectum, ad aliud autem phantasia, scilicet ad sensum; postquam determinatum est de sensu, dicendum est de phantasia; ut sic postmodum determinetur de altero, scilicet de intellectu et opinione.
          <td>637. After saying that imagination is not the same as opinion he begins to examine it in itself, first stating the question to be treated before proceeding with it at ‘If then’. We have seen, he says, that understanding differs from sensation, and that opinion is akin to the former, but imagining to the latter; and now, having finished with the senses, it will be convenient to discuss imagination before tackling the quite distinct problems touching the intellect and opinion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit si igitur prosequitur intentum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod phantasia non est aliqua potentiarum vel habituum manifestorum, qui discernunt vel iudicant verum et falsum. Secundo ostendit quid sit, ibi, sed quoniam accidit motus. Circa primum tria facit. Primo distinguit potentias et habitus, quibus aliquid discernitur. Secundo ostendit, quod phantasia non est aliquid horum, ibi, quod quidem igitur non sit sensus. Tertio ostendit quod non est aliquid compositum ex eis, ibi, manifestum igitur quoniam.
          <td>638. Then, at ‘If then’, he begins to treat of imagination, and this in two main sections, first proving that the imagination is not to be numbered among those cognitive powers or dispositions by which we discriminate truth from falsehood, or judge things to be true or false; and then, at ‘But since it can happen’, explaining what in fact the imagination is. The former section subdivides into three. To begin with, he enumerates our various powers or modes of discernment; secondly, he shows that imagination is not one of these, and thirdly, that it is not even a combination of any of them—this part beginning at ‘It is therefore evident’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod cum phantasia sit, secundum quam dicitur nobis fieri aliquod phantasma, idest aliquid apparibile, nisi forte accipiamus phantasmata metaphorice, necesse videtur quod sit aliquid de numero habituum vel potentiarum cognoscitivarum, quibus discernitur unum ab alio, aut quibus circa aliquid dicimus verum vel falsum, hoc est erramus vel non erramus. Nam apparere est aliquid discernere et dicere verum vel falsum. Potentiae autem vel habitus quibus discernimus, et dicimus verum et falsum, videntur esse hi quatuor: sensus, intellectus, opinio et scientia. Unde videtur quod phantasia sit aliquid horum quatuor.
          <td>First, then, he observes that if it is through imagination that we become conscious of phantasms or appearances (unless the term ‘phantasm’ is taken metaphorically) imagination would seem to be one of those cognitive dispositions or powers by which things are perceived together with their differences, or are judged according to this or that aspect, truly or falsely, i.e. with a correct or erroneous judgement. (Not that the appearance itself is the same as this discerning or judging.) Now there seem to be four powers or dispositions from which such discernment or judgement proceeds: sense, understanding, opinion and scientific knowledge. Imagination, then, is apparently one of these four.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ponit autem haec quatuor, quasi iam nota. Alia autem, quae ad cognitionem videntur pertinere, nondum erant suo tempore per certitudinem scita. Ipse autem iam superius distinxit intellectum a sensu. Unde praeter sensum connumerat tria alia; scilicet intellectum, opinionem et scientiam. Et videtur quod intellectus non accipiatur hic pro potentia; sic enim contra intellectum non dividerentur scientia et opinio, quae ad potentiam intellectivam pertinent: sed intellectus accipitur pro certa apprehensione eorum quae absque inquisitione nobis innotescunt, sicut sunt prima principia. Scientia vero pro cognitione eorum, de quibus certificamur per certitudinem vel investigationem rationis. Opinio autem pro cognitione eorum de quibus certum iudicium non habemus.
          <td>639. Aristotle mentions these four as being already familiar. Other factors (as they seem to be) in cognition were still, at the time he was writing, not defined with certainty. But having already, distinguished sensation from the intellect, he can enumerate here three factors distinct from sense: understanding, opinion and scientific knowledge. Nor is he, apparently, speaking of the understanding as a faculty (i.e. of the intellect); else it would not be set apart from science and opinion, which both belong to it as a faculty. But ‘understanding’ means here an infallible, immediate and intuitive grasp of such intelligible objects as the first principles of knowledge; while ‘scientific knowledge’ means certain knowledge obtained by rational investigation; and ‘opinion I means a knowing that falls short of scientific certainty.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde etiam dicit quod phantasia est habitus vel potentia de numero eorum, ad ostendendum quod inter haec, aliquid est ut potentia, et aliquid ut habitus. Cognoscere autem possumus quod haec tantum apprehensionis principia apud antiquos nota erant, ex positione Platonis superius in primo libro posita, qui solum haec quatuor ad numeros reduxit, tribuens intellectum uni, scientiam dualitati, opinionem ternario, sensum quaternario.
          <td>640. And in calling imagination one of these ‘dispositions or powers’ he implies that the cognitive factors here mentioned are either habits or powers. As to these four factors being the only principles of cognition known to the early philosophers, our evidence is the theory of Plato who reduced only these four to numbers—understanding to 1, science to 2, opinion to 3, sense to 4.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod igitur ostendit quod phantasia non est aliquid dictorum. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit quod non sit sensus. Secundo quod non sit intellectus, sive scientia, ibi, at vero neque semper. Tertio quod non sit opinio, ibi, relinquitur. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ostendit quod phantasia non sit sensus, neque secundum potentiam, neque secundum actum: et ratio est talis. Dormiens aliquid phantasiatur: hoc autem non fit secundum sensum in potentia, quia sensui in potentia existenti, nihil apparet: nec secundum sensum in actu, quia in somno non est sensus in actu; ergo phantasia non est sensus in potentia, neque sensus in actu.
          <td>641. Next, when he says ‘That it is not’, he distinguishes imagination from all the above four: first of all from sensation, then from understanding and science, and, finally from opinion. As to sensation, he begins by proving that imagination is not one of the senses, either potentially or actually. For imagination is active during sleep. This cannot be due to any sense as in potency, in which state the senses are aware of nothing at all; nor to any sense as in act, for in sleep the senses are not in act. Therefore imagination is neither a sense in potency nor a sense in act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi postea secundum ostendit quod phantasia non sit sensus in potentia: et est ratio talis. Sensus in potentia semper adest animali, phantasia autem non semper, cum non semper animali aliquid appareat; ergo phantasia non est sensus in potentia.
          <td>642. Then, at ‘Further etc.’, he argues as follows to show that imagination is not a sense in potency. The latter is always found in animals, but imagination, which implies an awareness of appearances, is sometimes lacking. Therefore...
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi si vero ostendit quod phantasia non sit sensus secundum actum, quatuor rationibus. Quarum prima talis est. Sensus secundum actum conveniunt omnibus bestiis, idest animalibus irrationalibus. Si igitur phantasia esset idem quod sensus in actu, sequeretur quod inesset omnibus animalibus irrationalibus. Hoc autem non est verum; non enim inest formicae aut api, aut vermi: ergo phantasia non est sensus secundum actum.
          <td>643. Then, at ‘But if etc.’, he gives four reasons for distinguishing imagination from the senses as in act. (1) Sense as in act is found in all animals, i.e. irrational animals; so that if it were the same as imagination, this would be found in all irrational animals, which in fact is not true; for neither ants, nor bees, nor worms have imagination. Therefore...
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est autem quod omnia animalia habent quodammodo phantasiam; sed animalia imperfecta habent phantasiam indeterminatam, sicut infra dicet philosophus. Sed hoc non videtur verum de formica et ape, in quarum operatione plurimum prudentiae apparet. Sed sciendum est quod opera prudentiae, formica et apis operantur naturali inclinatione, non ex hoc quod habeant phantasiam determinatam et distinctam a sensu: non enim phantasiantur aliquid, nisi dum moventur a sensibili. Quod autem operantur propter finem, quasi providentes in futurum, non contingit ex hoc quod habeant aliquam imaginationem ipsius futuri; sed imaginantur actus praesentes, qui ordinantur ad finem ex naturali inclinatione magis quam ex apprehensione. Illa autem animalia dicit philosophus phantasiam habere, quibus aliquid secundum phantasiam apparet, etiam dum non actu sentitur.
          <td>644. But note that all animals have imagination in some sense of the term; but the lower animals have it indeterminately, as Aristotle will explain later. And if ants and bees seem to differ in this respect from the rest of the lower animals, through their apparent exercise of a great deal of intelligence, the truth is, nevertheless, that ants and bees behave so cleverly, not because they are aware of definite images distinct from exterior sensations, but by a natural instinct; for they only imagine so long as they are actually receiving sensible impressions. Their purposeful and, as it were, provident activities do not arise from any image of what is going to happen in the future; their present activities alone are represented inwardly to them, and it is a natural instinct rather than any distinct apprehension which orders these activities to an end. On the other hand, says Aristotle, those animals have imagination in the precise sense of the term which retain a distinct image of things even while they are not actually sensing things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi postea hi quae talis est. Sensus secundum actum semper sunt veri; non enim sensus decipitur circa proprium sensibile: sed phantasiae ut plurimum sunt falsae. Non enim respondet imaginationi ut plurimum; ergo phantasia non est sensus secundum actum.
          <td>645. (2) This argument begins at ‘Again, sensations’. The senses in the act of sensing are always truthful; they cannot err about their proper objects. But phantasms are very often deceptive, when there is nothing real that corresponds to them. Therefore the imagination is distinct from every sense as in act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi amplius autem quae est talis. Cum operamur cum certitudine circa sensibile actu, scilicet ipsum sentiendo, non dicimus quod hoc videtur nobis homo, sed magis hoc dicimus cum non manifeste sentimus, sicut cum a remotis aliquid videmus, vel cum videmus aliquid in tenebris. Et tunc sensus secundum actum, aut est verus, aut est falsus. Circa sensibile enim per accidens, cuiusmodi sensibile est homo, non semper sensus est verus, sed quandoque decipitur. Addit autem hoc ut ostendat convenientiam inter sensum non manifestum, et phantasiam, quae etiam quandoque est vera, quandoque falsa est. Cum autem manifeste aliquid phantasiamur, dicimus quod hoc videtur nobis homo, et quod non per certitudinem sit homo; ergo phantasia non est idem quod sensus in actu.
          <td>646. (3) This argument comes at ‘Again, we do not say’. When, we are moved by an actual sense-experience to act immediately and without hesitation, we never say e.g. ‘That seems to us a man’. We are more likely to speak thus when we are uncertain, as when we see things at a distance or in the dark. And in these cases the actual sensation is either true or false. For the senses (whatever sense it is which makes us aware of a man) are indeed sometimes deceived as to their indirect object. He adds this in order to show the affinity between imagination, which can also be either truthful or deceptive, and obscure sensations. But as soon as we are sure that we are only imagining, we say ‘it appears to be a man’, and that we do not know for certain that it is a man. Therefore imagination is distinct from any sense as in act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit ibi et quod quae talis est. Phantasticae visiones apparent dormientibus. In eis autem non est sensus secundum actum; ergo phantastica visio non est sensus secundum actum.
          <td>647. (4) Again, phantasms come during sleep when the senses are not in act. Therefore a phantasm is not an actual sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero ostendit quod phantasia non sit intellectus neque scientia. Intellectus enim est primorum principiorum, et scientiarum de conclusionibus per demonstrationem acquisita, semper sunt verorum. Phantasia autem quandoque est falsa; ergo phantasia non est intellectus, neque scientia.
          <td>648. Next, when he says ‘And it is certainly’ he shows the difference between imagination and both simple understanding and science. Simple understanding bears upon first principles, and science upon demonstrated conclusions; and these are always true. But images are often false; therefore imagination is neither simple understanding nor science.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit relinquitur igitur ostendit quod phantasia non sit opinio quod magis videbatur, quia opinio etiam quandoque est falsa, sicut phantasia. Ostendit autem hoc duabus rationibus. Prima quarum talis est. Opinionem sequitur fides; non enim videtur esse conveniens, quod aliquis non credat id quod opinatur; et sic cum nulla bestia habeat fidem, nulli bestiarum inerit opinio. Sed phantasia inest multis bestiarum, ut dictum est; ergo phantasia non est opinio.
          <td>649. Then at ‘It remains’ he shows that imagination is not on (which it might seem to be, for opinion too is sometimes false) by two arguments. (1) The result of opinion is belief, if it is natural to believe in one’s opinions. If belief is not found in brute animals, this is because they have no opinions. But many brute animals, as he has said, have imagination. Therefore imagination is not opinion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi amplius omnem quae talis est. Ad omnem opinionem consequitur fides, quia unusquisque credit illud quod opinatur, ut dictum est. Sed ad fidem sequitur quod aliquis sit persuasus; ea enim credimus, quae nobis persuasa sunt. Ad persuasionem autem sequitur ratio secundum ordinem illationis, quia per aliquam rationem, aliquid alicui suadetur; ergo de primo ad ultimum, quicumque habet opinionem, habet rationem. Nulla autem bestia habet rationem, cum autem aliqua habeat phantasiam; ergo phantasia non est opinio. Et manifestum est quod haec secunda ratio inducitur ad confirmandum primam, quantum ad hoc quod prima supponebat quod nulla bestia habet fidem.
          <td>650. (2) (At, ‘Further, belief etc.’) Belief always follows opinion (as we have said) because one naturally believes in one’s opinions. And the state of being persuaded is the outcome of belief; we believe those things of which we are persuaded. Now persuasion is always accompanied by rational inference, for one must have some reason for being persuaded of anything; hence from first to last reasoning goes along with opinion. But while some brute animals have imaginations, none of them have reason. Imagination, then, is distinct from opinion. Obviously, this argument confirms what the previous one assumes, i.e. that brute animals lack belief.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit manifestum igitur ostendit quod phantasia non est aliquid compositum ex praemissis, et praecipue ex sensu et opinione, ex quibus magis posset videri esse composita. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ponit quod intendit, quasi ex praemissis concludens, quod quia phantasia neque est sensus neque opinio, manifestum propter hoc esse potest, quod phantasia, nec opinio est cum sensu, ita quod essentialiter sit opinio et habeat sensum concomitantem, neque opinio est per sensum, ita quod essentialiter sit opinio, sed et habeat sensum causantem, neque est complexio opinionis et sensus, ita quod essentialiter componatur ex utroque. Non autem addit quod non sit phantasia sensus cum opinione, quia phantasia magis videtur communicare cum opinione, quae potest esse falsa, quam cum sensu, qui est semper verus.
          <td>651. Then at ‘It is therefore evident’, he shows that imagination is not a combination of any of the factors mentioned above; and more particularly that it is not, as it might rather plausibly seem to be, a combination of sensation and opinion. And here he does three things. First, he states his conclusion, as a further inference from what has been said: that since imagination is neither one of the senses nor opinion, we can already see that it is neither opinion plus sensation—i.e. an opinion essentially, but with a concomitant sensation; nor opinion through sensation—i.e. an opinion essentially, but caused by sensation; nor a mixture of the two, as though both were of its essence. He does not say that imagination is not sensation plus opinion, because it has apparently more to do with opinion, which can be false, than with sensation which is always true.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi et manifestum ostendit qualiter oporteat accipi opinionem, si phantasia complectitur opinionem et sensum: quia enim phantasia est unius et eiusdem, manifestum est quod opinio adiuncta sensui, quae est phantasia, non est alia quaedam opinio, sed illa quae est de eodem de quo est sensus; sicut si dicamus, quod phantasia est quaedam complexio ex opinione albi, et sensu eiusdem. Non enim potest esse composita ex opinione albi et sensu boni, quia sic phantasia non esset de uno et eodem. Oportet igitur, si phantasia est ex complexione opinionis et sensus, quod apparere aliquid secundum phantasiam, nihil aliud sit quam opinari aliquid idem, quod sentitur per se, et non secundum accidens.
          <td>652. Secondly, at ‘And it is clear’, he shows what the term opinion would mean if it were true that imagination were a blend of sensation and opinion. For since an image is always of some definite thing, and of nothing else at the same time, then clearly the opinion which, conjoined to sensation, was an act of imagination, would bear simply and solely upon the one object presented to it by the sensation. It is as if one were to say, e.g. that imagination combined an opinion of whiteness and a sense of whiteness; it could not combine an opinion of whiteness and a sense of goodness; for, in that case, the object imagined would not be one and the same. Therefore, if to imagine is to combine opinion and sensation, to be aware of images is simply and solely to have as the object of one’s opinion the direct object of a sensation; not in any way the indirect object of that sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio ibi apparent autem destruit praedictam positionem tali ratione. Contingit aliquando quod aliqua falsa apparent secundum phantasiam, quae est a sensu: et de illis et de eisdem rebus, homo habet veram opinionem. Sicut secundum sensum apparet, quod sol non excedit quantitatem unius pedis, quod falsum est. Sed secundum veram opinionem creditur esse maior habitatione, idest tota terra, in qua habitamus. Si enim apparitio ipsa falsa, sit idem quod opinio cum sensu, oportet alterum duorum dicere: quorum unum est, quod in ista compositione opinionis ad sensum, aliquis abiiciat veram opinionem quam prius habebat, re opinata salvata, idest eodem modo manente; et ille qui abiicit opinionem, non sit oblitus neque quod decredat. Quod est impossibile. Istis enim tribus modis aliquis abiicit veram opinionem. Primo quando res mutatur, sicut cum aliquis vere opinatur quod Socrates sedet, eo sedente; sed postquam Socrates sedere destiterit, si retineat opinionem eamdem, vera opinio mutatur in falsam. Secundo quando desinit opinari quod prius opinabatur, propter hoc quod est pristinae opinionis oblitus. Tertio, quando desinit opinari quod prius opinabatur, quia decredit quod prius credebat, immutatur propter aliam rationem. Quod autem aliquis amittat opinionem, nullo istorum contingente, est impossibile. Quod tamen contingeret in proposito.
          <td>653. Thirdly, at ‘False appearances’, he refutes the above hypothesis. For it can happen that images derived from sensation present us with falsehoods of which, none the less, we form a true opinion. Thus our senses tell us that the sun measures only one foot across; which is false. But by our true opinion we believe that it is larger than ‘the inhabited world’, i.e. than the whole of our earth. Yet on the hypothesis that the image-appearances are only an opinion conjoined to sensation, one of two. consequences must follow. The first is that in the act of conjoining opinion and sensation we reject the true opinion which we held till then, while the thing itself, of which we form our opinion, ‘remains’, i.e. stays exactly the same; and we ourselves neither forget nor cease to be persuaded of that true opinion. But this is impossible; for there are only three ways in which a true opinion, once held, can be lost: (a) When the object itself changes,—as when we truly opine that Socrates is seated while he is seated; but if, when he ceases to sit, we retain that opinion, it changes from being a true opinion to being false; (b) When we cease to hold an opinion we once held because we forget it; and (c) When we cease to hold an opinion we once held because, for some new reason, we cease from thinking it to be true. It is impossible to lose an opinion if none of these conditions is realised; and yet this is what the first alternative involves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aliud autem quod oportet dicere, si primum non dicatur, est quod aliquis retineat cum falsa opinione, veram opinionem. Et sic si ipsa apparitio est ipsa opinio (quod necesse est ponere, si phantasia est opinio), sequitur quod eadem apparitio sit vera et falsa. Sed oportet si vera falsa facta est, et non sit vera, quod res transcendens idest transmutata ab eo quod prius erat, lateat opinantem; quia si non lateret eum, simul cum mutatione rei mutaretur opinio, et non esset eius opinio falsa. Hoc autem adiunxit ad exponendum quod prius dixerat de salvatione rei. Concludit ergo quod phantasia neque est quid praedictorum quatuor, neque est compositum ex his.
          <td>654. And there is only one other conceivable alternative; which is that the true opinion is retained along with the false one; which would mean that, since the image-appearance is identical with opinion (as it must be if imagining is opining), the same image-appearance is both true and false. And if from being true it becomes false then the ‘transformation’ of the object, i.e. its alteration from what it was before, must be hidden from him who holds the opinion; otherwise, as soon as the object altered the opinion would alter too, and thus would not be false. He adds this to explain his earlier remark, about the ‘remaining’ of the object. And his conclusion is that imagination is neither one of the aforesaid four factors in cognition, nor any combination of them.

Sensation is reliable as to whether a thing is white or not, but not as to whether it is this or that. Thirdly, there are the common qualities consequent on the accidents in which the proper qualities inhere. I mean, such as movement and dimension, which belong to sense-objects—and about these deception very easily arises in sensing. The movement derived from actual sensation differs from the sensations by which these three objects are perceived. Although the first [movement] is true, the sensation itself being present, the others can easily be false, whether sensation be present or not, and especially when the sense-object is distant. if, therefore, nothing except imagination possesses what has been described, then the statement is true, namely that imagination is a movement produced by sensation actuated. §§ 660-7

          LECTIO 6</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit quod phantasia non est aliquid illorum quatuor, quae ab antiquis ad cognitionem pertinere ponebantur, hic inquirit quid sit phantasia. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima ostendit quid sit phantasia. In secunda assignat rationem eorum, quae ad phantasiam pertinent, ibi, hoc autem accidit. Ad investigandum quid sit phantasia, hoc modo procedit. Primo enim proponit, quod si aliquid est motum, contingit quod ab eodem aliquid aliud moveatur. Ostensum est enim in octavo physicorum, quod est duplex movens: scilicet movens immobile, et movens motum, quod scilicet movet, eo quod movetur.
          <td>655. After showing that imagination is not one of those four activities into which the earlier philosophers divided knowledge, the Philosopher now asks: what is imagination in itself? And he does two things. First, he says what imagination is; secondly, he explains its properties, at ‘This happens because’. And with a view to defining imagination he lays it down that anything moved may itself move something else (recalling the argument in the <i>Physics</i> , Book VIII, where it is shown that there are two kinds of mover, one that is itself without movement, and one that moves another through being moved itself).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde ponit, quod phantasia est quidam motus. Sicuti enim sentiens movetur a sensibilibus, ita in phantasiando movetur a quibusdam apparentibus, quae dicuntur phantasmata.
          <td>656. Then he suggests that imagination is a sort of movement: that just as the sensing subject is moved by sensible objects, so, in imagining, one is moved by certain appearances called phantasms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ulterius ponit affinitatem, quam habet phantasia ad sensum, quia phantasia non potest fieri sine sensu, sed est tantum in habentibus sensum, scilicet in animalibus; et est illorum tantum quorum est sensus, scilicet illorum quae sentiuntur. Ea enim, quae sunt intelligibilia tantum, non cadunt in phantasiam.
          <td>657. Next, he suggests an affinity between the imagination and the senses, in that imagination presupposes sensation and is found only in sentient beings or animals; and further, that it bears only upon things sensed, and in no way on things purely intelligible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde proponit quod ab actu sensus contingit quemdam motum fieri. Quod quidem fit manifestum ex eo quod primo proponebatur, scilicet quod ab eo quod est motum, contingit moveri alterum. Sensus autem secundum actum fit, ex eo quod movetur a sensibilibus; unde relinquitur, quod a sensu secundum actum causetur aliquis motus. Ex quo etiam manifestum est, quia motus causatur ab actu sensus, necesse est quod sit similis sensui, quia omne agens agit simile sibi. Unde et illud, quod movet inquantum movetur, causat motum similem motui quo ipsum movetur.
          <td>658. Then he suggests that the act of sensation can give rise to a sort of movement, in accordance with the principle first laid down, that a thing moved may move another. Actual sensation is a being moved by a sensible object; and the movement of the actuated sense itself causes another movement which, as it proceeds from sensation, must resemble sensation; for every agent as such is a cause of its own likeness. And that which, being moved, moves another, must cause a motion similar to its own.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex omnibus autem his concludit, quod phantasia sit quidam motus causatus a sensu secundum actum; qui quidem motus non est sine sensu, neque potest inesse his quae non sentiunt. Quia si aliquis motus fit a sensu secundum actum, similis est motui sensus, et nihil aliud nisi phantasia invenitur esse tale. Relinquitur ergo, quod phantasia erit huiusmodi motus. Et ex hoc quod est motus causatus a sensu, similis ei, sequitur quod continget habentem phantasiam, multa agere et pati secundum eam. Et contingit esse veram et falsam, ut statim ostenditur.
          <td>659. And this leads him to the conclusion that imagination is a certain movement caused by the senses in their act of sensing. It cannot exist without sensation, nor in insentient beings. If there is any movement caused by actual sensation, it must resemble sensation, and imagining is the only activity of this kind. Hence it must be the movement in question. And, being such, it can give occasion to the imagining subject for a variety of actions and passions. And it can be either true or false, as we shall see.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit hoc autem assignat rationem eorum quae conveniunt phantasiae, per ea quae dicta sunt. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo assignat causam eius quod dixerat, quod phantasia quandoque sit vera et quandoque falsa. Secundo assignat causam huius nominis, ibi, quoniam autem visus. Tertio assignat causam eius quod dixerat, quod animalia multa agunt secundum phantasiam, ibi, et quoniam immanent.
          <td>660. Next, at ‘This happens’, he gives reasons for the characteristic properties of imagination, using the above analysis: (a) he gives a reason for his assertion that imagination is sometimes true and sometimes false; (b) he explains why it is called by this name; and (c) he explains why he said that animals are largely governed by their imaginations.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod hoc, scilicet phantasiam esse quandoque veram et quandoque falsam, accidit propter hoc quod dicetur, quia scilicet sensus, a cuius actu causatur phantasia, diversimode se habet ad veritatem, secundum quod comparatur ad diversa.
          <td>(a) First, then, he notes that the reason why imagination is sometimes true and sometimes false is implicit in the statement that its source is the act of the exterior sense; for the latter is related to truth in different ways, according to its varying relation to objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nam primo quidem circa propria sensibilia semper verus est aut modicum habet de falsitate. Sicut enim potentiae naturales non deficiunt in propriis operationibus, nisi in minori parte, propter aliquam corruptionem; sic etiam sensus non deficiunt a vero iudicio propriorum sensibilium, nisi in minori parte, propter aliquam corruptionem organi; ut apparet in febricitantibus, quibus propter indispositionem linguae dulcia amara esse videntur.
          <td>661. For, in the first place, sense-perception is always truthful with respect to its proper objects, or at least it incurs, with respect to these, the minimum of falsehood; for natural powers do not, as a general rule, fail in the activities proper to them; and if they do fail, this is due to some derangement or other. Thus only in a minority of cases do the senses judge inaccurately of their proper objects, and then only through some organic defect; e.g. when people sick with fever taste sweet things as bitter because their tongues are ill-disposed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo autem sensus est circa sensibilia per accidens; et hic iam decipitur sensus. Quod enim album sit quod videtur, non mentitur sensus; sed si album sit hoc aut illud, puta vel nix, vel farina vel aliquid huiusmodi, hic iam contingit mentiri sensum, et maxime a remotis.
          <td>662. But the senses have also their indirect objects, and with regard to these they can be deceived. What seems to be white is indeed white as the sense reports; but whether the white thing is this or that thing, is snow, e.g., or flour, is a question often answered badly by the senses, especially at a distance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertio sensus est sensibilium communium quae consequuntur subiecta in quibus sunt accidentia, quae sunt sensibilia propria; sicut magnitudo et motus, quae sunt sensibilia communia accidunt sensibilibus corporibus. Et circa huiusmodi maxime est deceptio, quia iudicium de his variatur secundum diversitatem distantiae. Nam quod a remotiori videtur, minus videtur.
          <td>663. Thirdly, there are the common sensibles’, found in things some of whose accidental qualities are ‘proper sensibles’. Thus size and movement accompany, as ‘common sensibles’, the sensible qualities of bodies. And these are very likely to give rise to error; for in their case our judgement has to adjust itself to differences of distance: things seen further away seem the smaller.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Motus autem phantasiae qui est factus ab actu sensus, differt ab istis tribus sensibus, id est actibus sensus, sicut effectus differt a causa. Et propter hoc etiam quia effectus est debilior causa, et quanto magis aliquid elongatur a primo agente, tanto minus recipit de virtute et similitudine eius; ideo in phantasia facilius adhuc quam in sensu potest incidere falsitas, quae consistit in dissimilitudine sensus ad sensibile. Tunc enim est falsus sensus quando aliter recipitur forma sensibilis in sensu, quam sit in sensibili. Et dico aliter secundum speciem, non secundum materiam; puta si sapor dulcis recipiatur in lingua secundum amaritudinem: secundum vero materiam semper aliter recipit sensus, quam habeat sensibile. Omnis igitur motus phantasiae, qui fit a motu propriorum sensibilium, est verus, ut in pluribus. Et hoc dico quantum ad praesentiam sensibilis, quando motus phantasiae est simul cum motu sensus.
          <td>664. Now the movement of imagination, being derived from the actuated senses, differs from these three types of actual sensation as an effect from its cause. Thus, just because effects, as such, are weaker than their causes, and the power and impress of an agent is less and less evident the further away are its effects, therefore imagination is even more liable than are the senses to fall into the error which arises from a dissimilarity between the sense and its object. For falsehood in the senses consists in receiving a sensible form as other than it is in the sensible object. I mean other in kind, not in point of materiality (for example, if a sweet savour is tasted on the tongue as bitter); for in point of materiality there is always a difference between the form as received in the sense and the form as existing in the object. it follows too, from what we have said, that imagination is generally truthful when it arises from the action of the ‘proper sensibles’; I mean, at least so long as the sensible object is present and the image-movement is simultaneous with the sense-movement.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quando motus phantasiae est in absentia sensus, tunc etiam circa propria sensibilia contingit decipi. Imaginatur enim quandoque absentia ut alba, licet sint nigra. Sed alii motus phantasiae, qui causantur a sensu sensibilium per accidens, et a sensu sensibilium communium, possunt esse falsi, sive sit praesens sensibile, sive non. Sed magis sunt falsi in absentia sensibilis, quam sunt quando sunt procul.
          <td>665. But when the image-movement occurs in the absence of the exterior sense-object we can be deceived, even with regard to proper sensibles. We may imagine absent black things as white. On the other hand, the image-movements arising from perception of objects indirectly sensed, or of the common-sensibles, are liable to go astray whether the exterior object be present or not; although they are the more liable to error in the object’s absence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hac autem ratione assignata, concludit ulterius principale propositum; dicens, quod si ea quae dicta sunt non conveniunt nisi phantasiae, et phantasia habet quod dictum est, relinquitur quod phantasia sit motus a sensu factus in actu.
          <td>666. From this argument he then draws a conclusion touching his main contention: namely, if the foregoing remarks are true of nothing but the imagination, and are certainly true of it, then imagination must be the movement proceeding from the actuated senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ulterius autem quod iste motus aliam potentiam requirat, quam sensitivam, Aristoteles hoc non determinat. Sed videtur quod cum secundum diversitatem actuum distinguantur potentiae, et diversitas motus requirat diversa mobilia, quia quod movetur, non movet seipsum, sed alterum, necessarium videtur quod sit alia potentia phantastica, sive imaginativa, a sensu.
          <td>667. Whether this movement also presupposes some potency other than the exterior senses, is a question which Aristotle leaves unanswered. Since, however, diverse acts imply diverse potencies, and diverse movements connote diverse receivers of movement (for the moving thing moves something other than itself, it seems necessary to posit an imaginative potency distinct from the exterior senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem assignat causam huius nominis. Circa quod sciendum est, quod phos in Graeco, idem est quod lux; et inde venit phanos quod est apparitio, vel illuminatio et phantasia. Dicit ergo quod visus est praecipuus inter alios sensus, eo quod est spiritualior, ut supra ostensum est, et plurium cognoscitivus: ideo phantasia quae causatur a sensu secundum actum, accipit nomen a lumine, sine quo non est videre, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>668. (b) Next, at ‘Since sight’, he explains the name <i>phantasia</i> . Note that <i>phos</i> is the Greek for light, whence comes <i>phanos</i> , i.e. ‘appearance’ or ‘enlightening’, and <i>phantasia</i> . He says, then, that, because sight is the principal sense, being more spiritual (as we have seen already) and knowing a wider range of objects than any other, therefore imagination, which arises from actual sensation, gets its name from light, without which nothing can be seen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et quoniam ostendit causam, quare animalia agunt et patiuntur secundum phantasiam; et dicit, quod phantasiae immanent, idest perseverant, etiam abeuntibus sensibilibus, et sunt similes sensibus secundum actum. Unde sicut sensus secundum actum movet appetitum ad praesentiam sensibilis, ita et phantasiae in absentia sensibilis. Et propter hoc dicit quod animalia multa operantur secundum phantasias. Sed hoc contingit propter defectum intellectus, quia cum intellectus adest, quia est superior, eius iudicium praevalet ad agendum.
          <td>669. (c) Then, at ‘And since these images’, he explains why the actions and passions of animals are governed by imagination. Images, he says ‘dwell within’ in the absence of sensible objects, as traces of actual sensations; therefore, just as sensations arouse appetitive impulses whilst the sensed objects are present, so do images when these are absent. And therefore images very largely determine the behaviour of animals. Nevertheless, this happens through their lack of intelligence; and where intelligence is present it is able, being a higher faculty, to make its own judgement prevail in practice.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde quando intellectus non dominatur, agunt animalia secundum phantasiam. Alia quidem, quia omnino non habent intellectum, sicut bestiae, alia vero quia habent intellectum velatum, sicut homines. Quod contingit tripliciter. Quandoque quidem ex aliqua passione irae, aut concupiscentiae, vel timoris aut aliquid huiusmodi. Quandoque autem accidit ex aliqua infirmitate, sicut patet in phreneticis vel furiosis. Quandoque autem in somno, sicut accidit in dormientibus. Ex istis enim causis contingit quod intellectus non praevalet phantasiae, unde homo sequitur apprehensionem phantasticam quasi veram.
          <td>670. Hence, so long as the intellect is not in command animals are swayed by imagination; some animals because they simply lack intelligence (the beasts), and some in so far as their intellect is veiled (men). And men may be so swayed in three ways: (a) when they fall into some passion, such as anger, desire, fear etc.; (b) when they are of unsound mind, through delirium or insanity; and (c) when they are asleep and dreaming. In these cases the intellect ceases to control the imagination, with the result that men take their imaginary representations for the truth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ultimo concludit de phantasia, quod dictum est quid sit, et quae sit eius causa.
          <td>In conclusion, he says that he has now stated what the imagination is and whence it arises.

            <td>That the impassibility of the sensitive faculty is not like that of the intellective faculty, is evident from the organs and from sensation itself. For the sense cannot receive an impression from too violent a sense-object—e.g. a sound from very great sounds, whilst from over-powerful odours there comes no smell, nor from over-strong colour any seeing. But when the intellect understands something highly intelligible, it does not understand what is inferior to these less than before, but more so. For whereas the sensitive faculty is not found apart from the body, the intellect is separate. §§ 687-99

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de parte animae sensitiva, et ostendit etiam quod sentire et intelligere non sunt idem, hic incipit determinare de parte animae intellectiva. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima determinat de parte animae intellectiva.

          <td>671. Having treated of the sensitive part of the soul, and shown that to sense and to understand are quite distinct operations, the Philosopher now turns to the intellectual part. His treatment falls into two main divisions. First, he comes to certain conclusions on the intellectual part in general; after which, from what has been concluded about sense and intellect he deduces, at ‘And now recapitulating’ [L.13, §787], some necessary consequences with regard to the soul as a whole. The former division falls into two sections: one on the intellect as such, and one comparing intellect with the senses. The latter begins at ‘And it seems that the sense-object’ [L.12 §765]. The intellect as such is first treated in itself, and then, at ‘Intelligence etc.’ [L.11 §746], in its activity. The former part then subdivides again into three parts: (a) on the potential intellect; (b) on the agent intellect [L.10 §728]; and (c) on intellect as in act [L.10 §740]. After defining the potential intellect, he determines its object [L.8 §705], and then adduces an objection [L.9 §720]. The definition of potential intellect involves explanations (1) of its nature, and (ii) of the way it proceeds into act [L.8 §700]. And as to its nature, he first states the problems he is attempting to solve; after which, at ‘For if understanding is like sensing’ [§675], he propounds his own view.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo, quod postquam determinatum est de parte animae sensitiva, et ostensum est quod sapere et intelligere non est idem quod sentire, considerandum est nunc de parte animae qua cognoscit anima, idest intelligit, et sapit. Supra autem dictum est, quod differentia est inter sapere et intelligere. Nam sapere pertinet ad iudicium intellectus, intelligere autem ad eius apprehensionem.
          <td>672. So he says that, having dealt ‘With the sensitive part of the soul, and shown that judgement and understanding differ from sensation, it is now time to discuss that part of the soul ‘by which it knows’, i.e. understands, and ‘is wise’. We have already distinguished between being wise and understanding; to be wise pertains to intellectual judgement, to understand pertains to intellectual apprehension.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Circa hanc autem partem aliquid est quod praetermittit, de quo erat apud antiquos dubium. Utrum scilicet haec pars animae sit separabilis ab aliis partibus animae subiecto, sive non sit separabilis subiecto, sed ratione tantum. Intelligit autem esse separabile subiecto, per hoc quod dicit esse separabile secundum magnitudinem, propter Platonem, qui ponens partes animae subiecto abinvicem separatas, attribuit eis organa in diversis partibus corporis. Hoc est ergo quod praetermittit.
          <td>673. At this point an old problem emerges (which Aristotle for the time being sets aside), namely whether this part of the soul is a really separate being, distinct from the other parts, or is merely separable in thought. He refers to the former alternative when he speaks of being ‘spatially’ separable, and he uses this expression because Plato, who thought of the soul’s parts as really distinct entities, associated the latter with different organs of the body. This problem Aristotle sets aside.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed duo sunt quae inquirere intendit. Quorum primum est. Si sit separabilis secundum rationem haec pars animae ab aliis, quam differentiam habet ab aliis. Et quia proprietas potentiae ex qualitate actus cognoscitur. Secundum quod inquirere intendit est quomodo sit ipsum intelligere, idest quomodo operatio intellectualis compleatur.
          <td>674. And he keeps two ends in view. One is to examine how this part of the soul differs from the others, if it can be separated from them in thought. And, as potencies are known from their acts, his second aim is to examine the act of understanding itself, i.e. how intellectual activity is completed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit si igitur ostendit propositum. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo proponit similitudinem intellectus ad sensum. Secundo ex huiusmodi similitudine concludit naturam intellectus possibilis, ibi, necesse est itaque. Tertio ostendit, ex his quae de intellectu probaverat, differentiam inter intellectum et sensum, ibi, quoniam autem non similis.
          <td>675. Next, at ‘For if understanding’, he sets down his own view in three stages: (1) he suggests a similarity between intellect and sense; (2) whence he argues, at ‘It is also necessary’, to a conclusion touching the nature of the potential intellect; (3) whence in turn he deduces a difference between intellect and sense, at ‘That the impassibility’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Primo igitur ex huiusmodi suppositione procedit ad propositum ostendendum quod intelligere est simile ei quod est sentire. Quae quidem similitudo ex hoc manifesta est, quod sicut sentire est quoddam cognoscere, et sentimus quandoque quidem in potentia, quandoque autem in actu, sic et intelligere cognoscere quoddam est; et quandoque quidem intelligimus in potentia, et quandoque in actu. Ex hoc autem sequitur quod, cum sentire sit quoddam pati a sensibili, aut aliquid simile passioni, quod intelligere sit vel pati aliquid ab intelligibili, vel aliquid alterum huiusmodi, simile scilicet passioni.
          <td>First of all then, as a preliminary to the statement of his own theory, he suggests that the acts of understanding and of sensing are similar, in that, just as sensing is a kind of knowing, and as it may be either potential or actual, so understanding is a kind of knowing which may be either potential or actual. Whence it follows that, as sensing is a certain state of being passive to a sensible object (something like a passion in the strict sense of the term) so understanding is either a being passive to an intelligible object, or something else that resembles passion, in the strict sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Horum autem duorum secundum verius est. Nam sentire, ut supra in secundo dictum est, non proprie pati est. Patitur enim proprie aliquid a contrario. Sed aliquid habet simile passioni, inquantum sensus est in potentia ad sensibile, et est susceptivus sensibilium. Ergo, si intelligere est simile ei quod est sentire; et partem intellectivam oportet esse impassibilem, passione proprie accepta; sed oportet quod habeat aliquid simile passibilitati: quia oportet huiusmodi partem esse susceptivam speciei intelligibilis, et quod sit in potentia ad huiusmodi speciem, sed non sit hoc in actu. Et sic oportet, quod sicut se habet sensitivum ad sensibilia, similiter se habeat intellectivum ad intelligibilia; quia utrumque est in potentia ad suum obiectum, et est susceptivum eius.
          <td>676. Of these alternatives the second is the more likely to be true. For even sensing, as we have seen, is not strictly a being passive to anything—for this, strictly, involves an object of a nature contrary to the passive subject. Yet sensing resembles a passion inasmuch as the sense is potential with respect to its object; for it receives sensible impressions. So far then as our understanding resembles sensation the intellect too will be impassible (taking passivity in the strict sense), yet will it show some likeness to what is passive, in its receptivity to intelligible ideas; for these it possesses only potentially, not actually. Thus, as sensitive life is to sensible objects, so is the intellect to intelligible objects, each being potential with respect to its object and able to receive that object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit necesse est ex praemissis ostendit naturam intellectus possibilis. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod intellectus possibilis non est aliquid corporeum, vel commixtum ex rebus corporalibus. Secundo ostendit quod non habet organum corporale, ibi, unde neque misceri est. Considerandum est ergo circa primum, quod antiqui de intellectu dupliciter opinati sunt. Quidam enim posuerunt, quod intellectus erat compositus ex principiis omnium ad hoc quod cognosceret omnia; et hanc supra dixit esse opinionem Empedoclis. Anaxagoras vero dixit intellectum esse simplicem et immixtum, et nulli rerum corporalium habere aliquid commune. Ex eo ergo quod dictum est, quod intellectus non est actu intelligens, sed potentia tantum, concludit quod necesse est intellectum, propter hoc quod intelligit omnia in potentia, non esse mixtum ex rebus corporalibus, sicut Empedocles posuit, sed esse immixtum sicut dixit Anaxagoras.
          <td>677. Then at ‘It is also necessary’ he proceeds to deduce the nature of the potential intellect. First he shows that this intellect is not a bodily thing nor compounded of bodily things; and then, at ‘Hence it is a reasonable’ that it has no bodily organ. As to the first point, we should note that there used to be two opinions about the intellect. Some—and this, as we have seen, was the view of Empedocles—thought that intellect was a composition of all the principles of things, and that this explained its universal knowledge. On the other hand Anaxagoras thought it was simple and pure and detached from all bodily things. And therefore, precisely because the intellect, as he has just said, is not in act of understanding, but in potency only, and in potency to know everything, Aristotle argues that it cannot be compounded of bodily things, as Empedocles thought, but must be separate from such things, as Anaxagoras thought.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quidem Anaxagoras hoc dixit hac ratione motus, quia posuit intellectum esse principium totius motus a quo omnia moventur secundum eius imperium. Si autem esset mixtus ex naturis corporalibus, vel haberet aliquam earum determinate, non posset omnia movere suo imperio, quia determinaretur ad unum. Et hoc est quod dicit quod Anaxagoras posuit intellectum esse immixtum ut imperet, id est ut suo imperio omnia moveat.
          <td>678. Now the reason why Anaxagoras thought this was that he regarded intellect as the principle that dominated and initiated all movement; which it could not be if it were either a composition of bodily things or identified with any one of such things; for in these cases it would be restricted to one course of action only. Hence Aristotle’s observation that, in Anaxagoras’ view, the intellect was detached ‘so that it might command’ and, commanding, initiate all movement.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia nos nunc non loquimur de intellectu, qui omnia movet, sed de intellectu quo anima intelligit, illud medium non est opportunum ad ostendendum intellectum esse immixtum; sed oportet aliud medium accipere ad illud ostendendum, ex hoc scilicet quod intellectus omnia cognoscit: et hoc est quod addit hoc autem est ut cognoscat: quasi dicat: sicut Anaxagoras posuit intellectum esse immixtum ad hoc ut imperet, ita oportet nos ponere intellectum esse immixtum ad hoc ut cognoscat.
          <td>679. But, since we are not concerned at present with the all-moving Mind, but with the mind by which the soul understands, we require a different middle term to prove that the intellect is unmixed with bodily things; and this we find in its universal knowledge. That is why Aristotle adds ‘That it might know’, as if to say: as Anaxagoras maintained that intellect was unmixed because it commands, so we have to maintain that it is unmixed because it knows.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod quidem tali ratione apparet. Omne enim, quod est in potentia ad aliquid et receptivum eius, caret eo ad quod est in potentia, et cuius est receptivum; sicut pupilla, quae est in potentia ad colores, et est receptiva ipsorum, est carens omni colore: sed intellectus noster sic intelligit intelligibilia, quod est in potentia ad ea et susceptivus eorum, sicut sensus sensibilium: ergo caret omnibus illis rebus quas natus est intelligere. Cum igitur intellectus noster natus sit intelligere omnes res sensibiles et corporales, necesse est quod careat omni natura corporali, sicut sensus visus caret omni colore, propter hoc quod est cognoscitivus coloris. Si enim haberet aliquem colorem, ille color prohiberet videre alios colores. Sicut lingua febricitantis, quae habet aliquem humorem amarum, non potest recipere dulcem saporem. Sic etiam intellectus si haberet aliquam naturam determinatam, illa natura connaturalis sibi prohiberet eum a cognitione aliarum naturarum. Et hoc est quod dicit: intus apparens enim prohibebit cognoscere extraneum et obstruet, idest impediet intellectum, et quodammodo velabit et concludet ab inspectione aliorum. Et appellat intus apparens aliquid intrinsecum connaturale intellectui, quod dum ei apparet, semper impeditur intellectus ab intelligendo alia: sicut si diceremus quod humor amarus esset intus apparens linguae febricitantis.
          <td>680. The following argument may make this point clear. Anything that is in potency with respect to an object, and able to receive it into itself, is, as such, without that object; thus the pupil of the eye, being potential to colours and able to receive them, is itself colourless. But our intellect is so related to the objects it understands that it is in potency with respect to them, and capable of being affected by them (as sense is related to sensible objects). Therefore it must itself lack all those things which of its nature it understands. Since then it naturally understands all sensible and bodily things, it must be lacking in every bodily nature; just as the sense of sight, being able to know colour, lacks all colour. If sight itself had any particular colour, this colour would prevent it from seeing other colours, just as the tongue of a feverish man, being coated with a bitter moisture, cannot taste anything sweet. In the same way then, if the intellect were restricted to any particular nature, this connatural restriction would prevent it from knowing other natures. Hence he says: ‘What appeared inwardly would prevent and impede’ (its knowledge of) ‘what was without’; i.e. it would get in the way of the intellect, and veil it so to say, and prevent it from inspecting other things. He calls ‘the inwardly appearing’ whatever might be supposed to be intrinsic and co-natural to the intellect and which, so long as it ‘appeared’ therein would necessarily prevent the understanding of anything else; rather as we might say that the bitter moisture was an ‘inwardly appearing’ factor in a fevered tongue.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Concludit autem ex hoc quod non contingit naturam intellectus esse neque unam, idest nullam determinatam, sed hanc solam naturam habet, quod est possibilis respectu omnium. Et hoc quidem contingit intellectui, quia non est cognoscitivus tantum unius generis sensibilium, sicut visus vel auditus, vel omnium qualitatum et accidentium sensibilium communium vel propriorum; sed universaliter totius naturae sensibilis. Unde sicut visus caret quodam genere sensibilium, ita oportet quod intellectus careat tota natura sensibili.
          <td>681. From this he concludes, not that in fact the nature of the intellect is ‘not one’, i.e. that it has no definite nature at all; but that its nature is simply to be open to all things; and that it is so inasmuch as it is capable of knowing, not (like sight or hearing) merely one ‘particular class of sensible objects, nor even all sensible accidents and qualities (whether these be common or proper sense-objects) but quite generally the whole of sensible nature; Therefore, just as the faculty of sight is by nature free from one class of sensible objects, so must the intellect be entirely free from all sensible natures.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex hoc autem ulterius concludit, quod ille, qui vocatur intellectus animae, nihil est in actu eorum, quae sunt ante intelligere: quod est contrarium ei quod antiqui ponebant. Dicebant enim eum ad hoc quod cognosceret omnia, esse compositum ex omnibus. Si autem esset cognoscitivus omnium quia haberet in se omnia, esset semper intellectus in actu et nunquam in potentia: sicut supra dixit de sensu, quod si esset compositus ex sensibilibus, non indigeret sensibilibus exterioribus ad sentiendum.
          <td>682. He concludes further that what we call our intellect is not in act with respect to real beings until it actually understands. This is contrary to the early philosophers’ principle that intellect must be compounded of all things if it can know all things. But if it knew all things, as containing them all in itself already, it would be an ever-actual intellect, and never merely in potency. In the same way he has remarked already of the senses, that if they were intrinsically made up of the objects they perceive, their perceptions would not presuppose any exterior sensible objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ne quis crederet, quod esset hoc verum de quolibet intellectu, quod sit in potentia ad sua intelligibilia, antequam intelligat; interponit quod nunc loquitur de intellectu quo anima opinatur et intelligit. Et hoc dicit, ut praeservet se ab intellectu divino, qui non est in potentia, sed est quodammodo intellectus omnium. De quo intellectu Anaxagoras dixit, quod est immixtus ut imperet.
          <td>683. And lest anyone should suppose this to be true of any and every intellect, that it is in potency to its objects before it knows them, he adds that he is speaking here of the intellect by which the soul understands and forms opinions. Thus he excludes from this context the Mind of God, which, far from being potential, is a certain actual understanding of all things, and of which Anaxagoras said that it could command all because it was perfectly unmixed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit unde neque ostendit quod intellectus non habet organum corporale. Et primo ostendit propositum. Secundo adaptat ad hoc quoddam dictum antiquorum, ibi, et bene iam. Dicit ergo primo, concludens ex praedictis, quod si intellectus noster, ad hoc quod cognoscat omnia, oportet quod non habeat naturam aliquam determinatam ex naturis rerum corporalium quas cognoscit, eodem modo rationabile est quod non misceatur corpori, idest quod non habeat aliquod organum corporale, sicut habet pars animae sensitiva: quia si erit aliquod organum corporale intellectui, sicut est parti sensitivae, sequetur quod habeat aliquam naturam determinatam ex naturis rerum sensibilium. Et hoc est quod dicit qualis enim aliquis utique fiet, idest aliquam qualitatem sensibilem habens, ut scilicet sit actu calidus aut frigidus. Manifestum est enim quod potentia animae, quae est actus alicuius organi, conformatur illi organo, sicut actus susceptibilis.
          <td>684. Next, at ‘Hence it is a reasonable’, he shows that the intellect has no bodily organ; and then, at ‘They spoke to the point’, approves a saying of the early philosophers. First, then, he concludes from what has been said, that if the mind’s universal capacity for knowledge implies its intrinsic distinction from all the corporeal natures that it knows, for the same reason it can be argued that the mind is not ‘involved in the body’, i.e. that it has no bodily organ, as the sensitive part of the soul has. For if the intellect had, like the sensitive part, a bodily organ, it would necessarily be just one particular sensible nature among many. Therefore he says ‘some quality’ etc., meaning that a nature of this kind would have some particular sensible quality such as actual heat or cold; for it is obvious that, if the soul acts through a bodily organ, the soul itself must correspond to that organ as being in potency to its act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Neque refert quantum ad actum potentiae, utrum ipsa potentia habeat aliquam qualitatem sensibilem determinatam aut organum, cum actus non potentiae sit solum, sed compositi ex potentia et organo corporeo. Similiter enim impeditur visio oculorum, si potentia visiva haberet colorem determinatum sive pupilla. Et ideo dicit quod eiusdem rationis est ponere quod intellectus non habeat organum corporale, et quod non habeat aliquam naturam corpoream determinatam. Et ideo subdit quod nullum est organum intellectivae partis sicut est sensitivae.
          <td>685. It makes no difference to the act of the potency whether it is the potency itself that has a particular sensible quality or the organ, since the act is not of the potency alone but of potency and organ together. In the same way sight would be impeded if it were the visual potency, not the pupil of the eye, that was coloured. So he says that it comes to the same to maintain that intellect has no bodily organ and that it has no particular bodily nature; and concludes that the intellectual part of the soul, unlike the sensitive, has no bodily organ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et bene adaptat quod dictum est, opinioni antiquorum; et dicit, quod ex quo pars intellectiva non habet organum sicut pars sensitiva, iam potest verificari dictum illorum, qui dixerunt, quod anima est locus specierum: quod per similitudinem dicitur, eo quod est specierum receptiva. Quod quidem non verum esset, si quaelibet pars animae haberet organum; quia iam species non reciperentur in anima sola, sed in coniuncto. Non enim visus solum est susceptivus specierum, sed oculus: et ideo non dicendum est, quod tota anima sit locus specierum, sed solum pars intellectiva, quae organum non habet. Nec ita est locus specierum, quod habeat actu species, sed potentia tantum.
          <td>686. Next, where he says ‘And they spoke to the point’, he relates his view to an opinion of the early philosophers, saying that, granted intellect’s lack of a bodily organ, we can see the point of. the old saying that the soul is the ‘place’ of forms,—meaning that it receives these into itself. Now this saying would be false if every part of the soul had its bodily organ, for then the forms would be received into the composition of soul and body, not into the soul alone; for it is not sight that receives visible forms, but the eye. It follows that the soul as a whole is not the ‘place’ of forms, but only that part of it which lacks a bodily organ, i.e. the intellect; and even this part does not, as such, possess them actually, but potentially only.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod autem ostendit differentiam inter intellectum et sensum quantum ad impassibilitatem. Dictum est enim supra, quod sicut sentire non est pati passione proprie accepta, ita nec intelligere. Et ex hoc supra conclusit, quod intellectus erat impassibilis. Ne ergo aliquis crederet, quod in eodem gradu impassibilitatis esset sensus et intellectus, subiungit hoc, quod non est similis impassibilitas sensitivi et intellectivi. Sensus enim licet non patiatur a sensibili, passione proprie accepta, patitur tamen per accidens, inquantum organi proportio corrumpitur ab excellenti sensibili. Sed de intellectu hoc accidere non potest, cum organo careat; unde nec per se nec per accidens passibilis est.
          <td>687. Then, at ‘That the impassibility’, he shows how the intellect and the senses differ with respect to impassibility. He has already observed that neither sensation nor understanding is a passion in the precise sense of a state of being passively affected; whence he had inferred that the intellect was impassible. But, lest it be supposed that sense and intellect were impassible in the same degree, he now distinguishes them in this respect. Though the senses as such are not, strictly speaking, passively affected by their objects, they are <i>indirectly</i> so affected, inasmuch as the equilibrium of the sense-organ is disturbed by any excess in its object. But the same is not true of the intellect, since it has no organ; it is therefore neither directly nor indirectly passible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc est quod dicit, quod dissimilitudo impassibilitatis sensitivi et intellectivi manifesta est ex organo et sensu, quia sensus efficitur impotens ad sentiendum ex valde sensibili, sicut auditus non potest audire sonum propter hoc quod motus est ex magnis sonis, neque visus potest videre, neque olfactus odorare ex eo quod hi sensus moti sunt prius ex fortibus odoribus et coloribus corrumpentibus organum. Sed intellectus, quia non habet organum corporeum, quod corrumpi possit ob excellentiam proprii obiecti, cum intelligit aliquid valde intelligibile, non minus postea intelligit infima, sed magis: et idem accideret de sensu, si non haberet organum corporale. Debilitatur tamen intellectus ex laesione alicuius organi corporalis indirecte, inquantum ad eius operationem requiritur operatio sensus habentis organum. Causa igitur diversitatis est, quia sensitivum non est sine corpore, sed intellectus est separatus.
          <td>688. This is what he means when he proceeds to say that the dissimilarity between sense and intellect in point of passibility appears from the organs and from sensation. For a very strong sense-object can stun the faculty of sense. One can be deafened by great sounds, blinded by strong colours, made powerless to smell anything by over-powering odours; and this because the organ in each case is injured. But since the intellect has no organ that could be injured by an excess of its appropriate object, its activity is not, in fact, weakened by a great intelligibility in its object; indeed it is rather strengthened thereby; and the same would be true of the senses, if they could exist without bodily organs. All the same, an injury to an organ of the body may indirectly weaken the intellect, in so far as the latter’s activity presupposes sensation. The cause, then, of the difference is that sensitivity acts in the body, but the intellect acts on its own.

          <td>Ex his autem, quae dicuntur, apparet falsitas opinionis illorum qui dixerunt, quod intellectus est vis imaginativa, vel aliqua praeparatio in natura humana, consequens corporis complexionem. Sed horum occasione verborum, quidam intantum decepti sunt ut ponerent intellectum possibilem esse a corpore separatum, sicut una de substantiis separatis. Quod quidem omnino impossibile est.
          <td>689. All this goes to show the falsity of the opinion that intellect is the same as imagination, or as anything else in our nature that depends on the body’s constitution. On the other hand, this same text has been, for some, an occasion of falling into the error of regarding the intellectual power as quite separated from the body, as a substance that exists on its own. Which is an utterly indefensible position.

          <td>Manifestum est enim, quod hic homo intelligit. Si enim hoc negetur, tunc dicens hanc opinionem non intelligit aliquid, et ideo non est audiendus: si autem intelligit oportet quod aliquo formaliter intelligat. Hic autem est intellectus possibilis, de quo philosophus dicit: dico autem intellectum quo intelligit et opinatur anima. Intellectus ergo possibilis est, quo hic homo, formaliter loquendo, intelligit. Illud autem, quo aliquid operatur, sicut activo principio, potest secundum esse separari ab eo quod operatur: ut si dicamus, quod balivus operatur per regem, quia rex movet eum ad operandum. Sed impossibile est illud, quo aliquid operatur formaliter, separari ab eo secundum esse. Quod ideo est, quia nihil agit nisi secundum quod est actu. Sic igitur aliquid formaliter operatur per aliquid, si cum eo sit actu. Non autem fit aliquid cum aliquo ens actu, si sit separatum ab eo secundum esse. Unde impossibile est quod illud, quo aliquid agit formaliter, sit separatum ab eo secundum esse.
          <td>690. For it is clear that the actually intelligent being is this particular man. Whoever denies this implies that he himself understands nothing; and therefore that one need pay no attention to what he says. But if he does understand anything he must do so in virtue of some principle in him of this particular activity of understanding; which is the intellectual power (as potential) to which the Philosopher refers when he says: ‘I mean that mind by which the soul understands and forms opinions’. The potential intellect then is precisely that by which this particular man understands. Now that in virtue of which, as a principle of activity, an agent acts may certainly exist in separation from the agent; as e.g. a king and his bailiff have separate existence, though the latter acts only as moved by the king. But it is quite impossible for the agent to exist separately from that by which, formally and immediately, he is an agent; and this because action only proceeds from an agent in ,so far as the latter is in a state of actuality. It follows that the agent and the proper and immediate principle of his activity must exist together in one act; which could not be if they were separate beings. Hence the impossibility of a separation in being of an agent from its formal principle of activity.

Sic igitur dicunt intellectum possibilem copulari nobiscum per formam suam.
          <td>691 With this truth in mind, those who maintained the opinion to which I refer tried to think out some way of so linking up and uniting the separated substance, which for them was the intellectual potency, with ourselves, as to identify its act of understanding with out own. They said then that the form of the potential intellect, that by which it is brought into act, was the intelligible idea; and that the subject possessed of this idea was a kind of phantasm produced by ourselves. In this way, they said, the potential intellect is linked with us through its form.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc quod dictum est, nullam omnino continuationem intellectus ad nos demonstrat: quod sic patet. Intellectus enim possibilis non est unum cum intelligibili, nisi secundum quod intellectus est in actu; sicut neque sensus est idem cum sensibili in potentia, ut supra habitum est. Species igitur intelligibilis non est forma intellectus possibilis, nisi secundum quod est intelligibilis actu: non est autem intelligibilis actu, nisi secundum quod est a phantasmatibus abstracta et remota. Manifestum est igitur, quod secundum quod unitur intellectui, est remota a phantasmatibus. Non igitur intellectus per hoc unitur nobiscum.
          <td>§692. But this theory entirely fails to prove any continuity between the intellect and ourselves. For the intellectual power is only united with an intelligible object in the degree that it is in act; just as we have seen that the senses cannot unite with their appropriate objects so long as these remain in potency. Therefore the intelligible idea cannot be the form of the intellectual power until it is actually understood; and this cannot happen until it is disengaged from phantasms by abstraction. Hence, precisely in the degree that it is joined to the intellect it is removed from phantasms. Not in this way therefore could an intellectual power be united with us.

Manifestum est autem quod hic incidit fallacia accidentis: quia species intelligibilis secundum quod est unum cum intellectu possibili, est abstracta a phantasmatibus, ut dictum est.
          <td>693. And obviously the upholder of this view was led astray by a <i>fallacia accidentis</i> . For his argument comes to this: phantasms are somehow united to intelligible ideas, and these to the potential intellect; and therefore the latter is united to the phantasms. But, as I say, it is clear that, in the degree that the intelligible idea is one with the intellectual power, it is abstracted from phantasms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dato tamen quod per hunc modum sit aliqua unio intellectus possibilis ad nos, non tamen haec unio faceret nos intelligentes, sed magis intellectos.

Non enim per hoc quod species quae est in pupilla, est similitudo coloris qui est in pariete, color est videns, sed magis est visus. Per hoc igitur quod species intelligibilis, quae est in intellectu possibili, est similitudo quaedam phantasmatum, non sequitur quod nos sumus intelligentes, sed quod nos, vel potius phantasmata nostra sint intellecta ab illa substantia separata.
          <td>694. But even granted that between the intellectual power and ourselves there existed some such union as this view supposes, it would not in fact cause us to understand, but rather to be understood. If the eye contains a likeness of a coloured. wall, this does not cause the colour to see, but, on the contrary, to be seen. Therefore if the intelligible idea in the intellect is a sort of likeness of our phantasms, it does not follow that we perceive anything intellectually, but rather that we-or more precisely our phantasms-are understood by that separated intellectual substance.

          <td>695. Many other criticisms might be urged, such as I have set out in more detail elsewhere. Enough to note for the present that the. theory in question is an implicit denial of the existence of thinking in the human individual.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum etiam est quod haec positio contra intentionem philosophi est. Et primo quidem, quia philosophus hic inquirit de parte animae. Sic enim hunc tractatum incipit. Unde manifestum est quod intellectus possibilis pars animae est, et non substantia separata.
          <td>696. Furthermore, it is also clearly contrary to the teaching of Aristotle. First, because he has explicitly said (at the beginning of the treatise) that the subject matter of his enquiry is a part of the soul, not any separated substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item ex hoc quod ipse procedit ad inquirendum de intellectu, sive sit subiecto separabilis ab aliis partibus animae, sive non. Unde patet quod suus processus stat, etiam si intellectus subiecto non sit separabilis ab aliis partibus animae.
          <td>697. Moreover, he has set out to examine the intellect leaving aside the question whether it is a being distinct from the rest of the soul; so that even if it be not distinct in this way, that does not affect his argument.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Item per hoc quod dicit quod intellectus est quo anima intelligit. Haec enim omnia ostendunt quod Aristoteles non dicit intellectum esse separatum sicut sunt substantiae separatae.
          <td>698. Again, Aristotle calls the intellect that by which the soul understands. All these indications show that he did not assert that the intellect was a separate substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Mirum est autem quomodo tam leviter erraverunt, ex hoc quod dicit quod intellectus est separatus, cum ex litera sua huius rei habeatur intellectus, dicit enim separatus intellectus, quia non habet organum, sicut sensus. Et hoc contingit propter hoc, quia anima humana propter suam nobilitatem supergreditur facultatem materiae corporalis, et non potest totaliter includi ab ea. Unde remanet ei aliqua actio, in qua materia corporalis non communicat. Et propter hoc potentia eius ad hanc actionem non habet organum corporale, et sic est intellectus separatus.
          <td>699. Indeed it is astonishing how easily some have let themselves be deceived by his calling the intellect ‘separate’; for the text itself makes it perfectly clear what he means,—namely that, unlike the senses, the intellect has no bodily organ. For the nobility of the human soul transcends the scope and limits of bodily matter. Hence it enjoys a certain activity in which bodily matter has no share; the potentiality to which activity is without a bodily organ; and in this sense only is it a ‘separate’ intellect.

For flesh is not separable from matter; it is like the snub of a nose, one, [thing] existing in the other. There is discerned therefore by the sensitive faculty what is hot, what is cold, and anything else of which the flesh is a certain ratio.

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de intellectu possibili, qui est in potentia ad intelligibilia, hic ostendit quomodo in actum reducatur. Et primo ostendit quod intellectus aliquando fit in actu. Secundo ostendit quid sit proprium obiectum eius respectu cuius fit in actu, ibi, quoniam autem aliud est magnitudo.
          <td>700. Having reached certain conclusions about the intellect as potential with respect to intelligible objects, the Philosopher now goes on to show how it is actualised. And first he shows that it is actualised intermittently; and then, at ‘Now as dimension’, what is the precise object of its actualisation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ostendit igitur, quomodo intellectus in actum reducatur, dicens: dictum est, quod anima intellectiva non est actu ipsae species, sed in potentia tantum, cum autem sic fiat singula, idest sic reducatur in actum specierum intelligibilium, quemadmodum sciens, idest habens scientiae habitum, habet species in actu, et tunc dicitur intellectus qui est secundum actum. Hoc autem accidit, statim, cum aliquis potest per seipsum operari operatione intellectus, quae est ipsum intelligere: sicut et quamlibet formam tunc aliquis in actu habet, quando potest operationem illius formae explere.
          <td>He explains how the intellect is actualised thus. The intellectual soul is, we have said, only in potency to its ideas at first. ‘But when it becomes particular objects’, i.e. when the mind reaches the degree of actual apprehension of intelligibles that is found in the knowledge habitually possessed by a man of science, then it can already be called an intellect in act; and that degree is reached as soon as one is capable of producing, on one’s own initiative, the intellectual activity called understanding. For the actual possession of any form is coincident with the ability to act accordingly.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed licet tunc intellectus quodammodo sit in actu, quando habet species intelligibiles, sicut sciens habet habitum; est tamen et tunc quodammodo in potentia, non tamen eodem modo sicut prius erat in potentia, antequam scientiam acquireret, addiscendo vel inveniendo. Nam antequam haberet habitum scientiae, qui est primus actus, non poterat operari cum vellet; sed oportebat, quod ab altero reduceretur in actum; sed quando iam habet habitum scientiae, qui est actus primus, potest, cum voluerit, procedere in actum secundum qui est operatio.
          <td>701. Yet though a mind is already, in a way, in act when it has intelligible notions in the manner of one who possesses a science habitually, none the less the mind then is still, in a way, in potency; though not in the same way as it was before it acquired the science, either by being taught it or by its own unaided efforts. Before it acquired the habit of a science—which is its first state of actuality—it could not actualise itself at will, it needed to be brought into act by the mind of another; but once such a habit is acquired, the intellect has the power to bring itself into action at will.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est autem ex hoc quod hic dicitur, falsam esse opinionem Avicennae quam habet de speciebus intelligibilibus contra opinionem Aristotelis. Ponit enim Avicenna, quod species non conservantur in intellectu possibili, nec sunt in eo nisi quando actu intelligit. Sed oportet secundum ipsum, quod quandocumque intelligit actu, quod convertat se ad intelligentiam separatam agentem, a qua effluunt in intellectum possibilem intelligibiles species.
          <td>702. What is said here disproves the un-aristotelian position of Avicenna touching intelligible ideas. Avicenna maintained that ideas are not retained by the potential intellect, but exist in it only so long as it is actually understanding. Whence it follows that, for this intellect to come to the act of understanding anything, it must have recourse to a separated active intellect, the source of intelligible ideas in the intellectual potency.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Contra quod manifeste hic philosophus dicit, quod intellectus reducitur in actum specierum, per modum, quo sciens actu, adhuc est in potentia intelligens. Cum enim intellectus actu intelligit, species intelligibiles sunt in eo secundum actum perfectum: cum autem habet habitum scientiae, sunt species in ipso intellectu medio modo inter potentiam puram et actum purum.
          <td>703. But against this Aristotle is clearly saying that the manner in which the mind becomes actually possessed of ideas is that of one who, possessing a science habitually, is stiff in potency to a given act of understanding. Thus the mind actually understanding possesses its ideas in fullest actuality; and so long as it has the habit of a science, it possesses them in a manner half-way between mere potency and complete actuality.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia dixerat, quod quando intellectus fit quodammodo in actu, secundum singula eorum ad quae erat in potentia, tunc potest intelligere, respectu autem sui nullo modo erat in potentia, posset aliquis credere, quod factus in actu, seipsum non intelligeret; et ideo ad hoc excludendum subiungit quod intellectus factus in actu, non potest intelligere alia, sed etiam tunc potest intelligere seipsum.
          <td>704. And having asserted that, once the mind has become partly actual with respect to certain ideas hitherto potentially apprehended, it is capable of understanding, whereas simply regarded in itself it lacks the capacity, because this might lead one to suppose that even as in act the mind never thinks of itself, Aristotle adds that, once in act, the mind is able to think not only of other things, but also of itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem, ostendit philosophus quid sit obiectum intellectus. Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod philosophus in septimo metaphysicae inquirit, utrum quod quid est, idest quidditas, vel essentia rei, quam definitio significat, sit idem quod res. Et quia Plato ponebat quidditates rerum esse separatas a singularibus, quas dicebat ideas, vel species; ideo ostendit, quod quidditates rerum non sunt aliud a rebus nisi per accidens; utputa non est idem quidditas hominis albi, et homo albus; quia quidditas hominis non continet in se nisi quod pertinet ad speciem hominis; sed hoc quod dico homo albus habet aliquid in se praeter illud quod est de specie humana.
          <td>705. Next at ‘Now, as dimension is one’, Aristotle elucidates the object of the intellect. To understand him here we must recall the problem stated in Book VII of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , namely whether the ‘whatness’ or quiddity or essence of a thing—whatever is signified by its definition—whether this is the same as the thing itself And whilst Plato had separated the quiddities (called by him ‘ideas’ or ‘species’) of things from things in their singularity, Aristotle was concerned to show that quiddities are only accidentally distinct from singular things. For example, a white man and his essence are distinct just in so far as the essence of man includes only what is specifically human, whereas the thing called one white man includes something else as well.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem contingit in omnibus habentibus formam in materia, quia in eis est aliquid praeter principia speciei. Nam natura speciei individuatur per materiam: unde principia individuantia et accidentia individui sunt praeter essentiam speciei. Et ideo contingit sub una specie inveniri plura individua: quae licet non differant in natura speciei, differunt tamen secundum principia individuantia. Et propter hoc in omnibus habentibus formam in materia, non est omnino idem, et res et quod quid est eius. Socrates enim non est sua humanitas. In his vero quae non habent formam in materia, sicut sunt formae simplices, nihil potest esse praeter essentiam speciei; quia ipsa forma est tota essentia. Et ideo in talibus non possunt esse plura individua unius speciei, nec potest in eis differre res et quod quid est eius.
          <td>706. And the same is true of anything whose form exists in matter; there is something in it besides its specific principle. The specific nature is individualised through matter; hence the individualising principles and individual accidents are not included in the essence as such. That is why there can be many individuals of the same specific nature—having this nature in common, whilst they differ in virtue of their individuating principles. Hence, in all such things, the thing and its essence are not quite identical. Socrates is not his humanity. But where the form does not exist in matter, where it exists simply in itself, there can be nothing except the essence; for then the form is the entire essence. And in such cases, of course, there cannot be a number of individuals sharing the same nature; nor can the individual and its nature be distinguished.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum est etiam, quod non solum naturalia habent speciem in materia, sed etiam mathematica. Est enim duplex materia: scilicet sensibilis, a qua abstrahunt mathematica, et concernunt eam naturalia, et intelligibilis, quam mathematica concernunt. Quod quidem sic intelligendum est. Manifestum est enim, quod quantitas immediate inhaeret substantiae: qualitates autem sensibiles in quantitate fundantur, ut album et nigrum, calidum et frigidum. Remoto autem posteriori remanet prius: unde remotis qualitatibus sensibilibus secundum intellectum, adhuc remanet quantitas continua in intellectu.
          <td>707. This also should be considered, that things existing concretely in Nature—physical things—are not alone in having their essences in matter; the same is also true of mathematical entities. For there are two kinds of matter: sensible matter, which is intrinsic to physical things and from which the mathematician abstracts; and intelligible matter, intrinsic to mathematical entities. For it is clear that, whereas quantity pertains to a substance immediately, sensible qualities, like white and black or heat and cold, presuppose quantity. Now given two things of which one is prior to the other, if you remove the second, the first remains; hence if only its sensible qualities are removed from a substance by a mental abstraction, continuous quantity still remains, in the mind, after the abstraction.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quaedam ergo sunt formae, quae materiam requirunt sub determinata dispositione sensibilium qualitatum; et huiusmodi sunt omnes formae naturales; et idcirco naturalia concernunt materiam sensibilem. Quaedam vero sunt formae, quae non exigunt materiam sub determinata dispositione sensibilium qualitatum, tamen requirunt materiam sub quantitate existentem: sicut triangulus, et quadratum, et huiusmodi: et haec dicuntur mathematica; et abstrahunt a materia sensibili, sed non a materia intelligibili, inquantum in intellectu remanet continua quantitas, abstracta a sensibili qualitate. Sic ergo patet, quia sicut naturalia habent formam in materia, ita et mathematica: et propter hoc tam in naturalibus quam in mathematicis differt res et quod quid est: unde in utrisque inveniuntur plura individua sub una specie. Sicut enim sunt plures homines unius speciei, ita et plures trianguli sub una specie.
          <td>708. For there are some forms which can only exist in a matter which is possessed of certain definite sensible qualities; and such are the forms of physical things; and such things therefore always involve sensible matter. But there are other forms which do not call for matter possessed of definite sensible qualities, yet do require matter existing as quantity. These are the so-called mathematical objects such as triangles, squares and the like; they are abstracted from sensible matter, but not from intelligible matter; for the mind retains the notion of a quantitative continuum after abstracting from sensible quality. Clearly then, both physical and mathematical objects have their forms in matter, and in both there is a difference between a thing and its essence; which is why in both cases many individual things are found to share the same nature: e.g. men and triangles.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>His igitur habitis, planum est accipere ex litera philosophi intellectum. Dicit enim quod aliud est magnitudo et magnitudinis esse, id est aliud est magnitudo, et quod quid est eius. Esse enim quod est magnitudinis appellat quidditatem eius. Et similiter aliud est aqua et aquae esse, et sic est in multis aliis, id est in omnibus mathematicis et naturalibus. Unde signanter duo exempla posuit. Nam magnitudo est quid mathematicum, aqua autem quid naturale.
          <td>709. If these points are understood, the text of Aristotle should present no difficulties. For he says ‘dimension, and the being of dimension’ differ, meaning a dimension and its essence-for by ‘the being of dimension’ he means its essence. So also ‘water’ and its ‘being’ are distinct; and similarly in the case of ‘many other things’, i.e. in all physical and mathematical objects. Hence his choice of these two examples: for dimension is a mathematical object and water a physical one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Non autem hoc contingit in omnibus. Nam in his, quae omnino sunt separata a materia idem est res et quod quid est eius. Et quia substantiae separatae ignotae sunt nobis, non potuit eas nominare propriis nominibus, sicut mathematica et naturalia, sed nominavit ea sub exemplo rerum naturalium. Et hoc est quod subdit, quod in quibusdam idem est carni esse et carnem: ex quo non intelligit, quod sit idem caro et quod quid est eius. Non enim diceret in quibusdam sic esse; sed simpliciter diceret, quod idem est caro et carni esse. Sed intelligit quod hoc, quod sic dicitur aliquid et alicui, ut caro, et carni esse, idem est in quibusdam, idest in his quae sunt a materia separata.
          <td>710. But this distinction is not verified in ‘all things’; for in perfectly immaterial substances the thing is identical with its essence. And as such substances are beyond the reach of the human mind, Aristotle could not assign proper names to them, as he could to physical and mathematical objects; so he describes them in terms drawn from physical objects. That is why he says that ‘in certain ‘ things flesh’ and ‘its being’ are identical.’ He does not mean this literally, else he would not have said ‘in certain things’, but would have absolutely identified flesh and its being. He means that ‘in certain things’, i.e. immaterial substances, the two factors which we distinguish as the concrete thing and what is predicated of it—for instance flesh and its being—are identical.

          <td>Et quia ad diversa cognoscenda diversae potentiae cognoscitivae requiruntur, concludit, quod anima aut cognoscit alio rem, et alio eius quidditatem, aut uno et eodem, sed alio modo se habente. Manifestum est autem, quod caro non est sine materia: sed forma carnis est forma determinata, et in materia determinata sensibili: sicut etiam simul habet subiectum sensibile determinatum, scilicet nasum. Hanc igitur naturam sensitivam cognoscit anima per sensum. Et hoc est quod subdit, quod anima iudicat potentia sensitiva calidum et frigidum, et alia huiusmodi quorum ratio, idest proportio quaedam caro est. Forma enim carnis requirit determinatam proportionem calidi et frigidi, et aliorum huiusmodi.
          <td>711. And since diversity in objects known implies diversity in the knowing faculties, he concludes by saying that either the soul knows a thing with one faculty and its essence with another, or both with the same faculty functioning in different ways. For it is obvious that flesh can only exist in matter; its form being in a certain definite and particular sensible matter. The being, too, which has flesh is a definite sensible thing, e.g. a nose. Now this sensitive nature the soul knows through the senses; that is why he adds that it is by the sense-faculty that the soul discerns the hot and the cold and so forth, of which flesh is a certain ‘ratio’, i.e. proportion. For the form of flesh requires a certain definite proportion of heat and cold and so forth.

          <td>Sed oportet quod alia potentia discernat esse carni, idest quod quid est carnis. Sed hoc contingit dupliciter: uno modo sic quod ipsa caro vel quidditas carnis cognoscantur omnino potentiis abinvicem diversis: puta quod potentia intellectiva cognoscitur quidditas carnis, potentia sensitiva cognoscitur caro: et hoc contingit quando anima per se cognoscit singulare et per se cognoscit naturam speciei. Alio modo contingit, quod cognoscitur caro, et quod quid est carnis: non quod sit alia et alia potentia: sed quia una et eadem potentia, alio et alio modo, cognoscit carnem, et quod quid est eius: et illud oportet esse, cum anima comparat universale ad singulare. Sicut enim supra dictum est, quia non possemus sentire differentiam dulcis et albi, nisi esset una potentia sensitiva communis quae cognosceret utrumque, ita etiam non possemus cognoscere comparationem universalis ad particulare, nisi esset una potentia quae cognosceret utrumque. Intellectus igitur utrumque cognoscit, sed alio et alio modo.
          <td>712. But the ‘being of flesh’, i.e. its essence, must be ‘discerned’ by some other faculty. But the functioning of two distinct ‘faculties’ takes place in two ways. In one way flesh and its essence can be discerned by powers in the soul which are completely distinct; the essence discerned by the intellect, the flesh by the senses; and this happens when we know the individual in itself and the specific nature in itself. But in another way the flesh and its essence may be discerned, not by two distinct faculties, but by one faculty knowing in two distinct ways—knowing in one way flesh, in another the essence of flesh; and this happens when the knowing soul correlates the universal and the individual. For, just as it would be impossible for us (as we have seen) to distinguish sweetness from whiteness if we had not a common sense faculty which knew both at once, so also we could not make any comparison between the universal and the individual if we had not a faculty which perceived both at once. The intellect therefore knows both at once, but in different ways.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cognoscit enim naturam speciei, sive quod quid est, directe extendendo seipsum, ipsum autem singulare per quamdam reflexionem, inquantum redit super phantasmata, a quibus species intelligibiles abstrahuntur.

          <td>713. It knows the specific nature or essence of an object by going out directly to that object; but it knows the individual thing indirectly or reflexively, by a return to the phantasms from which it abstracted what is intelligible. This Aristotle expresses by saying that the intellectual soul either knows flesh sensitively and discerns the ‘being of flesh’ with ‘another’ and ‘separate’ potency,—i.e. other than sensitivity, in the sense that intellect is a power distinct from the senses; or it knows flesh and the ‘being of flesh’ by one and the same intellectual power functioning diversely; in so far as it can ‘bend back’, so to say, ‘upon itself’. As ‘stretched out straight’, and apprehending directly, it ‘discerns’ the ‘being’ or essence of flesh; but by reflection it knows the flesh itself.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit iterum autem quod supra dixerat in naturalibus, exponit in mathematicis: dicens, quod iterum in his quae sunt per abstractionem, idest in mathematicis, quorum ratio abstrahit a materia sensibili, rectum se habet, sicut simum. Haec enim mathematica habent materiam, sicut et naturalia. Rectum enim mathematicum est, simum autem naturale. Ratio enim recti est cum continuo, sicut ratio simi cum naso. Continuum autem est materia intelligibilis, sicut simum materia sensibilis. Unde manifestum est, quod aliud est in mathematicis res et quod quid erat esse, ut rectum et recto esse; unde oportet quod alio cognoscat quod quid erat esse horum, et alio ipsa.
          <td>714. Next, at ‘Again, in the abstract sphere’, he applies what he had said of physical objects to mathematical objects, saying that ‘in the abstract sphere’, i.e. ‘in mathematics, where we abstract from sensible matter, the straight line is like the snub-nosed in the sphere of sensible matter. For line is a mathematical object, as a snub-nose is a physical one; and fine essentially involves a continuum, as what is snub-nosed a nose. But the continuum is intelligible matter, as what is snub-nosed is sensible matter. Therefore in mathematics also the thing and its essence, e.g. the straight fine and its straightness, are different; hence too, even in mathematics, things and essences must be objects of different kinds of knowing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et supponamus ad praesens, exempli causa cum Platone, quod dualitas sit quod quid erat esse lineae rectae. Plato enim ponebat, quod numeri erant species et quidditates mathematicorum; puta unitas lineae, dualitas lineae rectae, et sic de aliis. Oportet igitur, quod anima alio cognoscat ipsa mathematica et quidditates eorum, aut eodem aliter se habente. Unde sicut per naturalia ostenditur, quod intellectus, qui cognoscit quidditates naturalium, sit alius a sensu qui cognoscit ipsa naturalia singularia, ita ex mathematicis ostenditur quod intellectus qui cognoscit quod quid est ipsorum, sit aliud ab imaginativa virtute, quae apprehendit ipsa mathematica.
          <td>715. As an instance of this let us suppose for a moment, with Plato, that the essence of straight line is duality (for Plato identified the essences of mathematical objects with numbers, so that a line was unity, a straight line duality, and so on). The soul then must know mathematical objects and their essences in different ways. Hence, just as it can be shown, in the case of physical objects, that the intellect knowing their essences is other than the senses which know them in their individuality, so too, in the case of mathematics, it can be shown that what knows the essences, i.e. the intellect, is distinct from what apprehends mathematical objects themselves, i.e. the imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia posset aliquis dicere, quod eodem modo intelligerentur mathematica et naturalia, subiungit quod sicut res sunt separabiles a materia, ita se habent ad intellectum. Unde illa quae sunt secundum esse separata a materia sensibili, solo intellectu percipi possunt; quae autem non sunt separata a materia sensibili secundum esse, sed secundum rationem, intelliguntur absque materia sensibili, non autem absque materia intelligibili. Naturalia vero intelliguntur per abstractionem a materia individuali, non autem per abstractionem a materia sensibili totaliter. Intelligitur enim homo, ut compositus ex carnibus et ossibus, per abstractionem tamen ab his carnibus et his ossibus. Et inde est, quod intellectus non cognoscit directe singularia, sed sensus vel imaginatio.
          <td>716. And lest it be said that the mind works in the same way in mathematics and in natural science, he adds that the relation of things to the intellect corresponds to their separability from matter. What is separate in being from sensible matter can be discerned only by the intellect. What is not separate from sensible matter in being, but only in thought, can be perceived in abstraction from sensible matter, but not from intelligible matter. Physical objects, however, though they are intellectually discerned in abstraction from individual matter, cannot be completely abstracted from sensible matter; for ‘man’ is understood as including flesh and bones; though in abstraction from this flesh and these bones. But the singular individual is not directly known by the intellect, but by the senses or imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Apparet autem ex hoc quod philosophus hic dicit, quod proprium obiectum intellectus est quidditas rei, quae non est separata a rebus, ut Platonici posuerunt. Unde illud, quod est obiectum intellectus nostri non est aliquid extra res sensibiles existens, ut Platonici posuerunt, sed aliquid in rebus sensibilibus existens; licet intellectus apprehendat alio modo quidditates rerum, quam sint in rebus sensibilibus. Non enim apprehendit eas cum conditionibus individuantibus, quae eis in rebus sensibilibus adiunguntur. Et hoc sine falsitate intellectus contingere potest. Nihil enim prohibet duorum adinvicem coniunctorum, unum intelligi absque hoc quod intelligatur aliud. Sicut visus apprehendit colorem, absque hoc quod apprehendat odorem, non tamen absque hoc quod apprehendat magnitudinem quae est proprium subiectum coloris. Unde et intellectus potest intelligere aliquam formam absque individuantibus principiis, non tamen absque materia, a qua dependet ratio illius formae: sicut non potest intelligere simum sine naso, sed potest curvum sine naso intelligere. Et quia hoc non distinxerunt Platonici, posuerunt quod mathematica et quidditates rerum sunt separatae in esse, sicut sunt separatae in intellectu.
          <td>717. From this text of Aristotle one can go on to show that the intellect’s proper object is indeed the essence of things; but not the essence by itself, in separation from things, as the Platonists thought. Hence this ‘proper object’ of our intellect is not, as the Platonists held, something existing, outside sensible things; it is something intrinsic to sensible things; and this, even though the mode in which essences are grasped by the mind differs from their mode of existence in sensible things; for the mind discerns them apart from the individuating conditions which belong to them in the order of sensible reality. Nor need this involve the mind in any falsehood; for there is no reason why, of two conjoined things, it should not discern one without discerning the other; just as sight perceives colour without perceiving odour, though not without perceiving colour’s necessary ground which is spatial magnitude. In like manner, the intellect can perceive a form apart from its individuating principles, though not apart from the matter required by the nature of the form in question; thus it cannot understand the snub-nosed without thinking of nose, but it can understand a curve without thinking of nose. And it was just because the Platonists failed to draw this distinction that they thought that mathematical objects and the essences of things were as separate from matter in reality as they are in the mind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Manifestum est etiam, quod species intelligibiles, quibus intellectus possibilis fit in actu, non sunt obiectum intellectus. Non enim se habent ad intellectum sicut quod intelligitur, sed sicut quo intelligit. Sicut enim species, quae est in visu, non est quod videtur, sed est quo visus videt; quod autem videtur est color, qui est in corpore; similiter quod intellectus intelligit est quidditas, quae est in rebus; non autem species intelligibilis, nisi inquantum intellectus in seipsum reflectitur. Manifestum est enim quod scientiae sunt de his quae intellectus intelligit. Sunt autem scientiae de rebus, non autem de speciebus, vel intentionibus intelligibilibus, nisi sola scientia rationalis. Unde manifestum est, quod species intelligibilis non est obiectum intellectus, sed quidditas rei intellectae.
          <td>718. Furthermore, it is clear that the intelligible ideas by which the potential intellect is actualised are not in themselves the intellect’s object: for they are not that which, but that by which it understands. For, as with sight the image in the eye is not what is seen, but what gives rise to the act of sight (for what is seen is colour which exists in an exterior body), so also what the intellect understands is the essence existing in things; it is not its own intelligible idea, except in so far as the intellect reflects upon itself. Because, obviously, it is what the mind understands that makes up the subject-matter of the sciences; and all these, apart from rational science, have realities for their subject-matter, not ideas. Clearly then, the intellect’s object is not the intelligible idea, but the essence of intelligible realities.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo patet nullam esse rationem quorumdam volentium ostendere, quod intellectus possibilis sit unus in omnibus, ex hoc, quod idem est intellectum ab omnibus, cum oporteat esse plures numero species intelligibiles, si sunt plures intellectus. Non enim est species intelligibilis, ipsum intellectum, sed similitudo eius in anima: et ideo si sunt plures intellectus habentes similitudinem unius et eiusdem rei, erit eadem res intellecta apud omnes. Et praeter hoc manifestum est, quod etiam substantiae separatae intelligunt quidditates rerum naturalium, quas nos intelligimus, et earum intellectus diversi sunt. Unde, si eorum ratio esset efficax, non evitaretur inconveniens, quod concludunt, per hoc, quod ponunt unum intellectum in omnibus hominibus. Non enim possunt ponere unum intellectum in omnibus intelligentibus.
          <td>719. From which we can infer the futility of an argument used by some to prove that all men have only one potential intellect in common. They argue from the fact that all men can understand one and the same object; and say that if there were really many human intellects they would necessarily have many intelligible ideas. But these intelligible ideas are not precisely what the mind understands; they are only the latter’s likeness present in the soul; hence it is quite possible for many intellects to possess likenesses of one and the same object, so that one thing is understood by all. Besides, the separated substances must know the essences of the physical things which we know; and clearly their intellects are distinct. Hence, if the above argument were valid, its conclusion—that all men have only one intellect—would still involve a difficulty; for one cannot reduce <i>all</i> intellects to one.

          <td>Postquam ostendit philosophus naturam intellectus possibilis, et obiectum eius, hic movet quasdam dubitationes circa praedeterminata. Et dividitur in duas partes. In prima ponit dubitationes. Secunda solvit eas, ibi, aut pati. Movet autem primo duas dubitationes: quarum prima talis est. Si intellectus est simplex et impassibilis, et nulli habet aliquid commune, ut Anaxagoras dixit, quomodo intellectus potest intelligere, cum intelligere sit pati quoddam, et de ratione patientis hoc esse videatur, quod habeat aliquid commune cum agente? Quia inquantum est aliquid commune utrisque, scilicet agenti et patienti, videtur quod hoc agat, et illud patiatur. Oportet enim ea quae agunt et patiuntur adinvicem, communicare in materia, ut dicitur in primo de generatione.
          <td>720. Having outlined the nature and object of the potential intellect, Aristotle now goes on to discuss some relevant difficulties; and this in two stages: first stating two problems and then, at ‘Or what about the receptivity’, answering them. The first of the two problems might be stated thus: if intellect is, as Anaxagoras said, something simple and impassible and removed from all else, how can it actually understand? For to understand is a kind of receiving, and every receiver, as such, would seem to be affected by an agent; and it is precisely through having something in common that two things are related as agent and patient, this mutual relationship implying a material factor in common, as is shown in Book I of the <i>De Generatione</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam dubitationem ponit ibi amplius autem et insurgit haec dubitatio ex eo quod supra dixit, quod intellectus factus in actu, etiam seipsum intelligit. Et est ista dubitatio, quod si intellectus est intelligibilis, hoc potest contingere duobus modis. Uno modo, quod sit intelligibilis secundum se, et non secundum aliud. Alio modo, quod habeat aliquid sibi adiunctum, quod faciat ipsum intelligibilem. Si autem secundum seipsum est intelligibilis, et non secundum aliud, intelligibile autem inquantum huiusmodi est unum in specie, sequetur, si hoc non solum est intelligibile, sed intellectus; quod etiam alia intelligibilia sint intellectus, et ita omnia intelligibilia intelligent. Si autem est intelligibilis per hoc quod habet aliquid aliud sibi adiunctum, sequeretur quod habeat aliquid quod faciat ipsum intelligibilem, sicut et alia, quae intelliguntur: et ita videtur sequi idem quod prius, scilicet quod semper id quod intelligitur, intelligat.
          <td>721. The second difficulty he states at ‘Again, if it is’. This difficulty is occasioned by his earlier statement that once the mind is in act it can understand itself. Now if intellect itself is intelligible, it is so in either of two ways: either merely of itself, or by way of something else conjoined with it. If the first alternative be true, then, since the intelligible as such forms one species, and since this intelligible is an intellect, it seems to follow that other intelligibles are also intellects, and thus everything intelligible is also intelligent. Should we take the second alternative, however, it would follow that the mind was like other things that are understood in being conjoined with something which makes it intelligible, with the result, it might seem, here also, that that which is understood is always possessed of understanding.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit aut pati solvit praemissas dubitationes. Et primo solvit primam; dicens, quod sicut prius distinctum est de passione, cum ageretur de sensu, quod pati dicitur secundum aliquid commune, idest hoc quod est pati commune est ad passionem quae est in contrarias dispositiones, sicut est passio mutua in rebus naturalibus, quae communicant in materia: et est aliquod pati, quod dicitur secundum receptionem tantum. Intellectus igitur dicitur pati, inquantum est quodammodo in potentia ad intelligibilia, et nihil est actu eorum antequam intelligat. Oportet autem hoc sic esse, sicut contingit in tabula, in qua nihil est actu scriptum, sed plura possunt in ea scribi. Et hoc etiam accidit intellectui possibili, quia nihil intelligibilium est in eo actu, sed potentia tantum.
          <td>722. Then at ‘Or what about the receptivity’, he removes these difficulties. As to the first, relying on his earlier analysis of passivity, he reminds us that one can speak of passivity in a general sense which is common to two different kinds of change: to the mutual alteration of things which have their material factor in ‘common and mutually exclusive, alternating formal determinations; and also to the change which implies nothing more than a reception of forms from outside the changed thing. The mind, then, is called passive just in so far as it is in potency, somehow, to intelligible objects which are not actual in it until understood by it. It is like a sheet of paper on which no word is yet written, but many can be written. Such is the condition of the intellect as a potency, so long as it lacks actual knowledge of intelligible objects.

          <td>Et per hoc excluditur tam opinio antiquorum naturalium, qui ponebant animam compositam ex omnibus, ut intelligeret omnia, quam etiam opinio Platonis, qui posuit naturaliter animam humanam habere omnem scientiam, sed esse eam quodammodo oblitam, propter unionem ad corpus: dicens, quod addiscere nihil aliud est quam reminisci.
          <td>723. This is against, not only the early natural philosophers’ view that the soul knows all things because it is composed of all things, but also Plato’s opinion that the human soul is by nature in possession of a universal knowledge which only its union with the body has caused it to forget. (This theory is implicit in Plato’s reduction of learning to remembering.)

          <td>Deinde cum dicit et ipse solvit secundam dubitationem. Et primo solvit quaestionem. Secundo respondet ad obiectionem in contrarium factam, ibi, non autem semper. Dicit ergo primo, quod intellectus possibilis est intelligibilis non per suam essentiam, sed per aliquam speciem intelligibilem, sicut et alia intelligibilia. Quod probat ex hoc, quod intellectum in actu et intelligens in actu, sunt unum, sicut et supra dixit, quod sensibile in actu et sensus in actu sunt unum. Est autem aliquod intelligibile in actu, per hoc quod est in actu a materia abstractum: sic enim supra dixit, quod sicut res sunt separabiles a materia, sic sunt et quae sunt circa intellectum. Et ideo hic dicit, quod in his quae sunt sine materia. Id est si accipiamus intelligibilia actu, idem est intellectus et quod intelligitur, sicut idem est sentiens in actu et quod sentitur in actu. Ipsa enim scientia speculativa, et sic scibile, idest scibile in actu, est idem. Species igitur rei intellectae in actu, est species ipsius intellectus; et sic per eam seipsum intelligere potest. Unde et supra philosophus per ipsum intelligere, et per illud quod intelligitur, scrutatus est naturam intellectus possibilis. Non enim cognoscimus intellectum nostrum nisi per hoc, quod intelligimus nos intelligere.
          <td>724. After this, at ‘And it is itself’, he answers the second difficulty; and then, at ‘The reason why there is not’, a fresh objection. First, then, he says that the potential intellect is itself intelligible, not indeed immediately, but like other intelligible things, through a concept. To prove this he has recourse to the principle that the actually understood object and the actually understanding subject are one being—just as he said earlier in this book, that the actually sensed object and the actually sensing subject are one being. Now the actually understood is so in virtue of an abstraction from matter; for, as we have seen, things become objects of the understanding just in the degree that they can be separated from matter. So he says ‘in things separated from the material’. So the understanding and the understood are one being, provided the latter is actually understood; and the same is true of the object and subject of sensation. Speculative knowledge and what is knowable ‘in this way’ (i.e. in act) are identical. Therefore the concept of the actually understood thing is also a concept of the understanding, through which the latter can understand itself. That is why all the foregoing discussion of the potential intellect has been carried on in terms of the latter’s act and object. For we only know the intellect through our knowledge that we are using it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Accidit autem hoc in intellectu possibili, quod non intelligatur per essentiam suam, sed per speciem intelligibilem, ex hoc quod est potentia tantum in ordine intelligibilium. Ostendit enim philosophus, in nono metaphysicae, quod nihil intelligitur nisi secundum quod est in actu. Et potest accipi simile in rebus sensibilibus. Nam id quod est in potentia tantum in eis, scilicet materia prima, non habet aliquam actionem per essentiam suam, sed solum per formam ei adiunctam: substantiae autem sensibiles, quae sunt secundum aliquid in actu, et secundum aliquid in potentia, secundum seipsas habent aliquam actionem. Similiter intellectus possibilis, qui est tantum in potentia in ordine intelligibilium, non intelligit, neque intelligitur, nisi per speciem in eo susceptam.
          <td>725. The reason why the potential intellect cannot be known immediately, but only through a concept, is the fact that it is potential also as an intelligible object; for, as it is proved in Book IX of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , intelligibility depends upon actuality. And there is a like dependence in the field of sensible realities too. In this field what is purely potential, i.e. bare matter, cannot act of itself, but only through some form conjoined with it; whereas sensible substances, being compositions of potency. and act, can act, to some extent, of themselves. So, too, the potential intellect, being purely potential in the order of intelligible things, neither understands nor is understood except through its own concepts.

          <td>Deus autem, qui est purus actus in ordine intelligibilium, et aliae substantiae separatae, quae sunt mediae inter potentiam et actum per suam essentiam et intelligunt et intelliguntur.
          <td>726. But God who, among intelligible objects, is the one that is perfect actuality, and also the other immaterial substances midway between potency and act, know and are known simply of and in themselves.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit non autem respondet ad obiectionem, quae erat in contrarium; dicens, quod ex quo intellectus possibilis habet aliquid quod facit ipsum intelligibilem, sicut et alia, restat ut consideretur causa non semper intelligendi, id est quare non semper intelligibile intelligit. Quod ideo est, quia in rebus habentibus materiam, species non est intelligibilis secundum actum, sed secundum potentiam tantum. Intelligibile autem in potentia non est idem cum intellectu, sed solum intelligibile in actu: unde in illis quae habent speciem in materia, non inerit intellectus, ut scilicet intelligere possint, quia intellectus talium, idest intelligibilium, est quaedam potentia sine materia. Illud autem quod est in materia est intelligibile, sed in potentia tantum, quod vero est in intellectu, est species intelligibilis secundum actum.
          <td>727. Next, at ‘The reason why’, he answers an objection to the above solution. For if our mind, like other things, is rendered intelligible by union with some principle of intelligibility which is not precisely itself, why should not any intelligible object be itself a subject which understands;—or, as he says, we still have to enquire into ‘the reason’ for ‘not always understanding’. Now the reason is that in any material thing the form is not actually intelligible; it is only potentially so; and only what is actually intelligible, not the merely potentially so, is identical with intellect; so that things whose form exists in matter are not themselves possessed of an intellect with which to understand. The ‘mind that understands such things’ (i.e. intelligible objects) is a certain immaterial potency. The material thing is indeed intelligible but only potentially, whereas what exists in an intellect is an actually intelligible form.

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de intellectu possibili, nunc determinat de intellectu agente. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit esse intellectum agentem, praeter possibilem, et ratione, et exemplo. Secundo ostendit huius intellectus naturam, ibi, et hic intellectus. Ponit ergo circa primum talem rationem. In omni natura quae est quandoque in potentia et quandoque in actu, oportet ponere aliquid, quod est sicut materia in unoquoque genere, quod scilicet est in potentia ad omnia quae sunt illius generis. Et aliud, quod est sicut causa agens, et factivum; quod ita se habet in faciendo omnia, sicut ars ad materiam. Sed anima secundum partem intellectivam quandoque est in potentia, et quandoque in actu. Necesse est igitur in anima intellectiva esse has differentias: ut scilicet unus sit intellectus, in quo possint omnia intelligibilia fieri, et hic est intellectus possibilis, de quo supra dictum est: et alius intellectus sit ad hoc quod possit omnia intelligibilia facere in actu; qui vocatur intellectus agens, et est sicut habitus quidam.
          <td>728. Having examined the potential intellect, the Philosopher now turns his attention to the agent intellect. He first shows by argument and illustration that there is such a thing as the agent intellect; and then, at ‘And this is intellect’, he explains its nature. The argument he uses is this. In any nature which alternates between potency and actuality we must posit (1) a factor akin to the matter which, in any given class of things, is potentially all the particulars included in the class; and (2,) another factor which operates as an active and productive cause, like art with respect to its material. Since then the intellectual part of the soul alternates between potency and act, it must include these two distinct principles: first, a potentiality within which all intelligible concepts can be actualised (this is the potential intellect already discussed); and then, also, a principle whose function it is to actualise those concepts. And this latter is the agent intellect,—being ‘a sort of state’.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Huius autem verbi occasione, quidam posuerunt intellectum agentem idem esse cum intellectu qui est habitus principiorum. Quod esse non potest: quia intellectus, qui est habitus principiorum, praesupponit aliqua iam intellecta in actu: scilicet terminos principiorum, per quorum intelligentiam cognoscimus principia: et sic sequeretur, quod intellectus agens non faceret omnia intelligibilia in actu, ut hic philosophus dicit. Dicendum est ergo, quod habitus, sic accipitur secundum quod philosophus frequenter consuevit nominare omnem formam et naturam habitum, prout habitus distinguitur contra privationem et potentiam, ut sic per hoc quod nominat eum habitum distinguat eum ab intellectu possibili, qui est potentia.
          <td>729. This last phrase has led some to suppose that the agent intellect is one with the ‘intellect’ which is a habitual apprehension of first principles. But it is not so; for the latter ‘intellect’ presupposes the actual presence in the mind of certain intelligible and understood objects, which are the terms in understanding which we apprehend the truth of first principles. So the view in question would imply that the agent intellect was not, as Aristotle here maintains, the primary source, for us, of the actual intelligibility of anything. Therefore I hold that the term ‘state’ is used here in the sense in which Aristotle often calls any form or nature a ‘state’, to distinguish it from a privation or a potency. In this case the agent intellect is called a state to distinguish it from the intellect in potency.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde dicit quod est habitus, ut lumen, quod quodammodo facit colores existentes in potentia, esse actu colores. Et dicit quodammodo, quia supra ostensum est, quod color secundum seipsum est visibilis. Hoc autem solummodo facit lumen, ipsum esse actu colorem, inquantum facit diaphanum esse in actu, ut moveri possit a colore, ut sic color videatur. Intellectus autem agens facit ipsa intelligibilia esse in actu, quae prius erant in potentia, per hoc quod abstrahit ea a materia; sic enim sunt intelligibilia in actu, ut dictum est.
          <td>730. So he calls it a state, and compares it to light which ‘in a way’ brings colours from potency to act;—‘in a way’ because, as we have seen, colour is visible of itself; all that light does is to actualise a transparent medium which can then be modified by colour so that colour is seen. The agent intellect, on the other hand, actualises the intelligible notions themselves, abstracting them from matter, i.e. bringing them from potential to actual intelligibility.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Inducitur autem Aristoteles ad ponendum intellectum agentem, ad excludendum opinionem Platonis, qui posuit quidditates rerum sensibilium esse a materia separatas, et intelligibiles actu; unde non erat ei necessarium ponere intellectum agentem. Sed quia Aristoteles ponit, quod quidditates rerum sensibilium sunt in materia, et non intelligibiles actu, oportuit quod poneret aliquem intellectum qui abstraheret a materia, et sic faceret eas intelligibiles actu.
          <td>731. The reason why Aristotle came to postulate an agent intellect was his rejection of Plato’s theory that the essences of sensible things existed apart from matter, in a state of actual intelligibility. For Plato there was clearly no need to posit an agent intellect. But Aristotle, who regarded the essences of sensible things as existing in matter with only a potential intelligibility, had to invoke some abstractive principle in the mind itself to render these essences actually intelligible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et hic ponit quatuor conditiones intellectus agentis: quarum prima est, quod sit separabilis: secunda, quod sit impassibilis: tertia quod sit immixtus, idest non compositus ex naturis corporalibus, neque adiunctus organo corporali; sed in his tribus convenit cum intellectu possibili: quarta autem conditio est, quod sit in actu secundum suam substantiam; in quo differt ab intellectu possibili, qui est in potentia secundum suam substantiam, sed est in actu solum secundum speciem susceptam.
          <td>732. Next, at ‘And this etc.’, he states four qualities or conditions of the agent intellect: first, its separation from matter; second, its impassibility; third, its purity, by which he means that it is neither made up of bodily natures nor conjoined with a bodily organ. Now these three qualities are also found in the potential intellect; but the fourth is proper to the agent intellect, and consists in its being essentially in act; whereas, the potential intellect is essentially potential and comes to act only by receiving an intelligible object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ad has quatuor conditiones probandas, inducit unam rationem, quae talis est. Agens est honorabilius patiente, et principium activum, materia: sed intellectus agens comparatur ad possibilem sicut agens ad materiam, sicut iam dictum est: ergo intellectus agens est nobilior possibili. Sed intellectus possibilis est separatus, impassibilis et immixtus, ut supra ostensum est: ergo multo magis intellectus agens. Ex hoc etiam patet, quod sit secundum substantiam suam in actu; quia agens est nobilius patiente, non nisi secundum quod est in actu.
          <td>733. To demonstrate these qualities he argues as follows. What acts is nobler than what is acted on, an active principle is nobler than its material. Now the agent intellect, as we have said, is to the potential intellect as an active principle to its material; therefore it is the nobler of the two. if, then, the potential intellect be (as has been shown) free from matter and impassible and pure, <i>a fortiori</i> the agent intellect. Consequently the agent intellect is also essentially actual, for only in virtue of its actuality is an active principle nobler than a passive one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Occasione autem horum quae hic dicuntur, quidam posuerunt intellectum agentem, substantiam separatam, et quod differt secundum substantiam ab intellectu possibili. Illud autem non videtur esse verum. Non enim homo esset a natura sufficienter institutus, si non haberet in seipso principia, quibus posset operationem complere, quae est intelligere: quae quidem compleri non potest, nisi per intellectum possibilem, et per intellectum agentem. Unde perfectio humanae naturae requirit, quod utrumque eorum sit aliquid in homine. Videmus etiam, quod sicut operatio intellectus possibilis, quae est recipere intelligibilia, attribuitur homini, ita et operatio intellectus agentis, quae est abstrahere intelligibilia. Hoc autem non posset, nisi principium formale huius actionis esset ei secundum esse coniunctum.
          <td>734. Now what is said here has led some to conceive of the agent intellect as a separated substance, subsisting apart from the potential intellect. But this does not seem to be true; for human nature would be a deficient nature if it lacked any one of the principles that it needs for its naturally appropriate activity of understanding; and this requires both the potential and the agent intellects. Hence, complete human nature requires that both of these be intrinsic to man. Moreover, just as the potential intellect’s function of receiving intelligible objects is attributed to the individual man as its subject, so also is the work of the agent intellect, the abstracting of such objects from matter. And this is only possible in so far as the formal principle of the latter activity is one in being with the individual man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nec sufficit ad hoc, quod actio attribuatur homini per hoc quod species intelligibiles factae per intellectum agentem, habent quodammodo pro subiecto phantasmata, quae sunt in nobis; quia ut supra diximus, cum de intellectu possibili ageretur, species non sunt intelligibiles in actu, nisi quia sunt abstractae a phantasmatibus: et sic eis mediantibus actio intellectus agentis non posset nobis attribui. Et praeterea intellectus agens comparatur ad species intellectus in actu, sicut ars ad species artificiatorum, per quas manifestum est, quod artificia non habent actionem artis: unde etiam dato, quod species factae intelligibiles actu, essent in nobis, non sequeretur, quod nos possemus habere actionem intellectus agentis.
          <td>735. Nor is it enough to say that the intelligible notions formed by the agent intellect subsist somehow in phantasms, which are certainly intrinsic to us; for as we have already observed in treating of the potential intellect, objects only become actually intelligible when abstracted from phantasms; so that, merely by way of the phantasms, we cannot attribute the work of the agent intellect to ourselves. Besides, the agent intellect is to ideas in act in the mind as art is to the ideas it works by; and obviously the things on which art impresses such ideas do not themselves produce the art; hence, even granted that we were the subjects of ideas made actually intelligible in us, it would not follow that it is we who produce them by means of an agent intellect in ourselves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est etiam praedicta positio contra Aristotelis intentionem: qui expresse dixit, has differentias duas, scilicet intellectum agentem et intellectum possibilem, esse in anima: ex quo expresse dat intelligere, quod sint partes animae, vel potentiae, et non aliquae substantiae separatae.
          <td>736. Nor does the above theory agree with Aristotle who expressly states that these two distinct powers, the agent and the potential intellects, are in the soul; thus making it quite clear that he takes them to be parts or potencies of the soul, not distinct substances.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra hoc videtur esse praecipue, quod intellectus possibilis comparatur ad intelligibilia, ut in potentia existens ad illa; intellectus autem agens comparatur ad ea, ut ens in actu: non videtur autem possibile, idem respectu eiusdem posse esse in potentia et in actu: unde non videtur possibile, quod intellectus agens et possibilis conveniant in una substantia animae.
          <td>737. The chief difficulty arises from the fact that, while the potential intellect is in potency to intelligible objects, the agent intellect stands to the latter as a being already in act. And it would seem impossible that one and the same thing should be at once in act and in potency to the same object; and therefore that these two intellects should belong to the one substance of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed hoc de facili solvitur, si quis recte consideret, quomodo intellectus possibilis sit in potentia ad intelligibilia, et quomodo intelligibilia sunt in potentia respectu intellectus agentis. Est enim intellectus possibilis in potentia ad intelligibilia, sicut indeterminatum ad determinatum. Nam intellectus possibilis non habet determinate naturam alicuius rerum sensibilium. Unumquodque autem intelligibile, est aliqua determinata natura alicuius speciei. Unde supra dixit, quod intellectus possibilis comparatur ad intelligibilia, sicut tabula ad determinatas picturas. Quantum autem ad hoc, intellectus agens non est in actu.
          <td>738. But there is really no difficulty in this if we understand aright how the potential intellect is potential with respect to intelligible objects, and how the latter are potential with respect to the agent intellect. In the former case the potentiality is that of the indefinite to the definite; for the potential intellect is not, as such, endowed with any definite and particular sensible thing’s nature. Yet only definite particular natures are, as such, intelligible—hence Aristotle’s earlier comparison’ of the intellectual power’s relation to intelligible objects with that of a sheet of paper to particular definite pictures. And from this point of view the agent intellect is not in act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si enim intellectus agens haberet in se determinationem omnium intelligibilium, non indigeret intellectus possibilis phantasmatibus, sed per solum intellectum agentem reduceretur in actum omnium intelligibilium, et sic non compararetur ad intelligibilia ut faciens ad factum, ut philosophus hic dicit, sed ut existens ipsa intelligibilia. Comparatur igitur ut actus respectu intelligibilium, inquantum est quaedam virtus immaterialis activa, potens alia similia sibi facere, scilicet immaterialia. Et per hunc modum, ea quae sunt intelligibilia in potentia, facit intelligibilia in actu. Sic enim et lumen facit colores in actu, non quod ipsum habeat in se determinationem omnium colorum. Huiusmodi autem virtus activa est quaedam participatio luminis intellectualis a substantiis separatis. Et ideo philosophus dicit, quod est sicut habitus, vel lumen; quod non competeret dici de eo, si esset substantia separata.
          <td>739. For if the agent intellect as such included the definite forms of all intelligible objects, the potential intellect would not depend upon phantasms; it would be actualised simply and solely by the agent intellect; and the latter’s relation to intelligible objects would not be that of a maker to something made, as the Philosopher here says; for it would simply be identical with them. What makes it therefore in act with respect to intelligible objects is the fact that it is an active immaterial force able to assimilate other things to itself, i.e.. to immaterialise them. In this way it renders the potentially intelligible actually so (like light which, without containing particular colours, actually brings colours into act). And because this active force is a certain participation in the intellectual light of separated substances, the Philosopher compares it to a state and to light; which would not be an appropriate way of describing it if it were itself a separate substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit idem autem determinat de intellectu secundum actum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ponit conditiones intellectus in actu. Secundo ostendit conditiones totius partis intellectivae, secundum quod differt ab aliis partibus animae, ibi, separatus autem. Circa primum tres ponit conditiones intellectus in actu: quarum prima est, quod scientia in actu, est idem rei scitae. Quod non est verum de intellectu in potentia. Secunda conditio eius est, quod scientia in potentia in uno et eodem, tempore est prior quam scientia in actu; sed universaliter non est prior, non solum natura, sed neque etiam tempore: et hoc est, quod philosophus dicit in nono metaphysicae, quod actus est prior potentia natura, tempore vero in uno et eodem potentia prior est actu, quia unum et idem prius est in potentia, et postea fit actu. Sed universaliter loquendo, etiam tempore actus est prior. Nam quod in potentia est, non reducitur in actum nisi per aliquod quod est actu. Et sic etiam de potentia sciente, non fit aliquis sciens actu, inveniendo, neque discendo, nisi per aliquam scientiam praeexistentem in actu; quia omnis doctrina et disciplina intellectiva fit ex praeexistenti cognitione, ut dicitur in primo posteriorum.
          <td>740. Next, at ‘Knowledge in act’ he states his conclusions concerning intellect as in act; and first he states its properties; and then, it ‘Only separated’ how the intellectual part of the soul in general differs from the rest of the soul. Regarding the former point, he states three properties of intellect in act. First, its actual knowledge is identical with the thing known; which is not true of intellect as potential. Secondly, though in one and the same thing potential knowledge is prior in time to actual knowledge, yet, speaking universally, potential knowledge is not prior either in nature or in time. In Book IX of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , Aristotle had said that act is by nature prior to potency, but not in time in one and the same thing; for a thing is first in potency and afterwards in act. But universally speaking act takes priority even in time; because no potency would ever be actualised unless something were already in act. So, even in the case of potential knowledge, no one ever comes to know anything actually, whether through his own effort or another’s teaching, except in virtue of some pre-existing actual knowledge, as it is said in Book I of the <i>Posterior Analytics</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertia conditio intellectus in actu, per quam differt ab intellectu possibili, et intellectu in habitu, est quia uterque quandoque intelligit, et quandoque non intelligit. Sed hoc non potest dici de intellectu in actu, qui consistit in ipso intelligere.
          <td>741. The third property of intellect as in act, differentiating it from the potential intellect and from intellect in habitual possession of knowledge, is that it is always in act; for it simply is the act of understanding. In the other cases intellect is sometimes in act and sometimes in potency.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit separatus autem ponit conditiones totius intellectivae partis. Et primo ponit veritatem. Secundo excludit obiectionem, ibi, non reminiscitur. Dicit ergo primo, quod solus intellectus separatus est hoc, quod vere est. Quod quidem non potest intelligi neque de intellectu agente neque de intellectu possibili tantum, sed de utroque, quia de utroque supra dixit quod est separatus. Et patet quod hic loquitur de tota parte intellectiva: quae quidem dicitur separata, ex hoc quod habet operationem suam sine organo corporali.
          <td>742. Next, at ‘Only separated’, he states the properties of the intellect as a whole; first stating the truth, and then refuting an objection. He says, then, that only the mind separated from matter is that which really is mind; and he speaks here, not of the agent or passive intellect in isolation, but of both together, since both have been described as separated from matter. And the whole intellect is so described because it operates without a bodily organ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia in principio huius libri dixit quod si aliqua operatio animae sit propria, contingit animam separari; concludit, quod haec sola pars animae, scilicet intellectiva, est incorruptibilis et perpetua. Et hoc est quod supra posuit in secundo, quod hoc genus animae separatur ab aliis, sicut perpetuum a corruptibili. Dicitur autem perpetua, non quod semper fuerit, sed quod semper erit. Unde philosophus dicit in duodecimo metaphysicorum, quod forma numquam est ante materiam, sed posterius remanet anima, non omnis, sed intellectus.
          <td>743. And in line with what he said at the beginning of this book, that the soul might be separable from the body if any of its activities were proper to itself, he now concludes that the soul’s intellectual part alone is immortal and perpetual. This is what he has said in Book II, namely that this ‘kind’ of soul was separable from others as the perpetual from the mortal,—perpetual in the sense that it survives for ever, not in the sense that it always has existed; for as he shows in Book XII of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , forms cannot exist before their matter. The soul, then (not all of it, but only its intellectual part) will survive its matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit reminiscitur excludit quamdam obiectionem.

          <td>744. Next, at ‘It does not remember’, he meets an objection. For we might suppose that knowledge would remain unchanged in the intellectual part of the soul which survives. But already in Book I he has disallowed this, where, he observed that the act of the intellect must cease when something else dies; and that after death the soul remembers and loves no more.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo hic dicit, quod non reminiscitur, scilicet post mortem eorum, quae in vita scivimus, quia hoc quidem impassibile est, id est ista pars animae intellectivae impassibilis est, unde ipsa non est subiectum passionum animae, sicut sunt amor et odium, reminiscentia et huiusmodi, quae ex aliqua passione corporali contingunt. Passivus vero intellectus corruptibilis est, idest pars animae, quae non est sine praedictis passionibus, est corruptibilis; pertinent enim ad partem sensitivam.

Sine hac autem parte animae corporalis, intellectus nihil intelligit. Non enim intelligit aliquid sine phantasmate, ut infra dicetur. Et ideo destructo corpore non remanet in anima separata scientia rerum secundum eundem modum, quo modo intelligit. Sed quomodo tunc intelligat, non est praesentis intentionis discutere.
          <td>745. So now he adds that what we have known in life is not recalled after death; because ‘it is impassible’, i.e. that part of the intellectual soul of which he speaks; which, therefore, is unaffected by passions such as love and hatred and reminiscence and so forth, which all depend on modifications of the body. For the ‘passive intellect’—a part of the soul which depends on the aforesaid passions—is certainly mortal; for it belongs to our sensitive nature. Nevertheless, it is called ‘intellect’ and ‘rational’ because it has a certain share in reason: it obeys and is governed by reason (see Book I of the <i>Ethics</i> ). And without the co-operation of this embodied part of the soul there is no understanding anything; for the intellect always requires phantasms, as we shall see. Hence, after the body’s death the soul no longer knows anything in the same way as before. But how it does know anything then is not part of our present enquiry.

            <td>Intelligence of what is not complex is in a sphere where there can be no deception. But in matters where there is false or true, there is also some composition of things understood as of many brought to a unity. As Empedocles said, ‘The heads of many grew with no neck’, [but] concord afterwards brought them to unity; so in the same way these disjunct terms are combined, like ‘the diagonal’ and ‘the incommensurate’. If the composition be of things done, or of future events, time also is taken into the reckoning, as one of the component elements. Falsity is always in a combination, as for instance when one brings together ‘white’ and a not-white object, or ‘not-white’ with a white one. All these statements can also be divisions. It is not only, then, false or true that Cleon is white, but that this fact was true or will be true. It is the intellect which imposes a unity in each case. §§ 746-5 1

          LECTIO 11</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de intellectu, hic determinat de operatione intellectus. Et dividitur in duas partes. In prima distinguit duas operationes intellectus. In secunda determinat de utraque earum, ibi, indivisibile autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod una operationum intellectus est, secundum quod intelligit indivisibilia, puta cum intelligit hominem aut bovem, aut aliquid huiusmodi incomplexorum. Et haec intelligentia est in his circa quae non est falsum: tum quia incomplexa non sunt vera neque falsa, tum quia intellectus non decipitur in eo quod quid est, ut infra dicetur.
          <td>746. Having come to conclusions about the intellect the philosopher now examines its activity; and this in two parts; first distinguishing two such activities, and then reaching conclusions about each of these. First, then, he says that the intellect, by one of its activities, understands things simply; understanding, for instance, man or ox, or any such thing, simply in itself And this operation involves no falsehood, both because objects considered simply in themselves are neither true nor false, and also because, as we shall see later on, the mind is infallible with respect to what things are in themselves.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in illis intelligibilibus, in quibus est verum et falsum, est iam quaedam compositio intellectuum, idest rerum intellectarum: sicut quando ex multis fit aliquid unum. Et ponit exemplum secundum opinionem Empedoclis qui opinabatur, quod omnia generata sunt a casu, non propter aliquem finem, sed secundum quod contingit ex divisione rerum per litem et coniunctione per amicitiam. Unde dixit quod a principio germinaverunt multa capita sine cervice, et similiter multae aliae partes animalium separatae ab aliis partibus. Et dicit germinaverunt quasi ex elementis producta sine semine animalis, sicut terra germinat herbam virentem. Sed postmodum huiusmodi partes, sic divisae, compositae sunt per concordiam, et ex eis factum est unum animal habens diversas partes, ut puta caput, manus, pedes et huiusmodi. Et ubi est constitutum animal habens omnes partes necessarias ad sui conservationem, idem animal salvatum est, et generavit sibi simile. Si autem defuit alia aliqua aliarum partium, non potuit salvari, nec remansit in sibi simili per generationem. Sicut ergo Empedocles posuit quod amicitia composuit multas partes, et constituit ex eis unum animal, ita et intellectus multa incomplexa prius separata componit, et facit ex eis unum intellectum: in qua compositione, quandoque est veritas, quandoque falsitas.
          <td>747. On the other hand, where truth and falsehood are found in the intelligible objects themselves, there must have been already a certain composition of these objects, i.e. of the things understood, joining several such objects together. He gives as an example the theory of Empedocles that A things originated by chance, not design; by merely following a process of division and conjunction through strife and love respectively. Thus Empedocles said that in the beginning many heads ‘grew’ without necks; and similarly that many other parts of animals grew up in separation from other parts; and he says ‘grew’ as though these things sprang from the elements, not from the seed of animals, as. grass grows from the earth. Only afterwards did these parts, thus differentiated, come together in harmony and make up the single animal with its various parts—head, hands, feet and so on. And if all the parts necessary for the animal’s existence were present it could go on living and would beget its own kind; but not if any were lacking. So then, just as love (according to Empedocles), brought together the different parts of animals and formed of them one animal, so too the intellect is able to combine many simple and separate objects and make one intelligible object of them. And such combinations are sometimes true and sometimes false.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Veritas quidem, quando componit ea quae in re sunt unum, et composita; sicut cum componit asymmetrum, hoc est incommensurabile, et diametrum: nam diameter quadrati est incommensurabilis lateri. Falsa autem compositio est, quando componit ea quae non sunt composita in rebus, sicut cum componit symmetrum diametro, dicens, quod diameter quadrati est symmeter, id est commensurabilis lateri.
          <td>748. They are true when they put together what are combined and united in reality, e.g. the diagonal and incommensurability for the diagonal of a square is incommensurable with its sides. And they are false when they put together what are not combined in reality, saying, e.g. that the diagonal of a square is commensurable with its sides.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Symmetrum et diametrum aliquando separatim et seorsum intellectus intelligit, et tunc sunt duo intelligibilia: quando autem componit, fit unum intelligibile, et simul intelligitur ab intellectu. Sed quia intellectus non semper componit ea quae sunt in praesenti, sed quae fuerunt vel erunt, ideo subiungit, quod si intellectus faciat compositionem factorum, idest praeteritorum et futurorum, oportet quod cointelligat suae compositioni tempus praeteritum et futurum. Et sic componit, formans compositionem de praeterito vel de futuro.
          <td>749. Now commensurability and the diagonal are sometimes understood separately, making two distinct intelligible objects; but when combined they make one object which the mind understands all together. But again, since the objects so combined are sometimes things past or future, not present, he adds that when the mind combines things ‘done’—i.e. past—or things to come, it should include the notion of time past or future; and in this way its combination will refer to past or future.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod hoc sit verum, probat, quia contingit compositionem de praeterito vel de futuro esse falsam, falsum autem semper in compositione est. Et namque falsum est, si non album componatur ei quod est album, ut si dicas, cygnus non est albus: aut si album componatur ei quod non est album, ut si dicatur, quod corvus est albus. Et quia quaecumque contingit affirmare, contingit etiam negare, subiungit quod omnia praedicta possunt per divisionem fieri.
          <td>750. And he proves this by saying that combinations concerning past or future may be false, and that the falsehood is always in the combination itself Again, there is falsehood if the not-white is combined with what is white, as when swans are said to be not white; or if white is combined with the not-white, as when crows are said to be white. And because all that can be affirmed can also be denied, he adds that all these combinations might also have been divisions.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Potest enim intellectus omnia dividere et secundum praesens tempus et secundum praeteritum, et secundum futurum, et vere et false. Sic igitur patet quod cum compositio non solum sit secundum praesens tempus, sed secundum praeteritum et futurum, verum autem et falsum consistit in compositione et divisione, oportet quod verum et falsum non solum sint in propositionibus de praesenti puta quod Cleon est albus, sed etiam in illis de praeterito et futuro, quod Cleon erit vel fuit albus. Considerandum est autem, quod compositio propositionis non est opus naturae, sed est opus rationis et intellectus. Et ideo subiungit, quod illud quod facit unumquodque intelligibilium, componendo ex intelligibilibus propositiones, hoc est intellectus. Et quia verum et falsum consistit in compositione; ideo dicitur in sexto metaphysicorum, quod verum et falsum non est in rebus, sed in mente.
          <td>751. For the mind can always separate things, whether in the present, or past or future; and it can do this both truly and falsely. Clearly then, since combinations can be made with reference to time past and future as well as present, and since truth and falsehood are found precisely in combinations and separations (or divisions), it follows that not only are propositions about the present true or false—e.g. that Cleon is white—but also propositions about the past or future—e.g. that Cleon was or shall be white. Since, however, the combination that makes a proposition is a work of reason and understanding, not of nature, he subjoins that the agent of such propositions, composed of intelligible objects, is the mind. And since it is in combinations that truth and falsehood are found, he can say, in Book VI of the <i>Metaphysics</i> , that truth and falsehood are not in things but in the mind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit indivisibile autem determinat de utraque praedictarum operationum. Et primo de ea, quae est intelligentia indivisibilium. Secundo de ea quae est compositio et divisio, ibi, est autem dictio quidem. Tertio ponit quoddam quod est commune utrisque, ibi, idem autem est secundum actum. Prima pars dividitur in tres, secundum quod indivisibile dicitur tripliciter, quot videlicet modis dicitur et unum, cuius ratio ex indivisione est.
          <td>752. Next, at ‘As the indivisible is twofold’, he comes to conclusions on both the aforesaid intellectual activities: (1) on the understanding of objects simply in themselves; (2) at ‘Now every utterance’ on the intellect’s combinations and divisions; after which (3) he states something common to both. Section (1) divides into three parts according to three ways of considering indivisibility—that is to say, unity which consists in indivision.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicitur enim uno modo aliquid unum continuitate. Unde et illud, quod est continuum, indivisibile dicitur, inquantum non est divisum actu, licet sit divisibile in potentia. Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod cum divisibile dicatur dupliciter, scilicet, actu et potentia, nihil prohibet intellectum intelligere indivisibile cum intelligit aliquid continuum, scilicet longitudinem, quae est indivisibilis actu, licet sit divisibilis potentia. Et propter hoc intelligit eam cum indivisibili tempore, quia intelligit eam, ut indivisibile.
          <td>First of all, a thing may be one by continuity; hence the continuum is called an indivisible because it is actually undivided, though it is potentially divisible. So he says that, since anything may be divisible either potentially or actually, there is nothing to prevent, the mind thinking of a continuum or length as indivisible actually. And, so doing, its thought will also occur in an undivided time.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc est contra opinionem Platonis in primo positam, qui posuit intelligentiam fieri quasi per motum quemdam continuum magnitudinis. Potest ergo intellectus intelligere magnitudinem dupliciter. Uno modo, secundum quod est divisibilis in potentia, et sic intelligit lineam numerando partem post partem, et sic intelligit eam in tempore: alio modo secundum quod est indivisibilis in actu, et sic intelligit eam ut unum quid constans ex multis partibus, et sic intelligit eam simul. Et ideo subiungit, quod similiter tempus et longitudo dividitur vel non dividitur intelligendo.
          <td>753. This is against the view of Plato, that the understanding of things in space involved a sort of continuous movement. In fact spatial things can be understood in two ways: either as potentially divisible—and thus the mind considers one section of a line after another, and so understands the whole in a period of time; or as actually indivisible—and thus the whole line is considered as a unity made up of parts and understood simultaneously. lie adds therefore that, in the act of understanding, either both time and length are divided, or both are not divided.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Unde non est dicere, quod intelligatur secundum medium utriusque, id est quod media pars intelligatur in medio temporis. Hoc enim non esset, nisi linea divideretur in actu; sed est divisibilis tantum in potentia. Si autem utrumque dimidium lineae seorsum intelligat, tunc dividit lineam in actu secundum intellectum. Unde et tunc tempus simul dividitur, sicut et longitudo. Si autem intelligat lineam, sicut unum quid constitutum ex duabus partibus, etiam intelliget in tempore non diviso, sed secundum aliquid quod est in utrisque partibus temporis, scilicet in instanti. Et si continuetur consideratio per aliquod aliud tempus, non dividetur tempus, ut aliud intelligat in una parte temporis, et aliud in alia, sed idem in utraque.
          <td>754. Consequently it cannot be said that the understanding involves dividing both by half, i.e. that half a line is understood in half the given time it takes to understand a whole one. This would be the case if the line were actually divided; but a line, as such, is only potentially divisible. If each of its halves, however, is understood separately, then the whole is actually divided mentally; and the time is divided also. But if the line is understood as a unity made up of two parts, the time also will be undivided or instantaneous—the instant being that which persists in every part of time. And if the mind’s consideration is prolonged in time, the instants will not be separated with respect to distinct parts of the line understood one after another; but the whole line will be understood at every instant.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quod autem ponit alium modum indivisibilis. Nam dicitur alio modo unum, quando habet speciem unam, etsi sit compositum ex partibus non continuis, sicut homo, aut domus, aut etiam exercitus; et huic respondet indivisibile secundum speciem. Et de hoc dicit hic, quod illud, quod est indivisibile non secundum quantitatem, sed speciem, intelligit anima tempore indivisibili, et per indivisibilem animae partem; non quod intellectus intelligens sit aliqua magnitudo, ut Plato posuit. Et licet illud quod est indivisibile specie, habeat aliquam divisionem in partibus, tamen illa divisa intelligit per accidens, non inquantum sunt divisibilia et ex parte eius quod intelligitur, et ex parte temporis, sed inquantum sunt indivisibilia: quia in partibus divisis etiam in actu, est aliquid indivisibile, scilicet ipsa species quam intellectus indivisibiliter intelligit. Sed si intelligeret partes ut divisas, puta carnem per se, et os per se, et sic de aliis, tunc non intelligeret in tempore indivisibili.
          <td>755. Next, at ‘But whatever’, he mentions another kind of unity, namely that which comes of a thing being one in kind, though made up of discontinuous parts, e.g. the unity of a man, or a house, or even of an army. This is a specific, not a quantitative indivision; and the soul, he says, understands it by what is undivided in the soul and in an indivisible point of time—not, as Plato thought, by anything quantitative in the intellect. And though division may be contained in such unities, the divided parts are not understood—so far as the object and time of the understanding are concerned—as divided, but as united; for even though there be an actual division into parts, the species itself, as such, is indivisible; and this it is that is indivisibly understood. But if the parts are understood separately—e.g. the flesh and bones and so forth—the whole is not understood in an undivided time.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Vult autem philosophus consequenter ostendere similitudinem huiusmodi ad primum modum. Sicut enim in hoc modo est aliquid indivisibile, scilicet species, quae facit omnes partes totius esse unum, sic forte in continuis est aliquid inseparabile, scilicet indivisibile, quod facit tempus esse unum et longitudinem unam, sive hoc dicatur esse punctum in longitudine, et instans in tempore, sive ipsa species longitudinis aut temporis. Sed in hoc differt, quod istud indivisibile est similiter in omni continuo, et tempore, et longitudine; sed indivisibile, quod est species, non est similiter in omnibus habentibus speciem; quia quaedam componuntur ex partibus homogeneis, quaedam ex partibus heterogeneis, et ex his dissimiliter.
          <td>756. Then he points out wherein this second kind of unity seems to resemble the former kind. For as the species is something indivisible unifying the parts of a whole, so perhaps there may be something indivisible in any period of time or spatial length,—the point perhaps or the instant, or perhaps the species itself of length and d time. But there is this difference that, while the indivisible in the continuum is one and the same in every continuum, whether temporal or spatial, the unity of species differs from one thing to another; for some things are made up of homogeneous and some of heterogeneous parts.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit punctum autem prosequitur de indivisibili tertio modo dicto. Videtur enim unum esse quod est penitus indivisibile, ut punctus et unitas: et de hoc ostendit nunc, quomodo intelligitur: dicens, quod punctum, quod est quoddam signum divisionis inter partes lineae, et omne quod est divisio inter partes continui, sicut instans inter partes temporis, et sic de aliis, et omne quod est sic indivisibile in potentia et actu, ut punctus, monstratur, idest manifestatur intellectui sicut privatio, idest per privationem continui et divisibilis.
          <td>757. Then at ‘A point etc.’ he goes on to show how the third sort of indivisibility, i.e. whatever seems to be entirely one, such as a point or unit, is understood. A point, he says, is a sort of sign of division between sections of a line, as an instant between periods of time; and all such—being, like the point, both actually and potentially indivisible,—are ‘shown’ to the mind ‘as privation’, i.e. as privations of the divisible continuum.

          <td>Cuius ratio est, quia intellectus noster accipit a sensu; et ideo ea cadunt prius in apprehensionem intellectus nostri, quae sunt sensibilia; et huiusmodi sunt magnitudinem habentia, unde punctus et unitas non definiuntur nisi negative. Et inde est etiam quod omnia quae transcendunt haec sensibilia nota nobis non cognoscuntur a nobis nisi per negationem: sicuti de substantiis separatis cognoscimus, quod sunt immateriales et incorporeae, et alia huiusmodi.
          <td>758. The reason being that our mind has to start from sense data. Sensibles therefore are the first things intellectually apprehended; and these all have some magnitude; hence the point and the unit can be only negatively defined. For the same reason whatever transcends the sensibles which we apprehend is known by us only negatively. Of ‘separated’ substances we only know that they are immaterial and incorporeal and so forth.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et similis ratio est in aliis, quae cognoscuntur per oppositum; ut quando cognoscit intellectus malum, aut nigrum, quae se habent ad sua opposita ut privationes: semper enim alterum contrariorum est ut imperfectum et ut privatio respectu alterius. Et subiungit quasi respondens, quod intellectus cognoscit utrumque istorum aliquo modo, suo contrario scilicet malum per bonum et nigrum per album. Oportet autem quod intellectus noster qui sic cognoscit unum contrariorum per alterum, sit in potentia cognoscens, et quod in ipso sit species unius oppositi per quam aliud cognoscat, ita quod quandoque sit in ipso species albi, et quandoque species nigri, ut per unum possit cognoscere alterum. Si autem est aliquis intellectus, cui non inest unum contrariorum, ad cognitionem alterius, tunc oportet, quod talis intellectus cognoscat seipsum primo et per seipsum cognoscat alia, et quod sit semper in actu, et sit penitus separabilis a materia etiam secundum esse, ut ostensum est de intellectu Dei in duodecimo metaphysicorum.
          <td>759. It is the same with things known by opposition, such as evil or black, which are privations of their opposites; for of two contraries one is always a lack or privation of the other. So he adds that the mind somehow knows each of these by its contrary: evil by good and black by white. Now if our mind thus knows one contrary by means of another, it must do so by moving from potency into act, and also by receiving into itself the likeness of one contrary, e.g. of white, and only after and in virtue of this, the likeness of the other, e.g. of black. But ff there exists a mind that does not have to move from one contrary to another, it must have itself for its primary and immediate object; and it must know all other things in knowing itself; and be always in act and entirely immaterial—even in its being; and such is the Divine Mind according to the teaching of Book XII of the <i>Metaphysics</i> .

          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem determinat de secunda operatione intellectus, quae est compositio et divisio. Et dicit, quod dictio, qua dicit intellectus aliquid de aliquo, sicut contingit in affirmatione, semper est aut vera, vel falsa. Sed intellectus non semper est verus aut falsus, quia intellectus est incomplexorum, qui neque verus aut falsus est quantum ad id quod intelligitur. Veritas enim et falsitas consistit in quadam adaequatione vel comparatione unius ad alterum, quae quidem est in compositione vel divisione intellectus. Non autem in intelligibili incomplexo.
          <td>760. Then at ‘Now every utterance’, he states a conclusion about the mind’s second activity of combining and distinguishing. He says that whenever a statement is made about anything—as when a mind affirms anything—the statement must be either true or false. Understanding as such, however, need not be true or false; its proper object is a simple one, and therefore, as bearing on this object, the act of understanding is neither true nor false. For truth and falsehood consist in a certain adequation or comparison of one thing to another, as when the mind combines or distinguishes; but not in the intelligible object taken by itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed licet ipsum intelligibile incomplexum non sit neque verum neque falsum, tamen intellectus intelligendo ipsum verus est, inquantum adaequatur rei intellectae. Et ideo subdit, quod intellectus, qui est ipsius quid est secundum hoc quod aliquid erat esse, scilicet secundum quod intelligit quid est res, verus est semper, et non secundum quod intelligit aliquid de aliquo.
          <td>761. Yet though this latter object as such is neither true nor false, the mind understanding it is true in so far as it is conformed to a reality understood. So he adds that just so far as the mind bears on an essence, i.e. understands <i>what</i> anything is, it is always true; but not just in so far as it relates one thing to another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et huius rationem assignat, quia quod quid est primum obiectum intellectus: unde sicut visus nunquam decipitur in proprio obiecto, ita neque intellectus in cognoscendo quod quid est. Nam intellectus nunquam decipitur in cognoscendo quod quid est homo. Sed sicut visus non semper verus est in iudicando de his quae sunt adiuncta proprio obiecto, puta si album est homo, vel non, sic intellectus non semper est verus in componendo aliquid alicui. Sic enim se habent intelligendo substantiae separatae, si penitus sunt sine materia, sicut cum nos intelligimus, quod quid est: et ideo in earum intellectu non contingit esse falsum.
          <td>762. The reason for this is that, as he says, essence, is what the intellect first knows; hence, just as sight is infallible with respect to its proper object, so is the intellect with respect to essence. It cannot, for instance, be mistaken when it simply knows what man is; on the other hand, just as sight can be deceived in respect of what is joined with its proper object, e.g. in discerning that some white object is a man, so too the intellect sometimes goes astray in relating one object to another. But the totally immaterial substances understand in a manner corresponding to our human apprehension of essences; so that they are infallible.

          <td>Sciendum tamen est, quod in cognoscendo quod quid est, contingit esse deceptionem per accidens, dupliciter, ratione compositionis intervenientis.

Alio modo, prout partes definitionis non cohaerent sibi invicem; et tunc definitio est falsa simpliciter; ut si aliquis ponat in definitione alicuius animalis insensibile; unde in illis in quorum definitione nulla est compositio, non contingit esse deceptionem; sed oportet ea, vel intelligere vere, vel nullo modo, ut dicitur in nono metaphysicorum.
          <td>763. But note that even in knowing essences deception can occur indirectly, in two ways: (a) inasmuch as one thing’s definition becomes false when applied to another thing; e.g. the definition of a circle applied to a triangle; and (b) inasmuch as the parts of a definition do not agree together, in which case the definition is simply false; e.g. if one were to include ‘lacking sense-perception’ in-one’s definition of ‘animal’. Whence it follows that deception absolutely cannot occur where the definition involves no combining of parts; in this case one either understands truly or not at all (See Book IX of the <i>Metaphysics</i> ).

          <td>764. Finally, at ‘Knowledge in act he repeats what he has said of intellect in act, that actual knowledge is one with its actual object; and that in one and the same thing potential knowledge precedes actual knowledge in time; but that this is not true universally; for all actualities derive from one Actual Being, as was explained above.

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de intellectu secundum se, hic determinat de intellectu per comparationem ad sensum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit qualis sit motus sensus. Secundo, assimilat motum intellectus motui sensus, ibi sentire quidem igitur.
          <td>765. Here the Philosopher turns to consider the intellect as compared with the senses; first explaining the kind of movement that sensation involves; and secondly, showing how this movement resembles that of the intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod sensibile videtur faciens in actu partem sensitivam, ex eo quod erat in potentia. Non enim sic agit sensibile in sensum sicut contrarium in suum contrarium ut aliquid ab eo abiiciat transmutando, et alterando ipsum; sed solum reducit eum de potentia in actum. Et hoc est quod subdit, quod sensitivum neque patitur neque alteratur a sensibili, passione et alteratione proprie accepta, secundum scilicet quod est ex contrario in contrarium.
          <td>On the former point he observes that the sense-object appears to play an active part in sensation, in so far as sensitivity as a whole is, to start with, in potency. For the sense-object and the sense-faculty are not mutually exclusive things, as though, when one acted on the other it had to transform and alter the latter by destroying something within it. In fact, all that the object does to the faculty is to actualise it; so he adds that sensitivity is not passive to the change-producing activity of the sense-object in the ordinary sense of the terms ‘passivity’ and ‘change’, which generally connote the substitution of one, of two mutually exclusive qualities for the other.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia motus, qui est in rebus corporalibus, de quo determinatum est in libro physicorum, est de contrario in contrarium, manifestum est, quod sentire, si dicatur motus, est alia species motus ab ea de qua determinatum est in libro physicorum: ille enim motus est actus existentis in potentia: quia videlicet recedens ab uno contrario, quamdiu movetur non attingit alterum contrarium, quod est terminus motus, sed est in potentia. Et quia omne, quod est in potentia, inquantum huiusmodi, est imperfectum, ideo ille motus est actus imperfecti. Sed iste motus est actus perfecti: est enim operatio sensus iam facti in actu, per suam speciem. Non enim sentire convenit sensui nisi in actu existenti; et ideo iste motus simpliciter est alter a motu physico. Et huiusmodi motus dicitur proprie operatio, ut sentire et intelligere et velle. Et secundum hunc motum anima movet seipsam secundum Platonem, inquantum cognoscit et amat seipsam.
          <td>766. Since, as he shows in the <i>Physics</i> , changes of bodies are of this latter kind, it is clear that if we call sensation a change we mean a different sort of change. Movement from one mutually exclusive quality to another is the actuality of a thing in potency; for while the thing is losing one quality, and so long as it still has not the other, its movement is still incomplete and it is in potency. And because the potential as such is imperfect, this kind of movement is an actuality of the imperfect; whereas the kind we are concerned with here is an actuality of what is perfect,—the response of a sense-faculty already actualised by its object. Only the senses in act can have sensations. So their movement is quite different from physical movement. It is this movement also which, together with understanding and willing, is properly called an ‘operation’: and this also is what Plato referred to when he said that the soul moves itself through knowing and loving itself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sentire igitur assimilat motum intellectus motui sensus. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit qualiter procedit motus in sensu. Secundo ostendit, quod similiter procedit in intellectu, ibi, intellectivae autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod cum sensibile reducat in actum sensitivum sine passione et alteratione, sicut de intellectu supra dictum est; manifestum est ex dictis, quod ipsum sentire est simile ei quod est intelligere, ita tamen quod quando est solum sentire, idest apprehendere et iudicare secundum sensum, hoc est simile ei quod est solum dicere et intelligere: quando scilicet intellectus iudicat aliquid, et apprehendit: quod est dicere, quia simplex apprehensio et iudicium sensus assimilatur speculationi intellectus. Sed quando sensus sentit aliquid delectabile aut triste, quasi affirmans et negans id quod sensu percipitur, esse delectabile aut triste, tunc prosequitur per appetitum, idest desiderat aut fugit. Et dicit signanter, aut affirmans aut negans, quia facere affirmationem et negationem est proprium intellectus, ut supra dictum est. Sed sensus facit aliquid simile huic, quando apprehendit aliquid ut delectabile et triste.
          <td>767. Next, at ‘Sensation therefore’ he likens the intellect’s movement to that of the senses;—first showing how the senses move, and then, at ‘Imaginative phantasms’, how a similar movement takes place in the intellect. As regards the former point he says that, since the sensible object actualises our sensitivity without any accompanying passion (properly so called) or alteration, and the like also happens in intellection, as we have already seen, therefore sensation resembles the act of the intellect—that is to say, mere sensation, with its sensuous apprehension and judgement, resembles mere intellection, with its intellectual apprehension and judgement. Pure sensuous apprehension and discernment resemble intellectual understanding and discernment. But when the senses affirm (so to say) pleasure or pain in their act of perceiving, then appetite comes into play, i.e. a desire or avoidance of the object perceived. And note the phrase ‘so to say’; for properly speaking affirmation and denial are acts of the intellect; but something like them occurs when pleasure or pain is experienced sensuously.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ut sciatur quid sit delectari et tristari, subiungit quod delectari et tristari, est agere sensitiva medietate, idest actio quaedam sensitivae virtutis, quae dicitur medietas, inquantum sensus communis comparatur ad sensus proprios ut quoddam medium, sicut centrum comparatur ad lineas terminatas ad ipsum. Non autem omnis actio sensitivae partis est delectare et tristari, sed quae est respectu boni vel mali inquantum huiusmodi. Nam bonum sensus, scilicet quod est ei conveniens, causat delectationem; malum autem quod est repugnans et nocivum, causat tristitiam. Et ex hoc quod tristari vel delectari, sequuntur fuga et appetitus, id est desiderium, quae sunt secundum actum.
          <td>768. And to show what pleasure and pain are, he observes further that the act of perceiving pleasure and pain takes place in the ‘sensitive mean’; that is to say, it is the act of a certain midway faculty of sense—so called because the common sense is a sort of medium between the particular senses, like the centre of a circle in relation to lines drawn from the circumference. But not every act of the sensitive part is a sense of pleasure or pain. This perception relates precisely to the good and the bad as such. For the good of the senses—i.e. what suits them—gives pleasure; while what is bad, i.e. repugnant and harmful to them, causes pain. And pain and pleasure are followed, respectively, by avoidance and appetite (or desire); and these are a sort of activity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Patet igitur, quod motus sensibilis in sensum procedit quasi triplici gradu. Nam primo apprehendit ipsum sensibile ut conveniens vel nocivum. Secundo ex hoc sequitur delectatio et tristitia. Tertio autem sequitur desiderium vel fuga. Et quamvis appetere vel fugere vel sentire, sint diversi actus, tamen principium eorum est idem subiecto, sed ratione differt. Et hoc est quod subiungit, quod appetitivum et fugitivum, idest pars animae, quae fugit et desiderat, non sunt alterae subiecto, neque abinvicem, neque a parte sensitiva; sed esse aliud est, idest differunt ratione. Et hoc dicit contra Platonem, qui ponebat in alia parte corporis organum appetitivi, et in alia organum sensitivi.
          <td>769. Thus the movement from sense-object to sense passes through three stages, as it were. There is first an awareness of the object as being in harmony or out of harmony with the sense: then a feeling of pleasure or pain; and then desire or avoidance. And although desiring, avoiding and mere sensing are different acts, still they are all acts of identically the same subject, though they can be distinguished in thought. This is What he means by adding that the ‘desiring and avoiding’—i.e. that part of the soul which desires or avoids, is not divided in being nor distinct from the sensitivity; although in ‘essence’ they ‘differ’, i.e. are represented by different concepts. He says this against Plato in particular, who maintained that desire and sensation had distinct organs in different parts of the body.

          <td>770. Next, at ‘Imaginative phantasms’, he compares the mind’s movement to the process of sense-knowledge as he has described it. And he does two things here: he shows how the mind is related (a) to sense-objects, and (b) at ‘The mind understands by abstraction’ to objects beyond the range of sense. (a) divides into (i) an explanation of the way the mind is related to sense-objects in practical activity; and (ii) at ‘And generally in practical affairs’ a comparison of the practical and speculative intellects. And with regard to the former point, he first states and then, at ‘This is comparable to the way’ illustrates the resemblance between the mind’s activity and that of the senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod phantasmata se habent ad intellectivam partem animae, sicut sensibilia ad sensum. Unde sicut sensus movetur a sensibilibus, ita intellectus a phantasmatibus. Et sicut, cum sensus apprehendit aliquid sicut delectabile vel triste, prosequitur illud aut fugit, ita etiam cum intellectus apprehendit aliquid, affirmans vel negans esse bonum vel malum, fugit aut prosequitur.
          <td>First, then, he observes that phantasms are to the intellectual part of the soul as sense-objects to the senses; as these last are affected by their objects, so is the intellect by phantasms. And as sensation of the pleasant or painful is succeeded by desire or avoidance, so also the intellect, when it affirms or desires goodness or badness in an object it apprehends, tends either towards or away from that object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex ipso autem modo loquendi Aristotelis duplex est attendenda differentia inter intellectum et sensum: quia in sensu erant tria. Nam ex apprehensione boni vel mali, non statim sequebatur desiderium vel fuga, sicut hic circa intellectum; sed sequebatur delectatio et tristitia, et ex hoc ulterius desiderium et fuga. Cuius ratio est, quia sicut sensus non apprehendit bonum universale, ita appetitus sensitivae partis non movetur a bono vel malo universali, sed a quodam determinato bono, quod est delectabile secundum sensum, et quodam determinato malo, quod est contristans secundum sensum. In parte autem intellectiva est apprehensio boni et mali universalis: unde et appetitus intellectivae partis movetur statim ex bono vel malo apprehenso.
          <td>771. But note that Aristotle’s use of terms here suggests a two-fold difference between intellect and senses. For in the first place, when the senses apprehend their good and evil, this awareness is not immediately succeeded by pursuit or avoidance, but by pleasure and pain,—after which the sensing subject pursues or withdraws. The reason is that as the senses are not aware of goodness in general, so sense appetition is not swayed by the good or the bad in general, but only by this or that particular good, pleasant to sense, or, by this or that particular evil, unpleasant to sense. The soul’s intellectual part, on the contrary, is aware of goodness and badness in general; hence its appetition at once and immediately responds to this apprehension.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secunda differentia est quod de intellectu dicit simpliciter quod affirmat vel negat; sed de sensu, quod quasi affirmat vel negat. Cuius ratio ex dictis patet. Ex hoc autem quod dixerat, concludit ulterius, quod si phantasmata se habent ad animam intellectivam sicut sensibile ad sensum; sicut sensus non potest sentire sine sensibili, ita anima non potest intelligere sine phantasmate.
          <td>772. The other difference appears in Aristotle’s observing, unconditionally, that the intellect affirms or denies, whereas of the senses he only says that they affirm ‘so to say’. The reason for this has already been given. And from what has been said he draws the further conclusion that if intellect is related to phantasms as the senses to their object, then just as the senses cannot sense without an object, so the soul cannot understand without phantasms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sicut enim manifestat similitudinem positam. Et primo quantum ad hoc quod dixit, quod intellectivae animae phantasmata sunt ut sensibilia. Secundo quantum ad hoc quod dixit, quod cum bonum aut malum affirmat aut negat, fugit aut prosequitur, ibi, species quidem igitur.
          <td>773. Then, where he says ‘This is comparable’, he explains the resemblance still further: (a) as regards the likeness between phantasms and sense-objects in relation to the intellectual soul; and (b)—at ‘The, intellectual faculty therefore’—as regards the avoidance or pursuit that follows the affirmation or denial of goodness or badness.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod aer immutatus a colore, facit pupillam huiusmodi, id est facit eam aliqualem, imprimens in eam speciem coloris; et ipsa, scilicet pupilla sic immutata immutat alterum, scilicet sensum communem; et similiter auditus immutatus ab aere immutat sensum communem. Et licet sensus exteriores sint plures, tamen ultimum, ad quod terminantur immutationes horum sensuum, est unum; quia est quasi quaedam medietas una inter omnes sensus, sicut centrum, ad quod terminantur omnes lineae, quasi ad unum medium.
          <td>First, then, he remarks that colour-affected air itself modifies the pupil of the eye in a particular way, i.e. it imprints on it a likeness of some colour, and that then the pupil, so modified, acts upon the common sense. Similarly our hearing, itself affected by the air, acts upon the common sense. And though there are several exterior senses, their reactions all come back to one point, which is a certain common medium between all the senses, like a centre upon which lines from a circumference all converge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quamvis sit unum subiecto, illud medium omnium sensuum, tamen esse ipsius est plura, id est ratio ipsius diversificatur secundum quod ad diversos sensus comparatur. Et hoc est quo discernit anima, in quo differat dulce et calidum, de quo dictum est prius, cum de ipso secundum se agebatur; et nunc etiam dicendum est de ipso per comparationem ad intellectum, quia est aliquid unum respectu omnium sensibilium, sicut intellectus est terminus omnium phantasmatum. Et sicut ex parte illa erant plura, quae diiudicabantur ab uno, ita et haec ex parte intellectus se habent in quodam modo proportionabili, idest quod proportionabiliter respondet uni diiudicanti circa sensibilia, aut etiam est similitudo quantum ad numerum diiudicatorum: inquantum intellectus se habet ad utraque inter quae discernit sicut illa se habebant adinvicem, idest sicut se habebat unus sensus communis ad diversa sensibilia inter quae discernebat.
          <td>774. And while this mid-point is a unity as a subject, its ‘essence’ is manifold, that is to say, the idea of it varies according as we relate it to the different senses. It is the faculty by which the soul sees the difference between the sweet and the hot, as we saw when we were considering it in itself; and now, relating it to the intellect, we may say that, as all sensible objects find a common terminus in the common sense, so do all phantasms in the intellect. And as in the one case many objects were said to be judged by a single principle, so in the other case also in a like proportion. Again, as to the number of objects judged: the intellect is related to both objects whose distinction it perceives as ‘they’ to one another, i.e. as the single common sense to the different sensibles whose differences it discerns.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et non differt si accipiamus, causa exempli, vel non homogenea, id est diversa sensibilia non unius generis, sicut album, quod est in genere coloris, et dulce quod est in genere saporis, inter quae sensus communis discernit: aut si accipiamus contraria, ut album et nigrum, quae sunt unius generis, quia inter utraque sensus communis discernit.
          <td>775. It makes no difference whether we speak of the non-homogeneous, i.e. of different sensibles differing in genus, for instance of white which is a colour, and sweet which is a savour; or of contrary qualities of the same genus, like black and white. For the common sense discriminates between both kinds of difference.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Accipiamus ergo a, loco albi, et b loco nigri: ut sic se habeat a album ad b nigrum, sicut c ad d: id est sicut phantasia albi ad phantasiam nigri: quare et secundum permutationem proportionum a se habet ad c, sicut b ad d; idest album ad phantasma albi sicut nigrum ad phantasma nigri; et sic se habet intellectus ad c et ad d, scilicet ad phantasma albi et nigri, sicut se habet sensus ad a et b, idest ad album et nigrum. Si igitur c et d, idest phantasmata albi et nigri, sunt inexistentia uni, idest iudicantur ab uno intellectu, sic se habebunt sicut a et b, idest album et nigrum, quae iudicantur ab uno sensu. Ita quod sicut sensus diiudicans haec duo erat unum subiecto, differens ratione; ita erit de intellectu. Et eadem ratio est, si accipiamus non homogenea, ut scilicet a sit dulce, et b sit album.
          <td>776. For white, then, let us put A, and for black, B; so that, as A is to B, so is C to D; the latter standing for the phantasms of white and black respectively, Then, varying the proportions, A is to C as B to D: i.e., white is to the phantasm of white as black to the phantasm of black; and as the intellect is to C and D, so is the sense in question to A and B. If therefore C and D, the phantasms of white and black, are related to a unity in so far as they are judged by one intellect, they resemble in this A and B, namely white and black, which are judged by one sense; so that, just as the sense which discriminates these two is in itself one, but twofold in thought, so also is the intellect. And the same reasoning is valid if we take non-homogeneous objects—taking, for instance, A for sweet and B for white.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit species quidem manifestat quod dixerat supra, quod cum intellectus affirmat vel negat bonum aut malum, fugit aut prosequitur; concludens ex praedictis, quod pars animae intellectiva intelligit species a phantasmatibus abstractas. Et sicut intellectui determinatur aliquid imitabile et fugiendum in illis, scilicet in sensibilibus, cum praesentia fuerint, ita et modo ad imitandum vel fugiendum, cum fiunt in phantasmatibus extra sensum, idest cum repraesentantur phantasmata in absentia sensibilium.
          <td>777. Next, at ‘The intellectual faculty’, he explains what he said above, that in affirming or denying good or evil the mind either avoids or pursues; and so concludes that the intellectual part of the soul understands intelligible forms abstracted from phantasms. And just as, when sensible objects are actually present, the mind is impressed by whatever is congenial or abhorrent in them, so too, in the absence of such objects externally, the mind is induced to desire them or fly from them by their representations present in the imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ponit exemplum de utroque. Et primo, quando movetur ad praesentiam sensibilium, sicut homo sentiens aliquid quod fugiendum est, idest aliquod terribile, puta fremitum aliquem, sicut cum videt, quod ignis est accensus in civitate, videns ignem moveri, cognoscit communi, idest aliqua potentia communi diiudicativa, vel communi, idest ab eo quod communiter accidere solet, cognoscit, inquam, quoniam sunt praelia, vel quoniam est aliquid pugnans, et sic movetur aliquando intellectus ad fugiendum vel imitandum ex sensibili praesente. Aliquando autem ex phantasmatibus, aut intelligibilibus quae sunt in anima, ratiocinatur, et deliberat futura aut praesentia, tamquam si actu videret. Et cum iudicat aliquid esse laetum vel triste, fugit hoc, aut imitatur, ut ibi quando movebatur a praesenti sensibili.
          <td>778. And he gives examples. First, of the process that is started by sense-objects actually present—as when a man sees something fearful, for instance the confusion caused by a fire in a city; seeing the flames leaping he knows ‘in general’—i.e. by some common faculty of judging, or perhaps according to what commonly happens—that a conflict is raging; and thus the mind is moved to pursue or flee by objects present exteriorly. But sometimes phantasms or ideas presented inwardly cause the soul to deliberate about things future or present, reckoning them to be desirable or horrible,—as though they were actually seen here and now.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit et omnino comparat cognitionem intellectus practici et speculativi; dicens quod verum et falsum, idest vera et falsa cognitio intellectus in actione idest secundum quod pertinet ad intellectum practicum, et sine actione idest secundum quod pertinet ad intellectum speculativum, est in eodem genere, sive illud genus sit bonum sive malum. Quod potest dupliciter intelligi. Uno modo sic, quod res intellecta vel practice vel speculative, quandoque est bona, quandoque est mala. Neque diversificatur propter hoc genus rei, quod consideratur speculative vel practice. Alio modo potest intelligi, quod ipsa cognitio vera est quoddam bonum intellectus sive speculativi sive practici. Et ipsa cognitio falsa est quoddam malum intellectus, sive speculativi sive practici.
          <td>779. Next at ‘And generally’,:’ he compares speculative with practical knowledge. Truth and falsehood, he says, i.e. true and false knowing, both in the sphere of action (the practical intellect) and outside that sphere (the speculative intellect), belong to the same category, whether good or evil. This can be taken in two ways: (1) That the thing understood, either speculatively or practically, may be either good or bad, and that it remains such from the point of view of either mode of understanding; or (2) that the knowing itself is, if true, a good for the intellect, whether it be speculative or practical; whereas if false, it is an evil for the intellect, again in both cases.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Non ergo intendit comparare verum et falsum bono et malo secundum convenientiam generis, sed verum et falsum, quod est in actione, vero et falso quod est sine actione. Et hoc patet ex differentia quam subdit, dicens, quod differt, scilicet quod est in actione, et quod est sine actione, in eo quod est simpliciter et quodam. Nam intellectus speculativus considerat aliquod verum esse vel falsum in universali, quod est considerare simpliciter: intellectus autem practicus applicando ad particulare operabile, quia operatio in particularibus est.
          <td>780. Thus he is not reducing truth and falsehood to a common genus with good and evil, but truth and falsehood in action to a common genus with truth and falsehood in speculation. This is clear from his distinguishing ‘in-action’ and ‘not-in-action’ as ‘absolute’ and ‘relative’. For the speculative intellect considers a thing as true or false universally or ‘absolutely’, whereas the practical intellect relates its apprehensions to particular things to be done; for doing is always in the particular.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit abstractione autem quia dixerat philosophus, quod nequaquam sine phantasmate intelligit anima, phantasmata autem a sensu accipiuntur; vult ostendere quomodo intellectus noster intelligit ea quae sunt a sensibus separata. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit quomodo intelligit mathematica, quae a materia sensibili abstrahuntur. Secundo, inquirit utrum intelligat ea quae sunt secundum esse a materia separata, ibi, utrum autem contingat. Circa primum considerandum est, quod eorum quae sunt in rebus coniuncta, contingit unum sine altero intelligi, et vere, dummodo unum eorum non sit in ratione alterius. Si enim Socrates sit musicus et albus, possumus intelligere albedinem, nihil de musica intelligendo. Non autem possum intelligere hominem, nihil intelligendo de animali, quia animal est in ratione hominis. Sic ergo separando secundum intellectum, quae sunt secundum rem coniuncta modo praedicto, non contingit falsitas.
          <td>781. Then, at ‘The mind understands’ having already said that there is no act of the intellect without a phantasm, and that phantasms derive from sensation, the Philosopher begins to explain how we understand things that are outside the range of sensation. Here he proceeds in two stages: (1) he explains how we understand mathematical objects abstracted from sensible matter; and (2) he enquires whether we understand anything that is immaterial in being at ‘Whether it is possible’. As regards the first point, note that of things joined in reality the mind may think, and think truly, of one without the other, provided that the concept of the one is. not included in that of the other. If Socrates is both white and musical his whiteness can be understood without regard to his musical character; but I cannot understand ‘man’ if I do not understand ‘animal’, for the concept of man includes animal. Thus it is possible to distinguish mentally things conjoined in reality, and yet not fall into error.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem intellectus intelligat ea quae sunt coniuncta, esse separata, esset intellectus falsus: ut puta si in praedicto exemplo, diceret musicum non esse album: ea vero, quae sunt in sensibilibus, abstrahit intellectus, non quidem intelligens ea esse separata, sed separatim vel seorsum ea intelligens. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod intellectus intelligit ea, quae sunt dicta per abstractionem, scilicet mathematica, hoc modo sicut dum intelligit simum secundum quod est simum, non intelligit separate, id est seorsum, simum a materia sensibili, quia materia sensibilis, scilicet nasus, cadit in definitione simi.
          <td>782. But if the conjoined things were understood as separate things the mind would err,—as, to take our former example, if it judged that the musical person was not white. Certain aspects, however, of sense-objects the mind simply considers in separation or distinctly, without judging them to exist separately. This is what he. means by saying that what the mind understands by abstraction (even mathematical objects) it understands in the same way as, e.g., a snub-nose; understanding it precisely as a snub-nose, yet not in separation from sensible matter; for sensible matter, the nose, is included in the definition of a snub-nose.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem intellectus intelligit aliquid in actu, inquantum est curvum, sine carne intelligit inquantum est curvum: non quidem ita quod intelligat curvum esse sine carne; sed quia intelligit curvum, non intelligendo carnem. Et hoc ideo, quia caro non ponitur in definitione curvi. Et sic intellectus intelligit omnia mathematica separate, tamquam si essent separata, quamvis non sint separata secundum rem.
          <td>783. When, however, the mind understands actually anything precisely as curved, it abstracts from flesh; not that it judges the curved thing to be not flesh, but it understands ‘curved’ without regard to flesh; because flesh does not enter into the definition of a curve. And it is thus that we understand all mathematical objects, —as though they were separated from sensible matter, whilst in reality they are not so.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Non autem sic intelligit naturalia; quia in definitione naturalium ponitur materia sensibilis, non autem in definitione mathematicorum. Abstrahit tamen circa naturalia intellectus universale a particulari simili modo, inquantum intelligit naturam speciei sine principiis individuantibus, quae non cadunt in definitione speciei. Et omnino intellectus in actu est res intellecta, quia sicut res in sui ratione habent materiam vel non habent, sic ab intellectu percipiuntur. Et quia hunc modum abstractionis Plato non consideravit, coactus fuit ponere mathematica et species separatas, loco cuius ad praedictam abstractionem faciendam Aristoteles posuit intellectum agentem.
          <td>784. But we do not so understand physical things; for in their definition (unlike mathematical objects) sensible matter is included. Yet in understanding them we still abstract a universal from particulars, in so far as the specific nature is understood apart from the individuating principles; for these do not enter into the definition. And the mind in act is its object; for precisely in the degree that the object is or is not material, it is or is not perceived by the mind. And just because Plato overlooked this process of abstraction he was forced to conceive of mathematical objects and specific natures as existing in separation from matter; whereas Aristotle was able to explain that process by the agent intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit utrum autem movet quaestionem de his quae sunt separata a materia secundum esse, dicens quod posterius considerandum erit, utrum contingat intellectum nostrum non separatum a magnitudine, idest a corpore, intelligere aliquid separatorum, idest aliquam substantiam separatam. Haec enim quaestio hic determinari non potuit, quia nondum erat manifestum esse aliquas substantias separatas, nec quae vel quales sint. Unde haec quaestio pertinet ad metaphysicum: non tamen invenitur ab Aristotele soluta, quia complementum illius scientiae nondum ad nos pervenit, vel quia nondum est totus liber translatus, vel quia forte praeoccupatus morte non complevit.
          <td>785. Next, at ‘Whether it is possible’, he puts a question about things that exist immaterially: whether, that is, our intellect, though conjoined with spatial magnitude (i.e. the body), can understand ‘anything separated’, i.e. any substance separated from matter. He undertakes to pursue this enquiry later,—not at present, because it is not yet evident that any such substances exist nor, if they do, what sort of thing they are. It is a problem for metaphysics. In fact, we do not know Aristotle’s solution of this problem, for we have not the whole of his <i>Metaphysics</i> ; either because it is not yet all translated, or possibly because he died before he could complete it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum tamen est quod intellectum hic dicit non separatum a corpore, inquantum est potentia quaedam animae, quae est actus corporis. Supra tamen dixit eum a corpore separatum, quia non habet aliquod organum deputatum suae operationi.
          <td>786. We should note, however, that when he speaks of the intellect here as not ‘separated’ from the body he refers to the fact that it is one of the powers of the soul, which is the actuality of the body; whereas speaking, at an earlier stage, of the intellect as ‘separated’ he was referring to its non-organic mode of activity.

          <td>787. After treating of its powers of sense and intellect the Philosopher goes on now to draw conclusions about the nature of the soul: showing first that the early philosophers were partly right and partly wrong about the soul; and then explaining how the intellect depends on the senses. As to the former point, he first explains how the soul, as the early philosophers said, is in a way all things; and then how it is not all things in the way they supposed. He says then, recapitulating, that one can admit that the soul is in a way all things; for everything is either sensible or intelligible, and sense and intellect (or science) are in the soul, sense being somehow the sensible, and intellect, or science, the intelligible or the scientifically knowable.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et qualiter hoc sit oportet inquirere. Sensus enim et scientia dividuntur in res, idest dividuntur in actum et potentiam quemadmodum et res, ita tamen quod scientia et sensus quae sunt in potentia ad sensibilia et scibilia, se habent ad scibilia et sensibilia quae sunt in potentia; scientia vero et sensus quae sunt in actu, ordinantur in sensibilia et scibilia quae sunt in actu, sed tamen diversimode. Nam sensus in actu, et scientia vel intellectus in actu, sunt scibilia et sensibilia in actu. Sed potentia animae sensitivae, et id quod scire potest idest potentia intellectiva, non est ipsum sensibile vel scibile, sed est in potentia ad ipsa. Sensitivum quidem ad sensibile; quod autem scire potest, ad scibile. Relinquitur igitur quod anima quodammodo sit omnia.
          <td>788. But we must ask how this is so. For sense and intellectual knowledge are divided ‘into realities’, that is, their division into act and potency corresponds to a like division in reality; but in such a way that while potential intellectual or sensuous knowledge answers to things potentially understood or sensed, and actual intellectual or sensuous knowledge answers to things actually understood or sensed, there is a difference between the two relationships. For the sense in act and the intellect in act are the objects they actually sense or understand; but neither the sensitive nor the intellectual potency is actually its object; it is only so potentially. And that is how the soul is ‘somehow’ everything.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit necesse est ostendit quod alio modo est omnia, quam antiqui ponerent; et dicit, quod si anima est omnia, necesse est quod sit, vel ipsae res scibiles et sensibiles, sicut Empedocles posuit quod terra terram cognoscimus, et aqua aquam, et sic de aliis; aut sit species ipsorum. Non autem anima est ipsa res, sicut illi posuerunt, quia lapis non est in anima, sed species lapidis. Et per hunc modum dicitur intellectus in actu esse ipsum intellectum in actu, inquantum species intellecti est species intellectus in actu.
          <td>789. Next, at ‘Now they must be’ he shows how the ancients misapplied this formula. He says that if the soul is indeed all things, it must be either simply identical with all things or a formal likeness of all things. The former view was that of Empedocles who made out that we, being earth, know earth, and being water we know water, and so on. But obviously the soul is not simply identical with the things it knows; for not stone itself, but its formal likeness exists in the soul. And this enables us to see how intellect in act is what it understands; the form’ of the object is the form of the mind in act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo patet quod anima assimilatur manui. Manus enim est organum organorum, quia manus datae sunt homini loco omnium organorum, quae data sunt aliis animalibus ad defensionem, vel impugnationem, vel cooperimentum. Omnia enim haec homo sibi manu praeparat. Et similiter anima data est homini loco omnium formarum, ut sit homo quodammodo totum ens, inquantum secundum animam est quodammodo omnia, prout eius anima est receptiva omnium formarum. Nam intellectus est quaedam potentia receptiva omnium formarum intelligibilium, et sensus est quaedam potentia receptiva omnium formarum sensibilium.
          <td>790. Thus the soul resembles the hand. The hand is the most perfect of organs, for it takes the place in man of all the organs given to other animals for purposes of defence or attack or covering. Man can provide all these needs for himself with his hands. And in the same way the soul in man takes the place of all the forms of being, so that through his soul a man is, in a way, all being or everything; his soul being able to assimilate all the forms of being—the intellect intelligible forms and the senses sensible forms.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem quia dixerat quod intellectus est quodammodo intelligibilis, sicut sensus sensibilis, posset aliquis credere, quod intellectus non dependeret a sensu. Et hoc quidem verum esset si intelligibilia nostri intellectus essent a sensibilibus separata secundum esse, ut Platonici posuerunt. Et ideo hic ostendit, quod intellectus indiget sensu. Et postmodum quod intellectus differt a phantasia, quae etiam a sensu dependet, ibi, est autem phantasia. Dicit ergo primo, quod quia nulla res intellecta a nobis, est praeter magnitudines sensibiles, quasi ab eis separata secundum esse, sicut sensibilia videntur abinvicem separata: necesse est quod intelligibilia intellectus nostri sint in speciebus sensibilibus secundum esse, tam illa quae dicuntur per abstractionem, scilicet mathematica, quam naturalia, quae sunt habitus et passiones sensibilium. Et propter hoc sine sensu non potest aliquis homo addiscere quasi de novo acquirens scientiam, neque intelligere, quasi utens scientia habita. Sed oportet, cum aliquis speculatur in actu, quod simul formet sibi aliquod phantasma. Phantasmata enim sunt similitudines sensibilium.
          <td>791. Next, at ‘But since there are’: the doctrine just stated, namely that intellect is, in a way, the intelligible object as sense is the sensible object, might lead one to suppose that the intellect did not depend on the senses; as would be the case indeed if the intelligible objects attained by our mind had their existence apart from sensible things, as the Platonists thought. So he now shows the intellect’s dependence on the senses; and then goes on (at ‘Imagination is other’ ) to show that it differs, none the less, from imagination which also depends on the senses First, then, he observes that, since all the objects of our understanding are included within the range of sensible things existing in space, that is to say, that none seems to have that sort of distinct existence apart from things of sense which particular things of sense have apart from one another, it follows that all these intelligible objects have their beings in the objects of sense; this being true not only of the objects studied by natural science, the properties and modifications of things of sense, but even of mathematical abstractions. It follows then that without some use of the senses we can neither learn anything new, as it were for the first time; nor bring before our understanding any intellectual knowledge already possessed. Whenever the intellect actually regards anything there must at the same time be formed in us a phantasm, that is, a likeness of something sensible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in hoc differunt ab eis, quia sunt praeter materiam. Nam sensus est susceptivus specierum sine materia, ut supradictum est. Phantasia autem est motus factus a sensu secundum actum.
          <td>792. Phantasms, however, differ from things of sense by their immateriality. For as we have shown, the senses receive the forms of things immaterially; and phantasms are nothing but movements started by actual sensation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Patet autem ex hoc falsum esse, quod Avicenna ponit, quod intellectus non indiget sensu postquam acquisivit scientiam. Manifestum est enim quod postquam aliquis acquisivit habitum scientiae, necesse est ad hoc quod speculetur, quod utatur phantasmate; et propter hoc per laesionem organi impeditur usus scientiae iam acquisitae.
          <td>It will be clear now that Avicenna erred in saying that once the mind had acquired knowledge it no longer needed the senses. For we know by experience that in order to reflect on knowledge already gained we have to make use of phantasms; and that any injury to the physical apparatus underlying these will tend to prevent our using the knowledge we already have.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit est autem ostendit differentiam inter phantasiam et intellectum.

Nam cognoscere verum et falsum est solius intellectus.
          <td>793. Then at ‘Imagination is other’ he distinguishes between intellect and imagination. (1) With respect to the normal activity of the intellect, which is by composing and dividing, he says that imagining is neither intellectual affirmation nor intellectual denial; for these immediately involve truth and falsehood; which is not the case with imagining. Only the intellect knows truth and falsehood.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundo ibi primi autem inquirit in quo differant primi intellectus, idest intelligentiae indivisibilium, cum non sint phantasmata. Et respondet, quod non sunt sine phantasmatibus, sed tamen non sunt phantasmata, quia phantasmata sunt similitudines particularium, intellecta autem sunt universalia ab individuantibus conditionibus abstracta: unde phantasmata sunt indivisibilia in potentia, et non in actu.
          <td>794. (2) He asks (at ‘What difference etc.) how the primary intellectual notions, the understanding of indivisible objects, differ from phantasms; and he replies that while these are always attended by phantasms, they differ from phantasms by their universality: they are abstracted from individuating conditions, whereas phantasms are always of particulars. Phantasms in fact are not actually, but only potentially, indivisible.

          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de partibus animae vegetativa, sensitiva et intellectiva, nunc quarto determinat de parte animae motiva. Et dividitur in partes duas. In prima dicit de quo est intentio. In secunda prosequitur, ibi, habet autem dubitationem. Dicit ergo primo, quod quia anima quae est animalium, definita est etiam ab antiquis philosophis secundum duas potentias, idest secundum quod habet potentiam ad duo quorum unum est discretio, quae fit per cognitionem, quae quidem discretio opus est intellectivae et sensitivae partis, aliud autem est movere secundum locum: de sensu et intellectu sunt tanta determinata, quanta in prioribus habita sunt. Sed nunc speculandum est de alia parte scilicet principio movente, quid animae sit. Utrum scilicet sit aliqua pars animae separabilis ab aliis, vel magnitudine, id est subiecto, ita quod habeat distinctum locum in corpore ab aliis potentiis, sicut Platonici posuerunt: vel sit separabilis ab aliis animae partibus, ratione tantum. An non sit pars animae, sed sit tota anima. Et dato quod sit aliqua pars animae, remanet considerandum utrum sit quaedam alia pars animae praeter illas quae consueverunt dici, et praeter eas quae a nobis dictae sunt, aut est una earum.
          <td>795. Having studied the soul in its vegetative, sensitive and intellectual parts, the Philosopher now considers it as a subject of movement. Introducing the problem, he observes first of all that the old philosophers defined the life-principle of animals in terms of two capacities: the capacity to discern or know, which is the function of intellect and sense; and the capacity to move from place to place. It is the latter capacity that we are concerned with now. We want to understand the principle of movement in relation to the soul: whether, if it is a part of the soul, it is really spatially separate from the other parts, so that it is located in a special part of the body, as the Platonists supposed; or, on the contrary, separable only in thought; whether perhaps it is not a part at all, but the entire soul; and whether, granted that it is only a part, it is or is not distinct from the parts usually enumerated, and distinct from those already studied in this treatise.

Primo recitat divisionem potentiarum animae, quam quidam ponebant. Secundo disputat contra eas, ibi, secundum enim differentias.
          <td>796. Next, at ‘A difficulty etc.’, he begins a controversial section, which itself leads him, at ‘It seems that there are two’, to certain conclusions. This section contains two parts: (1) an argument against a certain division of the powers of the soul; and (2) an argument, at ‘But of local motion’, concerning especially the motive-principle as a part of the soul. As regards (1) he first states a division of the powers of the soul made by some philosophers, and then, at ‘For according to’, disputes it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod mox in principio huius inquisitionis habet dubitationem, quomodo oporteat distinguere partes animae, et quot sunt: quia secundum aliquem modum videntur infinitae esse, idest non posse comprehendi sub aliquo certo numero. Et hoc verum esset, si singulis operibus animae et motibus qui sunt ab anima, necesse esset attribuere diversas partes animae: et sic videtur quod non sint solum illae partes quas quidam determinant, scilicet rationalem, irascibilem, appetitivam, idest concupiscibilem. Haec quidem divisio non comprehendit omnes animae partes, sed solum vires motivas in homine.
          <td>He begins then by saying that we are met at the outset of our enquiry by the problem of dividing the soul’s powers. What should be the principle of this division, and how many powers are there? It has seemed to some that the number of these powers was infinite, i.e. quite indeterminable; and this would indeed be the truth if every act or movement in the soul had to be assigned to its own distinct part. Thus it would seem inadequate to divide the soul, as some do, into a rational part, an irascible part, and an appetitive (i.e. concupiscible) part; for these include only the motive powers of the soul.

          <td>797. And if others make the dividing line fall between the powers that share in reason and those that do not, this division, though comprehensive enough in a sense, is not exactly relevant to the parts of the soul as such, but only to the parts of the rational soul; and so Aristotle uses it in the <i>Ethics</i> .

(1) Granted that the differences just mentioned between the various parts of the soul are truly differences, they are not the only ones; the soul has other parts, already mentioned in this Treatise, which differ even more from one another. For instance, in all plants and animals (and thus in all living things) exists the vegetative part; and in all animals the sensitive part; and these two obviously differ from each other, and also from the rational, irascible and concupiscible parts, more than these last two parts from each other. Yet neither is included in the divisions given above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod non comprehendantur sub prima divisione manifestum est. Patet enim quod neque vegetativa neque sensitiva potest dici esse rationabilis, vel concupiscibilis, vel irascibilis. Unde hoc praetermisso, probat, quod haec non comprehendantur sub secunda divisione; dicens quod non de facili potest aliquis, vel vegetativam vel sensitivam ponere, vel irrationalem, vel rationem habentem.
          <td>799. Not, it is clear, in the first division: for neither vegetability nor sensitivity can be called either rational, irascible or concupiscible. Again, passing to the second division, Aristotle shows that neither vegetativity nor sensitivity are envisaged thereby. It is difficult, he says, to identify either with what shares or does not share in reason.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quidem quod neutra harum habeat rationem, manifestum est. Sed quod neque etiam aliqua earum sit irrationabilis, ex hoc manifestum esse potest: quia irrationabile est, vel quod est contrarium rationi, vel quod est natum habere rationem et non habet: quorum neutrum contingit dictis partibus. Si enim diceret tantum negationem rationis, non posset poni genus potentiarum animae. Unde manifestum videtur, quod praemissae divisiones potentiarum animae sint inconvenientes.
          <td>800. That neither is rational in nature is obvious; but we can also show that neither is irrational. For the irrational means what is either anti-rational or lacking a rationality that it ought to possess; and neither of the aforesaid parts is such. Whereas if one were simply to call them non-rational they would not constitute, properly speaking, a classification of the soul’s powers. Clearly, then, the aforesaid divisions are inadequate.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ad idem ponit ibi adhuc autem dicens quod pars animae phantastica, qua secundum rationem ab omnibus aliis differt, habet multam dubitationem cum qua praedictarum potentiarum debeat esse eadem vel altera; et praecipue si aliquis ponat partes animae separatas subiecto, sicut aliqui ponebant.
          <td>801. (2) Then, at ‘Further, there is’, he observes that it is very hard to decide whether imagination, which can certainly be distinguished in thought from the rest of the soul, is or is not really the same thing as any one of the powers already mentioned; especially if we were to follow those who say that the parts of the soul are really separate beings.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi adhuc autem dicit quod vis etiam appetitiva videtur esse altera ratione et potentia ab omnibus partibus animae. Et si secundum praedictam divisionem, partes animae subiecto distinguantur in rationalem et irrationalem inconveniens videbitur sequestrare, idest, dividere appetitivam in duas partes subiecto differentes: et tamen hoc oportebit, si quis dicat rationale et irrationale partes animae subiecto distinctas; quia quaedam appetitiva est in parte rationabili, idest voluntas, quaedam in parte irrationabili scilicet irascibilis et concupiscibilis. Et siquis distinguat partes animae in tres subiecto distinctas, scilicet rationalem, irrationalem et irascibilem, sequetur quod in unaquaque earum erit appetitus: in rationabili enim est voluntas, ut dictum est: irascibili inest appetitus, et similiter concupiscibili. Erunt igitur tres appetitus in anima subiecto differentes secundum praedictam divisionem.
          <td>802. (3) Then again, at ‘Furthermore, there is’, he remarks that the appetitive capacity seems distinct, both in thought and as a real potency, from other parts of the soul. Now, assuming that the soul was so divided into a rational and an irrational part that each was a thing distinct from the other, one would have to ‘split up’, i.e. to divide the appetitive capacity in the same way—a very questionable procedure; and yet this capacity is certainly in part rational or volitional, and in part irrational (the irascible and concupiscible parts). Similarly, if we add the irascible part as a distinct thing to the rational and irrational parts of the soul, we should have to posit a different appetitive force in each: in one a volitional force, in another an irascible force, and in the third a concupiscible force; making three distinct things of this kind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quaeritur quare in appetitu sensitivo sunt duae potentiae appetitivae, scilicet irascibilis et concupiscibilis, in appetitu autem rationali est unus appetitus tantum, scilicet voluntas. Et dicendum est, quod potentiae distinguuntur secundum rationes obiectorum. Obiectum autem appetitivae est bonum apprehensum.
          <td>803. But the question now arises why the sensitive part of the soul has two appetitive capacities, the irascible and the concupiscible, whereas there is only one rational appetitive force, the will. I answer that potencies differ according to the objective terms of their acts; and the objective term of appetite is the good as apprehended.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alio autem modo apprehendit bonum intellectus et sensus. Nam intellectus apprehendit bonum secundum universalem rationem boni; sensus autem apprehendit sub determinata ratione boni. Et ideo appetitus qui sequitur apprehensionem intellectus, est unus tantum. Appetitus autem qui sequuntur apprehensionem sensus, distinguuntur secundum diversam rationem boni apprehensi. Nam aliquid apprehensum per sensum, habet rationem boni appetibilis, inquantum est delectabile secundum sensum; et ad hoc bonum ordinatur concupiscibilis. Aliquid autem habet rationem boni et appetibilis, inquantum perficitur delectabilibus, quasi habens facultatem ad libitum utendi eis; et ad hoc ordinatur irascibilis, quae est quasi propugnatrix concupiscibilis. Et inde est quod animalia non irascuntur neque pugnant nisi propter delectabilia, id est propter cibos et venerea, ut dicitur in sexto de historiis animalium.
          <td>804. Now the intellect and the senses apprehend the good differently: the intellect apprehends it under a general idea of goodness; but the senses in this or that particular determination. And this is why there is only one kind of appetite following intellectual apprehension, whereas the desire arising from sensuous apprehension divides according to diverse kinds of apprehended good. For some things seem good to the senses simply as affording pleasure; and this kind of goodness is answered by the concupiscible appetite. But other things seem good and desirable as terminating in pleasure in so far as by means of them one is enabled freely to enjoy pleasant things; and to this good corresponds the irascible appetite; which fights, as it were, on behalf of the concupiscible. Thus animals only get angry and fight for things that will afford them pleasure, that is to say, when they are hunting or mating, as it says in Book VI of the <i>Historia Animalium</i> .
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et propter hoc omnes passiones irascibilis incipiunt a passionibus concupiscibilis, et terminantur in eis. Ira enim tristitia commovetur, et in delectationem finitur. Irati enim puniendo delectantur. Et propter hoc quidam dicunt, quod obiectum irascibilis est arduum.
          <td>805. Therefore every movement of the irascible appetite starts from and ends in a movement of the concupiscible appetite. Anger springs from a sadness and ceases in a pleasure; for the angry find their satisfaction in punishing. Hence some say that to overcome obstacles is the precise object of the irascible appetite.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quod autem a quibusdam dicitur, quod irascibilis ordinatur ad fugam mali, nullam omnino habet rationem. Eadem enim est potentia contrariorum, sicut visus albi et nigri: unde bonum et malum non possunt diversificare potentiam appetitivam. Et propter hoc, sicut amor boni pertinet ad concupiscibilem, ita odium mali, ut dicit philosophus in nono Ethicorum; et spes de bono et timor de malo pertinent ad irascibilem.
          <td>806. But it is quite unreasonable to say, as some do, that the specific function of this appetite is to avoid evils. For one and the same potency bears upon contraries—as sight upon both black and white; hence good and evil cannot by themselves differentiate the appetitive potency. Hence, just as loving some good pertains to the concupiscible appetite, so does hating an evil (as Aristotle says in Book, IX of the <i>Ethics</i> ); and similarly both the hope of good and the fear of evil pertain to the irascible appetite.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit ibi sed iam dicens, quod etiam illud, de quo nunc quaerimus, scilicet quid sit movens animal secundum locum, facit dubitationem circa praedictas divisiones; quia non videtur sub eis contineri. De motu autem augmenti et decrementi, qui est communis omnibus viventibus, manifestum est, quod habet principium commune omnibus viventibus, secundum generativam et vegetativam. Quaedam autem aliae mutationes animalium sunt, sicut respiratio et expiratio, somnus et vigilia, de quibus posterius determinandum est, quid causet ea. Habent enim multam dubitationem; et propter hoc specialem exigunt tractatum.
          <td>807. Then, at ‘But to come’, he observes that what we are at present concerned to elucidate (the principle of local movement in animals) does not seem to be accounted for by the aforesaid divisions; and that this is a further point against the latter. Now clearly the movements of growth and decline, common to all living things, spring from some common generative and vegetative principle; whereas certain other mutations, such as breathing in and out, or sleeping and waking, are not at all easy to explain and require to be treated of separately later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sed de motu procedit disputative ad inquirendum quid sit principium motus secundum locum in animalibus. Et primo ostendit, quod non sit vegetativa potentia. Secundo quod nec sensitiva, ibi, similiter autem neque sensitiva. Tertio quod nec intellectiva, ibi, at vero neque ratiocinativa. Quarto quod nec appetitiva, ibi, at vero neque appetitus. Dicit ergo primo, quod considerandum nunc est, quid sit movens animal secundum locum motu processivo.
          <td>808. Then, at ‘But of local motion’ he asks what is the principle of local movement in animals. And he shows first that it is not the vegetative principle; secondly, at ‘Likewise’, that it is not sensitivity; thirdly, at ‘Nor is the reasoning faculty’, that it is not the intellect; and fourthly, at ‘But not even appetition’, that it is not the appetitive power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod non sit potentia vegetativa, ostendit duabus rationibus: quarum prima talis est. Semper motus processivus secundum locum, est propter aliquid imaginatum et desideratum. Non enim animal movetur nisi appetens aut fugiens aliquid, nisi forte per violentiam: sed phantasia et appetitus non competit parti vegetativae: ergo pars vegetativa non est principium motus localis processivi.
          <td>That it is not the vegetative principle he proves by two arguments. The first is as follows. Local movement from place to place is always occasioned by something the animal imagines and desires; no animal moves (except under compulsion) unless it wants, or withdraws from, something. But since the vegetative principle is without imagination and desire, it cannot be the principle of this kind of local movement.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi, amplius et quae talis est. Pars vegetativa est etiam in plantis: si igitur pars vegetativa esset principium motus localis processivi, sequeretur quod plantae essent motivae suiipsarum secundum hunc motum, et haberent partes organicas convenientes huic motui: quod patet esse falsum. Non ergo pars vegetativa est principium motus localis processivi in animalibus.
          <td>809. The second argument at ‘Further: plants’, runs thus. If the vegetative part were this principle, all plants would move about in this way, and be equipped with the necessary organs for doing so: which they obviously do not and are not. Therefore...
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit similiter autem ostendit quod neque etiam sensus est principium talis motus, tali ratione. Sensus enim est omnibus animalibus: si ergo sensus esset principium praedicti motus, sequeretur quod omne animal hoc modo moveretur. Quod patet esse falsum: quia multa sunt habentia sensum, quae tamen manent semper in eodem loco, et sunt immobilia per finem, id est quamdiu vivunt.
          <td>810. Next, at ‘Likewise’, he shows that sensitivity is not the principle we are seeking. For if it were, every animal would have the power to move from place to place. But many animals, though capable of sensation, are fixed in one place and motionless so long as they live.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia posset aliquis credere, quod non est propter hoc quod deficiat eis principium motivum, sed quia deficiunt eis instrumenta apta ad motum; ideo ad removendum hoc, subiungit quod natura nihil facit frustra, neque deficit in necessariis, nisi in animalibus orbatis et imperfectis, sicut sunt animalia monstruosa: quae quidem monstra animalibus accidunt praeter intentionem naturae, ex corruptione alicuius principii in semine. Sed animalia immobilia sunt perfecta in sua specie, et non sunt orbata quasi monstra: cuius signum est, quia generant sibi simile, et habent debitum augmentum et decrementum, quod non est in animalibus orbatis; ergo et in huiusmodi animalibus natura nihil facit frustra, neque deficit in necessariis. Unde sequitur, quod si haberent principium motus, quod haberent partes organicas dispositas ad motum processivum. Alias principium motivum esset in eis superfluum, et necessaria ad executionem potentiae motivae eis deficerent. Ex hoc autem accipere possumus, quod cuicumque inest aliquod principium vitae, insunt ei organa convenientia illi principio; et quod partes corporis sunt propter partes animae.
          <td>811. And to meet the objection that perhaps the reason why such animals are immobile is that they lack, not the principle, but the organs of movement, he adds that Nature is never purposeless: it never fails to provide what is necessary for a given animal, unless this animal is deformed or a monster; and such monsters are exceptions to the normal course of nature, being caused by some defect or other in the parental seed. Now these immobile animals are perfect in their own way, not deformed like monsters: they generate offspring in their own likeness and grow and decline quite normally. In them, therefore, Nature does not act without purpose or fail in what is necessary for life. If then they were endowed with a motive-principle they would also have organs of motion; otherwise this principle would be useless, being unequipped with the necessary instruments: Note that this reasoning implies that wherever a vital principle exists there also will be found a corresponding organic apparatus; and that the parts of a living body subserve the powers of its soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero neque ostendit quod etiam intellectus non est principium motivum: et dicit, quod neque ratiocinativa, quae vocatur intellectus, videtur esse movens. Unde accipere possumus, quod ratio et intellectus non sunt diversae partes animae, sed ipse intellectus dicitur ratio, inquantum per inquisitionem quamdam pervenit ad cognoscendum intelligibilem veritatem.
          <td>812. Next, where he says ‘Nor is the reasoning faculty’, he shows that not even mind is the motive-principle we seek. His words, ‘nor is the reasoning faculty... called intellect’, indicate, by the way, that reason and intellect are not distinct parts of the soul. The intellect is called ‘reason’ in so far as it comes to intelligible truths by a process of enquiry.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod intellectus non sit principium motus, probat primo quantum ad speculativum intellectum; quia cum intellectus speculativus speculative consideret ea quae sunt tantum speculabilia, et nullo modo agibilia, sicut cum considerat quod triangulus habet tres angulos aequales duobus rectis, et alia huiusmodi; manifestum est, quod speculativus intellectus non speculatur aliquid agibile, neque dicit aliquid de fugibili et persequibili; et sic non potest movere; quia semper motus est fugientis aliquid secundum appetitum aut prosequentis.
          <td>813. That intellect is not the principle of movement he first proves with regard to the speculative intellect. So far as the mind merely considers things which are simply objects of speculation, not things to be done (e.g. that a triangle has three angles equal to two right angles) it is obviously not concerned with action and makes no judgement as to what should be avoided or pursued. In this state therefore the mind initiates no movement; for all movement is a pursuit of, or withdrawal from, something, by way of appetition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aliquando autem intellectus considerat aliquid agibile, non tamen practice, sed speculative, quia considerat ipsum in universali, et non secundum quod est principium particularis operis. Et de hoc consequenter dicit, quod neque intellectus, cum fuerit speculatus, idest speculative consideraverit, aliquid huiusmodi, idest aliquid agibile, nondum praecipit prosequi vel fugere: sicut cum multoties intelligimus terribile aliquod vel delectabile. Sed intellectus non iubet timere vel desiderare; sed aliquando movetur cor ad timendum, absque imperio intellectus. Et si iterum delectabile moveat appetitum, erit aliqua alia pars, quam cor, quae movetur.
          <td>814. Again, the mind sometimes considers something to be done, yet not in a practical or effective way, but only speculatively,—considering it universally, not in view of an action in the particular. So he says that so far as the ‘speculative’ mind considers ‘something of this kind’, i.e. as the intellect regards even a practical affair in a merely speculative way, it makes no decision as yet about decision or flight. Thus we can often think of terrible or desirable things without commanding ourselves to fear or desire them; even if, for example, our hearts are moved by fear. And if, he adds, it is a desirable thing that moves us, it does so through some other organ than the heart.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc dicit propter opinionem Platonis, qui posuit partes animae esse subiecto distinctas; ita quod irascibilis, cuius est timere, sit in corde, et concupiscibilis sit in aliqua alia parte corporis, puta in hepate. Sic igitur manifestum est, quod intellectus speculative considerando aliquid agibile, non movet. Ex quo patet, quod intellectus speculativus nullo modo movet aliquid.
          <td>815. (This he adds with Plato in mind, who located the parts of the soul in different parts of the body, the irascible part, whence fear arises, in the heart; and the concupiscible in some other organ such as the liver.) Clearly then a merely speculative consideration, even of something practical, does not of itself move to action. As such the speculative intellect is in no way a motive power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit amplius et probat, quod nec etiam intellectus practicus movet: dicens, quod nec etiam intellectu practico praecipiente, quod contingit cum intelligentia dicit aliquid fugiendum aut prosequendum, non propter hoc homo movetur, sed agit secundum concupiscentiam; sicut patet de incontinentibus, qui habent rationem rectam, sed non inhaerent rationi rectae; unde videtur quod intellectus non moveat. Probat autem idem ex medicis, qui habentes scientiam medicativam non sanantur, quia non faciunt ea in seipsis, quae praecipit ars eis. Ex quo videtur, quod agere secundum scientiam non sit scientiae practicae, sed alicuius alterius.
          <td>816. Next at ‘Further, when’, he shows that not even the practical intellect moves to action. For when a man, he says, comes to a decision, understanding that something should be avoided or pursued, he may nevertheless fail to follow this intellectual decision and follow his feelings instead,—as incontinent people do, who know what ought to be done but fail to carry it out. It would seem therefore that mere intellect does not suffice to move us. Similarly, doctors may know quite well how to recover health yet not recover it, because they fail to put into practice their own prescriptions. Apparently then, to act according to knowledge involves something else besides even practical knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero ostendit quod pars appetita non sit dominativa super hunc motum, quia videmus quod continentes appetunt et concupiscunt, sed non operantur ea quorum habent appetitum. E converso est in incontinentibus, ut manifestius apparet in septimo Ethic. Videtur igitur quod neque appetitus moveat.
          <td>817. Lastly, with ‘But not even appetition’, he shows that the appetitive part itself does not simply command our movements; for we may see continent people in a state of want and desire yet refusing to act according to their desires. And the converse is true of the incontinent, as he explains more clearly in the <i>Ethics</i> , Book VII. So it seems that neither is appetition the cause of movement.

            <td>Now, the intellectual power which reasons to some purpose in view, and is practical, differs in its end from the speculative. Appetition also is always for a purpose; for that of which there is desire is the principle of the practical ‘intellect. The last end is the first principle of action. Hence, it seems reasonable to take these two as the motive forces, appetition, and the practical reason. For the object of appetite causes motion; and it is for this that reason also initiates movement, the desirable being its principle. And when imagination moves, it only does so with appetition. Therefore there is one single mover,—the object desired. For if there were two movers, intellect and appetition, they would move in virtue of some common principle. Now reason does not appear to cause movement apart from appetency; for will is an appetency. When there is movement by reason there is also movement by will. But appetition moves apart from reason, for concupiscence is a sort of appetition. §§ 820-5

For the subject desiring is moved in so far as it desires, and its desire is an act or movement of a certain kind. What receives the motion is the animal.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus processit disputative ad inquirendum quid sit principium motus localis in animalibus, hic determinat veritatem. Et primo ostendit in universali, quid sit principium motus. Secundo quomodo hoc principium diversimode in diversis reperitur, ibi, omnino quidem igitur. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit quid sit principium motus in animalibus. Secundo docet ordinem, quomodo motus iste completur, quantum ad motores et mobilia, ibi, specie quidem igitur. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ponit esse duo principia motus. Secundo reducit ea in unum, ibi, intellectus autem. Tertio solvit obiectionem superius positam, ibi, quoniam autem.
          <td>818. So far the Philosopher has pursued his enquiry into the principle of local movement in animals by the method of refuting unsatisfactory solutions; but now he states the positive truth on the matter: first, showing in general what that principle is; and secondly, at ‘Generally then’, how it varies in different subjects. The first point again divides into (a) a statement of the motive principle in animals; and (b), at ‘The motive-force will therefore’, an analysis of the factors at work when this principle is in action. Again (a) subdivides into three points: (1) That there are two motive-principles; which (2) he reduces to one, at ‘Now the intellectual power’, while with (3) he answers an objection (at ‘Since appetites.’) already raised.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod consideratis his quae praedicta sunt, cum manifestum sit quod vegetativa pars non sit movens, et similiter neque sensus, cum non omnia, in quibus haec sunt, moveri inveniantur, ut patet ex dictis: videntur duo haec esse moventia, scilicet appetitus et intellectus; ita tamen quod sub intellectu phantasia comprehendatur, quae habet aliquid simile intellectui, inquantum movet ad absentiam sensibilium sicut intellectus, quia haec etiam est principium motus.
          <td>First, then, he says that the foregoing examination makes it clear that neither the vegetative nor the sensitive part is the motive-principle, since they are found in things that do not move. So it would seem that the moving principles are two: intellect and appetency. Note, however, that he includes imagination under intellect; for it resembles intellect in that it impels to action in the absence of sense-objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Multi enim homines praetermissa scientia intellectus, sequuntur in suis motibus phantasiam, sicut illi, qui non secundum rationem agunt, sed impetu moventur ad aliquid agendum. Et in aliis animalibus manifestum est, quod nunquam intellectus est neque ratio quae movere possit, sed solum phantasia. In hominibus vero est phantasia et intellectus. Sic ergo manifestum est, quod utraque haec movent; scilicet intellectus comprehendens sub se phantasiam, et appetitus.
          <td>819. For in their actions many people follow the changes in their imaginations rather than rational knowledge; for instance, those who act impulsively without reflection. Besides, other animals ate obviously only impelled to action through imagination, not through intellect or reason; but men through both intellect and imagination. Clearly, then, both these are motive-principles: intellect (including imagination) and appetition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit intellectus autem reducit praedicta moventia in unum. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit propositum. Secundo ex eo, quod est ostensum, assignat causam cuiusdam accidentis circa motum animalium, ibi, intellectus quidem igitur. Tertio improbat divisionem potentiarum, quam antiqui ponebant, ibi, dividentibus autem.
          <td>820. Then at ‘Now the intellectual,’ he reduces the two to one; and this in three stages: (1) justifying the reduction; (2), at ‘All intellect, then, is right,’ using it to show the cause of a particular accidental factor in animal movements; and (3) refuting, at ‘For those who divide’ an early division of the powers of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod intellectus, qui movet, est intellectus qui ratiocinatur propter aliquid, non propter ratiocinari tantum; et hic est intellectus practicus, qui differt a speculativo secundum finem. Nam speculativus speculatur veritatem, non propter aliquid aliud, sed propter seipsum tantum; practicus autem speculatur veritatem propter operationem.
          <td>First, then, he says that the mind as a motive-principle is the mind in so far as it reasons for some purpose other than mere reasoning; in other words, it is the practical reason, which differs from the speculative by a different finality; for while the latter regards truth for its own sake and nothing else, the practical reason relates its knowledge of truth to some deed to be done.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et manifestum est, quod omnis appetitus est propter aliquid. Stultum enim est dicere, quod aliquis appetat propter appetere. Nam appetere est quidam motus in aliud tendens. Sed illud cuius est appetitus, scilicet appetibile, est principium intellectus practici. Nam illud, quod est primo appetibile, est finis a quo incipit consideratio intellectus practici. Cum enim volumus aliquid deliberare de agendis, primo supponimus finem, deinde procedimus per ordinem ad inquirendum illa, quae sunt propter finem; sic procedentes semper a posteriori ad prius, usque ad illud, quod nobis imminet primo agendum. Et hoc est quod subdit quod ultimum de actione intellectus practici, est principium actionis; idest illud, unde debemus actionem incipere. Unde rationabiliter dictum est, quod haec duo sunt moventia, scilicet appetitus, et intellectus practicus. Quia enim ipsum appetibile, quod est primum consideratum ab intellectu practico, movet, propter hoc dicitur intellectus practicus movere, quia scilicet eius principium, quod est appetibile, movet.
          <td>821. Now obviously every appetition is for some end beyond itself. It is absurd to say that desire is for the sake of desiring; desire is essentially a tendency to ‘the other’. Moreover, an object of desire is always the practical reason’s starting point; what is first desired provides the end whence its deliberations begin. If we wish to weigh a course of action we first lay down some end and then deliberate about the means, moving back, so to say, from what is to come later on to what is immediately to be done at the beginning. So he adds that the last thing that the practical reason considers is the first thing that has to be done—i.e. the starting point of the whole action. This is why it is reasonable to assert that both appetition and the practical reason are motive-principles; for the object desired certainly incites to action, and it is also what the practical reason first considers; so that the latter is said to impel to action because the starting point of its deliberations, the object desired, does so.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod dicitur de intellectu, intelligendum est etiam de phantasia; quia cum phantasia movet, non movet sine appetitu. Non enim movet, nisi inquantum repraesentat appetibile, sicut nec intellectus.
          <td>822. And what is said of the intellect may be applied to the imagination; if it moves it does so only in virtue of an object desired: of which it contains, like the intellect, a representation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sic igitur apparet, quod unum est movens, scilicet appetibile; hoc enim appetitum movet, et est principium intellectus, quae duo ponebantur moventia.
          <td>823. So it is clear that there is ultimately one mover, the object desired. For this both moves appetition and affords a starting point for the practical intellect—the two motive-principles which have been assumed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc rationabile est, quod haec duo moventia reducantur in unum, quod est appetibile: quia si ponebantur haec duo intellectus et appetitus esse moventia, respectu eiusdem motus, cum unius effectus sit una causa propria, necesse est quod moveant haec duo secundum aliquam communem speciem. Non est autem dicendum quod appetitus moveat sub specie intellectus, sed magis e converso; quia intellectus non invenitur movens sine appetitu; quia voluntas, secundum quam movet intellectus, est quidam appetitus.
          <td>824. And it is reasonable that these two principles should be reduced to unity in the object of desire; for if both intellect and appetition are principles with respect to one and the same movement they must, as such, share the same specific nature; since a single effect implies always a single cause of precisely that one effect. Now it cannot be said that appetite is a moving principle through sharing the specific nature of intellect, but rather <i>e converso</i> ; for intellect only moves anything in virtue of appetition. It moves by means of the will, which is a sort of appetition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ratio huius assignatur in nono metaphysicorum: quia cum ratio scientiae practicae se habeat ad opposita, non movet, nisi determinetur ad unum per appetitum. Sed appetitus movet sine ratione, sicut patet ex his quae ex concupiscentia moventur. Concupiscentia enim est appetitus quidam. Exemplificat autem magis de concupiscentia quam de ira, quia ira habet aliquid rationis, non autem concupiscentia, ut probat philosophus in septimo Ethicorum. Et sic patet quod moventia reducuntur in unum, quod est appetibile.
          <td>825. The explanation of this (given in Book IX of the <i>Metaphysics</i> ) is that the practical reason is essentially balanced between alternatives; nor can it initiate movement unless appetition fixes it exclusively upon one alternative. Appetition, on the other hand, can move to action independently of reason, as we see in the case of the concupiscible desire which is a sort of appetite. He mentions this desire rather than the irascible because, unlike the irascible, it has no admixture of rationality (as he shows in Book VII of the <i>Ethics</i> ). Clearly, then, the motive-principles are reducible to the one object of appetition.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit intellectus quidem assignat ex praedictis rationem cuiusdam accidentis circa motum vel actionem; ostendens scilicet quare in actionibus et motibus nostris erramus. Et dicit quod omnis intellectus est rectus: quod intelligendum est de intellectu principiorum. Non enim erramus circa prima principia in operabilibus, cuiusmodi sunt, nulli nocendum esse, non esse aliquid iniuste agendum, et similia; sicut nec erramus circa prima principia in speculativis. In his autem quae sunt post principia, si quidem recte consideramus, procedit ex rectitudine quae est circa prima principia. Si autem a rectitudine deviamus, procedit ex errore qui accidit in ratiocinando. Sed appetitus et phantasia, qui etiam movent, sunt et cum rectitudine, et sine rectitudine. Et ideo in actionibus nostris contingit deficere a rectitudine secundum quod deficimus ab intellectu et ratione. Unde patet ex praedictis quod appetibile semper movet.
          <td>826. Next at ‘All intellect then’ he applies what has been said to a particular accidental factor in movement or action, explaining why we go amiss in our actions. ‘All intellect’, he says, ‘is right’, by which he means that we never err about the first principles of action, about such truths as ‘it is wrong to do harm to anyone’, or ‘injustice is never right’, and so on. Those principles correspond to the equally infallible first principles of the speculative reason. But as for the consequences of these first principles, if we apprehend them aright it is because our thought is consistent with our grasp of the principles, whereas if we deviate from the truth the fault lies in our reasoning. Appetition and imagination (motive-principles likewise) may be, on the other hand, either right or wrong. Hence if we act amiss it is, in the last analysis, because we fall short of what we intellectually know; and our previous conclusion stands, that the final motive-impulse comes from the object of desire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem appetibile, est aut vere bonum, quando persistitur in iudicio intellectus recti, aut apparens bonum quando declinat a iudicio intellectus recti, propter appetitum vel phantasiam. Non autem omne bonum est appetibile et movens, sed bonum agibile, quod est bonum applicatum ad operationem; et hoc contingit aliter se habere, sicut omnia quae nostrae actioni subduntur. Unde bonum ultimum et necessarium in sua universitate consistens, non movet. Manifestum est igitur quod potentia animae quae dicitur appetitus, sit movens.
          <td>827. Now this object is either a real good or a seeming good: it is a real good if the mind’s original correct judgement is maintained; it is only a seeming good if appetite or imagination cause a deflection from that judgement. Yet not every good is desirable as a cause of action, but only the good-as-term-of-action, i.e. a good that is actually related to our actions. And precisely as such no such good is always good in the same way; for it must vary in relation to ourselves. That is why the ultimate and absolute good, regarded in its universality, does not, as such, move us to act. Clearly, then, the final motive force derives from the soul itself acting through the appetitive power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit dividentibus autem excludit illud quod antiqui dixerunt de distinctione partium motivarum; dicens, quod dividentibus partes animae in rationalem, irascibilem et concupiscibilem, si ipsi intendunt distinguere potentias animae abinvicem separatas, multo plures fient quam ipsi ponant; scilicet vegetativum, sensitivum, intellectivum, consiliativum, et appetitivum. Distinguit autem consiliativum ab appetitivo, sicut in sexto Ethicorum distinguitur ratiocinativum quod est contingentium, a scientifico, quod est necessariorum, et ea ratione quae ibi tangitur. Hae autem partes animae plus differunt abinvicem quam concupiscibile et irascibile, quae comprehenduntur sub appetitu sensitivo; unde plures sunt partes, quam ipsi ponant.
          <td>828. Then at ‘For those who divide’, he rejects an old division of the motive parts of the soul into the rational, irascible and concupiscible potencies. If, he says, the intention was to enumerate the potencies which are really distinct from each other, others should have been included, namely the vegetative, sensitive, intellectual, deliberative and appetitive powers. These last two are distinguished in the same way and for the same reason as, in the <i>Ethics</i> , Book VI, Aristotle distinguishes the ratiocinative faculty, which has to do with contingent matters, from the scientific faculty which has to do with necessary objects. All these parts of the soul differ more than the irascible and concupiscible, which are both included in the sensitive appetite. Hence that old division was incomplete.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem excludit quamdam obiectionem supra positam ad ostendendum quod appetitus non movet, per hoc quod continentes appetitum non sequuntur. Sed haec ratio solvitur; quia in homine sunt contrarii appetitus, quorum unum continentes sequuntur, et alii repugnant. Dicit ergo, quod quia possunt fieri appetitus contrarii adinvicem, hoc contingit cum ratio concupiscentiae contrariatur: et fit idest accidit hoc in habentibus sensum temporis, idest qui non solum cognoscunt quod in praesenti est, sed considerant praeteritum et futurum; quia intellectus quandoque ab aliquo concupiscibili retrahere iubet, propter futuri considerationem. Sicut cum febricitanti, ex iudicio intellectus videtur a vino abstinendum esse, ne febris incalescat. Sed concupiscentia incitat ad accipiendum propter ipsum iam, idest propter illud quod in praesenti est: videtur enim quod in praesenti est delectabile, esse simpliciter delectabile et bonum, ex eo quod non consideratur ut futurum.
          <td>829. Next, at ‘Since appetites may’, he meets an objection already touched upon, namely that if desire were a motive force, nobody would be continent; the continent, by definition, do not follow their desires. But this difficulty vanishes if we consider that in man there are contrary appetites, of which the continent follow one and reject the rest. Contrariety of desires springs out of an opposition between reason and the concupiscible appetite; and this happens ‘in beings possessing a time-sense’, i.e. that are aware, not of the present moment only, but of past and future as well. For sometimes the mind forbids a man to indulge a desire in view of what will happen in the future if it is indulged: thus a man in a state of fever sees with his mind that he ought to abstain from drinking wine. But desire prompts one to take things for the sake of ‘what is now’ i.e. in the present moment. For what is here and now pleasant seems absolutely pleasant and good if it is not related to the future.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit specie quidem ostendit ordinem motus. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit quomodo moventia sunt unum, et quomodo plura. Secundo quomodo ordinantur adinvicem, ibi, quoniam autem tria sunt. Tertio summarie determinat de unoquoque eorum quaedam, quae ad motum requiruntur, ibi, nunc autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod si moventia considerantur formaliter et secundum speciem, unum erit movens, scilicet appetibile vel appetitivum, quia inter omnia primum movens est appetibile; hic enim est movens non motum, inquantum est imaginatum vel intellectum. Manifestum est enim, quod secunda moventia non moventur, nisi inquantum participant primum. Unde omnia conveniunt in specie primi moventis. Quamvis autem omnia conveniant in specie primi moventis, tamen numero sunt plura.
          <td>830. Then at ‘The motive-force’ he analyses the process of the movements in question; and this in three stages. First, he shows how the factors in movement are at once many and one. Next, at ‘Since there are these three’, he explains how they are interrelated. Finally, at ‘Now, in short’, he briefly defines each of the factors on which movement depends. First, then, he observes that if the moving principles are considered formally and specifically they are reducible to one, to the object of desire or appetite; for this is the absolute starting point of movement, inasmuch as, being itself unmoved, it initiates movement through the mind or the imagination. And because the secondary motive-principles only move in virtue of their share in the primary one, therefore they all as such partake of the nature of this primary one. And yet, though specifically one, they are numerically many.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit quoniam autem assignat ordinem motus; et dicit quod tria sunt quae inveniuntur in motu. Unum, quod est movens, et aliud est organum quo movens movet, et tertium est quod movetur. Movens autem est duplex: unum quidem immobile, et aliud quod est movens motum. In motu igitur animalis, movens quod non movetur, est bonum actuale, quod movet appetitum prout est intellectum vel imaginatum. Sed movens motum, est ipse appetitus; quia omne quod appetit, inquantum appetit movetur, et ipsum appetere est quidam actus vel motus, prout motus est actus perfecti, prout dictum est de operatione sensus et intellectus. Quod autem movetur est animal. Organum autem, quo appetitus movet, est aliquid corporeum, scilicet quod est primum organum motus; et ideo de huiusmodi organis considerandum est in operationibus communibus animae et corporis. Determinat enim de hoc in libro de causa motus animalium. In hoc enim libro intendit determinare de anima secundum se.
          <td>831. Then at ‘Since there are these three’, he interrelates three factors in movement: (1) the mover, (2) the organ by which it moves, and (3) the thing moved. Now the mover is twofold: an unmoved mover, and a mover that moves through being moved itself. In the case of animals, the unmoved mover is some actual good influencing desire through the intellect or imagination. The mover moved is the desire itself, for whatever desires is moved inasmuch as it desires, desire itself being a certain act or movement in the sense that we give to the term ‘movement’ when we apply it to activities that are consequent upon actuality, such as sensing and understanding. Then the thing moved is the animal itself. And the organ by means of which desire issues into movement is a part of the body; it is the primary motor-organ; hence it has to be treated along with the activities common to body and soul (and is, in fact, examined in the <i>De Causa Motus Animalium</i> ). But here and now we are concerned particularly with the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit nunc autem summarie determinat de organo motus localis: et dicit, in summa, quod primum movens organice oportet tale esse, ut in eodem sit et principium et finis motus, sicut in quadam circulatione, in qua est gibbosum et concavum, quorum unum est quasi finis, et aliud quasi principium. Nam concavum est sicut finis, gibbosum autem videtur esse sicut principium motus. Secundum concavitatem enim contrahitur in seipso, secundum gibbositatem vero attenditur eius dilatatio, prout ab ipso fit principium motus et pulsus.
          <td>832. Next, at ‘Now, in short” he briefly states his view on the organ of local motion. He says that the primary organic motive-principle must be such that the movement starts and finishes in the same point, proceeding in a circle, as it were, and having a swelling out at the starting point and a concavity at the end. For the contractual movement draws the organ into concavity, while the expansive impulse, whence movement begins, follows a swelling out of the organ.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quia in ipso est principium motus et finis; principium autem motus oportet esse immobile in unoquoque motu, sicut cum movetur manus quiescit brachium, et cum movetur brachium quiescit humerus, et sicut omnis motus ab aliquo immobili procedit; oportet quod in ipso organo motus quod est cor, sit aliquid quiescens, inquantum est principium motus, et aliud quod movetur, inquantum motus terminatur ad ipsum. Et haec duo in ipso, scilicet quiescens et motum sunt diversa ratione, licet subiecto et magnitudine sint abinvicem inseparabilia.
          <td>833. Now, granted that this primary organ is both the starting point and term of movement, it must, as starting point, be motionless, and, as term, in movement; and both these at once. For in any movement the starting point itself does not move, all movement must proceed from the motionless,—as, for instance, while the hand is moving the arm is still, and while the arm moves the shoulder is still. However, these two factors in the organ, the motionless and the moved, though distinct in thought, are substantially and spatially inseparable.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et quod oporteat id esse principium motus et finis, et per consequens quiescens et mobile, manifestum est ex hoc, quod omnis motus animalis componitur ex pulsu et tractu. In pulsu autem id quod est movens, est tantum principium motus, quia pellens elongat a se id quod pellitur. Sed in tractu id quod movet est terminus motus, quia trahens ad se movet id quod trahitur. Et propter hoc oportet quod primum organum motus localis in animali, sit et ut principium motus, et ut terminus.
          <td>834. And that the organ is both starting point and term (and therefore both motionless and moved) is dear from the fact that all animal movements consist of impulsions and retractions. In impulsion the motive force comes from the starting point, for the impelling agent thrusts itself forward against what is impelled. But in retraction the motive force comes from the term, for the drawing power draws something back to itself Thus the first organ of local motion in animals must be at once both a starting point and a term.

          <td>Et ideo oportet quod in eo sit aliquid manens, et tamen quod hinc incipiat motus, sicut apparet in motu circulari. Nam corpus quod circulariter movetur, propter immobilitatem centri et polorum, non mutat totaliter locum, nisi forte ratione; sed secundum totum manet in eodem loco secundum subiectum; partes autem variant locum subiecto, et non ratione tantum: sic etiam est in omni motu cordis. Nam cor in eadem parte corporis confixum manet, sed movetur secundum dilatationem et constrictionem, ut causet motum pulsus et tractus; et sic quodammodo est mobile, et quodammodo quiescens.
          <td>835. So then there must be in it something that stays still and yet initiates motion. And in this it resembles circular movement: for a body revolving in a circle is kept as a whole in the same place by the immobility of the centre and the poles. In thought it may move as a whole, but not in reality. In reality it keeps to one place. But its parts are changing their places really, and not only in thought. And so it is with the heart: it remains fixed in the same part of the body while it dilates and contracts and so gives rise to movements of impulsion and retraction. Thus it is, in a sense, both motionless and moving.

Hence [reason] is able to make one phantasm out of several.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de principio motivo secundum localem motum in communi et secundum se, nunc determinat de ipso per comparationem ad diversa genera animalium. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit quid sit commune omnibus animalibus participantibus motum. Secundo quomodo principium motivum inveniatur in animalibus imperfectis, ibi, considerandum autem de imperfectis. Tertio ostendit quomodo hoc principium motus sit in animali perfectissimo, quod est homo, differenter ab aliis animalibus, ibi, sensibilis quidem.
          <td>836. The Philosopher now passes from a general consideration of the principle of local movement in itself to viewing it in relation to different types of animal. And he does three things here. First, he states what is common to all animals that move; then, at ‘Now we must consider’, he discusses the motive-principle of imperfect animals; and thirdly, at ‘Sensitive imagination’, that of the most perfect animal, man, in whom this principle exists in a unique way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod omne animal inquantum est appetitivum, sic est suiipsius motivum. Nam appetitus est causa propria motus. Sed appetitivum non est sine phantasia, quae est vel rationalis, vel sensibilis. Sensibili autem phantasia, alia animalia ab homine participant, non autem rationali phantasia.
          <td>First, then, he observes that all animals have the power of self-movement inasmuch as they have appetition; for appetition is precisely the cause of movement. Now appetition connotes imagination, either rational or merely sensuous; and while the latter is found in other animals, the former is proper to man alone.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Considerandum autem est, quod sicut supra dictum est, sicut sub intellectu phantasiam comprehendit, ita etiam phantasiam usque ad intellectum extendit, sequens nominis rationem. Nam phantasia apparitio quaedam est: apparet autem aliquid et secundum sensum et secundum rationem. Phantasia etiam habet suam operationem in absentia sensibilium, ut ratio et intellectus.
          <td>837. Note, however, that, just as Aristotle has included imagination under the term ‘intellect’ so now he extends the term ‘imagination’ to denote something intellectual; and in this he is guided by the meaning of the term itself For imagination is a sort of appearance; and things ‘appear’ to both sense and intellect. Besides, imagination can function, like reason or intellect, in the absence of exterior sense-objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit considerandum autem ostendit quid sit principium motus in animalibus imperfectis. Et dicuntur animalia imperfecta, quibus inest solum sensus tactus. Et dicit, quod considerandum est quid moveat ea; utrum scilicet in eis sit phantasia et concupiscentia, vel non. Videtur autem, quod in eis sit concupiscentia, quia in eis videtur esse laetitia et tristitia. Retrahunt enim se, cum ab aliquo nocivo tanguntur, et aperiunt se et extendunt in illud quod est eis conveniens; quod non fieret, nisi in eis esset dolor et delectatio. Si haec autem sunt in eis, necessarium est quod in eis sit concupiscentia. Sed cum concupiscentia ex sensu fiat delectationis, sequitur quod concupiscentia non sit sine phantasia.
          <td>838. Then, at ‘Now we must consider’, he points to the motive-principle in imperfect animals, that is, in those which have no sense but touch. We must ask, he says, what it is that moves these animals: can it be imagination and desire? They seem indeed to have desires, for they seem to feel joy and displeasure: they shrink back when touched by things that trouble them, but open out and extend themselves towards things that suit them, which implies a sense of pain and pleasure. And this in turn implies desire. And since desire springs from a sense of pleasure, it must involve some kind of image-representation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Restat ergo quaerendum, quomodo in eis sit phantasia. Et respondet quod sicut moventur, ita inest huiusmodi animalibus et phantasia et concupiscentia. Moventur autem non determinate, quasi intendentia aliquem determinatum locum, in suo motu, sicut accidit in animalibus quae moventur motu processivo, quae imaginantur aliquid distans, et illud concupiscunt et ad illud moventur. Sed huiusmodi animalia imperfecta non imaginantur aliquid distans, quia nihil imaginantur nisi ad praesentiam sensibilis. Sed cum laeduntur imaginantur illud ut nocivum, et retrahunt se; et cum delectantur, extendunt se super illud, et applicant se illi. Et sic in eis est phantasia vel concupiscentia indeterminata, inquantum imaginantur et concupiscunt aliquid ut conveniens non autem ut hoc aut illud, hic aut ibi; sed habent confusam imaginationem et concupiscentiam.
          <td>839. But of what kind is this? An answer, he says, may be gleaned from considering the movements of these animals. They do not move as with a definite end in view, as if intending to arrive at any particular spot, as do the animals that move from one place to another and that form an inward image of things at a distance, and so desire these things and move towards them. The imperfect animals form images only of objects actually present to their exterior sense—not of things at a distance. When they are hurt the image which they form conveys to them the exterior object as harmful, and thus they shrink from it. And as soon as anything affords them pleasure they reach out to it and cling to it. Thus both imagination and desire in them are indefinite, in the sense that they form images which warn or attract them without being images of any distinct thing in this or that definite place. They have a confused imagination and desire.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sensibilis igitur ostendit quod principium motivum sit in hominibus. Et circa hoc tria facit. Primo ostendit, quomodo principium movens in hominibus est ratio deliberans. Secundo quomodo aliquando deliberatio rationis per appetitum vincitur, ibi, vincit autem. Tertio ostendit quae ratio sit movens, ibi, scientificum autem. Dicit ergo primo, quod phantasia sensibilis, ut ex dictis patet, est etiam in aliis animalibus; sed illa, quae est per deliberationem, est tantum in rationalibus; quia considerare utrum hoc sit agendum, aut hoc quod est deliberare, opus est rationis.
          <td>840. Next, at ‘Sensitive imagination’, he points out the motive-principle in man; and this in three stages. He shows first how this principle is the deliberative reason; next, at ‘Appetite sometimes overcomes’, how it is sometimes overcome by desire; and thirdly, at ‘The cognitive faculty’, of what ‘reason’ he is speaking here. First, then, he says that while sensuous imagination exists also in other animals, deliberative imagination is proper to rational ones; to deliberate, that is to weigh alternatives, is a function of reason.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et in tali consideratione necesse est accipere aliquam unam regulam, vel finem, vel aliquid huiusmodi, ad quod mensuretur quid sit magis agendum. Manifestum est enim quod homo, imitatur, idest desiderat, id quod est magis in bonitate, et id quod est melius: melius autem semper diiudicamus aliqua mensura: et ideo oportet accipere aliquam mensuram in deliberando quid magis sit agendum. Et hoc est medium ex quo ratio practica syllogizat quid sit eligendum. Unde manifestum est, quod ratio deliberans potest ex pluribus phantasmatibus unum facere, scilicet ex tribus, quorum unum praeeligitur alteri, et tertium est quasi mensura, quae praeelegit.
          <td>§841. And this deliberation requires some sort of rule or end by which to reckon what most needs to be done. Clearly, a man, will ‘follow’, i.e. seek for, the better and more suitable alternative: which is always measured by some standard. We need therefore, a measure for our actions, a criterion for discerning what is most worth doing. And this will be the middle term of the syllogism, of the practical reason issuing in a choice. It follows that reason, deliberating, can form several images into a unity—three, to be precise; for one object is preferred to another, and a third gives the standard of preference.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et haec est causa, quare animalia non habent opinionem, licet habeant phantasiam; quia non possunt uti syllogismo, per quem unum praeeligant alteri. Sed deliberatio rationis habet illam, scilicet opinionem, alias non faceret ex pluribus phantasmatibus unum. Et inde est, quod appetitus inferior, qui sequitur phantasiam, non habet deliberationem, sed absque deliberatione movetur ad concupiscendum vel irascendum, quia scilicet sequitur phantasiam sensibilem.
          <td>842. We can see now why animals form no opinions, though they have images. They cannot prefer one thing to another by any process of reasoning. Rational deliberation, however, issues in opinion—else it would not unify a number of phantasms. Similarly, the lower appetite springing from imagination is non-deliberate: it moves at once into desire or repulsion following the sensuous imagination.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit vincit autem ostendit quomodo deliberatio rationis vincatur ab appetitu inferiori; et dicit quod appetitus inferior, qui est sine deliberatione, vincit deliberationem, et removet hominem ab eo quod deliberavit. Aliquando e converso appetitus movet appetitum, scilicet superior, qui est rationis deliberantis, eum qui est phantasiae sensibilis, sicut in corporibus caelestibus, sphaera superior movet inferiorem; quod accidit cum aliquis continens fuerit. Continentis enim est, per deliberationem rationis vincere passiones.
          <td>843. Next, at ‘Appetite sometimes’, he explains how rational deliberation may yield to the lower desire, may be overcome by it and drawn away from its own decision. Again, conversely, the superior appetite that follows rational deliberation sometimes sways the lower one that follows sensuous images (as a higher heavenly body may impel a lower). This happens in the case of ‘continence’; for the continent are those in whom deliberation gets the better of passion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et iste est naturalis ordo, ut superior appetitus moveat inferiorem; quia etiam in corporibus caelestibus naturaliter sphaera superior principalior est et movet inferiorem, ita quod inferior movetur tribus motibus localibus. Sicut sphaera Saturni movetur et motu diurno, qui est super polos mundi, et motu contrario, qui est super polos zodiaci, et praeter hoc motu proprio. Et similiter appetitus inferior, etsi aliquid de motu proprio retineat, movetur tamen naturali ordine, motu appetitus superioris, et motu rationis deliberantis. Si autem e converso accidit, quod appetitus superior transmoveatur ab inferiori, hoc est praeter ordinem naturalem. Unde et hoc facit peccatum in moribus, sicut peccata sunt monstra in natura.
          <td>844. Note that it is according to nature that the higher appetite should sway the lower. We see this in the heavenly bodies; the higher sphere gives the first impetus, moving the lower which, in turn, has a three-fold local movement. For the sphere, e.g., of Saturn moves first in diurnal motion, turning about the poles of the Universe; then in the contrary zodiacal motion; and thirdly, in its own proper motion. Likewise, the lower appetite, retaining something of its own proper movement, is also moved by another, and this naturally, following the impulse of the higher appetite and of rational deliberation. If the converse takes place, and the higher is in fact moved by the lower, this is contrary to the natural order of things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit scientificum autem ostendit quae ratio sit movens. Et primo sciendum est quod ratio speculativa, quam appellat scientificam, non movet, sed in quiete est, quia nihil de imitando vel fugiendo dicit, ut supra dictum est. Ratio autem practica, quaedam est universalis, et quaedam particularis. Universalis quidem, sicut quae dicit, quod oportet talem tale agere, sicut filium honorare parentes. Ratio autem particularis dicit quod hoc quidem est tale, et ego talis, puta quod ego filius, et hunc honorem debeo nunc exhibere parenti.
          <td>845. Then, at ‘the cognitive faculty’, he explains which reason it is that initiates movement. It is not the speculative reason (here called ‘cognitive’); for this remains quiet and still and makes no decisions about tending to or away from anything, as we have seen. And as for the practical reason, it is either universal or particular. By the universal practical reason we judge that such and such ought to be done, e.g. that children ought to honour their parents. By the particular practical reason we judge that this particular subject is such and such, e.g. that I am a son and I ought here and now to honour my parents.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Haec autem iam opinio movet, sed non autem illa quae est universalis. Aut si utraque movet, illa quae est universalis, movet ut causa prima et quiescens, particularis vero ut causa proxima, et quodammodo motui applicata. Nam operationes et motus in particularibus sunt; unde oportet ad hoc quod motus sequatur, quod opinio universalis ad particularia applicetur. Et propter hoc etiam peccatum in actionibus accidit, quando opinio in particulari operabili corrumpitur propter aliquam delectationem, vel propter aliquam aliam passionem, quae talem universalem opinionem non corrumpit.
          <td>846. Now it is this latter judgement that moves to action, not the other universal one;—or, if both move, the universal moves ass a first. and motionless cause of movement, the particular as a, proximate cause already, to a certain extent, applied to the movement itself. For deeds and movements are in the particular, and if any movement is actually to take place, the universal opinion must be particularised. In the same way the commission of any sinful action implies that one’s good judgement as to what should be done in the particular is neutralised by a pleasure or emotion of some kind; one’s universal opinion remaining, however, unaltered.

But if the animal that comes into contact [with other things] had no sense of touch it could not avoid certain things and seize upon others; and thus it could not preserve its existence. §§ 859-60

            <td>7. διὸ καὶ ἡ γεῦσίς ἐστιν ὥσπερ ἁφή τις· τροφῆς γάρ ἐστιν, ἡ δὲ τροφὴ τὸ σῶμα ἁπτόν. ψόφος δὲ καὶ χρῶμα καὶ ὀσμὴ οὐ τρέφει, οὐδὲ ποιεῖ οὔτ' αὔξησιν οὔτε φθίσιν· ὥστε καὶ τὴν γεῦσιν ἀνάγκη ἁφὴν εἶναί τινα, διὰ τὸ τοῦ ἁπτοῦ καὶ θρεπτικοῦ αἴσθησιν εἶναι· αὗται μὲν οὖν ἀναγκαῖαι τῷ ζῴῳ, καὶ φανερὸν ὅτι οὐχ οἷόν τε ἄνευ ἁφῆς εἶναι ζῷον,
            <td>This is why taste is a kind of touch; for food is a tangible body. But sound and colour and smell do not nourish, or contribute to growth or, decay. Taste must then be a kind of touch, being a sense of the tangible and the nutritive. These senses then are necessary to the animal. Hence it is plain that no animal can exist without touch. § 86-1

            <td>The others exist for its greater good; and then not in every kind of animal, but in some, namely in those that need to move from place to place. For if [such] an animal is to survive it must perceive not only what is in contact with it, but also what is afar; and this will happen, if it perceives through a medium, this being affected and moved by the sense object, and the animal itself by the medium. § 862

            <td>It is [as when] a thing is moving locally: it operates till it affects a change and, impelling something else, causes another impulsion, so that movement traverses a medium. The first mover causes motion and is unmoved: the last is moved, moving nothing else; but the intermediary is both; or the many intermediaries. So it is with the alteration in question, except that what is changed remains in the same place. If one clips an object into wax, the wax moves to the extent that the object enters it; whereas a stone is not moved at all; but water a long way, and air most of all, giving and receiving motion, so long as it remains a unity. Hence, as regards reflection, it is better to say that the air is affected by shape and colour, so long as it retains unity, than to say that the sight proceeds out and is reflected back. On a smooth surface [air] has unity, and so in turn, moves the sight; as if a seal were to sink into and right through wax. §§ 863-4

          <br>
          LECTIO 17</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus determinavit de singulis partibus animae, hic ostendit quomodo adinvicem ordinantur. Et primo ostendit, quod necesse est animae partem vegetabilem in omnibus viventibus inveniri. Secundo ostendit quod sensitiva non est in omnibus, sed in aliquibus, ibi, sensum autem non necesse.
          <td>847. After taking the various parts of the soul in turn, and discussing each one separately, the Philosopher now shows how they are interrelated: explaining, first, that the vegetative part is common to all animate beings, and then, at ‘Sensation is not necessarily found’, that the sphere of sensitivity is more limited.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, ex his quae supra de partibus animae determinata sunt, concludens, quod omne quod vivit, et per consequens quamcumque partem animae habens, necesse est quod habeat animam vegetabilem a principio suae generationis usque ad suam corruptionem. Ex quo innuit hoc esse in animalibus, quae generantur et corrumpuntur, intelligendum.
          <td>In the light, then, of his previous conclusions he observes, first, that all beings that participate in any way in soul must, from the first moment of their generation until their final corruption, have some share in the vegetative principle, indicating by these terms that he speaks especially of animate beings which come to being through generation and cease through corruption.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Hoc autem probat sic: quia necesse est quod omne vivens quod generatur, habeat augmentum et statum et decrementum: sed haec non possunt accidere sine alimento, quia tempore augmenti oportet quod plus de alimento convertatur, quam sufficiat ad conservationem praeexistentis magnitudinis: tempore autem status, aequaliter; sed tempore diminutionis, minus. Cum igitur uti alimento pertineat ad partem vegetabilem, necesse est quod haec pars animae sit in omnibus viventibus, quae generantur et corrumpuntur. Et sic patet ordo istius partis animae ad alias partes animae; quia omnes aliae praesupponunt istam.
          <td>848. And he proves the point thus. No animate and generated being can exist without passing through the stages of growth, maturity and decline. And these all presuppose food. Growth implies that more food is being absorbed by a subject than is needed to maintain its existing bulk. Maturity implies a balance of food and bulk; whilst in decline less food is being absorbed than suffices to maintain the subject's bulk. And as it pertains to the vegetative principle to make use of food, this principle must be common to everything that is born and that dies; and must be related to the other parts of soul as the foundation they all presuppose.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit sensum autem ostendit quomodo se habeat pars sensitiva ad viventia. Et primo ostendit quod non est in omnibus viventibus. Secundo ostendit in quibus viventibus sit, ibi, animal autem necesse. Dicit ergo primo, quod non est necessarium quod omnia viventia habeant sensum, quia sensus tactus (sine quo nullus alius potest esse, et per consequens neque aliquod animal, cuius ratio perficitur ex hoc quod habet sensum) esse non potest in aliquo corpore simplici, quia organum sensus tactus necesse est esse in quadam medietate inter contraria, ut supra ostensum est: quod nulli corpori simplici convenit, cum in corporibus simplicibus sint excellentiae qualitatum sensibilium, puta in igne excellentia calidi, in aqua, excellentia frigidi.
          <td>849. Then, at ‘Sensation etc.’, he shows how sensitivity is related to living things: and first, that it is not found in all of them; secondly, at ‘But if Nature’, where it is found. First, then, he remarks that touch (die sense presupposed by all the other senses, and therefore by all animal life as such) need not exist wherever life exists. The organ of touch requires (as we have seen)' a sort of balance of contrary qualities; hence it cannot exist in simple bodies, which are characterised by the predominance of some one particular sensible quality—as heat in fire or cold in water.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Similiter etiam quaecumque non sunt susceptiva specierum sine materia, non habent sensum. Nam sensus est susceptivus specierum sine materia, ut supra dictum est. Sunt autem quaedam viventia, scilicet plantae, quae sunt propinqua corporibus simplicibus propter earum terrestreitatem, et non recipiunt species sensibilium, nisi per materialem immutationem; non ergo omnia viventia habent sensum.
          <td>850. Similarly, whatever is unable to receive into itself forms free from matter cannot sense; for this way of receiving forms is, as we have seen essential to sensitivity. Now plants, because in them the earthy element predominates, so that they are near neighbours to the simple bodies, are unable to receive forms from outside, except with a material alteration. Not all living things. therefore, are sensitive.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit animal autem ostendit quod omnia animalia habent sensum. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit hoc de animalibus quae moventur motu processivo. Secundo simpliciter de omnibus animalibus, ibi, at vero. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit propositum. Secundo excludit quoddam per quod posset suae rationi obviari, ibi, non potest autem corpus. Dicit ergo primo, quod necesse est quod animal sensum habeat. Ad quod probandum proponit, primo quod natura nihil facit frustra: quia omnia, quae sunt in natura, sunt propter aliud, idest proveniunt ex necessitate ex his, quae propter aliquid sunt. Sicut natura facit membra propter aliquas operationes. Sed ex hoc quod membra sunt talis dispositionis, sequitur quod habeant aliqua accidentia, sicut quod habeant pilositates quasdam, vel colores, vel corruptiones, quae non sunt propter finem, sed magis proveniunt ex necessitate materiae. Sic igitur, cum natura operetur propter aliquid, si res naturales non possent pervenire ad finem, quem natura intendit, essent frustra.
          <td>851. Then, at ‘But if Nature’, he shows that all animals are sensitive. He does this (1) with regard to animals that can move from place to place; and (2) with regard to all animals without exception, at ‘But having sensation’. As regards (1) he first proves his point; and then, at ‘But a body’, refutes a possible objection. To prove that all animals are sensitive he assumes as a principle that Nature does nothing in a purposeless way. Everything in Nature has a reason, exists to supply the needs of purposeful being. Thus in order that certain activities may be carried Out, things have a natural equipment of suitable organs. These organs, it is true, being composed in this or that way, have certain accidental qualities or adjuncts, e.g. hairs or colours, not to mention innate weaknesses, which are due rather to the matter of which they are composed than to the ends which they subserve. But since Nature always does act for an end, whatever natural thing simply could not reach a natural end would be quite out of place in Nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed natura fecit corpus processivum, id est animalis quod potest moveri motu processivo, sic organizatum et dispositum, propter motum, et ut per motum ulterius prosequeretur alimentum, per quod conservaretur in esse. Hoc autem non posset esse, si non haberet sensum; quia non discerneret corruptibilia, quae possunt ei obviare, et sic corrumperetur, et non perveniret ad finem quem natura intendit, ut scilicet conservetur alimento, quod ex motu acquiritur. Quomodo enim alerentur, nisi quaererent alimentum per motum?
          <td>852. Now Nature has adapted the bodies of mobile animals for movement; and they move for the sake of obtaining the food which keeps them alive. And to this end they require sense-awareness; otherwise they would not perceive the noxious things to which their movement sometimes brings them, and thus they would die and the very purpose of their movements would be frustrated. For they move about in order to get food, and could not get it otherwise.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nec est instantia de animalibus immobilibus; quia animalibus manentibus, id est immobilibus existit adiunctum illud unde nata sunt nutriri, unde non oportet quod a remotis quaerant. Manifestum est igitur, quod si corpora processiva non haberent sensum, non possent consequi finem ad quem natura ordinavit, et ita essent frustra; quod est inconveniens.
          <td>853. (The case of immobile animals is not relevant here, for the food they naturally require is joined to their substance; they do not have to seek it at a distance.) Clearly then, if mobile animal bodies lacked sense-awareness they could not reach the end for which Nature designs them. They would be futile; which is an unacceptable conclusion.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit non potest excludit quoddam, per quod posset obviari praedictae rationi. Posset enim aliquis dicere, quod corpus processivum potest pervenire ad finem intentum a natura discernendo corruptibilia per intellectum, etiam si non haberet sensum. Sed excludit hoc, dicens, quod corpus non existens mansivum, sed processivum, non potest habere animam, et intellectum discernentem nociva, ita quod non habeat sensum, neque si sit generabile, neque si sit ingenerabile. Et de generabili quidem ostensum est. Nam viventia generabilia habentia intellectum sunt tantum homines. Intellectus autem humanus indiget sensu, ut supra ostensum est.
          <td>854. Next, at ‘But a body etc.’, he removes a possible objection. It might be suggested that some moving animal bodies could reach their natural end through an intellectual awareness of things that would do them harm, even though they lacked sense-awareness. But Aristotle rejects this hypothesis with respect to mobile animals, whether these come into existence by generation or no. The point has been proved with regard to generated animals; for the only animate things that come into being by generation and are endowed with intellect are human beings, and the human mind presupposes sensation, as we have seen.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quod dicit, quod neque illud quod est ingenerabile habet intellectum sine sensu, videtur esse falsum secundum opinionem Aristotelis. Nam corpora caelestia, quae ponit esse animata, habent de partibus animae, intellectum. Non habent autem sensum, cum sint corpora uniformia, non habentia distinctionem in organis, quae requiruntur ad sensum. Unde quidam sic exponunt, ut ibi terminetur sententia, ubi dicit generabile autem: ut sit sensus, quod nullum corpus non manens, non potest habere intellectum sine sensu, dummodo sit generabile. Sed quod subdit, at vero neque ingenerabile, est principium alterius sententiae: ac si dicat, quod hoc quod dictum est de corpore generabili, non sic se habet circa corpus ingenerabile, ut scilicet non possit habere intellectum sine sensu.
          <td>855. But his rejection of the suggestion that intellect might exist without sensitivity in non-generated living things may seem at variance with Aristotle’s own opinion. For it was his view that the heavenly bodies are both animate and intelligent, and yet lack sensitivity because their bodies are not organised into the distinct parts which alone make sensation possible. Hence some commentators make the sentence end at ‘yet not have sensation’; and its meaning they take to be that no mobile body can be intelligent, lacking sensitivity, provided that it is a generated body. And what follows—‘nor ‘indeed etc.’—they take as the beginning of a new sentence, meaning that the case of non-generated bodies, is different.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et hoc est quod subdit, quare enim non habebit. Intelligendum est magis relative quam interrogative; ut sit sensus, quod causa, quare corpus ingenerabile, scilicet corpus caeleste, non habet sensum, licet habeat intellectum, est ista: quia si haberet sensum, aut hoc esset ut exinde esset aliquid melius animae corporis, aut exinde esset melius corpori caelesti: sed neutrum horum est, quia anima corporis caelestis non magis intelligeret per sensum, quam sine sensu; intelligit enim per modum substantiarum separatarum ea quae sunt secundum se intelligibilia. Neque etiam corpus caeleste magis posset conservari in esse, propter sensum; quia non est possibile ipsum corrumpi, unde non indiget sensu ad vitandum corrumpentia.
          <td>856. Hence, according to their view, what follows, namely ‘Why should they not etc.’, must not be understood as an interrogation, but as a relative clause inserted to explain why non-generated bodies, i.e. the heavenly bodies, lack a sense-apparatus even while they have intelligence: Aristotle’s argument (they say) being that neither the body nor the soul of a heavenly body would get any benefit from its having senses;—not the soul, because it would not understand any better thereby, since its understanding, like that of spiritual substances, bears upon the purely intelligible; nor yet the body, because, being essentially incorruptible anyhow, its senses would play no part in maintaining its existence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed ad hunc sensum non adaptatur conclusio consequens, scilicet quod nullum corpus non manens, idest non immobile, habet animam sine sensu. Nisi forte dicatur, quod haec conclusio, non sequitur ex eo quod immediate dictum est, sed ex eo quod primo fuit dictum.
          <td>However, this interpretation hardly squares with the conclusion which follows, namely that no animate body which has the power to move from place to place lacks sensitivity (unless we choose to relate this conclusion to the previous statement; not to the immediately preceding one).
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia igitur haec expositio extorta videtur, dicendum est, quod per corpus ingenerabile non intelligit corpus caeleste, sed corpora quorumdam animalium aereorum quae ponebant Platonici nominantes ea Daemones; quos quidem Apuleius Platonicus sic definit. Daemones sunt animalia corpore aerea, mente rationalia, animo passiva, tempore aeterna. Et de huiusmodi animalium corporibus vult philosophus ostendere, quod non est possibile quod habeant intellectum sine sensu, sicut Platonici posuerunt; ut interrogative legatur quod dicitur: quare enim non habebit, scilicet huiusmodi corpus sensum? Quasi dicat: non est huius rationem assignare. Si enim non habet, aut hoc est propter bonum animae, aut propter bonum corporis. Sed neutrum horum; quia sine sensu neque anima eius intelligit melius, neque corpus magis conservabitur. Et ex hoc statim directe sequitur conclusio, quam inducit, quod nullum corpus mobile habens animam, careat sensu. Apparet autem, hanc esse intentionem Aristotelis, ex hoc quod immediate subiungit, quod impossibile est aliquod corpus simplex esse corpus animalis.
          <td>857. Since, then, this seems a forced interpretation, it is better to understand by ‘non-generated body’, not any heavenly body, but the bodies of certain airy animate beings called by the Platonists demons. Apuleius, for instance, defined them as air-bodied animate beings, rational, passive, eternal. And it would be concerning these beings, then, that the Philosopher seeks to prove that the Platonists were wrong in allowing them intelligence without senses. So the ‘Why should they not’ ought to be taken interrogatively, as meaning ‘why should such bodies as these lack senses? For, if they do lack them, this must be for the good either of their soul or their body; and neither reason is valid; for without senses their souls would understand no better, nor would their bodies be any the less corruptible. And the conclusion immediately follows, as given above, namely that no living bodies that are able to move about in space lack sensation. That this is indeed Aristotle’s meaning appears from his immediately adding that no simple body can possibly be the body of an animal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit at vero ostendit quod sensus sit simpliciter necessarius omni animali. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit propositum. Secundo inducit quamdam conclusionem ex dictis, ibi, manifestum igitur quoniam necesse. Circa primum duo facit. Primo proponit quod intendit. Secundo probat propositum, ibi, hoc autem ex his. Proponit autem duo: quorum primum est quod si aliquod corpus habet sensum, necesse est quod vel sit simplex, vel mistum. Et impossibile est quod sit simplex: quia si esset corpus simplex, non haberet tactum, quem quidem sensum necesse est omne animal habere, non solum animalia processiva, sed etiam animalia immobilia, sicut ostendit supra.
          <td>858. Then at ‘But having’ he proves the absolute necessity, for all animals, of sensitivity; first proving the point, then at ‘It is then evident’, drawing a conclusion. The proof subdivides. Thus: (1) he puts forward his own view; (2) he proves it, at ‘Which is evident from these considerations’. His own view contains two points, of which the first is that whatever body has sensation must be either simple or mixed. But it cannot be simple; for if it were it would lack the sense of touch; which he has already shown to be necessary for all animals, not only the mobile but also the immobile.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit hoc autem probat propositum. Et primo, quod sensus tactus sit in omnibus animalibus. Secundo, quod corpus animalis non possit esse corpus simplex, ibi, quod autem possibile. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod necesse est inesse omnibus animalibus sensum tactus. Secundo, quod alii sensus a sensu tactus non insunt omnibus, ibi, alii autem propter bonum et cetera. Circa primum duo facit. Primo ostendit, quod necesse est tactum inesse omnibus animalibus. Secundo ostendit idem de gustu, ibi, propter quod et gustus.
          <td>859. Then, at ‘Which is evident’, he proceeds to show (1) that touch is found in all animals; (2) at ‘It is clearly impossible’, that no animal body can be a simple body. With regard to (1) he first shows the necessity of touch for all animals; and then, at ‘The others exist’, that the other senses are not found in all. As to this necessity, however, having shown it in the case of touch, he then, at ‘This is why taste’, proves that it belongs also to taste.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod hoc, scilicet quod necesse sit tactum inesse omnibus animalibus, manifestum est ex his quae nunc dicentur. Animal enim est corpus animatum. Omne autem corpus, scilicet generabile et corruptibile, est tangibile; et dico tangibile, quod est sensibile tactu. Corpora autem caelestia quae sunt ingenerabilia et incorruptibilia, non sunt tangibilia. Non enim sunt de natura elementorum, ut possint habere qualitates elementares, quae sunt qualitates tangibiles. Sed omnia corpora corruptibilia necesse est habere qualitates tangibiles, cum sint vel elementa simplicia, vel ex elementis composita.
          <td>First, then, he observes that the necessary universality of touch in the animal world can be clearly shown. For every animal is a living body; and every body is tangible or sensible to touch. By body is here meant exclusively the generable and corruptible sort of body, not the non-generated, incorruptible heavenly bodies. These latter are not tangible; being outside the sphere of the elements they lack the elemental qualities which alone are tangible. But all corruptible bodies, being either simple elements or compounds of elements, are necessarily tangible.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ex hoc concludit, quod necesse est corpus animalis habere sensum tactus si debeat salvari corpus animalis; quia cum corpus animalis sit tangibile, idest habens tangibiles qualitates, et similiter corpora quae ipsum tangunt, immutari potest corpus animalis ab his quae ipsum tangunt, naturali immutatione usque ad suam corruptionem. Aliter autem est de aliis sensibus quae sentiunt per alia media, et non tangendo, sicut olfactus, visus et auditus. Unde illa sensibilia cum sint remota, non tangunt corpus animalis, nec possunt alterare ipsum ad corruptionem, sicut tangibilia. Et ideo nisi animal haberet sensum tactus, per quem discerneret convenientia a corruptivis, non posset haec fugere et illa accipere, et ita non posset salvari animal. Necessarium est igitur ad salutem animalis, quod habeat sensum tactus.
          <td>860. Whence he concludes to the necessity, for the preservation of the bodies of animals, that they be endowed with touch. For they are tangible, i.e. made up of tangible qualities; and so are the other bodies which actually touch them; and in the course of nature the animal’s body might well be so affected by these latter bodies as to be destroyed by them. It is not the same with those senses whose medium of contact with their objects is not by touch, i.e. smell, sight and hearing; for their objects, being at a distance, do not actually touch the animal’s body; they cannot therefore be a danger to its life, as tangible objects may be. Hence, unless the animal were able to touch, and touching to discriminate between objects harmful and congenial to it, it could not avoid the former and accept the latter, and so preserve its existence. Touch, then, is a necessity for animals.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit propter quod ostendit idem de gustu; scilicet quod gustus est sicut tactus quidam. Est enim gustus alimenti: quo scilicet discernitur alimentum, utrum sit conveniens vel non. Alimentum autem est quoddam corpus tangibile. Nutrit enim ex hoc quod est calidum, humidum, frigidum et siccum. Ex eisdem enim nutrimur ex quibus sumus. Sed sonus et color et odor nihil faciunt ad alimentum neque ad augmentum vel ad decrementum. Sapor autem confert ad alimentum, inquantum est sequela complexionis. Sic igitur patet, quod gustus est quidam tactus, quia est sensus alicuius tangibilis et vegetativi, id est nutritivi, scilicet alimenti. Et sic patet quod hi sensus necessarii sunt animali. Ex quo etiam manifestum est, quod animal non potest esse sine tactu.
          <td>861. Then, at ‘This is why taste’, he shows that the same is true of taste. For taste is a kind of touch, discriminating, as it does, between the goodness or harmfulness of different foods. Now food is essentially tangible and bodily; it nourishes the body just because it has the bodily qualities of being hot, moist, cold, dry. Bodies are nourished by bodies,—not by sounds or colours or scents; for sounds, colours and scents have nothing to do with growth or decay. Savour, however, is connected with nourishment by way of the body’s natural disposition. Since then taste perceives food, and food is something tangible in the vegetative or nutritive order, taste is a kind of touch. Both these senses then are necessary; from which it is all the more evident that animals could not exist without touch.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit alii autem ostendit quod alii sensus non insunt omnibus animalibus, sed quibusdam. Et circa hoc duo facit. Primo ostendit propositum. Secundo manifestat quoddam quod dixerat, ibi, sicut enim movens. Dicit ergo primo, quod alii sensus, scilicet visus, auditus et olfactus, conveniunt animali non propter necessitatem, sed propter bene esse. Sed necessarium est eos inesse non cuilibet generi animalium, sed quibusdam, scilicet quae moventur motu processivo: quia si debet huiusmodi animal salvari, non solum debet sentire id quod tangit, sed debet sentire id quod est a longe, quia ad aliquid remotum movetur. Hoc autem, scilicet quod sentiat aliquid a longe, erit, si habeat sensus, qui sentiant per medium; eo quod medium patitur et movetur a sensibili, sensus autem a medio.
          <td>862. Next, at ‘The others exist’, he explains why the other senses are not found in all animals, but only in some; after which, at ‘It is as when’, he explains one of his own expressions. First, then, he observes that the other senses, sight, hearing and smell, are required for the well-being of certain animals, but not for their bare existence. Yet for some animals (not all), these senses are absolutely necessary—for those, namely that can move from place to place; for these need to be able to perceive objects at a distance as well as what immediately touches them. Now to sense things at a distance is only possible though a medium; the medium being affected and altered by the object, and the sense by the medium.

          <td>Et hoc ostendit consequenter cum dicit sicut enim ostendit per simile in motu locali. Videmus enim quod movens secundum locum, facit permutationem usque ad aliquem determinatum locum; quia quod primo depellit, facit, ut illud depulsum, iterum depellat aliud; et sic primum depellens movet tertium per medium. Et primum quidem movens depellit, sed non depellitur; ultimum autem, ubi terminatur motus, depellitur, sed non depellit. Medium autem habet utrumque; scilicet quod depellit et depellitur; et contingit multa media esse talia. Et sicut hoc est in motu locali, ita contingit in alteratione, quod sit primum movens et ultimum motum, et medium quod sit movens et motum.
          <td>863. And at ‘It is as when’ he proceeds to show this by a simile from local motion. Anything moving from place to place will cause a succession of changes which terminate at its destination; for what is first propelled forward is itself the cause of something else being propelled; so that the first agent disturbs a third thing through a medium—the first thing being a disturber itself undisturbed; the last, where the movement terminates, being disturbed but not itself a disturber; whilst the medium is both disturber and disturbed; and there may be many such media. And this order in local motion is observable also in changes by alteration: where there is a primary agent of change, a final recipient of change, and a medium both changing and changed.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in hoc tamen differt, quod primum alterans manet secundum locum dum alterat; quod non contingit dici de pellente. Et ponit exemplum, sicut si aliquis tangat ceram liquefactam, usque ad illum terminum mota est, quousque per actionem caloris actio tangentis pertingit. Sed lapis, quia durus est, non est susceptivus talis impressionis. In aqua autem talis actio magis protenditur procul, quam in cera. Sed adhuc aer, qui est passibilior, in maxime remotum movetur, et facit et patitur, ut medium existens, dummodo maneat et sit unus; ut scilicet non interrumpatur per aliquod obstaculum interpositum. Et ideo circa repercussionem sensus, melius est dicere, quod aer patiatur a figura et colore, quousque permanet unus et continuus, quod contingit quando est lenis, et non interruptus, quam quod radii egredientes a visu repercutiantur a visibili, ut Platonici posuerunt. Et ideo aer sic motus a figura et colore, movebit visum inquantum visibile immutat totum aerem usque ad visum. Et esset simile de cera et sigillo, si figura sigilli imprimeretur in ceram usque ad ultimum terminum eius, sicut visibile imprimit speciem suam in aerem usque ad visum.
          <td>864. But with this difference, that, in the case of alteration, the agent of change is not moving from place to place as it changes, unlike the agent of propulsion. And he gives an example. If you touch soft wax it will be moved just so far as the warmth that accompanies your action makes the wax move. The hardness of stone would make it impervious to this kind of action; but water would be affected in this way, and still more air which is extremely mobile and has the maximum mobility at a distance from the moving agent. Air especially, then, is able to move and be moved as a medium, provided of course that it be continuous, i.e. not interrupted by any obstacle. With regard then to the impact of an object upon the senses, it is reasonable to hold (against the Platonists who said that sight emitted rays which the visible object reflected) that the intervening air is affected by the shape and colour of an object all the way between this object and the eye; provided of course that the air be uniform and continuous and smooth. Air, on this view, itself affected by shape and colour, affects sight; so that it is the visible object which modifies all the air between itself and the eye. It is as though the shape of a sea] were to modify a piece of wax right through from one side to the other.

            <td>It is clearly impossible for the body of an animal to be a simple element: to be, I mean, fire or air. For no other sense can exist without touch; since every animate body, as we have seen, is tactual. The sense organs, indeed, can be constituted of other elements (except earth) for they effect sensation by perceiving through some other thing, i.e. through a medium. But touch occurs by immediate contact with things; that is why it has this name. Other senses no doubt also perceive by contact, but through something else; touch alone, it would seem, through itself. Hence the body of an animal will not be of such elements as these; nor yet be earthy. For touch is a kind of mean between all tangible objects, and is receptive, not only of all the differences that characterise earth, but also heat and cold and all other tangible qualities. This is why we do not feel with the bones or hair or other such parts,—because they are earthy. Plants, too, have no sensation, for the same reason,—they are of earth; and without touch there can be no other sense; and this sense does not consist either of earth or of any other [single] element. §§ 865-8

            <td>It is then evident that animals must perish if they are deprived of this sense alone. For it is neither possible for what is not an animal to possess this, nor, to be an animal, is any other necessary. And this again is why no other sense-object (e.g. colour, smell and sound) will destroy the animal by excessive intensity, but only the [corresponding] faculty of sense;—except incidentally, as when, for example, together with a sound, a thrust and a blow take place; or when other [things] are set in motion, by objects seen or smelled, which destroy by contact; and flavour too, in so far as it happens also to be tangible, may destroy thus. But an excess of tangible qualities, of heat or cold or hardness, destroys the animal itself. For as every excess in a sense-object is destructive of the sense, so may the tangible destroy touch; and by touch life itself is defined. For it has been shown that without touch no, animal can exist. Hence an excess in the tangible destroys not the sense only, but the whole animal; for only this one sense is necessary to animals. §§ 869-71

          LECTIO 18</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit quod tactus de necessitate inest omnibus animalibus, hic intendit ostendere quod impossibile sit corpus animalis esse simplex, puta quod sit igneum, vel aereum, sicut Platonici posuerunt quaedam animalia esse aerea. Hoc autem probat, quia nullum alium sensum contingit esse sine tactu: oportet enim omne animal habere tactum, ut ostensum est, et per consequens oportet quod omne corpus animatum, scilicet anima sensibili, sit tale, ut per ipsum possit fieri sensus tactus. Omnia autem elementa praeter terram, possunt esse organa, vel media aliorum sensuum, scilicet aer et aqua, eo quod aer et aqua faciunt sentire per alterum, idest per medium. Sed tactus non fit per medium, sed in tangendo ipsa sensibilia; et ideo sic nominatur, quamvis et alii sensus sentiant quodammodo in tangendo, non quidem immediate, sed per medium. Nam sensibile tangit sensum per medium, sicut et per medium immutat ipsum. Solus autem sensus tactus in tangendo sensibile sentit per seipsum, et non per aliquod medium.
          <td>865. After proving that touch must exist in all animals, the philosopher now sets out to show that no animate body can be made up of one simple element: of fire, for instance, or air,—as certain Platonists thought when they imagined animals made of air. He argues this from the fact that the other senses all presuppose touch and that therefore, as he has said already, no animal can be without this sense. Every body that is both animate and sensitive must be such as is able to sense by touching. Now all the elements, except earth, can be organs of, or the medium for, the other senses: air and water for instance are adapted to sensation at a distance, which takes place through something other than the sensitive body itself, namely the medium. But touch involves no medium, it occurs by direct contact with its object. That is why it is so named: it is ‘contact’ par excellence, whereas the other senses perceive by a sort of contact, indeed, with their objects, but through a medium, not immediately. Only touch perceives of and by itself, and with no medium.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ex quo manifestum est, quod corpus animalis debet esse tale, ut per ipsum possit fieri tactus, non autem, ut per ipsum possit fieri visus et auditus: quia hi sensus fiunt per medium extrinsecum. Et, quia corpus animalis oportet esse tale ut per ipsum fiat sensus tactus, impossibile est quod ullum elementorum sit corpus animalis: neque terra, per quam non sunt alii sensus: neque alia elementa, per quae fiunt alii sensus.
          <td>866. From which it is clear that the animal body must be, of and by itself, capable of touching. This necessity is not found in the case of sight or hearing; for these senses work through an extrinsic medium. That is why the animal body cannot be made of any one single element,—not of earth alone, for earth in any case is not sensitive; nor of any of those other elements presupposed by the other senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cuius ratio est, quia illud, per quod fit tactus, oportet esse medium inter qualitates tangibiles, ad hoc quod sit susceptivum earum, utpote in potentia existens ad eas, ut supra ostensum est. Et hoc est verum non solum respectu qualitatum terrae, sed etiam omnium tangibilium qualitatum. In corporibus autem simplicibus non invenitur medium inter qualitates tangibiles, sed inveniuntur ipsae qualitates, secundum extremitatem contrarietatis. Et inde manifestum est, quod per nullum corpus simplex, nec per aliquid corporibus simplicibus vicinum, potest fieri sensus tactus. Et ideo ossibus, capillis et talibus partibus non sentimus, quia superabundat in eis quod terrae est, et non reducuntur ad medium, prout tactus requirit.
          <td>867. The reason is that the organ of touch must be balanced midway between the various tangible qualities; otherwise it could not receive their impressions. For as we have seen already, touch is in potency to these qualities. And this is true with respect to all tangible qualities, not to those of earth alone. Now simple bodies cannot be thus balanced half-way; they have one or other of opposed qualities to an extreme degree. Hence no simple body, nor any body approximating to simplicity, can touch. This is why we do not feel with such parts of our bodies as bones and hair, and so on, in which the element of earth so predominates that there is no balance of tangible qualities such as the sense of touch requires.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Propter istam etiam rationem, plantae nullum habent sensum, quia habent multum de terrestri, et sine tactu non est possibile esse aliquem alium sensum, nec tactum fieri possibile per aliquod simplex elementum. Sic ergo manifestum est, quod nullum corpus simplex potest esse animatum anima sensibili.
          <td>868. It is for the same reason that plants lack sensitivity. They contain too much earth for touch, and without touch no other sense can exist. No simple body, then, can be animated by the sensitive soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit manifestum igitur concludit ex praedictis habitudinem sensuum ad animalia. Et primo quantum ad tactum. Secundo quantum ad alios sensus, ibi alios autem sensus. Dicit ergo primo, quod cum necesse sit omne animal habere tactum, ut ostensum est, manifestum est quod solum per privationem huius sensus, scilicet tactus, necesse est animalia mori. Hic enim sensus convertitur cum animali, nec aliquid potest ipsum habere nisi sit animal, nec aliquid potest esse animal nisi habeat hunc sensum.
          <td>869. Then, at ‘It is then evident’, as a conclusion from what has been said, he shows how all the senses are related to animals; first the sense of touch; then, at ‘As we have said, the animal’ the other senses. First, then, he observes that, touch being necessary for all animals, they would die if deprived of it alone. It is indeed convertible with animality: only the animal has touch, and all animals have it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et inde ulterius concludit, quod sensibilia aliorum sensuum si sint excellentia corrumpunt quidem singulos sensus, puta nimis fulgida corrumpunt visum, et fortes soni corrumpunt auditum: quia tamen corruptis his sensibus, potest animal remanere, horum excellentiae non corrumpunt animal nisi per accidens, inquantum scilicet accidit animal pati simul ab aliquibus tangibilibus corrumpentibus; puta si simul cum sono fiat depulsio et ictus, ut accidit in tonitruo, ex quo interdum animalia moriuntur. Et similiter ab his quae videntur, aliqua moriuntur, non inquantum sunt visa, sed inquantum aerem inficiunt, ut dicitur de quibusdam venenosis. Et similiter intelligendum est de odoribus, secundum quod cum malis odoribus interdum adiungitur corruptio aeris. Et ita etiam de sapore est, quod potest corrumpere animal, non inquantum sapor est, sed inquantum sapori adiungitur aliqua qualitas tangibilis, puta quod talis sapor consequitur calorem excedentem vel frigus.
          <td>870. And he goes on to say that, while excess in the object of the other senses can destroy these senses one by one (as excessive brightness is blinding, and excessive noise deafening) yet, because the animal can survive the loss of these senses, such excess in their objects only <i>indirectly</i> endangers its life—inasmuch, that is, as destructive <i>tangible</i> objects are brought into play, as when blasts and blows accompany noise, as in thunderstorms for instance. So also, if things seen endanger life it is not precisely as seen, but as somehow infecting the air with some poison or other. So also smells might affect the air. Similarly, a savour might harm an animal, not precisely as a savour, but as accompanied by some tangible quality in excess, for example heat or cold.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed excellentia qualitatum tangibilium corrumpit animal per se, et non per accidens: quia omnis excellentia sensibilis corrumpit sensum. Unde quod tangi potest, idest tangibile si fuerit excellens, corrumpit tactum. Secundum autem hunc sensum determinatur vita animalis; tamdiu enim durat animal, quamdiu durat sensus tactus in eo. Ostensum est enim quod impossibile est esse animal sine tactu: unde manifestum est quod excellentiae tangibilium, non solum corrumpunt sensum tactus, sed etiam corrumpunt animal inquantum hunc solum sensum necesse est inesse animali.
          <td>871. On the other hand, tangible qualities can <i>directly</i> endanger an animal’s life. For as any excess in the sense-object may injure the corresponding sense, an excess in the object of touch may destroy this sense; and it is on this sense that the animal’s life depends. It survives just so long as it can touch. Only this sense is strictly necessary to animal life; hence its destruction involves the death of the whole animal.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit alios autem ostendit qualiter se habeant alii sensus ad animal: et dicit quod alios sensus habet animal, non propter necessitatem sui esse, quia sine eis potest esse et vivere, sed propter bene esse; sicut visum habet, qui videt in aere et in aqua, ut videat per aerem et aquam ea quae procul sunt. Et non solum per aerem et aquam, sed etiam per quodcumque diaphanum, quia etiam per corpora caelestia videmus. Gustum autem habet animal propter delectationem et tristitiam, quae est in cibo, ut sentiat delectationem in alimento, et sic concupiscat ipsum, et moveatur ad quaerendum ipsum.
          <td>872. Then at ‘As we have said, the animal’, he relates the other senses to the animal as a whole; they pertain, he says, to its greater perfection; they are not sheer necessities. Thus animals that live in air or water have sight in order that they may see things at a distance through air or water,—or indeed through any transparent medium, including the heavenly bodies. Similarly, animals have the sense of touch that they may find pleasure, or its contrary, in their food; and thus, taking pleasure in eating, may desire to eat, and so to look for the food they need.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed notandum est quod supra posuit gustum necessarium animalibus, inquantum est tactus quidam alimenti; hic autem numerat ipsum inter sensus non necessarios, inquantum est discretivus saporum, qui faciunt alimentum delectabile vel triste, ut accipiatur facilius, vel refutetur. Et quod dicitur de gustu intelligendum est de odoratu, quia per odoratum attrahuntur animalia ad alimentum a remotis; licet etiam in hominibus sit alia species et alia utilitas odoratus, ut in libro de sensu et sensato dicitur.
          <td>873. Notice that here Aristotle places taste among the senses which are not strictly necessary, whereas he had previously said that it was necessary for animals; but then he was considering taste as a kind of touch—the touch of nourishment—whereas now he is considering it as a discrimination between the savours which make nourishment agreeable or disagreeable, and thus the more readily taken or rejected. And the same applies to the sense of smell; its function is to draw the animal to its food from a distance,—though indeed in man, as Aristotle explains in the <i>De Sensu et Sensato</i> , smell has a different nature and utility.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Auditus autem est in animali ad hoc, quod ei aliquid significetur. Est enim necessarium quod conceptiones unius animalis alteri significentur, secundum quod unum animal iuvatur ex altero, ut patet maxime in gregabilibus animalibus, in quibus geniti educantur a generantibus. Et ideo oportet etiam quod animal habeat linguam, per quam sonando significet suas affectiones alteri.
          <td>874. The purpose, too, of hearing is to provide communication between animals. It is necessary that animals transmit their experiences to one another; for they help one another to live; as is especially evident in the gregarious animals whose young are reared by the parent. Hence, too, the tongue is necessary that one animal may communicate, by sound, its feelings to another.

    <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="margin-bottom:6.0pt;text-align:center"><b>NOTE TO III, 744-5 (Lectio ten)</b>
    <p>A much-disputed passage. A safe rendering of the Greek is: 'This alone is immortal and perpetual. We have however no memory of it because it is impassible, whereas the passive intellect (Or, the mind that can be affected) is perishable; and without it nothing thinks'—taking 'it' to refer to the agent intellect. The Latin translation, however, followed by St. Thomas, takes this 'it' to mean the 'passive intellect' and inserts anima, 'the soul', as subject of 'thinks'. Hence St. Thomas takes the whole section to refer to the state of the intellect after death: it 'does not remember', etc., once the passive intellect has perished; the latter is only 'called' intellect and is really a <i>pars animae corporalis</i> .&nbsp; See Introduction, as follows:
    <p>(6) Bk. III, lectio 10 (430a 20-25); 740-5. The text here has given rise, on various counts, to much perplexity. For reference in discussion it will be well to have before us the Greek text and Latin, version:
    <p><span style="font-size:13.0pt;font-family:" palatino="">Τὸ δ᾽αὐτό ἐστιν ἡ κατ᾽ ἐνέργειαν ἐπιστἠμη τῷ πράγματι· ἡ δὲ κατὰ δύναμιν χρόνῳ προτέρα ἐν τῷ ἑνί, ὅλως δ᾽οὐ χρονῳ· ἀλλ᾽ οὐχ ὁτὲ μὲν νοεῖ, ὁτὲ δ᾽οὐ νοεῖ. Χωρισθεὶς δ᾽ ἐστὶ μόνον τοῦθ᾽ ὅπερ ἐστί, καὶ τοῦτο μόνον ἀθάνατον καὶ ἀΐδιον. Οὐ μνημονεύομεν δέ ὅτι τοῦτο μὲν ἀπαθές, ὁ δὲ παθητικὸς νοῦς φθαρτός, καὶ ἀνευ τοῦτου οὐδὲν νοεῖ.</span>
    <p>Idem autem est secundum actum scientia rei; quae vero, secundum potentiam, tempore prior in uno est. Omnino autem neque tempore. Sed non aliquando quidem intelligit, aliquando autem non intelligit. Separatus autem est solum hoc, quod vere est. Et hoc solum immortale et perpetuum est. Non reminiscitur autem, quia hoc quidem impassibile est; passivus vero intellectus, est corruptibilis, et sine hoc nihil intelligit anima.
    <p>The English translation given above follows the version more closely than the latter follows the Greek. The main problems are (i) to find the antecedent of intelligit in the third sentence, (2) to find what <i>separatus</i> agrees with, and (3) to discover what Aristotle means by 'the passive intellect'.
    <p>(i) This question was already familiar to St. Thomas. The alternatives can be seen in <i>Summa Theologiae</i> , I, 79, 4, obj. 2 and ad 2. The objection runs: 'The Philosopher (de Anima, III) says of the active (i.e. agent) intellect, that it does not sometimes understand and sometimes not understand. But out soul does not always understand: sometimes it understands, and sometimes it does not understand. Therefore the active (agent) intellect is not something in our soul.' To which St. Thomas replies: 'The Philosopher says those words not of the active (agent) intellect, but of the intellect in act: of which he had already said: Knowledge in act is the same as the thing. Or, if we refer those words to the active (agent) intellect, then they are said because it is not owing to the active (agent) intellect that sometimes we do, and sometimes we do not understand, but to the intellect which is in potentiality.' The conclusion of the objection shows the importance of the question for the Averroist thesis of the separated intellect. St. Thomas clearly shows his preference for taking intellect to refer right back to 'knowledge in act', though finding the Averroist conclusion not necessitated by the alternative of taking it to refer to the agent-intellect. Curiously, though the version does not give any help in deciding this point, the Greek seems fully to justify St. Thomas's preference. The <span style="font-family:" palatino="">ἀλλά</span> is the strongest particle in its sentence and would seem absolutely to demand that its antecedent should be all of the sentence which precedes it. Commentators have not always seen this, but de Corte is surely right in making it one of his main arguments for taking the passage in the sense preferred by St. Thomas in the Summa and adopted by him in the Commentary.
    <p>It is matter of less moment but worthy of remark, that St. Thomas shows his penetration in overcoming, correctly, a further obscurity which is absent from the Greek but introduced by the author of the version by his writing omnino for <span style="font-family:" palatino="">ὅλως</span> . An early variant is <span style="font-size:14.0pt;font-family:" palatino="">ἅπλως</span> which comes to the same thing. The contrast is between knowledge in potency considered in the individual and the same considered absolutely or universally, without qualification. Omnino does not give this sense unmistakably, but St. Thomas does so understand it in the Commentary.
    <p>(ii) <i>Separatus</i> is commonly taken as referring only to the agent intellect, the last aspect of the intellective soul to have been considered. St. Thomas, with at least as much probability in his favour, argues for its reference to the intellective soul without qualification, on the ground that the 'possible' as well as the 'agent' intellect has been characterised as 'separate' in the foregoing passage. De Corte insists that the same interpretation is imposed by the whole theory of the soul and its parts which Aristotle presents.
    <p>We may note that the version's <i>vere</i> is one of its rare verbal additions to the text, admirably, however, bringing out the emphasis of the Greek. Its presence renders less objectionable St. Thomas's transference of the adverb <i>solum</i> into an adjective; the transference is to be explained by his taking <i>solum</i> with <i>separatus</i> rather than with <i>est hoc quod vere est</i> . But the presence of <i>vere</i> does much to retain the emphasis on the clause in which it occurs. It would be possible, consonantly with St. Thomas's principles, to translate: 'By itself, the intellect, when separated, is that which it truly is', the general sense being, in any case, that, in the state of separation from the body, intellective soul is purely intellective, the organic powers being necessarily in abeyance.
    <p>(iii) The Version turns <span style="font-family:" palatino="">μνημονεύομεν</span> by <i>reminiscitur</i> , but without serious consequences. With what previously mentioned period is the verb co-ordinated? It can only be with that indicated by <span style="font-family:" palatino="">Χωρισθεὶς</span> . In a state of separation from the body, the intellective soul no longer remembers. Memory has already been mentioned in 408b 24-29 as perishing with the <i>compositum</i> of body and soul; St. Thomas refers to that passage in 744, <i>supra dixit in primo quod intelligere corrumpitur, quodam interius corrupto</i> . We have already seen that the commentary on that passage ( 163 ss.) presents certain difficulties. This is the place to suggest that they may in part be caused by St. Thomas's awareness that Aristotle could not possibly be saying, in accordance with his own principles, that <i>intelligere</i> in the normal sense of that word is an act of the <i>compositum</i> as such and perishable with it. Yet the version gave him the statement, to which he here refers, <i>Intelligere igitur et considerare marcescunt alio quodam interius corrupto</i> . This genuine difficulty may have been the reason for the commentator's interpreting the passage as an <i>argumentum ad hominem</i> . But now in Book III, at the end of lectio 10 ( 745) he has his finger on the solution: ... <i>destructo corpore non remanet in anima separata scientia rerum secundum eundem modum quo modo intelligit. Sed quomodo tunc intelligat, non est praesentis intentionis discutere</i> . The word turned by <i>intelligere</i> is <span style="font-family:" palatino="">διάνοια</span> and its association in these two passages with memory and other acts of the compositum suggests that this term could be applied to other than distinctively spiritual acts of the mind. Indeed its being coupled with <span style="font-family:" palatino="">θεωρεῖν</span> in 408b 24 is sufficient warrant for finding such another use, since <span style="font-family:" palatino="">θεωρεῖν</span> is often used by Aristotle both for an act of sense and an act of mind. De Corte suggests that the preposition <span style="font-family:" palatino="">διά</span> in composition with the verb may here, as in other cases, have the sense of 'penetration'. The act signified would then be intermediate between sense perception and understanding proper: that collaboration of intellect and sense which is inescapably necessary to intellectual activity, so long as the soul is united to the body. The total aptitude for such collaboration is the 'passive' intellect of which Aristotle here alone makes mention. It is certainly impossible to equate this with the 'possible', or knowing, intellect properly so called.
    <p>We may close our discussion of this difficult passage by expanding the translation in the sense which seems to be appropriate.
    <blockquote>
      <p>Knowledge in act is the same as the thing (actually known). But (knowledge) that is potential is, in the individual, prior in time. Absolutely, however, not even in time. Whereas (knowledge in act) does not sometimes know and sometimes not know. When mind is separated (from the body) it is simply what it truly is. It does not (then) remember, because (mind) indeed is impassible; but the passive intellect is corruptible, and without it (in this life) the soul understands nothing.
