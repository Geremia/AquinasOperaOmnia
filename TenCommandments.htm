                  Three things are necessary for man to be saved: (1) knowledge
                  of what is to be believed, (2) knowledge of what is to be
                  desired, and (3) knowledge of what is to be done.

                              Here we are concerned with knowledge of what is to
                              be done, and with regard to this there is a
                              fourfold law:
                              <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                                <td>
                                  Prima dicitur lex naturae; et haec nihil aliud
                                  est nisi lumen intellectus insitum nobis a
                                  Deo, per quod cognoscimus quid agendum et quid
                                  vitandum. Hoc lumen et hanc legem dedit Deus
                                  homini in creatione. Sed multi credunt
                                  excusari per ignorantiam, si hanc legem non
                                  observant. Sed contra eos dicit propheta in
                                  Psal. IV, 6:
                                  <i>multi dicunt: quis ostendit nobis bona?</i>
                                  Quasi ignorent quid sit operandum. Sed ipse
                                  ibidem 7, respondet:
                                  <i
                                    >signatum est super nos lumen vultus tui,
                                    domine</i
                                  >: lumen scilicet intellectus, per quod nota
                                  sunt nobis agenda. Nullus enim ignorat quod
                                  illud quod nollet sibi fieri, non faciat
                                  alteri, et cetera talia. Sed licet Deus in
                                  creatione dederit homini hanc legem, scilicet
                                  naturae, Diabolus tamen in homine
                                  superseminavit aliam legem, scilicet
                                  concupiscentiae. Quousque enim in primo homine
                                  anima fuit subdita Deo, servando divina
                                  praecepta, etiam caro fuit subdita in omnibus
                                  animae vel rationi. Sed postquam Diabolus per
                                  suggestionem retraxit hominem ab observantia
                                  divinorum praeceptorum, ita etiam caro fuit
                                  inobediens rationi. Et inde accidit quod licet
                                  homo velit bonum secundum rationem, tamen ex
                                  concupiscentia ad contrarium inclinatur. Et
                                  hoc est quod apostolus dicit Rom. VII, 23:
                                  <i
                                    >video autem aliam legem in membris meis,
                                    repugnantem legi mentis meae</i
                                  >. Et inde est quod frequenter lex
                                  concupiscentiae legem naturae et ordinem
                                  rationis corrumpit. Et ideo subdit apostolus,
                                  ibid.:
                                  <i
                                    >captivantem me in lege peccati, quae est in
                                    membris meis</i
                                  >.
                                </td>

                                  (1) The first is the law of nature, and that
                                  is nothing other than the light of the
                                  intellect planted in us by God, by which we
                                  know what should be done and what should be
                                  avoided. God gave this light and this law in
                                  creation. But many believe that they are
                                  excused by ignorance if they do not observe
                                  this law. Against them the Prophet says in
                                  Psalm 4:6: “Many say: who will show us good
                                  things?”—as if they do not know what they
                                  should do. But he replies (v. 7): “The light
                                  of your face, Lord, is stamped on us”—that is,
                                  the light of the intellect, through which we
                                  know what should be done. For no one is
                                  ignorant that what he would not like to be
                                  done to himself he should not do to others,
                                  and similar norms. Yet, though God gave man
                                  this law of nature in creation, the Devil has
                                  sown in man another law on top of it, that of
                                  concupiscence. For in the first man, to the
                                  extent that the soul was subject to God,
                                  keeping the divine precepts, his flesh was
                                  also subject in all things to the soul or
                                  reason. But after the Devil by his suggestion
                                  drew man away from he observance of the divine
                                  commands, his flesh likewise became
                                  disobedient to reason. The result is that,
                                  although man may wish good according to
                                  reason, nevertheless by concupiscence he tends
                                  to the contrary. That is what the Apostle says
                                  (Rm 7:23): “But I see another law in my
                                  members, fighting the law of my mind.” Thus
                                  frequently he law of concupiscence corrupts
                                  the law of nature and the order of reason. And
                                  therefore the Apostle adds (<i>ibid.</i>):
                                  “...captivating me in the law of sin, which is
                                  in my members.”

                                      Quia ergo lex naturae per legem
                                      concupiscentiae destructa erat, oportebat
                                      quod homo reduceretur ad opera virtutis,
                                      et retraheretur a vitiis: ad quae
                                      necessaria erat lex Scripturae. Sed
                                      sciendum, quod homo retrahitur a malo et
                                      inducitur ad bonum ex duobus. Primo,
                                      timore: primum enim propter quod aliquis
                                      maxime incipit peccatum vitare, est
                                      consideratio poenae Inferni, et extremi
                                      iudicii. Et ideo dicitur Eccli. I, 16:
                                      <i>initium sapientiae timor domini</i>; et
                                      ibidem 27:
                                      <i>timor domini expellit peccatum</i>.
                                      Licet enim ille qui ex timore non peccat,
                                      non sit iustus: inde tamen incipit
                                      iustificatio. Hoc ergo modo retrahitur
                                      homo a malo et inducitur ad bonum per
                                      legem Moysi, quam quidam irritantes, morte
                                      puniebantur. Hebr. X, 28:
                                      <i
                                        >irritam quis faciens legem Moysi, sine

                                        testibus moritur</i
                                      >.

                                      (2) Because the law of nature was
                                      destroyed by the law of concupiscence, man
                                      needed to be brought back to the works of
                                      virtue and drawn away from vice, and for
                                      that the law of Scripture was necessary.
                                      But note that man is drawn from evil and
                                      led to the good from two motives. The
                                      first is fear, for the first and strongest
                                      motive for avoiding sin is the thought of
                                      the pains of hell and of the final
                                      judgment. Therefore it is said (Sir 1:16):
                                      “The beginning of wisdom is the fear of
                                      the Lord,” and (1:27), “The fear of the
                                      Lord drives away sin.” Although someone
                                      who avoids sin because of fear is not yet
                                      just, nevertheless his justification
                                      begins there. In this way man is drawn
                                      away from evil and led to good through the
                                      law of Moses, while those who transgressed
                                      it were punished by death—(Heb 10:28):
                                      Anyone who violates the law of Moses,
                                      without any mercy at the testimony of two
                                      or three should die.”

                                          a malis, insufficiens fuit: licet enim
                                          coercuerit manum, non coercebat
                                          animum; ideo est alius modus
                                          retrahendi a malo et inducendi ad
                                          bonum, modus scilicet amoris. Et hoc
                                          modo fuit data lex Christi, scilicet
                                          lex evangelica, quae est lex amoris.

                                          insufficient, and the law given by
                                          Moses which drew people from evil by
                                          fear was insufficient, in that it
                                          restrained the hand but did not
                                          restrain desire, therefore there came
                                          another way of restraining from evil
                                          and inducing people to good—that is
                                          the method of love. Thus there was
                                          given the law of Christ, that is, of
                                          the Gospel, which is the law of love.

                                              A triple difference should be
                                              noted between the law of fear and
                                              the law of love: (a) First, the
                                              law of fear makes slaves of its
                                              observers, whereas the law of love
                                              makes them free. For one who acts
                                              just out of fear acts as a slave,
                                              whereas one who acts out of love
                                              acts as a free person or a son.
                                              Thus the Apostle (2 Cor 3:17)
                                              says: “Where there is the spirit
                                              of the Lord, there is freedom,”
                                              because such people are acting out
                                              of love like sons. (b) The second
                                              difference is that the observers
                                              of the first law were rewarded
                                              with temporal goods (Is 1:19): “If
                                              you are willing and hear me, you
                                              shall eat the goods of the land.”
                                              But the observers of the second
                                              law are rewarded with heavenly
                                              goods (Mt 19:17): “If you want to
                                              enter life, observe the
                                              commandments,” and (Mt 3:2):
                                              “Repent, because the kingdom of
                                              heaven is near.” (c) The third
                                              difference is that the first law
                                              is heavy (Acts 15:10): “Why to you
                                              try to impose a yoke on our necks
                                              which even our fathers could not
                                              bear?” The second law, however, is
                                              light (Mt 11:30): “For my yoke is
                                              easy and my burden light;” and (Rm
                                              8:15): “You did not receive the
                                              spirit of servitude again in fear,
                                              but you received the spirit of
                                              adoption of sons.”

                                                  possunt scientiae insudare; et
                                                  propterea a Christo data est
                                                  lex brevis, ut ab omnibus
                                                  posset sciri, et nullus
                                                  propter ignorantiam possit ab
                                                  eius observantia excusari. Et
                                                  haec est lex divini amoris.
                                                  Apostolus, Rom. IX, 28:

                                                  actuum humanorum. Sicut enim
                                                  videmus in artificialibus quod
                                                  unumquodque opus tunc bonum et

                                                  quodlibet humanum opus rectum
                                                  est et virtuosum quando

                                                  As has been said, there is a
                                                  fourfold law: the first, the
                                                  law of nature which God
                                                  implanted at creation; the
                                                  second the law of
                                                  concupiscence; the third the
                                                  law of Scripture, and the
                                                  fourth, he law of charity and
                                                  grace, which is the law of
                                                  Christ. But it is clear that
                                                  not all can sweat away to gain
                                                  knowledge. Therefore Christ
                                                  gave an abridged law which all
                                                  can know, and no one can be
                                                  excused from observing it
                                                  because of ignorance. And that
                                                  is the law of divine love. The
                                                  Apostle says (Rm 9:28): “The
                                                  Lord will issue a brief
                                                  statement on the earth.” But
                                                  it should be realized that
                                                  this law must be the rule of
                                                  all human acts. We see that
                                                  manufactured goods are good
                                                  and right when they measure up
                                                  to a standard. So also any
                                                  human work is right and
                                                  virtuous when it harmonizes
                                                  with the standard of divine
                                                  love, and when it is out of
                                                  tune with this standard it is
                                                  not good or right or perfect.
                                                  For human acts to be good,
                                                  they must harmonize with the
                                                  standard of divine love.

                                                          that this law of
                                                          divine love produces
                                                          four very desirable
                                                          effects in man: (1)
                                                          First it causes
                                                          spiritual life in him.
                                                          For it is clear that
                                                          what is loved is
                                                          inside the lover.
                                                          Therefore whoever
                                                          loves God has him in
                                                          himself (1 Jn 4:16):
                                                          “Whoever remains in
                                                          love, remains in God
                                                          and God in him.” It is
                                                          also the nature of
                                                          love that it
                                                          transforms the lover
                                                          into what is loved
                                                          (Hos 9:10): “They
                                                          became abhorrent, just
                                                          like the things they
                                                          loved.” But if we love
                                                          God, we become divine,
                                                          because, as it is said
                                                          (1 Cor 6:17): “Whoever
                                                          sticks to the Lord
                                                          becomes one spirit
                                                          with him.” Augustine
                                                          says, “Just as the
                                                          soul is the life of
                                                          the body, so God is
                                                          the life of the soul.”
                                                          And that is clear,
                                                          because we say that
                                                          the body lives through
                                                          the soul when it
                                                          performs living
                                                          functions, such as
                                                          action and motion; but
                                                          when the soul leaves,
                                                          the body neither acts
                                                          nor moves. Likewise
                                                          the soul acts
                                                          virtuously and
                                                          perfectly when it acts
                                                          through charity,
                                                          through which God
                                                          dwells in it; but
                                                          without charity it
                                                          cannot act (1 Jn
                                                          3:14): “Whoever does
                                                          not love remains in
                                                          death.” It should be
                                                          noted, however, that
                                                          anyone who has all the
                                                          gifts of the Holy
                                                          Spirit apart from love
                                                          does not have life.
                                                          Whether it is the gift
                                                          of tongues or the gift
                                                          of faith or any other,
                                                          without charity they
                                                          do not give life. For
                                                          if a dead body is
                                                          dressed in gold and
                                                          precious stones, it
                                                          nonetheless remains
                                                          dead. So this is the
                                                          first effect of
                                                          charity.

                  Interrogatus Christus ante passionem, a legisperitis, quod

                  mandata, sicut satis manifestum est. In hoc enim omnia mandata
                  implentur.

                  Before his passion, the doctors of the Law asked Christ which
                  was the greatest and first commandment. He said (Mt 22:37):
                  “Love the Lord your God with all your heard, with all your
                  soul and all your mind; this is the greatest and first
                  commandment.” And that is truly that is the greatest, most
                  noble and most beneficial of all the commandments, as has
                  adequately been shown. For in this commandment all the other
                  commandments are fulfilled.

                      Sed ad hoc quod istud praeceptum dilectionis possit
                      perfecte impleri, quatuor requiruntur. Primum est
                      divinorum beneficiorum rememoratio: quia omnia quae
                      habemus, sive anima, sive corpus, sive exteriora, habemus
                      a Deo: et ideo oportet quod sibi de omnibus serviamus, et
                      eum diligamus corde perfecto. Nimis enim ingratus est qui
                      cogitans alicuius beneficia, eum non diligit. Haec
                      recogitans David dicebat, I Paralip. XXIX, 14:
                      <i

                      But to fulfill this commandment of love perfectly, four
                      things are required. The first is the recollection of the
                      divine benefits, because all that we have, whether our
                      soul or body or exterior things, we have them all from
                      God. Therefore we must serve him with all this and love
                      him with a perfect heart. A man would be extremely
                      ungrateful if, after thinking of all the benefits he
                      received from someone, he did not love him. With this in
                      mind, David said (1 Chron 29:14): “All belongs to you.
                      What we received from you we give to you.” Therefore in
                      his praise it is said (Sir 47:10): “With all his heart he
                      praised the Lord, and loved the God who made him.”

                          Secundum est divinae excellentiae consideratio. Deus
                          enim maior est corde nostro, I Ioan. III: unde si toto
                          corde et viribus ei serviamus, adhuc non sufficimus.
                          Eccli. XLIII, 32-33:
                          <i
                            >glorificantes dominum quantumcumque potueritis,
                            supervalebit adhuc (...) benedicentes dominum
                            exaltate illum quantum potestis: maior est enim omni

                        <td>
                          The second is consideration of the divine excellence.
                          For God is greater than our hearts (1 Jn 3); so if we
                          serve him with our whole heart and strength we still
                          fall short (Sir. 43:32-33): “When you praise the Lord,
                          exalt him as much as you can, for he will surpass even
                          that. When you exalt him put forth all your strength
                          and do not grow weary, for you cannot praise him
                          enough.”

                              Magnam enim iniuriam Deo facit qui aliquid ei
                              adaequat. Isai. XL, 18:
                              <i>cui similem fecistis Deum?</i> Tunc autem alia

                              omnino impossibile. Propterea dicitur Isai.
                              XXVIII, 20:

                              <i>ego sum Deus tuus Zelotes</i>. Nihil enim vult
                              quod diligamus quantum eum aut praeter eum.

                              The third is renunciation of worldly and earthly
                              things. For it is a big offense against God to
                              equate him with anything else (Is 40:18): “To whom
                              can you compare God?” We liken other things to God
                              when we love temporal and corruptible things along
                              with God. But this is altogether impossible. So it
                              is said (Is 28:20): “The bed is too short to
                              stretch out in it, and the covering is too short
                              to wrap oneself in it.” There the heart of man is
                              compared to a cramped bed and a short cover. For
                              the human heart is cramped with regard to God, so
                              that when you take into your heart things other
                              than him you push him out. for he cannot endure
                              any bed-fellow in the soul, just like a husband
                              with a wife. And so he himself states (Ex 20:5):
                              “I, Yahweh your God am a jealous God.” For he does
                              not want us to love anything as much as him or
                              besides him.

                                  Quartum est omnimoda peccatorum vitatio.
                                  Nullus enim potest diligere Deum in peccato
                                  existens. Matth. VI, 24:
                                  <i>non potestis Deo servire et mammonae</i>.
                                  Unde si in peccato existis, Deum non diligis.

                                  21:

                                  Sicut claudicans nunc huc nunc illuc
                                  inclinatur; sic et peccator nunc peccat, nunc
                                  Deum quaerere nititur. Et ideo dominus dicit,
                                  Ioelis II, 12:
                                  <i>convertimini ad me in toto corde vestro</i
                                  >.

                                  The fourth is complete avoidance of sin. For
                                  no one can love God when he is living in sin
                                  (Mt 6:24): “You cannot serve God and mammon.”
                                  So, if you are living in sin, you do not love
                                  God. But that man loved God who said (Is
                                  38:3): “Remember how I walked before you
                                  faithfully with a perfect heart.” Also Elijah
                                  said (1 Kg 18:21): “For how long will you go
                                  on limping with two opinions?” As a lame
                                  person bends this way and that, so a sinner
                                  wavers between sinning and seeking God.
                                  Therefore the Lord said (Joel 2:12): “Turn to
                                  me with all your heart.”

                                      But against that command, two kinds of
                                      people sin: (1) those who avoid one kind
                                      of sin, such as unchastity, while falling
                                      into another, such as usury. But they are
                                      still condemned, because “whoever offends
                                      in one point is guilty of breaking the
                                      whole law” (Jm 2:10). (2) Then there are
                                      those who confess some sins, and others
                                      not, or they split their confession
                                      between two or more confessors. But these
                                      do not merit, and rather sin by doing so,
                                      because they intend to deceive God and
                                      they are making a rift in the sacrament.

                                              It has now been shown that man
                                              must give himself to God. Now we
                                              have to see what is in him that he
                                              owes to God. Man owes God four
                                              things: his heart, his soul, his
                                              mind and his strength. And so it
                                              is said (Mt 22:37): “You shall
                                              love the Lord your God with all
                                              your heart, with all your soul,
                                              with all your mind and all your
                                              strength.” The “heart” here stands
                                              for intention. Intention has the
                                              power of drawing all actions under
                                              its sway, so that any good works
                                              done with a bad intention are
                                              turned into bad works (Lk 11:34):
                                              “If your eye”, that is, your
                                              intention, “is evil, your whole
                                              body will be dark;” that is, the
                                              totality of your good works will
                                              be dark. Therefore, in whatever we
                                              do our intention should be set on
                                              God. The Apostle says (1 Cor
                                              10:31): “Whether you eat or drink
                                              or do any other thing, do all for
                                              the glory of God.”

                                                  inutiliter, cum bona voluntas
                                                  desit; ut si quis furetur ut

                                                  But a good intention is not
                                                  enough, but there must also be
                                                  a good will, which is
                                                  indicated by the term “soul”.
                                                  For it often happens that
                                                  someone acts with a good
                                                  intention, but to no avail,
                                                  because a good will is
                                                  missing. For example, someone
                                                  may steal to feed the poor;
                                                  his intention is right, but he
                                                  is lacking the requisite good
                                                  will. So no evil can be
                                                  excused because it is done
                                                  with a good intention (Rm
                                                  3:8): “Those who [say we] say
                                                  ‘Let us do evil so that good
                                                  may come’ are justly
                                                  condemned.” A good will
                                                  accompanies an intention when
                                                  the will itself harmonizes
                                                  with the divine will, and that
                                                  we ask every day: “Your will
                                                  be done on earth as it is in
                                                  heaven.” And (Ps 39:9): “I
                                                  delight to do your will, my
                                                  God.” That is why it is said
                                                  “with all your soul.” For the
                                                  soul is often used in
                                                  Scripture for the will, as in
                                                  (Heb 10:38): “If he shrinks
                                                  back, my soul”, that is, my
                                                  will, “has no pleasure in
                                                  him.”

                                                      are present, but there is
                                                      some sin in the intellect.
                                                      Therefore the whole
                                                      intellect must be given to
                                                      God. The Apostle says (2
                                                      Cor 10:5): “taking every
                                                      intellect [thought]
                                                      captive to obey Christ.”
                                                      For many do not sin by
                                                      deed, but they like to
                                                      think much about sins.
                                                      Against them it is said
                                                      (Is 1:16): “Remove the
                                                      evil of your thoughts
                                                      [deeds].” There are also
                                                      many who trust in their
                                                      own wisdom and refuse to
                                                      accept the Faith; such are
                                                      not giving their minds to
                                                      God. Against them it is
                                                      said (Prov 3:5): “Do no
                                                      rely on your own
                                                      perception.”

                  Interrogatus Christus quod esset maximum mandatum, uni
                  interrogationi duas responsiones dedit. Et prima fuit:
                  <i>diliges dominum Deum tuum</i>; de quo dictum est. Secunda
                  vero fuit: <i>et proximum tuum sicut teipsum</i>. Ubi
                  considerandum est, quod qui hoc servat, totam legem implet.
                  Apostolus, Rom. XIII, 10:

                  When Christ was asked which is the greatest commandment, he
                  gave two answers to the one question. The first was “You shall
                  love the Lord your God,” which we have talked about. The
                  second was “and your neighbor as yourself.” At this point we
                  should point out that whoever observes this fulfills the whole
                  law. The Apostle said (Rm 13:10): “The fulfilment of the law
                  is love.”

                        <td>
                          There are four motives for loving our neighbor: The
                          first is divine love, since it is said (1 Jn 4:20):
                          “If anyone says that he loves God, while he hates his
                          brother, he is a liar.” For anyone who says he loves
                          someone, while hating his son or his members, he is
                          lying. But all of us faithful are sons and members of
                          Christ. The Apostle says (1 Cor 12:27): “You are the
                          body of Christ, and each of you a member of it.”
                          Therefore anyone who hates his neighbor does not love
                          God.

                              Secundum est divinum praeceptum. Christus enim in
                              recessu suo inter omnia alia praecepta, hoc
                              praeceptum discipulis praecipue commendavit
                              dicens, Ioan. XV, 12:
                              <i
                                >hoc est praeceptum meum, ut diligatis invicem
                                sicut dilexi vos</i
                              >. Nullus enim praecepta divina servat qui
                              proximum odit. Unde istud est signum observantiae
                              divinae legis, dilectio proximi. Unde dominus,
                              Ioan. XIII, 35:
                              <i
                                >in hoc cognoscent omnes quia discipuli mei
                                estis, si dilectionem habueritis ad invicem</i
                              >. Non dicit in suscitatione mortuorum, non in
                              aliquo evidenti signo; sed hoc est signum,
                              <i>si dilectionem habueritis ad invicem</i>. Et
                              hoc beatus Ioannes recte considerabat: unde
                              dicebat:
                              <i
                                >nos scimus quoniam translati sumus de morte ad
                                vitam</i
                              >. Et quare?
                              <i
                                >Quoniam diligimus fratres. Qui non diligit,
                                manet in morte</i
                              >.
                            </td>
                            <td>
                              The second motive is the divine precept. For when
                              Christ was going away, he stressed this
                              commandment to his disciples above all other
                              commandments, saying (Jn 15:12): “This is my
                              commandment, that you love one another as I have
                              loved you.” For no one is observing the divine
                              commandments if he hates his neighbor. So the sign
                              of observing the divine law is love of neighbor.
                              So the Lord said (Jn 13:35): “By this all will
                              know that you are my disciples, if you have love
                              for one another.” He does not point to raising the
                              dead or any other glaring sign, but this is the
                              sign: “if you have love for one another.” The
                              blessed John weighed this well when he said (1 Jn
                              3:14), “We know that we have been transferred from
                              death to life.” Why? “Because we love the
                              brothers. Whoever does not love remains in death.”

                                  Tertium est naturae communicatio. Sicut enim
                                  dicitur Eccli. XIII, 19,
                                  <i>omne animal diligit simile sibi</i>. Unde
                                  cum omnes homines sint similes in natura,
                                  invicem se diligere debent. Et ideo odire
                                  proximum non solum est contra divinam legem,
                                  sed etiam contra legem naturae.
                                </td>
                                <td>
                                  The third motive is our sharing in the same
                                  nature, as it is said (Sir 13:19): “Every
                                  animal loves its like.” Since all man are
                                  alike in nature, they should love one anther.
                                  So to hate one’s neighbor is not only against
                                  the divine law, but also against the law of
                                  nature.

                                      Quartum utilitatis consecutio. Omnia enim
                                      alterius alii sunt utilia per caritatem.
                                      Haec enim est quae unit Ecclesiam, et
                                      omnia communia facit. Psal. CXVIII, 63:
                                      <i
                                        >particeps ego sum omnium timentium te,
                                        et custodientium mandata tua.</i

                                      The fourth motive is the advantages it
                                      brings. For everything that one person has
                                      is useful to another through charity. For
                                      this is what unites the Church and makes
                                      everything common (Ps 118:63): “I am a
                                      companion of all who fear you and keep
                                      your precepts.”

                                              yourself.” That is the second
                                              commandment of the Law, and it
                                              concerns love of neighbor. We have
                                              discussed the fact that we must
                                              love our neighbor. Now we must
                                              turn to the way we must love him,
                                              and that is indicated in the words
                                              “as yourself”. Regarding this,
                                              there are five points we must
                                              observe in loving our neighbor:

                                                  triplex est amor; quorum duo
                                                  non sunt veri, tertius autem
                                                  verus. Primus est qui est

                                                  deficiente utilitate. Et tunc

                                                  The first is that we must love
                                                  him really as ourselves. We do
                                                  this if we love him for his
                                                  own sake, not because of our
                                                  own interest. Here recall that
                                                  there are three kinds of love.
                                                  The first is utilitarian (Sir
                                                  6:10): “he is a friend at
                                                  table, but will not be around
                                                  on the day of need.” That is
                                                  certainly not true love. It
                                                  vanishes when the advantage
                                                  vanishes. In that case we do
                                                  not wish good for our
                                                  neighbor, but rather our own
                                                  advantage. There is another
                                                  love directed at what is
                                                  pleasurable. This too is not
                                                  true love, because when the
                                                  pleasure vanishes it vanishes.
                                                  In that case we do not wish
                                                  good primarily for our
                                                  neighbor, but rather we want
                                                  his good for ourselves. The
                                                  third kind of love is for the
                                                  sake of virtue, and only that
                                                  is true love. For then we do
                                                  not love our neighbor in view
                                                  of our own good, but for his
                                                  own good.

                  Sicut iam dictum est, tota lex Christi dependet a caritate.
                  Caritas autem pendet ex duobus praeceptis; quorum unum est de
                  dilectione Dei, reliquum de dilectione proximi. Et de istis

                  The entire law of Christ depends upon charity. And charity
                  depends on two precepts, one of which concerns loving God and
                  the other concerns loving our neighbor.

                      Now God, in delivering the law to Moses, gave him Ten
                      Commandments written upon two tablets of stone. Three of
                      these Commandments that were written on the first tablet
                      referred to the love of God; and the seven Commandments
                      written on the other tablet related to the love of our
                      neighbor. The whole law, therefore, is founded on these
                      two precepts.

                              multipliciter hoc praeceptum transgrediebantur.
                              Quidam enim colebant Daemonia. Psal. XCV, 5:
                              <i>omnes dii gentium Daemonia</i>. Hoc autem est
                              maximum omnium peccatorum, et horribile. Nunc

                              intendunt. Haec enim, secundum Augustinum, fieri
                              non possunt quin aliquod pactum cum Diabolo
                              contrahatur. I Cor. X, 20:
                              <i>nolo vos fieri socios Daemoniorum</i>; et
                              iterum ibidem 21,

                              The First Commandment which relates to the love of
                              God is: “You shall not have strange gods.” For an
                              understanding of this Commandment, one must know
                              how of old it was violated. Some worshipped
                              demons. “All the gods of the Gentiles are devils”
                              [Ps 95:5]. This is the greatest and most
                              detestable of all sins. Even now there are many
                              who transgress this Commandment: all such as
                              practise divinations and fortune-telling. Such
                              things, according to St. Augustine, cannot be done
                              without some kind of pact with the devil. “I would
                              not that you should be made partakers with devils”
                              [1 Cor 10:20].

                                  Some worshipped the heavenly bodies, believing
                                  the stars to be gods: “They have imagined the
                                  sun and the moon to be the gods that rule the
                                  world” [Wis 13:2]. For this reason Moses
                                  forbade the Jews to raise their eyes, or adore
                                  the sun and moon and stars: “Keep therefore
                                  your souls carefully... lest perhaps lifting
                                  up your eyes to heaven, you see the sun and
                                  the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and
                                  being deceived by error you adore and serve
                                  them, which the Lord your God created for the
                                  service of all the nations” [Deut 4:15,19].
                                  The astrologers sin against this Commandment
                                  in that they say that these bodies are the
                                  rulers of souls, when in truth they were made
                                  for the use of man whose sole ruler is God.

                                                      [Phil 3:19]. We must,

                  This is the Second Commandment of the law. Just as there is
                  but one God whom we must worship, so there is only one God
                  whom we should reverence in a special manner. This, first of
                  all, has reference to the name of God. “You shall not take the
                  name of the Lord your God in vain.”

                          enim dicitur falsum. Psal. XI, 3:

                          “In vain” has a threefold meaning. Sometimes it is
                          said of that which is false: “They have spoken vain
                          things every one to his neighbor” [Ps 11:3]. One,
                          therefore, takes the name of God in vain when one uses
                          it to confirm that which is not true: “Love not a
                          false oath” [Zech 8:17]. “You shall not live because
                          you have spoken a lie in the name of the Lord” [Zech
                          13:3]. Any one so doing does injury to God, to
                          himself, and to all men.

                              It is an insult to God because, when you swear by
                              God, it is nothing other than to call Him to
                              witness; and when you swear falsely, you either
                              believe God to be ignorant of the truth and thus
                              place ignorance in God, whereas “all things are
                              naked and open to His eyes,”[Hb 4:13]. or you
                              think that God loves a lie, whereas He hates it:
                              “You will destroy all who speak lies” [Ps 5:7].
                              Or, again, you detract from His power, as if He
                              were not able to punish a lie.

                                  of God. It is the same thing to say, “By God

                                  it is not so!”

                                      For there can be no lasting society unless
                                      men believe one another. Matters that are
                                      doubtful may be confirmed by oaths: “An
                                      oath in confirmation puts an end to all
                                      controversy” [Hb 6:16]. Therefore, he who
                                      violates this precept does injury to God,
                                      is cruel to himself, and harmful to other
                                      men.

                                          Sometimes “vain” signifies useless:
                                          “The Lord knows the thoughts of men,
                                          that they are vain” [Ps 93:11]. God’s
                                          name, therefore, is taken in vain when
                                          it is used to confirm vain things.

                                              <i

                                              dicitur Matth. V, 33-34:

                                              In the Old Law it was forbidden to
                                              swear falsely: “You shall not take
                                              the name of the Lord your God in
                                              vain” [Dt 5:11]. And Christ
                                              forbade the taking of oaths except
                                              in case of necessity: “You have
                                              heard that it was said to them of
                                              old: You shall not swear
                                              falsely... But I say to you not to
                                              swear at all” [Mt 5:33-34]. And
                                              the reason for this is that in no
                                              part of our body are we so weak as
                                              in the tongue, for “the tongue no
                                              man can tame” [Jm 3:8]. And thus
                                              even in light matter one can
                                              perjure himself. “Let your speech
                                              be: Yea, yea; No, no. But I say to
                                              you not to swear at all” [Mt
                                              5:34,37].

                                                  Note well that an oath is like
                                                  medicine, which is never taken
                                                  continually but only in times
                                                  of necessity. Hence, the Lord
                                                  adds: “And what is over and
                                                  above these is evil” [Mt
                                                  5:37]. “Let not the mouth be
                                                  accustomed to swearing, for in
                                                  it there are many falls. And
                                                  let not the name of God be
                                                  usual in your mouth, and
                                                  meddle not with the names of
                                                  saints. For you shall not
                                                  escape free from them” [Sir

                                                      Sometimes “in vain” means
                                                      sin or injustice: “O sons

                                                      you love vanity?” [Ps
                                                      4:3]. Therefore, he who
                                                      swears to commit a sin,
                                                      takes the name of his God
                                                      in vain. Justice consists
                                                      in doing good and avoiding
                                                      evil. Therefore, if you

                                                      commit some crime of this
                                                      sort, you sin against
                                                      justice. And although you
                                                      must not keep this oath,
                                                      you are still guilty of
                                                      perjury. Herod did this
                                                      against John [Mk 6:17]. It
                                                      is likewise against
                                                      justice when one swears
                                                      not to do some good act,
                                                      as not to enter a church
                                                      or a religious community.
                                                      And although this oath,
                                                      too, is not binding, yet,
                                                      despite this, the person
                                                      himself is a perjurer.

                  This is the Third Commandment of the law, and very suitably is
                  it so. For we are first commanded to adore God in our hearts,
                  and the Commandment is to worship one God: “You shall not have
                  strange gods before Me.” In the Second Commandment we are told
                  to reverence God by word: “You shall not take the name of the
                  Lord your God in vain.” The Third commands us to reverence God
                  by act. It is: “Remember that you keep holy the Sabbath day”.
                  God wished that a certain day be set aside on which men direct
                  their minds to the service of the Lord.

                          Habetur autem hoc praeceptum quinque rationibus. Primo
                          enim datum fuit ad destructionem erroris. Praevidit
                          enim spiritus sanctus quod futuri erant aliqui dicturi
                          mundum semper fuisse. II Petr. III, 3-5:
                          <i
                            >venient in novissimis diebus in deceptione
                            illusores iuxta proprias concupiscentias ambulantes,
                            dicentes: ubi est promissio aut adventus eius? Ex
                            quo enim patres dormierunt, omnia sic perseverant ab
                            initio creaturae. Latet enim eos hoc volentes quod
                            caeli erant prius et terra de aqua, et per aquam
                            consistens Dei verbo</i
                          >. Voluit ergo Deus ut custodiretur unus dies in
                          memoriam quod Deus omnia creaverat in sex diebus, et
                          in septimo quievit a novis creaturis condendis. Et
                          hanc rationem ponit dominus in lege, dicens:
                          <i>memento ut diem sabbati sanctifices</i>. Sed Iudaei
                          in memoriam primae creationis colebant sabbatum;
                          Christus autem veniens fecit novam creationem. Per
                          primam enim homo terrenus, per secundam homo caelestis
                          effectus est. Gal. VI, 15:
                          <i
                            >in Christo Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet
                            neque praeputium, sed nova creatura</i
                          >. Et haec nova creatura est per gratiam, quae incepit
                          in resurrectione. Rom. VI, 4-5:
                          <i
                            >quomodo Christus surrexit a mortuis per gloriam
                            patris, ita et nos in novitate vitae ambulemus. Si
                            enim complantati facti sumus similitudini mortis
                            eius, simul et resurrectionis erimus</i
                          >. Et quia resurrectio facta est in dominica, ideo
                          celebramus illum diem, sicut Iudaei sabbatum propter
                          primam creationem.

                        <td>
                          There are five reasons for this Commandment. The first
                          reason was to put aside error, for the Holy Spirit saw
                          that in the future some men would say that the world
                          had always existed. “In the last days there shall come
                          deceitful scoffers, walking after their own lusts,
                          saying: Where is His promise or His coming? For since
                          the time that the fathers slept, all things continue
                          as they were from the beginning of creation. For this
                          they are willfully ignorant of, that the heavens were
                          before, and the earth out of water, and through water,
                          created by the word of God” [2 Pet 3:3-5]. God,
                          therefore, wished that one day should be set aside in
                          memory of the fact that He created all things in six
                          days, and that on the seventh day He rested from the
                          creation of new creatures. This is why the Lord placed
                          this Commandment in the law, saying: “Remember that
                          you keep holy the Sabbath day.” The Jews kept holy the
                          Sabbath in memory of the first creation; but Christ at
                          His coming brought about a new creation. For by the
                          first creation an earthly man was created, and by the
                          second a heavenly man was formed: “For in Christ Jesus
                          neither circumcision is worth any thing, nor
                          uncircumcision, but a new creature” [Gal 6:15]. This
                          new creation is through grace, which came by the
                          Resurrection: “That as Christ is risen from the dead
                          by the glory of the Father, so we also may walk in
                          newness of life. For if we have been planted together
                          in the likeness of His death, so shall we also be in
                          the likeness of His resurrection” [Rm 6:4-5]. And
                          thus, because the Resurrection took place on Sunday,
                          we celebrate that day, even as the Jews observed the
                          Sabbath on account of the first creation.

                              Secundo datum fuit ad instructionem fidei
                              redemptoris. Caro enim Christi in sepulcro
                              corrupta non fuit: unde dicit Psal. XV, 9:
                              <i>caro mea requiescat in spe</i>; item, ibidem
                              10:
                              <i>non dabis sanctum tuum videre corruptionem</i>.
                              Unde voluit sabbatum observari, ut sicut
                              sacrificia significabant mortem Christi, ita quies
                              sabbati requiem carnis eius. Sed nos ista
                              sacrificia non servamus, quia adveniente re et
                              veritate, debet cessare figura, sicut adveniente
                              sole cessat umbra; servamus tamen in veneratione
                              virginis gloriosae, in qua remansit tota fides
                              tali die in morte Christi.

                            <td>
                              The second reason for this Commandment is to
                              instruct us in our faith in the Redeemer. For the
                              flesh of Christ was not corrupted in the
                              sepulchre, and thus it is said: “Moreover My flesh
                              also shall rest in hope” [Ps 15:9]. “Nor will You
                              let your holy one see corruption” [Ps 15:10].
                              Wherefore, God wished that the Sabbath should be
                              observed, and that just as the sacrifices of the
                              Old Law signified the death of Christ, so should
                              the quiet of the Sabbath signify the rest of His
                              body in the sepulchre. But we do not now observe
                              these sacrifices, because with the advent of the
                              reality and the truth, figures of it must cease,
                              just as the darkness is dispelled with the rising
                              of the sun. Nevertheless, we keep the Saturdays in
                              veneration of the Blessed Virgin, in whom remained
                              a firm faith on that Saturday while Christ was
                              dead.

                                  The third reason is that this Commandment was
                                  given to strengthen and foreshadow the
                                  fulfillment of the promise of rest. For rest
                                  indeed was promised to us: “And on that day
                                  God shall give you rest from your labor, from
                                  your vexation, and from the hard bondage, to
                                  which you had been subjugated” [Is 14:3]. “My
                                  people shall dwell in a peaceful land, in
                                  secure accommodation, and in quiet places of
                                  rest” [Is 32:18].

                                      We hope for rest from three things: from

                                      struggles of temptations, and from the
                                      servitude of the devil. Christ promised
                                      this rest to all those who will come to
                                      Him: “Come to Me, all ye that labor and
                                      are burdened, and I will refresh you. Take
                                      up My yoke upon you, and learn of Me,

                                          rested, because it is necessary to do

                                              given for the increase of our
                                              love: “For the corruptible body is
                                              a load upon the soul” [Wis 9:15].
                                              And man always tends downwards
                                              towards earthly things unless he
                                              takes means to raise himself above
                                              them. It is indeed necessary to
                                              have a certain time for this; in
                                              fact, some do this continually: “I
                                              will bless the Lord at all times,
                                              His praise shall ever be in my
                                              mouth” [Ps 33:2]. And again: “Pray
                                              without ceasing” [1 Thes 5:17].
                                              These shall enjoy the everlasting
                                              Sabbath. There are others who do
                                              this (i.e., excite love for God)
                                              during a certain portion of the
                                              day: “Seven times a day I have
                                              given praise to You” [Ps 118:164].
                                              And some, in order to avoid being
                                              entirely apart from God, find it
                                              necessary to have a fixed day,
                                              lest they become too lukewarm in
                                              their love of God: “If you call
                                              the Sabbath delightful... then
                                              shall you delight in the Lord” [Is
                                              58:13-14]. Again: “Then shall you

                                              face to God” [Job 22:26]. And
                                              accordingly this day is not set
                                              aside for the sole exercise of
                                              games, but to praise and pray to
                                              the Lord God. Wherefore, St.
                                              Augustine says that it is a lesser
                                              evil to plough than to play on
                                              this day.

                                                  Commandment in order to

                                                  account of money. This is true
                                                  especially of the Jews, who
                                                  are most avaricious. “Observe
                                                  the day of the Sabbath to
                                                  sanctify it... that your

                                                  given for all these reasons.

                  Perfectio hominis consistit in dilectione Dei et proximi. Et
                  ad dilectionem Dei pertinent tria praecepta quae scripta
                  fuerunt in prima tabula; ad dilectionem vero proximi septem
                  quae sunt in secunda tabula. Sed, sicut dicitur I Ioan. III,
                  non debemus diligere verbo neque lingua, sed opere et
                  veritate. Homo enim sic diligens debet duo facere: scilicet
                  fugere malum, et facere bonum. Unde quaedam sunt in praeceptis
                  inducentia ad bonum, alia autem sunt prohibentia facere malum.
                  Et sciendum, quod cavere a malo faciendo est in potentia
                  nostra; sed facere cuilibet bonum non possumus: et ideo dicit
                  beatus Augustinus, quod nos omnes debemus diligere, sed non
                  omnibus tenemur benefacere. Sed inter omnes debemus benefacere
                  coniunctis nobis: quia,
                  <i
                    >si quis suorum, et maxime domesticorum, curam non habet,
                    infidelis est</i
                  >, I ad Tim. V, 8. Inter omnes autem propinquos sunt nobis
                  propinquiores pater et mater; et ideo dicit Ambrosius:
                  <i>primo debemus diligere Deum; secundo patrem et matrem</i>;
                  et hoc est quod dicit:
                  <i>honora patrem tuum et matrem tuam</i>.

                  Perfection for man consists in the love of God and of
                  neighbor. Now, the three Commandments which were written on
                  the first tablet pertain to the love of God; for the love of
                  neighbor there were the seven Commandments on the second
                  tablet. But we must “love, not in word nor in tongue, but in
                  deed and in truth” [1 Jn 3]. For a man to love thus, he must
                  do two things, namely, avoid evil and do good. Certain of the
                  Commandments prescribe good acts, while others forbid evil
                  deeds. And we must also know that to avoid evil is in our
                  power; but we are incapable of doing good to everyone. Thus,
                  St. Augustine says that we should love all, but we are not
                  bound to do good to all. But among those to whom we are bound
                  to do good are those in some way united to us. Thus, “if any
                  man does not take care of his own, especially of those of his
                  house, he has denied the faith” [1 Tim 5:8]. Now, amongst all
                  our relatives there are none closer than our father and
                  mother. “We ought to love God first,” says St. Ambrose, “then
                  our father and mother.” Hence, God has given us the
                  Commandment: “Honor your father and your mother.”

                      Ioan. I, sed a parentibus sustentatur. Tertio documentum.
                      Hebr. XII, 9:
                      <i>patres quidem carnis nostrae eruditores habuimus</i>.
                      Eccli. VII, 25: <i>filii tibi sunt? Erudi illos</i>.

                      The Philosopher also gives another reason for this honor
                      to parents, in that we cannot make an equal return to our
                      parents for the great benefits they have granted to us;
                      and, therefore, an offended parent has the right to send
                      his son away, but the son has no such right [
                      <i>Ethics</i> V]. Parents, indeed, give their children
                      three things. The first is that they brought them into
                      being: “Honor your father, and forget not the groanings of
                      your mother; remember that through them you were born”
                      [Sir 7:29-30]. Secondly, they furnished nourishment and
                      the support necessary for life. For a child comes naked
                      into the world, as Job relates (1:24), but he is provided
                      for by his parents. The third is instruction: “We have had
                      fathers of our flesh for instructors” [Hb 12:9]. “Do you
                      have children? Instruct them” [Sir 7:25].

                          Et debent parentes dare duo documenta filiis, et cito:
                          quia, ut dicitur Prov. XXII, 6,
                          <i

                          >; et Thren. III, 27:
                          <i
                            >bonum est viro cum portaverit iugum ab adolescentia
                            sua</i
                          >. Et sunt illa quae docuit Tobias filium suum Tobiae
                          IV, scilicet <i>timorem domini</i>, et
                          <i>abstinere ab omni peccato</i>. Et hoc est contra
                          illos qui delectantur in malitiis filiorum. Sed, sicut
                          dicitur Sap. IV, 6,
                          <i
                            >ex iniquis omnes filii qui nascuntur, testes sunt

                          >. Unde Deus punit peccatum in filio, ut dicitur Exod.
                          XX. Igitur filii a parentibus habent esse, nutrimentum

                          Parents, therefore, should give instruction without
                          delay to their children, because “a young man
                          according to his way, even when he is old will not
                          depart from it” [Prov 22:6]. And again: “It is good
                          for a man when he has borne the yoke from his youth”
                          [Lam 3:27]. Now, the instruction which Tobias gave his
                          son (Tob 4) was this: to fear the Lord and to abstain
                          from sin. This is indeed contrary to those parents who
                          approve of the misdeeds of their children. Children,
                          therefore, receive from their parents birth,
                          nourishment, and instruction.

                                  superiors, because from such we receive only
                                  temporal things: “He who fears the Lord honors
                                  his parents, and will serve them as his
                                  masters that brought him into the world. Honor

                                  [Sir 3:10]. And in doing this you shall also
                                  honor thyself, because “the glory of a man is

                                      Again, since we receive nourishment from
                                      our parents in our childhood, we must
                                      support them in their old age: “Son,
                                      support the old age of your father, and
                                      grieve him not in his life. And if his
                                      understanding fail, have patience with
                                      him; and do not despise him when you are
                                      in your strength... Of what an evil fame
                                      is he who forsakes his father! And he is
                                      cursed of God who angers his mother” [Sir
                                      3:14,15]. For the humiliation of those who
                                      act contrary to this, Cassiodorus relates
                                      how young storks, when the parents have
                                      lost their feathers by approaching old age
                                      and are unable to find suitable food, make
                                      the parent storks comfortable with their
                                      own feathers, and bring back food for
                                      their worn-out bodies. Thus, by this
                                      affectionate exchange the young ones repay
                                      the parents for what they received when
                                      they were young” [ <i>Epist.</i> II].

                                          We must obey our parents, for they
                                          have instructed us. “Children, obey
                                          your parents in all things” [Col
                                          3:20]. This excepts, of course, those
                                          things which are contrary to God. St.
                                          Jerome says that the only loyalty in
                                          such cases is to be cruel [
                                          <i>Ad Heliod</i> ]: “If any man hate
                                          not his father and mother... he cannot
                                          be My disciple” [Lk 14:26]. This is to
                                          say that God is in the truest sense
                                          our Father: “Is not He your Father who
                                          possessed you, made you and created
                                          you?” [Deut 32:6].

                                                  those who honor their parents,

                                                  honor their parents.

                                                      [Sir 3:9-10]. The very

                                                      parents; indeed, they are
                                                      cursed in the law by God
                                                      [Deut 27:16]. It is also
                                                      written: “He who is unjust
                                                      in that which is little,
                                                      is unjust also in what is
                                                      greater” [Lk 16:10]. But
                                                      this our natural life is
                                                      as nothing compared with
                                                      the life of grace. And so,
                                                      therefore, if you do not
                                                      acknowledge the blessing
                                                      of the natural life which
                                                      you owe to your parents,
                                                      then you are unworthy of
                                                      the life of grace, which
                                                      is greater, and all the
                                                      more so for the life of
                                                      glory, which is the
                                                      greatest of all blessings.

                                                          the land.” For “he who

                                                          that is a long life
                                                          which is a full life,
                                                          and it is not observed

                                                          Life, however, is full

                                                          and holy enjoys a long

                                                          he dies young: “Being
                                                          perfect in a short
                                                          space, he fulfilled a
                                                          long time; for his
                                                          soul pleased God” [Wis
                                                          4:13]. Thus, for
                                                          example, he is a good
                                                          merchant who does as
                                                          much business in one
                                                          day as another would
                                                          do in a year. And note
                                                          well that it sometimes
                                                          happens that a long
                                                          life may lead up to a
                                                          spiritual as well as a
                                                          bodily death, as was
                                                          the case with Judas.
                                                          Therefore, the reward
                                                          for keeping this
                                                          Commandment is a long
                                                          life for the body. But
                                                          the very opposite,
                                                          namely, death is the
                                                          fate of those who
                                                          dishonor their
                                                          parents. We receive
                                                          our life from them;
                                                          and just as the

                                                          the king, and lose
                                                          their rights in case
                                                          of any treachery, so
                                                          also they who dishonor
                                                          their parents deserve
                                                          to forfeit their
                                                          lives: “The eye that

                                                          young eagles eat it”
                                                          [Prov 30:17]. Here

                                                          princes, who in turn
                                                          are the “young
                                                          eagles.” But if it
                                                          happens that such are

                                                          they nevertheless

                      In the divine law which tells us we must love God and our
                      neighbor, it is commanded that we not only do good but
                      also avoid evil. The greatest evil that can be done to
                      one’s neighbor is to take his life. This is prohibited in
                      the Commandment: “You shall not kill.”

                          Killing of Animals Is Lawful.—In connection with this
                          Commandment there are three errors. Some have said
                          that it is not permitted to kill even brute animals.
                          But this is false, because it is not a sin to use that
                          which is subordinate to the power of man. It is in the
                          natural order that plants be the nourishment of
                          animals, certain animals nourish others, and all for
                          the nourishment of man: “Even the green herbs have I
                          delivered them all to you” [Gen 9:3]. The Philosopher
                          says that hunting is like a just war [
                          <i>Politics</i> I]. And St. Paul says: “Whatsoever is
                          sold in the meat market, eat; asking no questions for
                          conscience’ sake” [1 Cor 10:25]. Therefore, the sense
                          of the Commandment is: “You shall not kill men.”

                              <i>ego occidam, et vivere faciam</i>. Est ergo
                              licitum illis qui mandato Dei occidunt, quia tunc
                              Deus facit. Omnis enim lex mandatum Dei est. Prov.
                              VIII, 15:

                              <i>maleficos non patieris vivere</i>. Id enim quod
                              licitum est Deo, licitum est et ministris eius,
                              per mandatum ipsius. Constat autem quod Deus non
                              peccat, cum sit auctor legum, infligendo mortem
                              propter peccatum. Rom. VI, 23:
                              <i>stipendia peccati mors</i>. Ergo nec minister
                              eius. Est ergo sensus: <i>non occides</i> propria

                              The Execution of Criminals.—Some have held that
                              the killing of man is prohibited altogether. They
                              believe that judges in the civil courts are
                              murderers, who condemn men to death according to
                              the laws. Against this St. Augustine says that God
                              by this Commandment does not take away from
                              Himself the right to kill. Thus, we read: “I will
                              kill and I will make to live” [Deut 32:39]. It is,
                              therefore, lawful for a judge to kill according to
                              a mandate from God, since in this God operates,
                              and every law is a command of God: “By Me kings
                              reign, and lawgivers decree just things” [Prov
                              8:15]. And again: “For if you do what is evil,
                              fear; for he does not bear the sword in vain; for
                              he is God’s minister” [Rm 13:14]. To Moses also it
                              was said: “Wizards you shall not allow to live”
                              [Ex 22:18]. And thus that which is lawful to God
                              is lawful for His ministers when they act by His
                              mandate. It is evident that God who is the Author
                              of laws, has every right to inflict death on
                              account of sin. For “the wages of sin is death”
                              [Rm 6:23]. Neither does His minister sin in
                              inflicting that punishment. The sense, therefore,
                              of “You shall not kill” is that one shall not kill
                              by one’s own authority.

                                  Suicide is Prohibited.—There are those who
                                  held that although this Commandment forbids
                                  one to kill another, yet it is lawful to kill
                                  oneself. Thus, there are the examples of
                                  Samson (Judges, xvi) and Cato and certain
                                  virgins who threw themselves into the flames,
                                  as St. Augustine relates in
                                  <i>The City of God</i> [I, 27]. But he also
                                  explains this in the words: “He who kills
                                  himself, certainly kills a man” [
                                  <i>ibid.</i> 13]. If it is not lawful to kill
                                  except by the authority of God, then it is not
                                  lawful to kill oneself except either upon the
                                  authority of God or instructed by the Holy
                                  Spirit, as was the case of Samson. Therefore,
                                  “you shall not kill.”

                                      Other Meanings of “To Kill.”—It ought to
                                      be known that to kill a man may happen in
                                      several ways. Firstly, by one’s own hand:
                                      “Your hands are full of blood” [Is 1:15].
                                      This is not only against charity, which
                                      tells us to love our neighbor as
                                      ourselves: “No murderer has eternal life
                                      abiding in himself” [Jn 3:15]. But also it
                                      is against nature, for “every beast loves
                                      its like” [Sir 13:19]. And so it is said:
                                      “He who strikes a man with a will to kill
                                      him, shall be put to death” [Ex 21:12]. He
                                      who does this is more cruel than the wolf,
                                      of which Aristotle says that one wolf will
                                      not eat of the flesh of another wolf [
                                      <i>De animal.</i> IV].

                                          mouth. This is done by giving counsel
                                          to anyone against another by

                                                      negligence or avarice.
                                                      Thus, St. Ambrose says:
                                                      “Give food to him that is
                                                      dying of hunger; if you do
                                                      not, you are his

                  After the prohibition of murder, adultery is forbidden. This
                  is fitting, since husband and wife are as one body. “They
                  shall be,” says the Lord, “two in one flesh” [Gen 2:24].
                  Therefore, after an injury inflicted upon a man in his own
                  person, none is so grave as that which is inflicted upon a
                  person with whom one is joined.

                      Adultery is forbidden both to the wife and the husband. We
                      shall first consider the adultery of the wife, since in
                      this seems to lie the greater sin, for a wife who commits
                      adultery is guilty of three grave sins, which are implied
                      in the following words: “So every woman who leaves her
                      husband,... first, is unfaithful to the law of the Most
                      High; and secondly, she has offended against her husband;
                      thirdly, she has fornicated in adultery, and hath gotten
                      her children of another man” [Sir 23:32-33].

                          First, therefore, she has sinned by lack of faith,
                          since she is unfaithful to the law wherein God has
                          forbidden adultery. Moreover, she has spurned the
                          ordinance of God: “What therefore God has joined
                          together, let no man put asunder” [Mt 19:6]. And also
                          she has sinned against the institution or Sacrament.
                          Because marriage is contracted before the eyes of the
                          Church, and thereupon God is called, as it were, to
                          witness a bond of fidelity which must be kept: “The
                          Lord hath been witness between you and the wife of
                          your youth whom you have despised” [Mal 2:14].
                          Therefore, she has sinned against the law of God,
                          against a precept of the Church and against a
                          Sacrament of God.

                              Secundo peccat per proditionem, quia derelinquit
                              virum. Apostolus, I Cor. VII, 4:
                              <i

                              committit, dum seipsam alteri tradit, sicut servus
                              dans se alteri domino. Prov. II, 17:
                              <i
                                >reliquit ducem pubertatis suae, et pacti Dei

                              Secondly, she sins by infidelity because she has
                              betrayed her husband: “The wife does not have
                              power over her own body: but the husband” [1 Cor
                              7:4]. In fact, without the consent of the husband
                              she cannot observe chastity. If adultery is
                              committed, then, an act of treachery is
                              perpetrated in that the wife gives herself to
                              another, just as if a servant gave himself to
                              another master: “She forsakes the guide of her
                              youth, and has forgotten the covenant of her God”
                              [Prov 2:17-18].

                                  man not her husband; and this is a most grave
                                  theft in that she expends her heredity upon
                                  children not her husband’s. Let it be noted
                                  that such a one should encourage her children
                                  to enter religion, or upon such a walk of life
                                  that they do not succeed in the property of
                                  her husband. Therefore, an adulteress is
                                  guilty of sacrilege, treachery and theft.

                                      plures viros; et ideo non erat aequalitas.

                                      Husbands, however, do not sin any less
                                      than wives, although they sometimes may
                                      salve themselves to the contrary. This is
                                      clear for three reasons. First, because of
                                      the equality which holds between husband
                                      and wife, for “the husband also does not
                                      have power over his own body, but the
                                      wife” [1 Cor 7:4]. Therefore, as far as
                                      the rights of matrimony are concerned, one
                                      cannot act without the consent of the
                                      other. As an indication of this, God did
                                      not form woman from the foot or from the
                                      head, but from the rib of the man. Now,
                                      marriage was at no time a perfect state
                                      until the law of Christ came, because the
                                      Jew could have many wives, but a wife
                                      could not have many husbands; hence,
                                      equality did not exist.

                                          ex eius auctoritate, quia vir est
                                          caput mulieris: unde mulieres non
                                          debent loqui in Ecclesia, sed domi
                                          viros interrogare, ut dicitur I Cor.
                                          XIV. Est ergo vir doctor mulieris; et
                                          ideo Deus praeceptum dedit viro. Magis
                                          autem peccat sacerdos quam laicus, et
                                          episcopus quam sacerdos, si non
                                          servant quae debent, quia docere alios
                                          ad ipsos pertinet. A simili, si vir
                                          moechatur, frangit fidem non servando
                                          ea quae debet. Sed tamen uxores
                                          attendant ad id quod Christus dicit,
                                          Matth. XXIII, 3:

                                          The second reason is because strength
                                          is a special quality of the man, while
                                          the passion proper to the woman is
                                          concupiscence: “You husbands, likewise
                                          dwelling with them according to
                                          knowledge, giving honor to the female
                                          as to the weaker vessel” [1 Pt 3:7].
                                          Therefore, if you ask from your wife
                                          what you do not keep yourself, then
                                          you are unfaithful. The third reason
                                          is from the authority of the husband.
                                          For the husband is head of the wife,
                                          and as it is said: “Women may not
                                          speak in the church,... if they would
                                          learn anything, let them ask their
                                          husbands at home” [10]. The husband is
                                          the teacher of his wife, and God,
                                          therefore, gave the Commandment to the
                                          husband. Now, as regards fulfillment
                                          of their duties, a priest who fails is
                                          more guilty than a layman, and a
                                          bishop more than a priest, because it
                                          is especially incumbent upon them to
                                          teach others. In like manner, the
                                          husband that commits adultery breaks
                                          faith by not obeying that which he
                                          ought.

                                                  “Do not err: neither
                                                  fornicators... nor adulterers,
                                                  nor the effeminate, nor liers
                                                  with men shall possess the
                                                  kingdom of God” [1 Cor 6:9].
                                                  But one is not excluded from
                                                  the kingdom of God except by
                                                  mortal sin; therefore,
                                                  fornication is a mortal sin.

                                                      nevertheless, there is

                                                          also every form of
                                                          immodesty and
                                                          impurity. There are
                                                          some who say that
                                                          intercourse between
                                                          married persons is not
                                                          devoid of sin. But
                                                          this is heretical, for
                                                          the Apostle says: “Let
                                                          marriage be honorable
                                                          in all and the bed
                                                          undefiled” [Hb 13:4].
                                                          Not only is it devoid
                                                          of sin, but for those
                                                          in the state of grace
                                                          it is meritorious for
                                                          eternal life.
                                                          Sometimes, however, it
                                                          may be a venial sin,
                                                          sometimes a mortal
                                                          sin. When it is had
                                                          with the intention of
                                                          bringing forth
                                                          offspring, it is an
                                                          act of virtue. When it
                                                          is had with the intent
                                                          of rendering mutual
                                                          comfort, it is an act
                                                          of justice. When it is
                                                          a cause of exciting
                                                          lust, although within
                                                          the limits of
                                                          marriage, it is a
                                                          venial sin; and when
                                                          it goes beyond these
                                                          limits, so as to
                                                          intend intercourse
                                                          with another if
                                                          possible, it would be
                                                          a mortal sin.

                  The Lord specifically forbids injury to our neighbor in the
                  Commandments. Thus, “You shall not kill” forbids us to injure
                  our neighbor in his own person; “You shall not commit
                  adultery” forbids injury to the person to whom one is bound in
                  marriage; and now the Commandment, “You shall not steal,”
                  forbids us to injure our neighbor in his goods. This
                  Commandment forbids any worldly goods whatsoever to be taken
                  away wrongfully.

                      Theft is committed in a number of ways. First, by taking
                      stealthily: “If the good man of the house knew at what
                      hour the thief would come” [Mt 24:43]. This is an act
                      wholly blameworthy because it is a form of treachery.
                      “Confusion... is upon the thief” [Sir 5:17].

                          Secondly, by taking with violence, and this is an even
                          greater injury: “They have violently robbed the
                          fatherless” [Job 24:9]. Among such that do such things
                          are wicked kings and rulers: “Her princes are in the
                          midst of her as roaring lions; her judges are evening
                          wolves, they left nothing for the morning” [Zeph 3:3].
                          They act contrary to God’s will who wishes a rule
                          according to justice: “By Me kings reign and lawgivers
                          decree just things” [Prov 8:15]. Sometimes they do
                          such things stealthily and sometimes with violence:
                          “Your princes are faithless companions of thieves,
                          they all love bribes, they run after rewards” [Is
                          1:23]. At times they steal by enacting laws and
                          enforcing them for profit only: “Woe to those who make
                          wicked laws” [Is 10:1]. And St. Augustine says that
                          every wrongful usurpation is theft when he asks: “What
                          are thrones but forms of thievery?”[
                          <i>City of God</i> IV, 4].

                              Thirdly, theft is committed by not paying wages
                              that are due: “The wages of him whom you have
                              hired shall not abide by you until the morning”
                              [Lev 19:13]. This means that a man must pay every
                              one his due, whether he be prince, prelate, or
                              cleric, etc.: “Render therefore to all men their
                              dues. Tribute, to whom tribute is due, custom, to
                              whom custom” [Rm 13:7]. Hence, we are bound to
                              give a return to rulers who guard our safety.

                                  The fourth kind of theft is fraud in buying
                                  and selling: “You shall not have divers
                                  weights in your bag, a greater and a less”
                                  [Deut 25:13]. And again: “Do no unjust thing
                                  in judgment, in rule, in weight, or in
                                  measure” [Lev 19:35-36]. All this is directed
                                  against the keepers of wine-shops who mix
                                  water with the wine. Usury is also forbidden:
                                  “Who shall dwell in your tabernacle, or who
                                  shall rest in your holy hill?... He who has
                                  not put his money out to usury” [Ps 14:1,5].
                                  This is also against money-changers who commit
                                  many frauds, and against the sellers of cloth
                                  and other goods.

                                      Answer: In money the sin is that an item
                                      is sold twice. But in a house there are
                                      two items: the substance and the use. It
                                      is one thing to have a house, and another
                                      to use the house. So I can sell separately
                                      the use of a house without selling the
                                      house itself. The same for such like. But
                                      for things that consist in the use alone,
                                      and the use alienates the item, the same
                                      distinction cannot be made as with a
                                      house. We use money by alienating it, and
                                      food by consuming it. Therefore if you
                                      sell the use, you are selling twice.]

                                          Fifthly, theft is committed by those

                                          of his belly” [Job 20:15], has
                                          reference to temporal position. Thus,

                                          province or land by force are thieves,

                                          and a robber” [Jn 10:1]. Therefore,
                                          they who commit simony are thieves.

                                                  given. The first is because of
                                                  the gravity of this sin, which
                                                  is likened to murder: “The
                                                  bread of the needy is the life
                                                  of the poor; he who defrauds
                                                  them of it is a man of blood”
                                                  [Sir 24:25]. And again: “He
                                                  who sheds blood and he who
                                                  defrauds the laborer of his
                                                  hire are brothers” [Sir

                                                      for instance, of murder

                                                      on for others; but even if
                                                      one repents of this sin,

                                                      for the sin itself: “Woe

                  The Lord has forbidden anyone to injure his neighbor by deed;
                  now he forbids us to injure him by word. “You shall not bear
                  false witness against your neighbor.” This may occur in two
                  ways, either in a court of justice or in ordinary
                  conversation.

                      In iudicio autem tribus modis, secundum quod tres personae
                      possunt facere contra hoc praeceptum. Prima persona,
                      scilicet accusantis falso. Lev. XIX, 16:
                      <i>non eris criminator nec susurro in populo</i>. Et nota,
                      quod sicut non debes dicere falsum, ita non debes tacere
                      verum. Matth. XVIII, 15:
                      <i
                        >si autem peccaverit in te frater tuus, vade, et corripe
                        eum</i
                      >. Item persona testificantis mentiendo. Prov. XIX, 5:
                      <i>testis falsus non erit impunitus</i>. Hoc enim
                      praeceptum includit omnia praecedentia: quia aliquando
                      talis est homicida, aliquando fur et cetera. Debent autem
                      isti puniri poena, de qua dicitur, Deut. XIX, 18, 19, 21:

                      In the court of justice it may happen in three ways,
                      according to the three persons who may violate this
                      Commandment in court. The first person is the plaintiff
                      who makes a false accusation: “You shall not be a
                      detractor nor a whisperer among the people” [Lev 19:16].
                      And note well that it is not only wrong to speak falsely,
                      but also to conceal the truth: “If your brother offends
                      you, go and rebuke him” [Mt 18:15]. The second person is
                      the witness who testifies by lying: “A false witness shall
                      not be unpunished” [Prov 25:18]. For this Commandment
                      includes all the preceding ones, inasmuch as the false
                      witness may himself be the murderer or the thief, etc. And
                      such should be punished according to the law. “When after
                      most diligent inquisition, they shall find that the false
                      witness hath told a lie against his brother, they shall
                      render to him as he meant to do to his brother.... You
                      shall not pity him, but shall require life for life, eye
                      for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot”
                      [Deut 19:18-21]. And again: “A man who bears false witness
                      against his neighbor is like a dart and a sword and a
                      sharp arrow” [Prov 25:18]. The third person is the judge
                      who sins by giving an unjust sentence: “You shall not...
                      judge unjustly. Respect not the person of the poor, nor
                      honor the countenance of the mighty. But judge your
                      neighbor according to justice” [Lev 19:15].

                              detractores. Rom. I, 30:
                              <i>detractores Deo odibiles</i>. Dicit enim,
                              <i>Deo odibiles</i>, quia nihil est ita carum
                              homini sicut fama. Eccle. VII, 2:
                              <i
                                >melius est nomen bonum quam unguenta

                              >. Prov. XXII, 1:
                              <i>melius est nomen bonum quam divitiae multae</i
                              >. Detractores autem auferunt hoc. Eccle. X, 11:
                              <i
                                >si mordeat serpens in silentio, nihil eo minus
                                habet qui occulte detrahit</i
                              >. Unde si famam non restituant, salvari non
                              possunt.

                              In ordinary conversation one may violate this
                              Commandment in five ways. The first is by
                              detraction: “Detractors, hateful to God” [Rm
                              1:30]. “Hateful to God” here indicates that
                              nothing is so dear to a man as his good name: “A
                              good name is better than great riches” [Prov
                              22:1]. But detractors take away this good name:
                              “If a serpent bite in silence, he is no better
                              that backbites secretly” [Eccles 10:11].
                              Therefore, if detractors do not restore this
                              reputation, they cannot be saved.

                                  Item qui detractores libenter audit. Eccli.
                                  XXVIII, 28:
                                  <i

                                  tristem et torvum. Prov. XXV, 23:
                                  <i
                                    >ventus Aquilo dissipat pluvias, et facies

                                  Secondly, one may break this precept by
                                  listening to detractors willingly: “Hedge in
                                  your ears with thorns, do not listen to a
                                  wicked tongue, and make doors and bars for
                                  your mouth” [Sir 28:28]. One should not listen
                                  deliberately to such things, but ought to turn
                                  away, showing a sad and stern countenance:
                                  “The north wind drives away rain as does a sad
                                  countenance a backbiting tongue” [Prov 25:23].

                                      Thirdly, gossipers break this precept when
                                      they repeat whatever they hear: “Six
                                      things there are which the Lord hates, and
                                      the seventh His soul detests... one who

                                                      The prohibition of this
                                                      Commandment includes every
                                                      form of falsehood: “Refuse
                                                      to utter any lie; for the
                                                      habit of lying serves no
                                                      good” [Sir 7:14]. There
                                                      are four reasons for this.
                                                      The first is that lying
                                                      likens one to the devil,
                                                      because a liar is as the
                                                      son of the devil. Now, we
                                                      know that a man’s speech
                                                      betrays from what region
                                                      and country he comes from,
                                                      thus: “Even your accent
                                                      betrays you” [Mt 26:73].
                                                      Even so, some men are of
                                                      the devil’s kind, and are
                                                      called sons of the devil
                                                      because they are liars,
                                                      since the devil is “a liar
                                                      and the father of lies”
                                                      [Jn 8:44]. Thus, when the
                                                      devil said, “No, certainly
                                                      you shall not die,” [Gen
                                                      3:4], he lied. But, on the
                                                      contrary, others are the
                                                      children of God, who is
                                                      Truth, and they are those

                    Haec est differentia inter legem divinam et mundanam: quia
                    lex mundana iudicat facta et dicta; divina autem non haec
                    tantum, sed etiam cogitata. Et ratio huius est, quia illa
                    est per homines, qui iudicant ea quae apparent exterius; sed
                    divina est a Deo, qui exterius interiusque conspicit. Psal.
                    LXXII, 26: <i>Deus cordis mei</i>. I Reg. XVI, 7:
                    <i>homo videt quae foris sunt, Deus autem intuetur cor</i>.
                    Dictum est autem de praeceptis quae pertinent ad dicta et
                    facta; nunc ergo dicendum est de cogitatis. Nam apud Deum
                    voluntas pro facto reputatur: unde <i>non concupisces</i>;
                    idest, non solum non auferas facto, sed nec etiam rem
                    proximi tui concupisces. Et hoc propter multa.

                    “You shall not covet your neighbor’s goods.” There is this
                    difference between the divine and the human laws that human
                    law judges only deeds and words, whereas the divine law
                    judges also thoughts. The reason is because human laws are
                    made by men who see things only exteriorly, but the divine
                    law is from God, who sees both external things and the very
                    interior of men. “You are the God of my heart” [Ps 72:26].
                    And again: “Man sees those things that appear, but the Lord
                    sees the heart” [1 Sam 16:7]. Therefore, having considered
                    those Commandments which concern words and deeds, we now
                    treat of the Commandments about thoughts. For with God the
                    intention is taken for the deed, and thus the words, “You
                    shall not covet,” mean to include not only the taking by
                    act, but also the intention to take. Therefore, it says:
                    “You shall not even covet your neighbor’s goods.” There are
                    a number of reasons for this.

                        Primo propter concupiscentiae infinitatem.
                        Concupiscentia enim quid infinitum est. Quilibet autem
                        sapiens debet intendere finem aliquem, immo nullus debet
                        ire per viam infinitam. Eccle. V, 9:
                        <i>avarus non implebitur pecunia</i>. Isai. V, 8:
                        <i
                          >vae qui coniungitis domum ad domum, et agrum agro
                          copulatis</i
                        >. Et quod concupiscentia nunquam satietur, ratio est,
                        quia cor hominis factum est ad recipiendum Deum. Unde
                        Augustinus, in I Confess.:
                        <i
                          >fecisti nos domine ad te, et inquietum est cor

                        >. Id ergo quod minus Deo est, ipsum implere non potest.
                        Psal. CII, 5:
                        <i>qui replet in bonis desiderium tuum</i>.
                      </td>
                      <td>
                        The first reason for the Commandment is that man’s
                        desire has no limits, because desire itself is
                        boundless. But he who is wise will aim at some
                        particular end, for no one should have aimless desires:
                        “A covetous man shall not be satisfied with money”
                        [Eccles 5:9]. But the desires of man are never
                        satisfied, because the heart of man is made for God.
                        Thus, says St. Augustine: “You hast made us for You, O
                        Lord, and our heart is restless until it rests in You” [
                        <i>Conf.</i> I]. Nothing, therefore, less than God can
                        satisfy the human heart: “He satisfies your desire with
                        good things” [Ps 102:5].

                            Secundo quia aufert quietem, quae multum est
                            delectabilis. Semper enim cupidi soliciti sunt
                            acquirere non habita, et habita custodire. Eccle. V,
                            11: <i>saturitas divitis non sinit eum dormire</i>.
                            Matth. VI, 21:
                            <i>ubi est thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cor tuum</i>.
                            Et ideo Christus, Luc. VIII, divitias spinis
                            assimilavit, ut dicit Gregorius.

                          <td>
                            The second reason is that covetousness destroys
                            peace of heart, which is indeed highly delightful.
                            The covetous man is ever solicitous to acquire what
                            he lacks, and to hold that which he has: “The
                            fullness of the rich will not suffer him to sleep”
                            [Eccles 5:11]. “For where your treasure is, there is
                            your heart also” [Mt 6:21]. It was for this, says
                            St. Gregory, that Christ compared riches to thorns
                            [Lk 8:14].

                                Tertio quia causat in divitiis inutilitatem.
                                Facit enim divitias esse non utiles nec sibi nec
                                aliis: non enim utuntur eis nisi conservando.
                                Eccli. XIV, 3:
                                <i
                                  >viro cupido et tenaci sine ratione est
                                  substantia</i

                                others, because he desires only to hold on to
                                them: “Riches are not fitting for a covetous man
                                and a niggard” [Sir 14:3].

                                    Quarto, quia tollit iustitiae aequitatem.
                                    Exod. XXIII, 8:
                                    <i
                                      >ne accipias munera, quae etiam excaecant

                                    >. Eccli. XXXI, 5:
                                    <i>qui autem diligit, non iustificabitur</i
                                    >.

                                    The fourth reason is that it destroys the
                                    equality of justice: “Neither shall you take
                                    bribes, which even blind the wise, and
                                    pervert the words of the just” [Ex 23:8].
                                    And again: “He who loves gold shall not be
                                    justified” [Sir 31:5].

                                        quia, secundum Augustinum, quanto magis
                                        habet quis de caritate, tanto minus de
                                        cupiditate; et e converso, Eccli. VII,
                                        20:
                                        <i

                                        The fifth reason is that it destroys the
                                        love of God and neighbor, for says St.
                                        Augustine: “The more one loves, the less
                                        one covets,” and also the more one
                                        covets, the less one loves. “Nor despise
                                        your dear brother for the sake of gold”
                                        [Sir 7:20]. And just as “No man can
                                        serve two masters,” so neither can he
                                        serve “God and mammon” [Mt 6:24].

                                              mergunt homines in interitum et
                                              perditionem: radix enim omnium

                                            Finally, covetousness produces all
                                            kinds of wickedness. It is “the root
                                            of all evil,” says St. Paul, and
                                            when this root is implanted in the
                                            heart it brings forth murder and
                                            theft and all kinds of evil. “They
                                            that will become rich, fall into
                                            temptation, and into the snare of
                                            the devil, and into many
                                            unprofitable and hurtful desires
                                            which drown men in destruction and
                                            perdition. For the desire of money
                                            is the root of all evil” [1 Tim
                                            6:9-10]. And note, furthermore, that
                                            covetousness is a mortal sin when
                                            one covets one’s neighbor’s goods
                                            without reason; and even if there be
                                            a reason, it is a venial sin.

                  praeceptum, <i>non concupisces domum proximi tui</i>, ponitur
                  aliud, per quod prohibetur carnis concupiscentia. <i>Non</i>,

                  St. John says in his first Epistle that “all that is in the
                  world is the concupiscence of the flesh, the concupiscence of
                  the eyes, and the pride of life” [1 Jn 2:16]. Now, all that is
                  desirable is included in these three, two of which are
                  forbidden by the precept: “You shall not covet your neighbor’s
                  house.” Here “house,” signifying height, refers to avarice,
                  for “glory and wealth shall be in his house” [Ps 111:3]. This
                  means that he who desires the house, desires honors and
                  riches. And thus after the precept forbidding desire for the
                  house of one’s neighbor comes the Commandment prohibiting
                  concupiscence of the flesh: “You shall not covet your
                  neighbor’s wife.”

                      Et est sciendum, quod post peccatum, propter corruptionem
                      nullus evadit concupiscentiam praeter Christum et virginem
                      gloriosam. Et quandocumque concupiscentia adest, adest vel
                      cum veniali, vel cum mortali, quando scilicet dominatur.
                      Apostolus, Rom. VI, 12:
                      <i>non regnet peccatum in vestro mortali corpore</i>; et
                      non dicit, non sit, quia, sicut ipse dicit
                      <i
                        >scio quod non habitat in me, idest in carne mea,

                      Because of the corruption which resulted from the Fall,
                      none has been free from concupiscence except Christ and
                      the glorious Virgin. And wherever there is concupiscence,
                      there is either venial or mortal sin, provided that it is
                      allowed to dominate the reason. Hence the precept is not,
                      let sin not be; for it is written: “I know that nothing
                      good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh” [Rm 7:18].

                          First of all, sin rules in the flesh when, by giving
                          consent to it, concupiscence reigns in the heart. And,
                          therefore, St. Paul adds “so as to obey the lusts
                          thereof” to the words: “Do not let sin reign in your
                          mortal body” [Rm 6:12]. Accordingly the Lord says:
                          “Whoever looks on a woman to lust after her, has
                          already committed adultery with her in his heart” [Mt
                          5:28]. For with God the intention is taken for the
                          act.

                              exprimendo. Matth. XII, 34:
                              <i>ex abundantia enim cordis os loquitur</i>.
                              Ephes. IV, 29:
                              <i>omnis sermo malus ex ore vestro non procedat</i
                              >. Et ideo non est sine peccato componere
                              cantiones vanas, etiam secundum philosophos; quia
                              et poetae fingentes carmina amatoria debebant
                              expelli ex civitatibus. Tertio quando egreditur in
                              opere, membris concupiscentiae serviendo. Rom. VI,
                              19:
                              <i

                              Secondly, sin rules in the flesh when the
                              concupiscence of our heart is expressed in words:
                              “Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
                              speaks” [Mt 12:34]. And again: “Let no evil speech
                              proceed from your mouth” [Eph 4:29]. Therefore,
                              one is not without sin who composes frivolous
                              songs. Even the philosophers so thought, and poets
                              who wrote amatory verses were sent into exile.
                              Lastly, sin rules in the flesh when at the behest
                              of desire the members are made to serve iniquity:
                              “As you have yielded your members to serve
                              uncleanness to greater and greater iniquity” [Rm
                              6:19]. These, therefore, are the progressive steps
                              of concupiscence.

                                      We must realize that the avoidance of
                                      concupiscence demands much labor, for it
                                      is based on something within us. It is as
                                      hard as trying to capture an enemy in
                                      one’s own household. However, this desire
                                      can be overcome in four ways.

                                          Firstly, by fleeing the external
                                          occasions such as, for instance, bad

                                          an occasion for this sin: “Do not gaze
                                          not upon a maiden lest her beauty be a
                                          stumbling-block to you... Do not look

                                          dressed up, and do not gaze upon
                                          another’s beauty. For many have
                                          perished by the beauty of a woman,
                                          whereby lust is enkindled as a fire”
                                          [Sir 9:5-9]. And again: “Can a man
                                          hide fire in his bosom, and his
                                          garments not burn?” [Prov 6:27]. And
                                          thus Lot was commanded to flee,

                                                  build the house, they labor in
                                                  vain who build it” [Ps 126:1].
                                                  And also: “I knew that I could
                                                  not otherwise be continent,
                                                  except God gave it” [Wis
                                                  8:21]. Again: “This kind is
                                                  not cast out save by prayer
                                                  and fasting” [Mt 17:20]. All
                                                  this is not unlike to a fight
                                                  between two persons, one of
                                                  whom you desire to win, the
                                                  other to lose. You must
                                                  sustain the one and withdraw
                                                  all support from the other. So
                                                  also between the spirit and
                                                  the flesh there is a continual
                                                  combat. Now, if you wish the
                                                  spirit to win, you must assist
                                                  it by prayer, and likewise you
                                                  must resist the flesh by such
                                                  means as fasting; for by
                                                  fasting the flesh is weakened.

                                                      wholesome occupations:
                                                      “Idleness hath taught much
                                                      evil” [Sir 23:29]. Again:
                                                      “This was the iniquity of
                                                      Sodom your sister, pride,
                                                      fullness of bread, and

                                                      idleness of her” [Ez
                                                      16:49]. St. Jerome says:
                                                      “Be always busy in doing
                                                      something good, so that
                                                      the devil may find you
                                                      ever occupied.” Now, study
                                                      of the Scriptures is the
                                                      best of all occupations,
                                                      as St. Jerome tells us:
                                                      “Love to study the
                                                      Scriptures and you will
