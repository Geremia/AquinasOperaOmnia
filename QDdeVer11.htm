        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod solus Deus doceat, et magister dici debeat.
          <td>It seems that only God teaches and should be called a teacher, for
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Matth., XXIII, 8: unus est magister vester; et praecedit: nolite vocari Rabbi: super quo Glossa: ne divinum honorem hominibus tribuatis, aut quod Dei est, vobis usurpetis. Ergo magistrum esse et docere, solius Dei esse videtur.
          <td>1. In St. Matthew (2 3:8) we read: “One is your master”; and just before that: “Be not you called Rabbi.” On this passage the Gloss comments: “Lest you give divine honor to men, or usurp for yourselves what belongs to God.” Therefore, it seems that only God is a teacher, or teaches.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si homo docet, nonnisi per aliqua signa: quia si etiam rebus ipsis aliqua docere videatur, ut puta si aliquo quaerente quid sit ambulare, aliquis ambulet, tamen hoc non sufficit ad docendum, nisi signum aliquod adiungatur, ut Augustinus probat in l. de magistro: eo quod in eadem re plura conveniunt, unde nescietur quantum ad quid de re illa demonstratio fiat; utrum quantum ad substantiam, vel quantum ad accidens aliquod eius. Sed per signa non potest deveniri in cognitionem rerum, quia rerum cognitio potior est quam signorum; cum signorum cognitio ad rerum cognitionem ordinetur sicut ad finem: effectus autem non est potior sua causa. Ergo nullus potest alii tradere cognitionem aliquarum rerum, et sic non potest eum docere.
          <td>2. If a man teaches, he does so only through certain signs. For, even if one seems to teach by means of things, as, when asked what walking is, he walks, this is not sufficient to teach the one who asks, unless some sign be added, as Augustine proves. He does this by showing that there are many factors involved in the same action; hence, one will not know to what factor the demonstration was due, whether to the substance of the action or to some accident of it. Furthermore, one cannot come to a knowledge of things through a sign, for the knowledge of things is more excellent than the knowledge of signs, since the knowledge of signs is directed to knowledge of things as a means to an end. But the effect is not more excellent than its cause. Therefore, no one can impart knowledge of anything to another, and so cannot teach him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si aliquarum rerum signa alicui proponantur per hominem; aut ille cui proponuntur, cognoscit res illas quarum sunt signa, aut non. Si quidem res illas cognoscit, de eis non docetur. Si vero non cognoscit, ignoratis autem rebus, nec signorum significationes cognosci possunt; quia enim nescit hanc rem quae est lapis, non potest scire quid hoc nomen lapis significet. Ignorata vero significatione signorum, per signa non potest aliquis aliquid addiscere. Si ergo homo nihil aliud faciat ad doctrinam quam signa proponere, videtur quod homo ab homine doceri non possit.
          <td>3. If signs of certain things are proposed to someone by a man, the one to whom they are proposed either knows the things which the signs represent or he does not. If he knows the things, he is not taught them. But if he does not know them, he cannot know the meanings of the signs, since he does not know the things. For a man who does not know what a stone is cannot know what the word <i>stone</i> means. But if he does not know the meaning of the terms, he cannot learn anything through the signs. Therefore, if a man does nothing else to teach than propose signs, it seems that one man cannot be taught by another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, docere nihil aliud est quam scientiam in alio aliquo modo causare. Sed scientiae subiectum est intellectus; signa autem sensibilia, quibus solummodo videtur homo posse docere, non perveniunt usque ad partem intellectivam, sed sistunt in potentia sensitiva. Ergo homo ab homine doceri non potest.
          <td>4. To teach is nothing else than to cause knowledge in another in some way. But our understanding is the subject of knowledge. Now, sensible signs, by which alone, it would seem, man can be taught, do not reach the intellective part, but affect the senses only. Therefore, man cannot be taught by a man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si scientia in uno causatur ab alio; aut scientia inerat addiscenti, aut non inerat. Si non inerat, et in homine ab alio causatur; ergo unus homo in alio scientiam creat; quod est impossibile. Si autem prius inerat; aut inerat in actu perfecto, et sic causari non potest, quia quod est, non fit; aut inerat secundum rationem seminalem: rationes autem seminales per nullam virtutem creatam in actum educi possunt, sed a Deo solo naturae inseruntur, ut Augustinus dicit super Genes. ad litteram. Ergo relinquitur quod unus homo nullo modo alium docere possit.
          <td>5. If the knowledge is caused by one person in another, the learner either had it already or he did not. If he did not have it already and it was caused in him by another, then one man creates knowledge in another, which is impossible. However, if he had it already, it was present either in complete actuality, and thus it cannot be caused, for what already exists does not come into being, or it was present seminally ( <i>secundum rationes seminales</i> ) <i>.</i> But such seminal principles cannot be actualized by any created power, but are implanted in nature by God alone, as Augustine says. So, it remains true that one man can in no way teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, scientia quoddam accidens est. Accidens autem non transmutat subiectum. Cum ergo doctrina nihil aliud esse videatur nisi transfusio scientiae de magistro in discipulum, ergo unus homo alium docere non potest.
          <td>6. Knowledge is an accident. But an accident does not change the subject in which it inheres. Therefore, since teaching seems to be nothing else but the transfer of knowledge from teacher to pupil, one cannot teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Rom., X, 17, super illud, fides ex auditu, dicit Glossa: licet Deus intus doceat, praeco tamen exterius annuntiat. Scientia autem interius in mente causatur, non autem exterius in sensu. Ergo homo a solo Deo docetur, non ab alio homine.
          <td>7. The Gloss, on Romans (10:17), “Faith then comes by hearing,” says: “Although God teaches man interiorly, the preacher proclaims it exteriorly.” But knowledge is caused interiorly in the mind, not exteriorly in the senses. Therefore, man is taught only by God, not by another man.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit in Lib. de magistro: solus Deus cathedram habet in caelis, qui veritatem docet in terris; alius homo sic se habet ad cathedram sicut agricola ad arborem. Agricola autem non est factor arboris, sed cultor. Ergo nec homo potest dici doctor scientiae, sed ad scientiam dispositor.
          <td>8. Augustine says: “God alone, who teaches truth on earth, holds the teacher’s chair in heaven, but to this chair another man has the relation which a farmer has to a tree.” But the farmer does not make the tree; he cultivates it. And by the same token no nian can bc said to teach knowledge, but only prepare the mind for it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si homo est verus doctor, oportet quod veritatem doceat. Sed quicumque docet veritatem, mentem illuminat, cum veritas sit lumen mentis. Ergo homo mentem illuminabit, si docet. Sed hoc est falsum, cum Deus sit qui omnem hominem venientem in hunc mundum illuminet Ioann. I, 9. Ergo homo non potest alium vere docere.
          <td>9. If man is a real teacher, he must teach the truth. But whoever teaches the truth enlightens the mind, for truth is the light of the mind. If, therefore, man does teach, he enlightens the mind. But this is false, for in the Gospel according to St. John (1:9) we see that it is God who “enlighteneth every man that comes into this world.” Therefore, one man cannot really teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si unus homo alium docet, oportet quod eum faciat de potentia scientem actu scientem. Ergo oportet quod eius scientia educatur de potentia in actum. Quod autem de potentia in actum educitur, necesse est quod mutetur. Ergo scientia vel sapientia mutabitur; quod est contra Augustinum, in Lib. LXXXIII quaestionum, qui dicit, quod sapientia accedens homini, non ipsa mutatur, sed hominem mutat.
          <td>10. If one man teaches another, he must make a potential knower into an actual knower. Therefore, his knowledge must be raised from potency to act. But what is raised from potency to actuality must be changed. Therefore, knowledge or wisdom will be changed. However, this is contrary to Augustine, who says: “In coming to a man, wisdom is not itself changed, but changes the man.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, scientia nihil aliud esse videtur quam descriptio rerum in anima, cum scientia esse dicatur assimilatio scientis ad scitum. Sed unus homo non potest in alterius anima describere rerum similitudines: sic enim interius operaretur in ipso; quod solius Dei est. Ergo unus homo alium docere non potest.
          <td>11. Knowledge is nothing else but the representation of things in the soul, since knowledge is called the assimilation of the knower to the thing known. But one man cannot imprint the likeness of things in the soul of another. For, thus, he would work interiorly in that man, which God alone can do. Therefore, one man cannot teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Boetius dicit in Lib. de consolatione, quod per doctrinam solummodo mens hominis excitatur ad sciendum. Sed ille qui excitat intellectum ad sciendum, non facit eum scire; sicut ille qui excitat aliquem ad videndum corporaliter, non facit eum videre. Ergo unus homo non facit alium scire; et ita non proprie potest dici quod eum doceat.
          <td>12. Boethius says that teaching does no more than stimulate the mind to know. But he who stimulates the understanding to know does not make it know, just as one who incites someone to see with the eyes of the body does not make him see. Therefore, one man does not make another know. And so it cannot properly be said that he teaches him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ad scientiam requiritur cognitionis certitudo; alias non est scientia, sed opinio vel credulitas, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de magistro. Sed unus homo non potest in altero certitudinem facere per signa sensibilia quae proponit: quod enim est in sensu, magis est obliquum eo quod est in intellectu; certitudo autem semper fit per aliquid magis rectum. Ergo unus homo alium docere non potest.
          <td>13. There is no scientific knowledge without certitude. Otherwise, it is not scientific knowledge but opinion or belief, as Augustine says. But one man cannot produce certitude in another by means of the sensible signs which he proposes. For that which is in the sense faculty is less direct than that which is in the understanding, while certainty is always effected by the more direct. Therefore, one man cannot teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ad scientiam non requiritur nisi lumen intelligibile et species. Sed neutrum potest in uno homine ab alio causari: quia oporteret quod homo aliquid crearet, cum huiusmodi formae simplices non videantur posse produci nisi per creationem. Ergo homo non potest in alio scientiam causare, et sic nec docere.
          <td>14. The intelligible light and a species are all that are needed for knowledge. But neither of these can be caused in one man by another. For it would be necessary for a man to create something, since it seems that simple forms like these can be produced only by creation. Therefore, one man cannot cause knowledge in another and, so, cannot teach.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil potest formare mentem hominis nisi solus Deus, ut Augustinus dicit. Scientia autem, quaedam forma mentis est. Ergo solus Deus scientiam in anima causat.
          <td>15. As Augustine says, nothing except God alone can give the mind of man its form. But knowledge is a form of the mind. Therefore, only God can cause knowledge in the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut culpa est in mente, ita et ignorantia. Sed solus Deus purgat mentem a culpa: Isa., XLIII, 25: ego sum (...) qui deleo iniquitates tuas propter me. Ergo solus Deus purgat mentem ab ignorantia; et ita solus docet.
          <td>16. just as guilt is in the mind, so is ignorance. But only God cleanses the mind of guilt, according to Isaiah (43:25): “I am he that blots out tliy iniquities for my own sake.” Therefore, God alone cleanses the mind of ignorance. And, so, only God teaches.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cum scientia sit certitudinalis cognitio, ab illo aliquis scientiam accipit per cuius locutionem certificatur. Non autem certificatur aliquis ex hoc quod audit hominem loquentem; alias oporteret quod quidquid alicui ab homine dicitur, pro certo ei constaret. Certificatur autem solum secundum quod interius audit veritatem loquentem, quam consulit etiam de his quae ab homine audit, ut certus fiat. Ergo homo non docet, sed veritas quae interius loquitur, quae est Deus.
          <td>17. Since science is certain knowledge, one receives science from him whose words give him certainty. However, hearing a man speak does not give anyone certainty. Otherwise, anything that one person says to another would of necessity be clearly certain. Now, one reaches certitude only when he hears the truth speaking within him. And to be certain, he takes counsel with this interior voice even about those things which he hears from men. Therefore, not man but the truth speaking within, which is God, teaches.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nullus per locutionem alterius addiscit illa quae ante locutionem etiam interrogatus respondisset. Sed discipulus, antequam ei magister loquatur, responderet interrogatus de his quae magister proponit: non enim doceretur ex locutione magistri, nisi ita se habere cognosceret sicut magister proponit. Ergo unus homo non docetur per locutionem alterius hominis.
          <td>18. No one learns through the words of another those things, which, if asked, he would have answered, even before the other spoke. But even before the teacher speaks, the pupil, upon being questioned, would answer about the matters which the teacher proposes. For he would be taught by the words of the teacher only in so far as he knew that matters were such as the teacher claimed. Therefore, one man is not taught by the words of another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra.
          <td><b>To the Contrary</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est quod dicitur II Timoth. I, 11: in quo positus sum ego praedicator (...) et magister gentium. Ergo homo potest et esse et dici magister.
          <td>11. In the second Epistle to Timothy (1:11) we read: “Wherein I am appointed a preacher... and teacher of the gentiles.” Therefore, man can be a teacher and can be called one.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, II Timoth., III, 14: tu vero permane in his, quae didicisti, et credita sunt tibi. Glossa: a me tamquam a vero doctore; et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>2. In the second Epistle to Timothy (3:14) it is said: “But continueyouin those things which thou has learned, and which have been committed to thee.” Of this the Gloss says: “From me as from a true teacher.” We conclude as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Matth. XXIII, 8 et 9, simul dicitur: unus est magister vester, et unus est pater vester. Sed hoc quod Deus est pater omnium, non excludit quin etiam homo vere possit dici pater. Ergo etiam per hoc non excluditur quin homo vere possit dici magister.
          <td>3. In one place in Matthew (23:8, 9) we find: “One is your Father” and “One is your master.” But the fact that God is our Father does not make it impossible ‘for man truly to be called father. Likewise, the fact that God is our teacher does not make it impossible for man truly to be called teacher.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Roman. X, 15, super illud: quam speciosi supra montes etc. dicit Glossa: isti sunt pedes qui illuminant Ecclesiam. Loquitur autem de apostolis. Cum ergo illuminare sit actus doctoris, videtur quod hominibus docere competat.
          <td>4. The Gloss on Romans (10:15), “How beautiful over the mountains... “ reads: “They are the feet who enlighten the Church.”“ Now, it is speaking about the Apostles. Since, then, to enlighten is the act of a teacher, it seems that men are competent to teach.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ut dicitur in IV Meteororum, unumquodque tunc est perfectum quando potest simile sibi generare. Sed scientia est quaedam cognitio perfecta. Ergo homo qui habet scientiam, potest alium docere.
          <td>5. As is said in the <i>Meteorology</i> , each thing is perfect when it can generate things like itself. But scientific knowledge is a kind of perfect knowledge. Therefore, a man who has scientific knowledge can teach another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus in libro contra Manich. dicit, quod sicut terra, quae ante peccatum fonte irrigabatur, post peccatum indiguit pluvia de nubibus descendente; ita mens humana, quae per terram significatur, fonte veritatis ante peccatum fecundabatur, post peccatum vero indiget doctrina aliorum, quasi pluvia descendente de nubibus. Ergo saltem post peccatum homo ab homine docetur.
          <td>6. Augustine says that just as the earth was watered by a fountain before the coming of sin, and after its coming needed rain froin the clouds above, so also the human mind, which is represented by the earth, was made fruitful by the fountain of truth before the coming of sin, but after its coming it needs the teaching of others as rain coming down from the clouds. Therefore, at least since sin came into the world, man is taught by man.

          <td>There is the same sort of difference of opinion on three issues: on the bringing of forms into existence, on the acquiring of virtues, and on the acquiring of scientific knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam enim dixerunt, formas omnes sensibiles esse ab agente extrinseco, quod est substantia vel forma separata, quam appellant datorem formarum vel intelligentiam agentem; et quod omnia inferiora agentia naturalia non sunt nisi sicut praeparantia materiam ad formae susceptionem. Similiter etiam Avicenna dicit in sua Metaphys., quod habitus honesti causa non est actio nostra; sed actio prohibet eius contrarium, et adaptat ad illum, ut accidat hic habitus a substantia perficiente animas hominum, quae est intelligentia agens, vel substantia ei consimilis.
          <td>For some have said that all sensible forms come from an external agent, a separated substance or form, which they call the giver of forms or agent intelligence, and that all that lower natural agents do is prepare the matter to receive the form. Similarly, Avicenna says that our activity is not the cause of a good habit, but only keeps out its opposite and prepares us for the habit so that it may come from the substance which perfects; the souls of men. This is the agent intelligence or some similar substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Similiter etiam ponunt, quod scientia in nobis non efficitur nisi ab agente separato; unde Avicenna ponit in VI de naturalibus, quod formae intelligibiles effluunt in mentem nostram ab intelligentia agente.
          <td>They also hold that knowledge is caused in us only by an agent free of matter. For this reason Avicenna holds”, that the intelligible forms flow into our mind from the agent intelligence.

          <td>Quidam vero e contrario opinati sunt; scilicet quod omnia ista rebus essent indita, nec ab exteriori causam haberent, sed solummodo quod per exteriorem actionem manifestantur. Posuerunt enim quidam, quod omnes formae naturales essent actu in materia latentes, et quod agens naturale nihil aliud facit quam extrahere eas de occulto in manifestum. Similiter etiam aliqui posuerunt, quod omnes virtutum habitus nobis sunt inditi a natura; sed per exercitium operum removentur impedimenta, quibus praedicti habitus quasi occultabantur; sicut per limationem aufertur rubigo, ut claritas ferri manifestetur. Similiter etiam aliqui dixerunt quod animae est omnium scientia concreata; et per huiusmodi doctrinam et huiusmodi scientiae exteriora adminicula nihil fit aliud nisi quod anima deducitur in recordationem vel considerationem eorum quae prius scivit; unde dicunt, quod addiscere nihil est aliud quam reminisci.
          <td>Some have held the opposite opinion, namely, that all three of those are embodied in things and have no external cause, but are only brought to light by external activity. For some have held that all natural forms are in act, lying hidden in matter, and that a natural agent does nothing but draw them from concealment out into the open. In like manner, some” hold that all the habits of the virtues are implanted in us by nature. And the practice of their actions removes the obstructions which, as it were, hid these habits, just as rust is removed by filing so that the brightness of the iron is brought to light. Similarly, some also have said that the knowledge of all things is con-created with the soul and that through teaching and the external helps of this type of knowledge all that happens is that the soul is prompted to recall or consider those things which it knew previously. Hence, they say that learning is nothing but remembering.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Utraque autem istarum opinionum est absque ratione. Prima enim opinio excludit causas propinquas, dum effectus omnes in inferioribus provenientes, solis causis primis attribuit; in quo derogatur ordini universi, qui ordine et connexione causarum contexitur: dum prima causa ex eminentia bonitatis suae rebus aliis confert non solum quod sint, sed et quod causae sint. Secunda etiam opinio in idem quasi inconveniens redit: cum enim removens prohibens non sit nisi movens per accidens, ut dicitur VIII Physic.; si inferiora agentia nihil aliud faciunt quam producere de occulto in manifestum, removendo impedimenta, quibus formae et habitus virtutum et scientiarum occultabantur: sequetur quod omnia inferiora agentia non agant nisi per accidens.
          <td>But both of these positions lack a reasonable basis. For the first opinion excludes proximate causes, attributing solely to first causes all effects which happen in lower natures. In this it derogates from the order of the universe, which is made up of the order and connection of causes, since the first cause, by the pre-eminence of its goodness, gives other beings not only their existence, but also their existence as causes. The second position, too, falls into practically the same difficulty. For, since a thing which removes an obstruction is a mover only accidentally, as is said in the <i>Physics</i> , if lower agents do nothing but bring things from concealment into the open,. taking away the obstructions which concealed the forms and habits of the virtues and the sciences, it follows that all lower agents act only accidentally.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo, secundum doctrinam Aristotelis, via media inter has duas tenenda est in omnibus praedictis. Formae enim naturales praeexistunt quidem in materia, non in actu, ut alii dicebant, sed in potentia solum, de qua in actum reducuntur per agens extrinsecum proximum, non solum per agens primum, ut alia opinio ponebat. Similiter etiam secundum ipsius sententiam in VI Ethicorum, virtutum habitus ante earum consummationem praeexistunt in nobis in quibusdam naturalibus inclinationibus, quae sunt quaedam virtutum inchoationes, sed postea per exercitium operum adducuntur in debitam consummationem. Similiter etiam dicendum est de scientiae acquisitione; quod praeexistunt in nobis quaedam scientiarum semina, scilicet primae conceptiones intellectus, quae statim lumine intellectus agentis cognoscuntur per species a sensibilibus abstractas, sive sint complexa, sicut dignitates, sive incomplexa, sicut ratio entis, et unius, et huiusmodi, quae statim intellectus apprehendit. In istis autem principiis universalibus omnia sequentia includuntur, sicut in quibusdam rationibus seminalibus. Quando ergo ex istis universalibus cognitionibus mens educitur ut actu cognoscat particularia, quae prius in universali et quasi in potentia cognoscebantur, tunc aliquis dicitur scientiam acquirere.
          <td>Therefore, in all that has been said we ought to hold a middle position between these two, according to the teaching of Aristotle. For natural forms pre-exist in matter not actually, as some have said, but only in potency. They are brought to actuality from this state of potency through a proximate external agent, and not through the first agent alone, as one of the opinions maintains. Similarly, according to this opinion of Aristotle, before the habits of virtue are completely formed, they exist in us in certain natural inclinations, which are the beginnings of the virtues. But afterwards, through practice in their actions, they are brought to their proper completion. We must give a similar explanation of the acquisition of knowledge. For certain seeds of knowledge pre-exist in us, namely, the first concepts of understanding, which by the light of the agent intellect are immediately known through the species abstracted from sensible things. These are either complex, as axioms, or simple, as the notions of being, of the one, and so on, which the understanding grasps immediately. In these general principles, however, all the consequences are included as in certain seminal principles. When, therefore, the mind is led from these general notions to actual knowledge of the particular things, which it knew previously in general and, as it were, potentially, then one is said to acquire knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sciendum tamen est, quod in rebus naturalibus aliquid praeexistit in potentia dupliciter. Uno modo in potentia activa completa; quando, scilicet, principium intrinsecum sufficienter potest perducere in actum perfectum, sicut patet in sanatione: ex virtute enim naturali quae est in aegro, aeger ad sanitatem perducitur. Alio modo in potentia passiva; quando, scilicet, principium intrinsecum non sufficit ad educendum in actum, sicut patet quando ex aere fit ignis; hoc enim non poterat fieri per aliquam virtutem in aere existentem.
          <td>We must bear in mind, nevertheless, that in natural things something can pre-exist in potency in two ways. In one, it is in an active and completed potency, as when an intrinsic principle has sufficient power to flow into perfect act. Healing is an obvious example of this, for the sick person is restored to health by the natural power within him. The other appears in a passive potency, as happens when the internal principle does not have sufficient power to bring it into act. This is clear when air becomes fire, for this cannot result from any power existing in the air.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quando igitur praeexistit aliquid in potentia activa completa, tunc agens extrinsecum non agit nisi adiuvando agens intrinsecum, et ministrando ei ea quibus possit in actum exire; sicut medicus in sanatione est minister naturae, quae principaliter operatur, confortando naturam, et apponendo medicinas, quibus velut instrumentis natura utitur ad sanationem. Quando vero aliquid praeexistit in potentia passiva tantum, tunc agens extrinsecum est quod educit principaliter de potentia in actum; sicut ignis facit de aere, qui est potentia ignis, actu ignem.
          <td>Therefore, when something pre-exists in active completed potency, the external agent acts only by helping the internal agent and providing it with the means by which it can enter into act. Thus, in healing the doctor assists nature, which is the principal agent, by strengthen ing nature and prescribing medicines, which nature uses as instruments for healing. On the other hand, when something pre-exists only in passive potency, then it is the external agent which is the principal cause of the transition from potency to act. Thus, fire makes actual fire of air, which is potentially fire.

          <td>Scientia ergo praeexistit in addiscente in potentia non pure passiva, sed activa; alias homo non posset per seipsum acquirere scientiam.

          <td>Knowledge, therefore, pre-exists in the learner potentially, not, however, in the purely passive, but in the active, sense. Otherwise, man would not be able to acquire knowledge independently. Therefore, as there are two ways of being cured, that is, either through the activity of unaided nature or by nature with the aid of medicine, so also there are two ways of acquiring knowledge. In one way, natural reason by itself reaches knowledge of unknown things, and this way is called <i>discovery;</i> in the other way, when someone else aids the learner’s natural reason, and this is called <i>learning by instruction.</i>

          <td>In effects which are produced by nature and by art, art operates in the same way and through the same means as nature. For, as nature heals one who is suffering from cold by warming him, so also does the doctor. Hence, art is said to imitate nature. A similar thing takes place in acquiring knowledge. For the teacher leads the pupil to knowledge of things he does not know in the same way that one directs himself through the process of discovering something he does not know.

Et secundum hoc dicit philosophus, I posteriorum, quod demonstratio est syllogismus faciens scire.
          <td>Now, in discovery, the procedure of anyone who arrives at the knowledge of something unknown is to apply general self-evident principles to certain definite matters, from these to proceed to particular conclusions, and from these to others. Consequently, one person is said to teach another inasmuch as, by signs, he manifests to that other the reasoning process which he himself goes through by his own natural reason. And thus, through the instrumentality, as it were, of what is told him, the natural reason of the pupil arrives at a knowledge of the things which he did not know. Therefore, just as the doctor is said to heal a patient through the activity of nature, so a man is said to cause knowledge in another through the activity of the learner’s own natural reason, and this is teaching. So, one is said to teach another and be his teacher. This is what the Philosopher means when he says: “Demonstration is a syllogism which makes someone know.”

Ex ipsis enim principiis per se notis considerat, quod ea quae ex eis necessario consequuntur, sunt certitudinaliter tenenda; quae vero eis sunt contraria, totaliter respuenda; aliis autem assensum praebere potest, vel non praebere.

Unde, cum omnis doctrina humana efficaciam habere non possit nisi ex virtute illius luminis; constat quod solus Deus est qui interius et principaliter docet, sicut natura interius et principaliter sanat; nihilominus homo et sanare et docere proprie dicitur modo praedicto.
          <td>But, if someone proposes to another things which are not included in self-evident principles, or does not make it clear that they are included, he will not cause knowledge in the other but, perhaps, opinion or faith, although even this is in some way caused by inborn first principles, for from these self-evident principles he realizes that what necessarily follows from them is to be held with certitude, and that what is contrary to them is to be rejected completely, and that assent may be given to or withheld from whatever neither follows necessarily from nor is contrary to self-evident principles. Now, the light of reason by which such principles are evident to us is implanted in us by God as a kind of reflected likeness in us of the uncreated truth. So, since all human teaching can be effective only in virtue of that light, it is obvious that God alone teaches interiorly and principally, just as nature alone heals interiorly and principally. Nevertheless, both to heal and to teach can still be used in a proper sense in the way we have explained.

          <td>1. Since our Lord had ordered the disciples not to be called teachers, the Gloss explains how this prohibition is to be understood, lest it be taken absolutely. For we are forbidden to call man a teacher in this sense, that we attribute to him the pre-eminence of teaching, which belongs to God. It would be as if we put our hope in the wisdom of men, and did not rather consult divine truth about those things which we hear from man. And this divine truth speaks in us through the impression of its likeness, by means of which we can judge of all things.

The latter are proposed to us through signs and are applied to other things which were heretofore unknown to us simply, although they were known to us in some respect, as has been said. For knowledge of principles produces in us knowledge of conclusions; knowledge of signs does not.

Thus, if we are taught what man is, we must know something about him beforehand, namely, the meaning of animal, or of substance, or at least of being itself, which last concept cannot escape us. Similarly, if we are taught a certain conclusion, we must know beforehand what the subject and predicate are. We must also have previous knowledge of the principles through which the conclusion is taught, for “all teaching comes from pre-existing knowledge,” as is said in the Posterior Analytics. Hence, the argument does not follow.

Uncreated wisdom, however, cannot be changed in any way, whereas in us created wisdom can be changed for some extrinsic reason, though not by reason of anything intrinsic to it. We can consider this capacity for change in two ways. In one way, according to the relation which it has to eternal things, and in this way it is entirely unchangeable. In the other, according to the existence which it has in the subject, it is changed for some extrinsic reason when the subject which has wisdom in potency is changed into a subject having it in act. For the intelligible forms in which wisdom consists are both likenesses of things and forms perfecting the understanding.

          <td>11. In the pupil, the intelligible forms of which knowledge received through teaching is constituted are caused directly by the agent intellect and mediately by the one who teaches. For the teacher sets before the pupil signs of intelligible things, and from these the agent intellect derives the intelligible likenesses and causes them to exist in the possible intellect. Hence, the words of the teacher, heard or seen in writing, have the same efficacy in causing knowledge as things which are outside the soul. For from both the agent intellect receives intelligible likenesses, although the words of the teacher are more proximately disposed to cause knowledge than things outside the soul, in so far as they are signs of intelligible forms.

Visus enim corporalis non est vis collativa, ut ex quibusdam suorum obiectorum in alia perveniat; sed omnia sua obiecta sunt ei visibilia, quam cito ad illa convertitur: unde habens potentiam visivam se habet hoc modo ad omnia visibilia intuenda, sicut habens habitum ad ea quae habitualiter scit consideranda; et ideo videns non indiget ab alio excitari ad videndum, nisi quatenus per alium eius visus dirigitur in aliquod visibile, ut digito, vel aliquo huiusmodi.<br>

Doctor ergo excitat intellectum ad sciendum illa quae docet, sicut motor essentialis educens de potentia in actum; sed ostendens rem aliquam visui corporali, excitat eum sicut motor per accidens; prout etiam habens habitum scientiae potest excitari ad considerandum de aliquo.
          <td>12. Intellectual and bodily sight are not alike, for bodily sight is not a power which compares, so that among its objects it can proceed from one to another. Rather, all the objects of this sight can be seen as soon as it turns to them. Consequently, anyone who has the power of sight can look at all visible things, just as one who has a habit of knowledge can turn his attention to the things which he knows habitually. Therefore, the seeing subject needs no stimulus from another to see something, unless, perhaps, someone else directs the subject’s attention to some object by pointing it out or doing something of the sort.<br>
          But, since the intellective power can compare, it proceeds from some things to others. As a result, it does not have the same relation to all intelligible objects of consideration. Rather, the mind sees certain things immediately, those which are self-evident, in which are contained certain other things which it can understand only by using reason to unfold those things which are implicitly contained in principles. Thus, before the mind has the habit, it is not only in accidental potency to know these things, but also essential potency. For the mind needs a mover to actualize it through teaching, as is said in the <i>Physics</i> . But a man who already knew something habitually would not need this. Therefore, the teacher furnishes the pupil’s intellect with a stimulus to knowledge of the things which he teaches, as an indispensable mover, bringing the intellect from potentiality to actuality. But one who shows some thing to bodily sight prompts it to action as a nonessential mover. And one who has the habit of knowledge can in this way receive a stimulus from someone to consider something.

Therefore, the agent intellect is more the teacher than another man.

Quaedam vero agentia sunt in quibus eorum quae aguntur non praeexistit nisi pars; sicut motus causat sanitatem, aut aliqua medicina calida, in qua calor invenitur vel actualiter vel virtualiter; calor autem non est tota sanitas, sed est pars sanitatis. In primis igitur agentibus est perfecta ratio actionis; non autem in agentibus secundi modi, quia secundum hoc aliquid agit quod actu est; unde, cum non sit in actu effectus inducendi nisi in parte, non erit perfecte agens.

Now, there is one type of agent which has within itself everything which it produces in the effect, and it has these perfections in the same way as the effect, as happens in univocal agents, or in a higher way than the effect, as in equivocal causes. Then, there is a certain type of agent in which there pre-exists only a part of the effect. An example of this type is a movement which causes health, or some warm medicine, in which warmth exists either actually or virtually. But warmth is not complete health, but a part of it. The first type of agent, therefore, possesses the complete nature of action. But those of the second type do not, for a thing acts in so far as it is in act. Hence, since it actually contains the effect to be produced only partially, it is not an agent in the perfect sense.

Hence, the teacher or master must have the knowledge which he causes in another explicitly and perfectly, as it is to be received in the one who is learning through instruction. When, however, knowledge is acquired by someone through an internal principle, that which is the active cause of the knowledge has the knowledge to be acquired only partially, that is, in the seminal principles of knowledge, which are the general principles.

          <td>4. For the one learning a science, to learn it by discovery is the more perfect way of acquiring the knowledge, because it shows that he is more skillful in the acquisition of knowledge. However, for the one causing the knowledge, it is more perfect to cause it by means of instruction. For a teacher who knows the whole science explicitly can teach it to a pupil more readily than the pupil himself could learn it from his own rather general knowledge of the principles of the science.

However, it is impossible for one actually to have knowledge and not to have it, in such a way that he could teach himself.

Nor can he teach from without, as it seems, for to teach from without is to teach by means of some sensible signs, as Augustine also says. But angels do not teach us through sensible signs of this sort, unless, perhaps, they appear in a sensible form. Therefore, they do not teach us unless they so appear, an occurrence which is outside the ordinary course of nature, through a miracle, as it were.

Ergo nec etiam imprimendo in imaginationem Angelus docere nos potest, cum, mediante imaginatione, non possimus doceri nisi actu aliquid imaginando.
          <td>2. It was said that angels teach us from without in some manner, inasmuch as they make an impression on our imagination.—On the contrary, a species impressed on the imagination does not suffice for actually imagining unless an intention is present, as is clear from what Augustine says. But an angel cannot bring about an intention in us, since intention is an act of will, on which only God can make an impression. Therefore, an angel cannot teach us even by making an impression on our imagination, since we cannot be taught by means of our imagination unless we actually imagine something.

          <td>3. If we are taught by angels who do not appear to us in sensible form, this can happen only if they enlighten our understanding, which, it seems, they cannot do. For they do not give it the natural light, which, since it is concreated along with the mind, is from God alone, nor the light of grace, which only God infuses. Therefore, angels cannot teach us unless they appear in visible form.

          <td>4. Whenever anyone is taught by another, the learner must examine the concepts of the teacher, so that in this way the pupil’s mind may reach science through the same reasoning process which the teacher’s mind uses. But a man cannot see the concepts of an angel. For he does not see them in themselves, just as he does not see the concepts of another man. In fact, he sees them much less since they are more unlike his own. Nor, again, does he see them in sensible signs, unless perhaps when the angels appear in sensible form, a possibility which we are not now considering. Therefore, angels are unable to teach us in any other way [that is, except by appearance in sensible form].

          <td>7. An unfailing illumination can come only from an unfailing source of light, since the subject ceases to be illuminated when the light leaves. But an unfailing illumination is needed in teaching, for scientific knowledge concerns necessary things, which always exist. Therefore, teaching comes only from an unfailing light.

In John (1:3 8), when Jesus asked: “What seek you?” the two disciples of John answered: “Rabbi, (which is to say, being interpreted, Master,) where dwellest thou?” On this the Gloss reads: “They showed their faith by this name.”Another gloss reads that He asked them not because He did not know, but that they might gain merit by their reply. And when He asked what they sought, they told Him a person, not a thing. From all this we gather that in that answer they confessed that He was a person and showed their faith by this confession. In doing, this they gained merit. But the Christian faith is worthy of merit because we acknowledge that Christ is a divine Person. Therefore, to be a teacher pertains only to a divine person.

          <td>10. Augustine says: “Our mind is formed immediately by God without the interposition of any creature.” But an angel is a creature and, so, in the formation of the human mind does not stand between God and the human mind, as something higher than the mind and lower than God.

          <td>12. All knowledge takes place through some species. Therefore, if an angel is to teach a man, he has to cause in him some species through which the man will know. But he can do this only by creating the species (and an angel has no power at all to do this, as Damascene intends), or by illuminating the species which are in the phantasms, so that intelligible species may result from these in the human possible intellect. This latter seems to be a return to the error of those philosophers who make a separated substance of the agent intellect, whose task it is to illuminate the phantasms. Thus, an angel cannot teach.

Ergo nec intellectus humanus est capax eorum quae sunt in mente angelica; et sic homo per Angelum doceri non potest.
          <td>13. The intellect of an angel differs more from man’s intellect than the human intellect differs from the human imagination. But the imagination cannot receive that which is in the human intellect. For the imagination can receive only particular forms, such as the intellect does not contain. Therefore, the human intellect, also, is unable to receive those forms which are in the angelic mind. And thus, man cannot be taught through an angel.

          <td>15. Everything which is known is known either through its essence or through some likeness. But an angel cannot cause the knowledge through which the human mind knows things through their essence. For thus, the virtues and other things which are contained in the soul would have to be imprinted by angels, since such things are known through their essence. Similarly, angels cannot cause the knowledge of those things which are known through their likenesses, since the things to be known are closer to these likenesses which are in the knower than an angel is. Therefore, an angel can in no way cause knowledge in a man, and this is to teach.

          <td>16. As Augustine clearly shows a farmer is not called a creator even though he stimulates nature from without to produce natural effects. For equal reason, angels ought not be called teachers or masters, although they stimulate the understanding of man to acquire knowledge.

Ergo Angeli docere non possunt homines.
          <td>17. Since an angel is superior to man, if he teaches, his instruction must be better than human instruction. But this cannot be, for man can teach about those things which have determinate causes in nature. But angels cannot teach him about other things, such as future contingents, for the natural knowledge of the angels themselves does not extend to these things, since God alone knows such future events. Therefore, angels cannot teach men.

          <td>2. A higher agent can do what a lower agent can, and much more nobly, as is clear from Dionysius. But the human order is lower than the angelic order. Therefore, since one man can teach another, an angel can do this with much greater reason.

          <td>3. The order of divine wisdom exists more perfectly in spiritual substances than in bodily substances. But it is part of the order of lower bodies that they receive their perfections as the result of the influence of higher bodies. Therefore, lower spirits also, namely, human spirits, receive their perfection from the influence of higher spirits, that is to say, angels.

          <td>4. Everything which is in potentiality can be developed to actuality through that which is in actuality; and that which is less in actuality can be developed through that which is more completely in actuality. But the angelic intellect is more in actuality than the human intellect. Therefore, the human intellect can be developed to the actuality of knowledge through the angelic intellect.

          <td>An angel influences a man in two ways. In one way the action follows our way of acting, when, for instance, an angel appears to man in a sensible form, either taking on a body or in some other way, and instructs the man by means of sensible speech. We are not now investigating angelic teaching of this sort, for in this way an angel teaches no differently than a man does. The other way in which an angel influences us is the angelic way of acting, that is, invisibly. The purpose of this investigation is to find out how man can be taught in this way by an angel.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>We must bear in mind that, since an angel is between God and man, due order requires that he should have an intermediate mode of teaching, lower than God’s but higher than man’s. We can see in what sense this is true only if we see how God teaches and how man teaches.

          <td>Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod inter intellectum et corporalem visum haec est differentia: quod visui corporali omnia sua obiecta aequaliter sunt propinqua ad cognoscendum; sensus enim non est vis collativa, ut ex uno obiectorum suorum necesse habeat pervenire in aliud. Sed intellectui non omnia intelligibilia aequaliter vicina sunt ad cognoscendum; sed quaedam statim conspicere potest, quaedam vero non conspicit nisi ex aliis prius inspectis. Sic igitur homo ignotorum cognitionem per duo accipit; scilicet per lumen intellectuale, et per primas conceptiones per se notas, quae comparantur ad istud lumen, quod est intellectus agentis, sicut instrumenta ad artificem.
          <td>To show this we must bear in mind that there is this difference between understanding and bodily sight, namely, that, for the purposes of knowing, all the objects of bodily sight are equally near to it. For a sense is not a power which compares, so that it has to reach one of its objects by means of another. But, for the purposes of knowing, all intelligible things are not equally near to the intellect. Rather, some can be seen immediately, and some can be seen only by examining other principles. Therefore, man gains knowledge of things he does not know through two things: intellectual light and self-evident primary concepts. The latter have the same relation to the intellectual light of the agent intellect as tools to the craftsman.

          <td>Now, God in a most excellent way causes man’s knowledge in both of these ways. For He adorned the soul itself with intellectual light and imprinted on it the concepts of the first principles, which are, as it were, the sciences in embryo, just as He impressed on other physical things the seminal principles for producing all their effects.

          <td>But, since in the order of nature each man shares equally in the specific nature of intellectual light, he cannot in any way be the cause of knowledge in another by causing or increasing that light in him. But he does in a sense cause knowledge in another man as regards the new knowledge which is caused by self-evident principles. He does this, not as one who gives knowledge of the principles, but as one who shows certain sensible signs to the external senses, and thus brings into actuality that which was contained in the principles implicitly and in a certain sense in potentiality, as was said above.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Angelus vero, quia naturaliter habet lumen intellectuale perfectius quam homo, ex utraque parte potest homini esse causa sciendi; tamen inferiori modo quam Deus, et superiori quam homo. Ex parte enim luminis, quamvis non possit intellectuale lumen infundere, ut Deus facit, potest tamen lumen infusum confortare ad perfectius inspiciendum. Omne enim quod est in aliquo genere imperfectum, quando continuatur perfectiori in genere illo, magis confortatur virtus eius; sicut etiam videmus in corporibus, quod corpus locatum confortatur per corpus locans, quod comparatur ad ipsum ut actus ad potentiam, ut habetur IV Physic.
          <td>But, since by nature an angel has intellectual light more perfectly than man, he can cause man to know in both ways, in a manner lower than God, but higher than man. For, as regards the light, although he cannot infuse the intellectual light, as God does, he can strengthen the infused light to make man see more perfectly. For that which is imperfect in a given genus has its power intensified when it is brought in contact with that which is more perfect in that genus. Thus, in bodies, we see that the body which is given position is strengthened by the body giving it position, which is related to it as actuality to potentiality, as is said in the <i>Physics</i> .

Et hoc modo, commixtione alterius spiritus fieri potest ut ea quae ipse Angelus scit, per imagines huiusmodi, ei cui immiscetur, ostendat, ut Augustinus dicit XII super Genes. ad litteram.
          <td>As regards principles, too, an angel can teach a man, not, it is true, by giving him knowledge of the principles, as God does, nor by proposing to him under sensible signs the manner in which the conclusions are deduced from the principles, as man does, but by forming in his imagination certain species which can be formed by stimulating the corporeal organ. This is clearly what happens with persons sleeping and with the insane, who experience different phantasms according to the diversity of vapors which rise to the head. And in this way, by means of contact with another spirit, it is possible for an angel to use images of this sort to show what he himself knows to the person with whom he has come in contact, as Augustine says.

          <td>1. An angel who teaches invisibly teaches interiorly, it is true, in comparison with the instruction of a man who proposes his instruction to the external senses. But in comparison with the teaching of God, who works within the mind by infusing light, the teaching of an angel is classed as external.

          <td>2. Although an intention of the will cannot be forced, still an intention of the sensitive part can be forced. For just as, when someone is pricked, he has to pay attention ( <i>intendere</i> ) to the hurt, so, too, with all the other sensitive powers which use a bodily organ. And this attention ( <i>intentio</i> ) is enough for the imagination.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod sicut in naturalibus est agens univocum, quod eodem modo imprimit formam sicut eam habet, et agens aequivocum, quod alio modo habet quam imprimat; ita etiam est et de doctrina, quia homo docet hominem quasi univocum agens: unde per illum modum scientiam alteri tradit quo ipse eam habet, scilicet deducendo causas in causata. Unde oportet quod ipsi conceptus docentis patefiant per aliqua signa discenti. Sed Angelus docet quasi agens aequivocum: ipse enim intellectualiter cognoscit quod homini per viam rationis manifestatur. Unde non hoc modo ab Angelo docetur quod Angeli conceptus homini patefiant; sed quia in homine scientia causatur, secundum suum modum, earum rerum quas Angelus longe alio modo cognoscit.
          <td>4. As in physical things there is an univocal agent, which imprints a form in the same way it has it, and an equivocal agent, which has it in a way different from that in which it imprints it, so also in teaching. For one man teaches another as a kind of univocal agent, and thus communicates knowledge to the other in the same way that he himself has it, by proceeding from causes to the effects. It is for this reason that the concepts of the teacher must be conveyed to the learner through some signs. But an angel teaches as a kind of equivocal cause, for he knows intuitively that which man learns through a process of reasoning. Hence, an angel does not teach a man in such a way that the concepts of the angel are disclosed to the man, but the result is rather this, that the man is made to know in his own way those things which the angel knows in a far different way.

          <td>7. Although the knowledge which we get through teaching may be concerned with things that do not cease to be, the knowledge itself can cease to be. Hence, it is not necessary for the illumination of teaching to come from an unfailing light. Or, if it is from an unfailing light as its first principle, this does not entirely exclude a created light capable of failing, from being able to exist as a mediate principle.

Hence, a gloss a little further on says: “Since Nathanael knew that Christ, though absent, saw what he had done in another place, which is a sign of the Godhead, he acknowledged that Christ was not only a teacher, but also the Son of God.

          <td>10. It is not Augustine’s intention to say that the nature of the angelic mind is not more excellent than that of the human mind, but that angels are not between God and the human mind in such a way that the human mind receives the ultimate form of its perfection by being united to an angel, as some have held. They say that the final beatitude of man consists in this, that our understanding is united to an intelligence whose beatitude is union with God Himself.

Intellectus vero non cogitur ex subiecto, cum non utatur organo corporali; sed cogitur ex obiecto, quia ex efficacia demonstrationis cogitur quis conclusioni consentire. Affectus vero neque ex subiecto neque ex obiecto cogitur, sed proprio instinctu movetur in hoc vel illud: unde in affectum non potest imprimere nisi Deus, qui interius operatur. Sed in intellectum potest imprimere, quodammodo, etiam homo vel Angelus, repraesentando obiecta quibus intellectus cogatur.
          <td>11. There are in us some powers which are constrained by their subject and object, as the sensitive powers, which are stimulated both by excitation of the organ and by the strength of their object. But our understanding is not constrained by its subject, since it does not use a bodily organ. Rather, it is constrained by its object, because the effectiveness of a demonstration forces one to assent to a conclusion. However, the affections are constrained neither by their subject nor their object, but move toward one thing or another by reason of their own inclination. Hence, only God, who acts interiorly, can make an impression on the affections. But a man or an angel can, to a certain extent, make an impression on our understanding by representing to the mind the objects by which our understanding is constrained.

          <td>12. An angel does not create the species in our mind nor directly illuminate the phantasms. But our understanding can more effectively enlighten phantasms when an angelic light is united to the light of our understanding. Even if an angel did immediately illuminate the phantasms, it still would not follow from this that the opinion of those philosophers would be true. For, although it is the task of the agent intellect to illuminate the phantasms, it could still be said that this is not a function which belongs to it alone.

Similarly, the human understanding in its own manner can receive those things which are in the angelic understanding. But, although the human understanding is more like the imagination by reason of their common subject in so far as both are powers of the one soul, it is more like the angelic intellect by reason of their common genus, for both are immaterial powers.

          <td>15. An angel is not the cause of man's knowledge in so far as a man knows things through their essence, but in so far as he knows things through their likenesses. This does not mean that an angel is closer to things than their likenesses are, but that he makes the likenesses of things appear in the mind either by moving the imagination or strengthening the light of understanding.

          <td>Vita enim activa cum corpore deficit, ut Gregorius dicit super Ezech. Sed docere non deficit cum corpore, quia etiam Angeli, qui corpore carent, docent ut dictum est. Ergo videtur quod docere ad vitam contemplativam pertineat.
          <td>1. “There is no active life where there is no body,” as Gregory says. But there is teaching where there is no body, for even angels, who have no bodies, teach, as has been said. Therefore, it seems that teaching pertains to the contemplative life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut dicit Gregorius super Ezech., ante activa vita agitur ut ad contemplativam postea veniatur. Sed doctrina sequitur contemplationem non praecedit. Ergo docere non pertinet ad vitam activam.
          <td>2. Gregory says: “One engages in the active life in order to arrive at the contemplative later.” But teaching does not precede contemplation, but follows it. Therefore, teaching does not pertain to the active life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ut Gregorius dicit ibidem, activa vita dum occupatur in opere, minus videt. Sed ille qui docet, necesse habet magis videre quam ille qui simpliciter contemplatur. Ergo docere magis est contemplativae quam activae.
          <td>3. Gregory also says that the active life “sees less while it is engaged in work.” But one who teaches must of necessity see more than one who simply contemplates. Therefore, teaching pertains more to the contemplative than to the active life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unumquodque per idem est in se perfectum et aliis similem perfectionem tradens, sicut per eumdem calorem ignis est calidus et calefaciens. Sed aliquem esse perfectum in consideratione divinorum in seipso, pertinet ad vitam contemplativam. Ergo et doctrina, quae est eiusdem perfectionis transfusio in alium, ad vitam contemplativam pertinet.
          <td>4. It is the same perfection which makes each thing perfect in itself and enables it to give others a perfection like its own. Thus it is by reason of one and the same warmth that fire itself is warm and gives warmth to other things. But one's own perfection in meditation on things of God belongs to the contemplative life. Therefore, teaching, which is the communication of this same perfection to another, belongs to the contemplative life.

          <td>Praeterea, vita activa circa temporalia versatur. Sed doctrina praecipue versatur circa aeterna illorum enim excellentior est doctrina et perfectior. Ergo doctrina non pertinet ad vitam activam, sed contemplativam.
          <td>5. The active life is occupied with temporal things. But teaching is occupied mainly with things eternal, for the teaching of these latter is more excellent and more perfect. Therefore, teaching does not pertain to the active, but to the contemplative life.

          <td>Dicendum, quod contemplativa et activa vita ad invicem fine et materia distinguuntur. Materia namque activae vitae sunt temporalia, circa quae humanus actus versatur; materia autem contemplativae sunt rerum scibiles rationes, quibus contemplator insistit. Et haec materiae diversitas provenit ex diversitate finis: sicut et in omnibus aliis materia secundum finis exigentiam determinatur.
          <td>The contemplative and the active life are distinguished from each other by their subject matter and that to which they are ordained. For the subject matter of the active life is temporal affairs, with which human acts are concerned. But the intelligible natures of things, on which the one contemplating meditates, are the subject matter of the contemplative life. This diversity of subject matter arises from a diversity of the end to be attained, just as in all other things the requirements of the end to be attained prescribe certain conditions in the subject matter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Finis enim contemplativae vitae est inspectio veritatis, prout nunc de vita contemplativa agimus; veritatis, dico, increatae secundum modum possibilem contemplanti: quae quidem in hac vita imperfecte inspicitur, in futura autem videbitur perfecte. Unde et Gregorius dicit, quod contemplativa vita hic incipitur, ut in caelesti patria perficiatur. Sed activae finis est operatio, qua proximorum utilitati intenditur.
          <td>For the end toward which the contemplative life, as we are now examining it, is ordained is the consideration of truth, of that truth, I say, which is uncreated, considered in the manner possible to the one contemplating it. We see this truth imperfectly in this life, but perfectly in the life to come. Hence, Gregory says that the contemplative life begins here in order to be made perfect in the life to come. But the end toward which the active life is directed is the activity which is directed to the help of our neighbor.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>In actu autem docendi invenimus duplicem materiam, in cuius signum etiam actus docendi duplici accusativo coniungitur. Est, siquidem, una eius materia res ipsa quae docetur, alia vero cui scientia traditur. Ratione igitur primae materiae, actus doctrinae ad vitam contemplativam pertinet, sed ratione secundae pertinet ad vitam activam. Sed ex parte finis doctrina solummodo ad vitam activam pertinere invenitur, quia ultima materia eius, in qua finem intentum consequitur, est activae vitae materia. Unde magis ad activam vitam pertinet quam ad contemplativam, quamvis etiam aliquo modo ad contemplativam pertineat, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>Moreover, in the act of teaching we find a twofold subject matter, and as an indication of this, two accusatives are used as objects of the verb which expresses the act of teaching. This is so because the subject which one teaches is one kind of subject matter of teaching, and the one to whom the knowledge is communicated is another type of subject of teaching. Accordingly, by reason of the former, teaching pertains to the contemplative life, but by reason of the latter it is part of the active life. But, if we consider the end toward which it is directed, teaching seems to be a part only of the active life, because its last subject matter, in which it reaches the end proposed to it, is a subject with which the active life is concerned. Therefore, although it is in some sense a function of the contemplative life, as is clear from what has been said, it is, more properly a work of the active than of the contemplative life.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod vita activa secundum hoc cum corpore deficit, quod cum labore exercetur, et subvenit infirmitatibus proximorum; secundum quod Gregorius ibidem dicit, quod activa vita laboriosa est, quia desudat in opere; quae duo in futura vita non erunt. Nihilominus tamen actio hierarchica est in caelestibus spiritibus, ut Dionysius dicit, et illa actio est alterius modi ab activa vita quam nunc agimus in hac vita. Unde et illa doctrina quae ibi erit, longe est alia ab ista doctrina.
          <td>1. There is no active life where there is no body, inasmuch as toil is connected with its exercise, and inasmuch as it relieves the infirmities of our neighbors. It is in this sense that Gregory says: “The active life is laborious because it works in the sweat of its brow; two things which will not be in the future life.” Nevertheless, there is still hierarchical activity among the heavenly spirits, as Dionysius says, and the manner of the activity is different from the active life which we now lead in this life. Hence, the teaching which will exist there is far different from the teaching here.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod Gregorius, ibidem, dicit, sicut bonus ordo vivendi est ut ab activa vita in contemplativam tendatur; ita plerumque utiliter a contemplativa animus ad activam reflectitur, ut per hoc quod contemplativa mentem accenderit, perfectius activa teneatur. Sciendum tamen, quod activa contemplativam praecedit quantum ad illos actus qui in materia nullo modo cum contemplativa conveniunt; sed quantum ad illos actus qui materiam a contemplativa suscipiunt, necesse est ut activa contemplativam sequatur.
          <td>2. As Gregory says: “Just as the good disposal of our life leads us to try to pass from the active life to the contemplative, in like manner the minds of many can usefully turn back from the contemplative to the active life so that the flame which the coutemplative life has enkindled in their minds may lead them to live the active life more perfectly.” Still, we must bear in mind that the active life precedes the contemplative in regard to those acts which have a subject matter in which the contemplative life has no part at all, but the active life must follow the contemplative in those acts which receive their subject matter from the contemplative life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod visio docentis est principium doctrinae; sed ipsa doctrina magis consistit in transfusione scientiae rerum visarum quam in earum visione: unde visio docentis magis pertinet ad contemplationem quam ad actionem.
          <td>3. The insight of the teacher is a source of teaching, but teaching itself consists more in the communication of the things seen than in the vision of them. Hence, the insight of the teacher belongs more to action than to contemplation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod ratio illa probat quod vita contemplativa sit principium doctrinae; sicut calor non est ipsa calefactio, sed calefactionis principium, invenitur autem contemplativa vita esse activae principium in quantum eam dirigit; sicut e converso activa vita ad contemplativam disponit.
          <td>4. This argument proves that the contemplative life is a source of teaching just as heat is the source of the act of warming, and is not itself that activity. For we see that the contemplative life is the source of the active life in so far as it directs it, just as, conversely, the active life disposes for the contemplative.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum patet solutio ex dictis, quia respectu materiae primae doctrina cum contemplativa convenit, ut dictum est.
          <td>5. The solution is clear from what has been said, for teaching and the contemplative life have the first type of subject matter in common, as has been said above.
