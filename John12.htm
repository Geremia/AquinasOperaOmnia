                  1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where
                  Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead. 2 There they
                  made him a supper; Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those
                  at the table with him. 3 Mary took a pound of costly ointment
                  of pure nard and anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet
                  with her hair; and the house was filled with the fragrance of
                  the ointment. 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples (he
                  who was to betray him), said, 5 "Why was this ointment not
                  sold for three hundred denarii and given to the poor?" 6 This
                  he said, not that he cared for the poor but because he was a
                  thief, and as he had the money box he used to take what was
                  put into it.

                    1589 So far the Evangelist has been showing the power of
                    Christ's divinity by what he did and taught during his
                    public life. Now he begins to show the power of his divinity
                    as manifested in his passion and death.

                            Now there were two things which caused or occasioned
                            the passion of Christ: the glory of Christ, which
                            aroused the envy of the Jews, and their disbelief,
                            which blinded them. So first, he treats of the glory
                            Christ received; secondly, of the unbelief of the
                            Jews (v 37). In regard to the first he does two
                            things: first, he shows how Christ received glory
                            from other people; secondly, how he received glory
                            from God (v 27). Concerning the first he does three
                            things: first, he shows how Christ received glory
                            from his intimate friends; secondly, from the crowd
                            of the Jewish people (v 9): thirdly, from the
                            Gentiles (v 20). Concerning the first he does two
                            things: first, he shows the glory Christ received by
                            being ministered to by his friends; secondly, how
                            this kindled the indignation of the one who was to
                            betray him (v 4). In regard to the first he does
                            three things: first, he describes the time;
                            secondly, the place (v 1); and thirdly, the kindness
                            shown to Christ (v 2).

                                1590 He says first, what we have already stated:
                                that before the Passover Christ went into a
                                region near the wilderness, and since the feast
                                was drawing near, the Jews began to look for
                                him. Thus, when the paschal season was at hand,
                                during which the symbolic lamb was immolated,
                                he, as the true lamb, came to the place where he
                                would suffer and of his own free will be
                                immolated for the salvation of the world: "He
                                was offered because it was his own will," as we
                                read in Isaiah [53:7].

                                    The Evangelist says Christ came there

                                    inform us that by the day of the Passover he
                                    did not mean the fourteenth day of the first
                                    month (when according to the twelfth chapter
                                    of Exodus, the Passover lamb was slain in
                                    the evening), but the fifteenth day. This
                                    entire day was festive, and that year it
                                    fell on the Friday our Lord suffered. Thus
                                    the sixth day before the Passover was the
                                    first day of the week, i.e., the Palm Sunday
                                    on which our Lord entered Jerusalem.
                                    Consequently, Christ came to Bethany on the
                                    previous day, that is, on the Sabbath. This
                                    is what he means by the phrase,

                                        1591 This number is very appropriate to
                                        the mystery to be enacted. First of all,
                                        because of the number itself, for six is
                                        a perfect number. For God completed the
                                        works of creation in six days. For this
                                        reason it was appropriate that it should
                                        take six days to accomplish the work of
                                        the passion, which would restore all
                                        things: "to reconcile all things,
                                        whether on earth or in heaven, making
                                        peace by the blood of his cross" (Col
                                        1:20); "God was in Christ reconciling
                                        the world to himself" (2 Cor 5:19).

                                            Secondly, it is appropriate to the
                                            mystery, considering its
                                            foreshadowing. For Exodus (v 12)
                                            commanded that on the tenth day of
                                            the first month every man was to
                                            take a lamb for his household and
                                            keep it for the sacrifice. Thus it
                                            was also on the tenth day of the
                                            first month, i.e., on the sixth day
                                            before the fifteenth day, that our
                                            Lord decided to enter Jerusalem,
                                            drawing near to the place where he
                                            would be sacrificed. This is clear
                                            from what follows: "The next day a
                                            great crowd who had come to the
                                            feast heard that Jesus was coming to
                                            Jerusalem. So they took branches of
                                            palm trees and went out to meet him"
                                            (12:12).

                                                the place is mentioned. Bethany
                                                was a village near Jerusalem,
                                                and it means the "house of
                                                obedience." This also is
                                                appropriate to the mystery.
                                                First, as regards a reason for
                                                the passion: "He became obedient
                                                unto death" (Phil 2:8).

                                                Christ: "He became the source of
                                                eternal salvation to all who
                                                obey him" (Heb 5:9).

                    1607 Having narrated the traitor's indignation at the
                    kindness shown by the woman, the Evangelist now shows how
                    our Lord put a stop to it. First, our Lord answers the
                    unjust criticism Judas spoke against the woman; secondly, he
                    rejects the spiritual reason Judas pretended to have (v 8).

                        bona sint, non sunt prohibenda. Et, ut Chrysostomus
                        dicit, forte Iesus antequam mulier effudisset unguentum,
                        potius illud dari pauperibus elegisset; nunc vero quia
                        iam factum erat, prohibentes comprimit, dicens
                        <i>sinite illam</i>. Prov. III, 27:

                        1608 He says, <b>Let her alone</b>, i.e., do not stop
                        her. For it is well known that many good works are done
                        which if our advice had been sought before they were
                        done, we would not have advised that they be done,
                        because something better could possibly have been done.
                        Yet after they are begun, so long as they are good, they
                        should not be stopped. Thus, as Chrysostom says, before
                        the woman had poured out the ointment, Jesus would
                        perhaps have preferred that it be given to the poor, but
                        now that it was done, he held back those who were trying
                        to stop her, saying, <b>Let her alone</b>: "Do not
                        prevent one who is able from doing good. If you are
                        able, you also do good," as we read in Proverbs [3:27].

                            ungerent Iesum. Ideo ergo dicit

                            foretelling both his approaching death and the
                            kindness this woman was ready to do for him in his
                            tomb if he had not precluded it by rising so soon,
                            for as we read in Mark's Gospel (16:1): "Mary
                            Magdalene," along with other women, "bought spices,
                            so that they might go and anoint him." This is why
                            he said,
                            <b>let her keep it for the day of my burial</b>, not
                            the identical ointment she used, but ointment of the
                            same kind, in general or particular, or even a
                            similar service. It is as though he were saying: Do
                            not stop her from doing for me while I am alive what
                            she will be unable to do for me when I am dead. For,
                            as I said, she was prevented by the resurrection of
                            Christ occurring so quickly. This is expressed in a
                            clearer way in Mark (14:8): "She has anointed my
                            body beforehand for burying."

                                death? Not at all: for she did not understand
                                what she was doing. Rather, she was moved to do
                                it by a certain inner urge. It often happens
                                that people are moved to do things that they do
                                not understand, as in the case of Caiaphas, the
                                high priest, who said, "You know nothing at all;
                                you do not understand that it is expedient for
                                you that one man should die for the people"
                                (11:49). Things of this sort are called
                                presages, because they take place before the
                                event.

                                    ungerentur pedes eius ex eo; quia tamen

                                    1610 Then when he says,
                                    <b>the poor you always have with you</b>, he
                                    rejects the spiritual reason which Judas
                                    feigned when he said: "Why was this ointment
                                    not sold for three hundred denarii and given
                                    to the poor." Our Lord answered,
                                    <b>the poor you always have with you</b>.
                                    Here it might be remarked that sometimes one
                                    should do what is less needful if the
                                    opportunity remains for doing what is more
                                    needful. Thus, although it was more needful
                                    that this ointment be given to the poor
                                    rather than having it used to anoint the
                                    Lord's feet, nevertheless, because there was
                                    still opportunity to do the former, since we
                                    always have the poor with us, our Lord
                                    allowed what was less needful.

                                                Another explanation would be
                                                this. When our Lord said this he
                                                was thinking of the presence of
                                                his divinity. Now some seem to
                                                possess Christ spiritually,
                                                either in the sacrament or in
                                                professing the faith; yet they
                                                will not always possess him
                                                because they belong to the
                                                Church only nominally, and not
                                                by merit. These are the
                                                servants. But the children will
                                                always possess him because "the
                                                son continues for ever" (8:35).
                                                Thus he said to Judas,

                                                    was rebuking Judas when he
                                                    said this: for by being
                                                    annoyed that this respect
                                                    was shown to Christ, he
                                                    seemed to consider Christ's
                                                    presence as a burden.

                  12 The next day a great crowd who had come to the feast heard
                  that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem. 13 So they took branches
                  of palm trees and went out to meet him, crying, "Hosanna!
                  Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, even the King
                  of Israel!" 14 And Jesus found a young ass and sat upon it; as
                  it is written, 15 "Fear not, daughter of Zion; behold, your
                  king is coming, sitting on an ass's colt!" 16 His disciples
                  did not understand this at first; but when Jesus was
                  glorified, then they remembered that this had been written of
                  him and had been done to him. 17 The crowd that had been with
                  him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from
                  the dead bore witness. 18 The reason why the crowd went to
                  meet him was that they heard he had done this sign. 19 The
                  Pharisees then said to one another, "You see that you can do
                  nothing; look, the world has gone after him.

                    Christ. First, they go to meet Christ; secondly, we have the
                    reaction of the Pharisees (v 19). Concerning the first the
                    Evangelist does three things: first, he mentions their going
                    out; secondly, he tells of our Lord's entrance (v 14); and
                    thirdly, he states why the crowd went out to him.

                        went out to the Lord. First, the time they went out,
                        <b>the next day</b>, that is, the day following the one
                        he meant when he said, "six days before the Passover";
                        in other words, the tenth day of the month. This is in
                        keeping with the figure in Exodus (12:3), where we read
                        that the Paschal lamb which was to be immolated on the
                        fourteenth day in the evening should be procured on the
                        tenth day of the month.

                            converted to Christ: "Let the assembly of the people
                            be gathered about thee" (Ps 7:7). He says
                            <b>to the feast</b>, because believers are converted
                            to Christ so that they may come to the feast day of
                            the heavenly Jerusalem: "Many will come from east

                            Jacob in the kingdom of heaven" (Matt 8:11).

                                motive for going out, which was that they heard
                                that Jesus was coming: he says that they
                                <b>heard that Jesus was coming to Jerusalem</b>.
                                For all the faithful are converted to Christ
                                through what they hear about the faith: "Faith
                                comes from what is heard, and what is heard
                                comes by the preaching of Christ" (Rom 10:17);
                                "and the children of Israel heard that the Lord
                                had visited the children of Israel; and the
                                peoples believed," as we read in Exodus [4:31].

                                    fecerunt, quia
                                    <i>receperunt ramos palmarum</i>. Palma

                                    Et de martyribus triumphantibus legitur
                                    Apoc. VII, 9, quod
                                    <i>palmae erant in manibus eorum</i>. Rami

                                    sunt, significantes victoriam, quia dominus

                                    conducted themselves. And first of all, what
                                    they did:
                                    <b>they took branches of palm trees</b>. Now
                                    the palm, since it retains its freshness,
                                    signifies victory. Thus in antiquity it was
                                    conferred upon conquerors as a symbol of
                                    their victory. Again, we read in Revelation
                                    (7:9) of the conquering martyrs that they
                                    held "palm branches in their hands." And so
                                    the branches of palm trees were given as
                                    praise, signifying victory, because our Lord
                                    was to conquer death by dying and to triumph
                                    over Satan, the prince of death, by the
                                    victory of the cross.

                                        1621 Secondly, the Evangelist mentions
                                        what they said:
                                        <b
                                          >they shouted out Hosanna! Blessed is
                                          he who comes in the name of the Lord,
                                          the King of Israel!</b
                                        >
                                        Here they combine both petition and
                                        praise. There is petition when they say,
                                        <b>Hosanna</b>, that is "Save us, I
                                        implore you." It is like saying:
                                        <i>hosy</i>, which means "save," and
                                        <i>anna</i>, which means "implore."
                                        According to Augustine, this is not a
                                        word, but rather an exclamation of one
                                        praying.

                                        And it is quite proper that they should
                                        ask the Lord Jesus for salvation,
                                        because we read in Isaiah (35:4):
                                        "Behold your GodHe will come and save
                                        you"; "Stir up thy might, and come to
                                        save us!" (Ps 80:2).

                                            for his coming and for the power of
                                            his reign or kingdom. They praise
                                            his coming when they say,
                                            <b
                                              >Blessed is he who comes in the

                                            >. Note that to bless is to speak
                                            good things. Now God blesses us in
                                            one way, and we bless God in another
                                            way. For when God blesses us he
                                            makes us good, since for God to
                                            speak is to do: "For he commanded
                                            [that is, spoke], and they were
                                            created" (Ps 148:5). But when we
                                            bless God, we profess his goodness:
                                            "We bless you from the house of the
                                            Lord" (Ps 118:26); "Blessed be every
                                            one who blesses you!" (Gen 27:29).
                                            Therefore,
                                            <b

                                                Now because both the Father and
                                                the Son are the Lord, the
                                                phrase,

                                                can be understood in two ways.
                                                In one way,
                                                <b

                                                >, means blessed is he who comes
                                                in his own name, as Lord: "The
                                                Lord is our ruler" (Is 33:22).
                                                Moses did not come in the name
                                                of the Lord in this way, because
                                                he came as a servant: "Now Moses
                                                was faithful in all God's house
                                                as a servant, to testify to the
                                                things that were to be spoken
                                                later" (Heb 3:5). According to
                                                Augustine, the better
                                                interpretation would be to say
                                                that
                                                <b>in the name of the Lord</b>
                                                means in the name of the Father.

                                                For Christ's words direct our
                                                minds to this: "I have come in
                                                my Father's name" (5:45).
                                                Further, there are two ways in
                                                which Christ is said to have
                                                come in the name of the Father.
                                                First, he came as the Son, which
                                                implies the Father; secondly, he
                                                came to manifest the Father: "I
                                                have manifested thy name to the
                                                men whom thou gave me" (17:6).

                                                        Instead, the Psalm says:

                  20 Now among those who went up to worship at the feast were
                  some Greeks [Gentiles]. 21 So these came to Philip, who was
                  from Bethsaida in Galilee, and said to him, "Sir, we wish to
                  see Jesus." 22 Philip went and told Andrew; Andrew went with
                  Philip and they told Jesus. 23 And Jesus answered them, "The
                  hour has come for the Son of man to be glorified. 24 Truly,
                  truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat falls into the
                  earth and dies, it remains alone; but if it dies, it bears
                  much fruit. 25 He who loves his life loses it, and he who
                  hates his life in this world will keep it for eternal life. 26
                  If any one serves me, he must follow me; and where I am, there
                  shall my servant be also; if any one serves me, the Father
                  will honor him."

                    1631 Having described the glory Christ received from the
                    helpfulness of his friends and from the devotion of the
                    crowd, the Evangelist now describes the glory Christ
                    received from the devotion of the Gentiles. First, the
                    devotion of the Gentiles is mentioned; secondly, this
                    devotion is reported (v 22); and thirdly, we see the
                    prediction of Christ's passion (v 23). Concerning the
                    devotion of the Gentiles, two things are set forth: first,
                    their devotion to the sacraments of the Old Law; secondly,
                    their devotion to Christ (v 21).

                        the temple. Thus he says,
                        <b>Now among those who went up</b>, to Jerusalem,
                        <b>to worship at the feast were some Gentiles</b>. He is
                        saying in effect: Not just the Jews, but the Gentiles,
                        also, honored Christ. According to a Gloss, the reason
                        why they went up to Jerusalem was because they were
                        proselytes, who had been converted to the Jewish rite by
                        the preaching of those Jews who were scattered
                        throughout the world, and who strove to convert whomever
                        they could: "You traverse sea and land to make a single
                        proselyte" (Mt 23:15).

                        And so, in keeping with the Jewish rite, they went up
                        with the others.

                            Sed melius dicendum est, secundum Chrysostomum,
                            quod, sicut habetur II Mach. III, v. 2 s., templum
                            Dei quod erat in Ierusalem, in veneratione habebatur
                            cunctis populis et regibus universae terrae, ita ut
                            ipsum templum maximis muneribus illustrarent. Et
                            ideo contingebat quod in diebus festivis multi etiam
                            gentiles ascenderent Ierusalem. Simile habetur Act.
                            VIII, 27, de eunucho Candacis reginae Aethiopum, qui
                            venerat adorare in Ierusalem. Unde et Is. LVI, 7,

                            But a better reason is given by Chrysostom, namely,
                            that as we read in Maccabees (3:2), the temple of
                            God in Jerusalem was held in such esteem by all the
                            people and rulers throughout the world that they
                            considered it an honor to glorify the temple with
                            the finest gifts.

                            And so it happened that on the feast days even many
                            Gentiles would go up to Jerusalem. An example of
                            this is mentioned in the Acts (8:27), where it tells
                            of a eunuch, a minister to Queen Candace of
                            Ethiopia, who had come to Jerusalem to worship. Thus
                            Isaiah says: "My house shall be called a house of
                            prayer for all peoples" (Is 56:7). The fact that
                            these Gentiles came to the temple out of devotion
                            prefigured the conversion of the Gentiles to the
                            faith.

                                1633 The devotion of the Gentiles to Christ is
                                shown by their desire to see him; for the
                                Evangelist says, <b>So these</b>, that is, the
                                Gentiles, <b>came to Philip</b>. Here we should
                                note that Christ personally preached only to the
                                Jews: "For I tell you that Christ became a
                                servant to the circumcised to show God's
                                truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises
                                given to the patriarchs" (Rom 15:8); but he
                                preached to the Gentiles through the apostles.
                                "And I shall send of them that shall be saved to
                                the Gentiles, and they shall declare my glory to
                                the Gentiles" [Is 66:19]; "Go therefore and make
                                disciples of all nations" (Mt 28:19). This was
                                now being indicated beforehand inasmuch as the
                                Gentiles who wanted to see Christ did not come
                                to him first, but to one of his disciples, to
                                Philip. And this was fitting, because Philip was
                                the first to preach to those who were not of the
                                Jewish rite, namely, to the Samaritans, as we
                                see from the Acts (8:5): "Philip went down to
                                the city of Samaria, and proclaimed to them the
                                Christ."

                                    for "Philip" means the "mouth of the

                                    Now preachers are the mouth of Christ: "If
                                    you utter what is precious, and not what is
                                    worthless, you shall be as your mouth" (Jer
                                    15:19); and Christ too is the lantern: "I
                                    have given you as a light to the nations"
                                    (Is 42:6). It was also appropriate to him
                                    because of his home: for Philip
                                    <b>was from Bethsaida</b>, which means
                                    "hunting," and preachers hunt for those whom
                                    they convert to Christ: "I will send for
                                    many hunters, and they shall hunt them" (Jer
                                    16:16). Again, it was appropriate because
                                    Bethsaida was <b>in Galilee</b>, which means
                                    "transmigration," and the Gentiles, by the
                                    preaching of the apostles, were
                                    transmigrated from the gods of paganism to
                                    the state of believers: "Therefore, son of
                                    man, prepare for yourself an exile's
                                    baggage, and go into exile by day in their
                                    sight," as we read in Ezekiel (12:3).

                                        These Gentiles approached Philip and
                                        expressed their desires, saying,

                                            devotion is carried to Christ. In
                                            this action a definite order is
                                            being followed, because "the things
                                            that are from God are set in order"
                                            [Rom 13:1]. Now it belongs to the
                                            divine order that lower things be
                                            led back to God through those that
                                            are higher, and since Andrew
                                            outranked Philip among the apostles,
                                            because he was converted before him,
                                            Philip did not wish to bring these
                                            Gentiles to Christ by himself, but
                                            through Andrew, perhaps remembering
                                            that the Lord had said: "Go nowhere
                                            among the Gentiles" (Mt 10:5). And
                                            this is what he says,
                                            <b
                                              >Phillip went and told Andrew;
                                              Andrew went with Philip and they
                                              told Jesus</b
                                            >. This teaches us that all things
                                            should be done with the advice of
                                            those in authority. Thus, even Paul
                                            went up to Jerusalem and conferred
                                            with the apostles about the Gospel
                                            which he was preaching among the
                                            Gentiles (Gal 2:2).

                                                are to lead others to Christ.
                                                The first is clear, orderly
                                                speech; and this is indicated by
                                                Philip's name, which means the
                                                "mouth of the lantern." The
                                                second is virtue, manifested in
                                                good actions; and this is
                                                indicated by Andrew's name,
                                                which has the meaning of
                                                "strength." By the word of the
                                                Lord the heavens were made, and

                                                    time of his passion is near;
                                                    secondly, he intimates that
                                                    his passion is necessary (v
                                                    24); and thirdly, he
                                                    mentions the necessity for
                                                    others to suffer (v 25).

                  27 "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father,
                  save me from this hour'? No, for this purpose I have come to
                  this hour. 28 Father, glorify thy name." Then a voice came
                  from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it
                  again." 29 The crowd standing by heard it and said that it had
                  thundered. Others said, "An angel has spoken to him." 30 Jesus
                  answered, "This voice has come for your sake, not for mine. 31
                  Now is the judgment of this world, now shall the ruler of this
                  world be cast out; 32 and I, when I am lifted up from the
                  earth, will draw all men to myself." 33 He said this to show
                  by what death he was to die.

                    1649 Above, we saw the glory shown to Christ by various
                    types of people; here the Evangelist considers the glory
                    shown to Christ by God. First, he mentions that Christ asked
                    for glory; secondly, the promise of glory is made (v 28b).
                    Concerning the first he does two things. First, the interior
                    state of Christ is given; secondly, he mentions the request
                    made by Christ.

                        Propter quod Augustinus dicit:

                          >domine, sequi iubes animam meam, turbari video animam

                        1650 Note, in regard to the first, that it seems
                        incongruous for Christ to be saying,
                        <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>, for he had urged his
                        faithful to hate their own lives in this world; but with
                        his own death near at hand, we hear the Lord himself
                        saying, <b>Now is my soul troubled</b>. This leads
                        Augustine to say: "O Lord, You command my soul to
                        follow. But I see your own soul troubled. What support
                        shall I seek, if the rock crumbles?"

                        Thus we must first examine this troubled state of
                        Christ, and secondly, why he willed to undergo it.

                            Sciendum est autem quantum ad primum, quod proprie
                            dicitur turbari aliquid quando commovetur: unde et
                            mare commotum, dicimus esse turbatum. Quandocumque
                            ergo aliquid excedit modum suae quietis et
                            tranquillitatis, tunc illud dicitur turbari. In
                            anima autem humana est pars sensitiva, et pars
                            rationalis. In sensitiva quidem parte animae accidit
                            turbatio, quando aliquibus motibus commovetur; puta
                            cum timore contrahitur, spe elevatur, gaudio
                            dilatatur, seu aliqua alia passione afficitur. Sed
                            haec quidem turbatio quandoque quidem sub ratione
                            sistit; quandoque vero limitem rationis excedit, cum
                            scilicet ipsa ratio perturbatur. Quod quidem pluries

                            1651 As to the first, we should note that, properly
                            speaking, a thing is said to be troubled when it is
                            greatly agitated. Hence when the sea is very
                            agitated it is said to be troubled. And so whenever
                            a thing oversteps the bounds of its repose and
                            tranquility, it is said to be troubled. Now in the
                            human soul there is a sentient area and a rational
                            area. The sensitive area of the soul is troubled
                            when it becomes strongly affected by certain
                            movements. For example, when it is contracted by
                            fear, raised up by hope, dilated by joy, or
                            otherwise affected by one or other of the emotions.
                            Sometimes this perturbation remains within the
                            bounds of reason, and sometimes it exceeds the
                            bounds or reason, namely, when the reason itself is
                            troubled. And although this latter condition quite
                            often occurs in us, it is not found in Christ, since
                            he is the Wisdom of the Father. Indeed, it is not
                            found in any wise person; thus the Stoic tenet that
                            one who is wise is not troubled, that is, in his
                            reason.

                                in its sentient part; but these emotions do not
                                trouble my reason, and it does not abandon its
                                own order. "He began to be greatly distressed
                                and troubled" (Mk 14:33).

                                    Such emotions, however, exist in us
                                    otherwise than in Christ. In us, they arise
                                    from necessity, insofar as we are moved and
                                    affected from without, as it were. But in
                                    Christ, they are not from necessity, but
                                    from the command of reason, since there was
                                    never any emotion in him except that which
                                    he himself aroused. For in Christ the lower
                                    powers were subject to his reason so
                                    perfectly that they could not act or undergo
                                    anything except what reason appointed for
                                    them. Thus as was said above [11:33]: "he
                                    was deeply moved in spirit and troubled
                                    himself"; "You have moved the earth," that
                                    is, human nature, "and troubled it" [Ps
                                    59:4]. And so the soul of Christ was
                                    troubled in such a way that its perturbation
                                    was not opposed to reason, but according to
                                    the order of reason.

                                        quod dominus turbari voluit propter duo.
                                        Primo quidem propter fidei documenta, ut
                                        scilicet veritatem humanae naturae
                                        approbaret: et ideo iam ad passionem
                                        appropinquans omnia humanitus agit.
                                        Secundo propter exemplum: nam si omnia
                                        constanter egisset, et nullam passionem
                                        sensisset in anima, non fuisset
                                        sufficiens exemplum ad mortem
                                        sustinendam hominibus. Et ideo turbari
                                        voluit, ut, cum turbamur, non recusemus
                                        mortem sustinere, nec deficiamus; Hebr.

                                        1652 In regard to the second point, note
                                        that Christ willed to be troubled for
                                        two reasons. First, to show us a
                                        doctrine of the faith, that is, the
                                        truth of his human nature. Accordingly,
                                        as his passion was drawing near, he did
                                        everything in a human way. Secondly, he
                                        wanted to be an example for us. For if
                                        he had remained unmoved and had felt no
                                        emotions in his soul, he would not have
                                        been a satisfactory example of how we
                                        should face death. And so he willed to
                                        be troubled in order that when we are
                                        troubled at the prospect of death, we
                                        will not refuse to endure it, we will
                                        not run away: "For we have not a high
                                        priest who is unable to sympathize with
                                        our weakness, but one who in every
                                        respect has been tempted as we are, yet
                                        without sinning" (Heb 4:15).

                                            what came before is clear. He
                                            encouraged his disciples to suffer
                                            when he said: "He who hates his life
                                            in this world will keep it for
                                            eternal life." But some might say to
                                            him: "Lord, you can calmly discuss
                                            and philosophize about death because
                                            you are above human sorrows, and
                                            death does not trouble you." It was
                                            to counter this that he willed to be
                                            troubled. This disturbance in Christ
                                            was natural: for just as the soul
                                            naturally loves union with its body,
                                            so it naturally shrinks separation
                                            from it, especially since the reason
                                            of Christ allowed his soul and its
                                            inferior powers to act in their own
                                            proper way.

                    1675 Having mentioned the promised glorification of the Lord
                    and explaining the voice, the Evangelist now describes the
                    doubt which prevailed among the crowd. First, they introduce
                    the authority of the Law; and secondly, they raise a problem
                    based on it (v 34).

                        government and of peace there will be no end"; and in
                        Daniel (7:14): "His dominion is an everlasting dominion,

                            unam de facto, aliam de persona. De facto, cum

                            <i>ego si exaltatus fuero</i> etc., quomodo Iudaei

                            dicendum, quod Iudaei iam assueti erant verbis

                            filio hominis, tamen supra III, 14, hoc dixit:

                            1677 Basing themselves on this authority, they
                            formulate two doubts: one concerns a fact, and the
                            other the person. As concerns the fact, they say,
                            <b
                              >How can you say that the Son of man must be
                              lifted up?</b
                            >
                            But since Christ did not say that "the Son of man
                            must be lifted up," but "and I, when I am lifted
                            up," why do the Jews say that "the Son of man" must
                            be lifted up? The answer to this is that the Jews
                            were now accustomed to our Lord's words; thus they
                            remembered that he called himself the Son of man.
                            And so when he said, "And I, when I am lifted up,"
                            they took it to mean, "If the Son of man is lifted
                            up," as Augustine says.

                            Or, one might answer that although Christ did not
                            here mention the Son of man, yet earlier he had
                            said: "The Son of man must be lifted up" (3:14).

                                1678 Yet it seems that their statement,
                                <b>The Son of man must be lifted up</b>, is in
                                no way opposed to the statement that
                                <b>the Christ remains for ever</b>. The answer
                                is that since our Lord was accustomed to speak
                                to them in figurative language, they understood
                                much of what was said in that way. And so they
                                also suspected that when our Lord spoke of being
                                lifted up, he was referring to death on the
                                cross: "When you have lifted up the Son of man,
                                then you will know," as we read above (8:28).
                                Or, it could be said that they understood it in
                                this sense because they had already thought of
                                doing that very thing. Thus it was not the
                                sharpness of their understanding that gave them
                                this interpretation of these words, but an
                                awareness of their own wickedness.

                                    say: "We have heard from the law that the
                                    Christ does not suffer," because in many
                                    places of the law reference is made to his
                                    passion and resurrection: as "Like a lamb
                                    that is led to the slaughter" (Is 53:7); "I
                                    have slept and taken my rest: and I have
                                    risen up" [Ps 3:7]. Rather, they say,

                                    reason for this is that the former would not
                                    have involved any opposition, since no

                                        his person when they say,
                                        <b>Who is this Son of man?</b> They ask
                                        this because it says in Daniel (7:13):
                                        "And behold, with the clouds of heaven
                                        there came one like a son of man, and he
                                        came to the Ancient of Days"; and by
                                        that Son of man they understood the
                                        Christ. It is as though they were
                                        saying: "You say the Son of man must be
                                        lifted up; yet the Son of man, whom we
                                        take to be the Christ, remains forever.
                                        So <b>Who is this Son of man?</b> If he
                                        does not remain for ever, neither is he
                                        the Christ." In this they deserve to be
                                        reprimanded for their dullness, because
                                        even though they had seen and heard so
                                        many great things, they still had doubts
                                        about his being the Christ: "He who
                                        tells a story to a fool tells it to a
                                        drowsy man" (Sir 22:9).

                                                Augustine, so that "little"
                                                modifies "light."

                                                As if to say: "A little light is
                                                in you," insofar as it sees that
                                                the Christ remains for ever. For
                                                this is a truth, and every
                                                manifestation of the truth is a
                                                light infused by God. Yet this
                                                light which is in you is
                                                "little," because even though
                                                you recognize the eternity of
                                                the Christ, you do not believe
                                                in his death and resurrection.
                                                This shows that you do not have
                                                perfect faith. Thus, what was
                                                said to Peter applies also to
                                                them: "O man of little faith,
                                                why did you doubt?" (Mt 14:31).

                  37 Though he had done so many signs before them, yet they did
                  not believe in him; 38 it was that the word spoken by the
                  prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: "Lord, who has believed our
                  report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?" 39
                  Therefore they could not believe. For Isaiah again said, 40
                  "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they
                  should see with their eyes and perceive with their heart, and
                  turn for me to heal them." 41 Isaiah said this because he saw
                  his glory and spoke of him.

                    1688 Above, the Evangelist gave many examples of Christ's
                    glory, because of which the Jews sought to kill him out of
                    envy. Now he deals with another of the occasions surrounding
                    his passion, that is, the unbelief of the Jews. First, their
                    unbelief is discussed; in the second place, it is reproved
                    by our Lord (v 44). Concerning the first he does two things:
                    first, he reproves the unbelief of those who believed, but
                    in secret (v 42). As to the first, two things are done:
                    first, he mentions the strange hardness of their unbelief;
                    secondly, to show that it came about not without reason or
                    by chance, he mentions a prophecy (v 38).

                        1689 The Evangelist, as though at a loss to explain it,
                        says that our Lord had done many miracles: such as
                        changing water into wine, curing a paralytic, giving
                        sight to a blind man, and raising a dead man to life:
                        nevertheless,
                        <b
                          >though he had done so many signs before them, yet
                          they did not believe in him</b
                        >. They usually said: "What sign do you do, that we may
                        see, and believe you?" (6:30). But now! The Evangelist
                        says:
                        <b
                          >though he had done so many signs before them, yet
                          they did not believe in him</b
                        >. "If I had not done among them the works which no one
                        else did, they would not have sin" (15:24). And so they
                        could not say: "We do not see our signs" (Ps 74:9).

                            Christ (v 41). He does two things about the first:
                            he cites the prophecy foretelling their unbelief;
                            secondly, he adds the prophecy foretelling the
                            reason for their unbelief (v 39).

                                >. Here we should note that in Sacred Scripture
                                the word "that" sometimes indicates a cause, as
                                in "I came that they may have light" (10:10).
                                But at other times it just indicates a sequence
                                of events, and signifies a future event; and
                                that is how it is used here. These people did
                                not believe, but it was not because Isaiah
                                predicted this. Rather, Isaiah predicted this
                                because they were not going to believe. And so
                                this saying of Isaiah is fulfilled from the fact
                                that they did not believe. "Everything written
                                about me in the law of Moses and the prophets
                                and the psalms must be fulfilled" (Lk 24:44);
                                "Not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the law
                                until all is accomplished" (Matt 5:18).

                                    1692 But if it was necessary that the saying
                                    of Isaiah be fulfilled, it seems that the
                                    Jews should be excused for not believing,
                                    for they could not act contrary to the
                                    prophecy. I answer that the prophecy took
                                    account of their freedom. For God, knowing
                                    the future beforehand, foretold their
                                    unbelief in the prophecy, but he did not
                                    bring it about; for God does not force one
                                    to sin just because he already knows one's
                                    future sins. And so our Lord, from whom
                                    nothing is hidden, predicted that the Jews
                                    would commit the sin which they did commit.

                                        Here we should note that belief comes in
                                        two ways. Sometimes by instruction from
                                        another; and this is the usual way: "So
                                        faith comes from what is heard, and what
                                        is heard comes by the preaching of
                                        Christ" (Rom 10:17). Sometimes it come
                                        by a divine revelation; and this is the
                                        special way, spoken of by the Apostle:
                                        "For I did not receive it from man, nor
                                        was I taught it, but it came through a
                                        revelation of Jesus Christ" (Gal 1:12).

                                            1694 Isaiah foretold that there
                                            would be few believers. First, as to
                                            those who would believe in the usual
                                            way, by instruction, he says,
                                            <b
                                              >Lord, who has believed our
                                              report?</b
                                            >
                                            This can be understood in two ways.
                                            In one way, the meaning is:
                                            <b>who has believed our report?</b>
                                            That is, what you reported to us,
                                            what we have heard from you. "We
                                            have heard tidings from the Lord"
                                            (Obad 1:1); "Let us hear what the
                                            Lord will speak" (Ps 85:8). It is
                                            like they were saying: "Lord, we
                                            have heard these things from you.
                                            But who will believe us when we tell
                                            what we have heard from you about
                                            your birth and passion?" This entire
                                            chapter of Isaiah (ch. 53) is
                                            speaking of these things.

                                                Prophets are said to hear in
                                                order to suggest the way in
                                                which the prophets are
                                                instructed. By sight, a person
                                                receives an immediate knowledge
                                                of the thing seen, but by
                                                hearing he does not have an
                                                immediate knowledge of what he
                                                sees, but he gains his knowledge
                                                from certain signs of the thing.
                                                And so because the prophets did
                                                not immediately see the divine
                                                essence, but only certain signs
                                                of divine realties, they are
                                                said to hear. "If there is a
                                                prophet among you, I the Lord
                                                make myself known to him in a
                                                vision, I speak with him in a
                                                dream," by certain signs (Num
                                                12:6). The Son, however,
                                                eternally sees the divine
                                                essence itself: "No one has ever
                                                seen God; the only Son, who is
                                                in the bosom of the Father, he
                                                has made him known," as was said

                                                            also did when he
                                                            said that the Son is

                                                            Father. The reasons
                                                            for this were that a

                                                            persons, but only
                                                            one, and an arm is
                                                            not equal to the
                                                            person. The answer
                                                            to this is that in

                                                            similarities are not
                                                            really adequate, for
                                                            what we find in

                                                            perfectly represent
                                                            what is in God. Thus
                                                            Dionysius says that
                                                            symbolic theology is
                                                            not argumentative.
                                                            Thus the Son is not
                                                            called an arm as

                                                            because the Father

                  42 Nevertheless many even of the authorities believed in him,
                  but for fear of the Pharisees they did not confess it, lest
                  they should be put out of the synagogue: 43 for they loved the
                  praise [glory] of men more than the praise [glory] of God. 44
                  And Jesus cried out and said, "He who believes in me, believes
                  not in me but in him who sent me. 45 And he who sees me sees
                  him who sent me. 46 I have come as light into the world, that
                  whoever believes in me may not remain in darkness. 47 If any
                  one hears my sayings and does not keep them, I do not judge
                  him; for I did not come to judge the world but to save the
                  world. 48 He who rejects me and does not receive my sayings
                  has a judge; the word that I have spoken will be his judge on
                  the last day. 49 For I have not spoken on my own authority;
                  the Father who sent me has himself given me commandment what
                  to say and what to speak. 50 And I know that his commandment
                  is eternal life. What I say, therefore, I say as the Father
                  has bidden [said to] me."

                    1706 Above, the Evangelist described the failing of those
                    who did not believe at all; here he explains the failing of
                    those who believed in secret, because they were timid,
                    faint-hearted. First, he mentions their dignity; secondly,
                    their failing (v 42); and thirdly, he suggests the root of
                    this failing (v 43).

                        great, for they were the authorities, and on this point
                        he says,
                        <b>many even of the authorities believed in him</b>. He
                        is saying in effect: I said that although Jesus had done
                        so many signs, still they did not believe in him; and
                        although this was true for the majority, yet there were
                        some who did believe in him, because
                        <b>many even of the authorities</b>, of the people,
                        <b>believed in him</b>. One of these was Nicodemus, who
                        came to Jesus by night, as was said (c 3). Thus the
                        words of the Psalm (47:9) were fulfilled: "The princes
                        of the peoples gather as their people of the God of
                        Abraham"; and the statement of the Pharisees is proved
                        false: "Have any of the authorities or of the Pharisees
                        believed in him?" (7:48).

                            to be put out of the synagogue" (9:22). So, although
                            they believed with their hearts, they did not
                            profess him with their lips. Their faith, therefore,
                            was insufficient, for as is said in Romans (10:10):
                            "For a man believes with his heart and so is
                            justified, and he confesses with his lips and so is
                            saved." "Whoever is ashamed of me and my words, of
                            him will the Son of man be ashamed" (Lk 9:26).

                                        transgression" (Is 58:1), and said,
                                        <b
                                          >He who believes in me, believes not
                                          in me but in him who sent me</b
                                        >. This seems to contain a
                                        contradiction, for he says,
                                        <b
                                          >he who believes in me believes not in

                                        >. To understand this we should note
                                        first, according to Augustine, that our
                                        Lord said this to distinguish his divine
                                        and human nature.

                                        For since the proper object of faith is
                                        God, we can indeed believe that a
                                        creature exists, but we should not
                                        believe in a creature (<i
                                          >in creaturam</i
                                        >) but in God alone (<i>in Deum</i>)
                                        [See Part I, commentary on 6:29]. Now in
                                        Christ there is a created nature and the
                                        uncreated nature. Therefore, the truth
                                        of faith requires that our faith be in
                                        Christ as having an uncreated nature.
                                        And so he says,
                                        <b>he who believes in me</b>, that is,
                                        in my person, <b>believes not in me</b>,
                                        as a human being,
                                        <b>but in him who sent me</b>, that is,
                                        he believes in me as sent from the
                                        Father: "My teaching is not mine, but
                                        his who sent me" (7:16).

                                            According to Chrysostom, however,
                                            our Lord says this to suggest his

                                            It is a way of speaking similar to a
                                            person drawing water from a stream
                                            and saying that this water is not
                                            from the stream but from the spring:
                                            for it does not originate from the
                                            stream. So our Lord says,

                                            from another, that is, from my

                                                Christ also sent his disciples:
                                                "As the Father has sent me, even

                                                someone believed in the
                                                disciple, they would cease to
                                                believe in the master. So the
                                                Jews could say on the same basis
                                                that since you have been sent
                                                from the Father, anyone who
                                                believes in you ceases to
                                                believing in the Father.
                                                Therefore, our Lord shows
                                                against this that one who does
                                                not believe in him, does not
                                                believe in the Father. This is
                                                his meaning when he says,

                                                    to here is not a physical
                                                    vision, but a consideration
                                                    of the truth by the mind.
                                                    And the reason why one who
                                                    sees the Son also sees the
                                                    Father is that the Father is
                                                    in the Son by a unity of
                                                    essence. For one thing is
                                                    said to be seen in another
                                                    either because they are the
                                                    same, or they are entirely
                                                    conformed. But the Father
                                                    and the Son are the same in
                                                    nature and entirely
                                                    conformed: because the Son
                                                    is the image of the Father
                                                    and unlike in nothing, for
                                                    "He is the image of the
                                                    invisible God" (Col 1:15);
                                                    "He reflects the glory of
                                                    God and bears the very stamp
                                                    of his nature" (Heb 1:3).
                                                    And so, just as one believes
                                                    in the Father, so also he
                                                    believes in me: "He who has
                                                    seen me has seen the
                                                    FatherDo you not believe
                                                    that I am in the Father and
                                                    the Father in me?" (14:9).
                                                    It is as though he said: The
                                                    reason why one who sees me
                                                    sees the Father also, is
                                                    that the Father is in me and
                                                    I in the Father. Thus it is
                                                    clear what faith should be:
                                                    faith should be in Christ,
                                                    as God, just as it is in the
                                                    Father.

                                                        explained how Christ is
                                                        a light: "He was the
                                                        true light, which
                                                        enlightens every man

                                                        [1:9], and "I am the
                                                        light of the world"
                                                        (8:12). He also shows by

                                                        divine nature. For to be

                                                        but God is light by
                                                        essence: "God is light
                                                        and in him is no
                                                        darkness at all" (1 Jn
                                                        1:5). But because he
                                                        "dwells in
                                                        unapproachable light,
                                                        whom no man has ever
                                                        seen" (1 Tim 6:16), we
                                                        were unable to approach
                                                        him. And so it was
                                                        necessary that he come
                                                        to us. This is what he

                                                        which rescues from error
                                                        and disperses
                                                        intellectual darkness:
                                                        "I came from the Father

                                                        world" (16:28); "He came
                                                        to his own" [1:11]. And
                                                        although the apostles
                                                        are called light - "You

                                                        world" (Mt 5:14) - they
                                                        are not light in the
                                                        same way as Christ. For
                                                        they are a light whose
                                                        light has been given to
                                                        them, even though in
                                                        some way they also give
                                                        light, that is, in their
                                                        ministry. Furthermore,
                                                        none of the apostles
                                                        could truly say,
