              Haec verba competunt praesenti epistolae, in qua apostolus
              redarguit Galatas, qui intantum seducti fuerant a pseudo, ut simul
              servarent legalia et Evangelium, quod apostolus improperat eis in
              verbis praemissis, dicens
              <i>vetera, novis supervenientibus, proiicietis</i>. In quibus

              These words befit the present epistle in which the Apostle
              reproves the Galatians who had been so deceived by false teachers
              as to observe at once the rites of the Law and those of the
              Gospel. For this the Apostle rebukes them with the above words:
              <i>“The new coming on, you shall cast away the old.”</i>
              In these words the Lord suggests a fourfold oldness.

              Prima vetustas est erroris, de qua Is. XXVI, 3:
              <i>vetus error abiit</i>, et haec remota est per novitatem
              doctrinae Christi. Mc. I, 27:
              <i>quae est haec nova doctrina?</i>
            </td>
            <td>
              First, the oldness of error concerning which Isaiah states (26:3):
              “The old error is passed away.” This is removed by the newness of
              the doctrine of Christ. “What is this new doctrine?” (Mk 1:27).

              Secunda vetustas est figurae, de qua Hebr. c. VIII, 8:
              <i
                >consummabo super domum David, et super Iuda testamentum novum,
                non secundum testamentum quod feci patribus eorum</i
              >. Ubi primo ostendit primum testamentum esse vetustum, et hoc
              renovari per novitatem gratiae, seu veritatis praesentiae Christi.
              Ier. XXXI, 22: <i>novum faciet dominus super terram</i>, et
              cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              The second oldness is that of figure, concerning which Hebrews
              (8:8) states: “Behold, the days shall come, saith the Lord; and I
              will perfect, unto the house of Israel and unto the house of Juda,
              a new testament not according to the testament which I made to
              their fathers.” Here he shows first of all that the first
              testament is old and that it is made new by the newness of grace
              or of the reality of Christ’s presence. “The Lord hath created a
              new thing upon the earth...” (Jer 31:22).

              Tertia est vetustas culpae, de qua Ps. XXXI, v. 3:
              <i>quoniam tacui</i> (confitendo scilicet peccata mea),
              <i>inveteraverunt</i>, et cetera. Et haec renovatur per novitatem
              iustitiae. Rom. VI, 4: <i>in novitate vitae ambulemus</i>, et
              cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              The third is the oldness of guilt, concerning which Psalm (31:3)
              states: “Because I was silent” (not confessing my sins), “my bones
              grew old.” And this is made new by the newness of justice. “So we
              may walk in newness of life” (Rom 6:4).

              Quarta est vetustas poenae. Thren. III, 4:
              <i>vetustam feci pellem meam</i>. Et haec renovabitur per
              novitatem gloriae, de qua novitate Is. ult.:
              <i>ecce ego creo caelum novum</i>, etc.; Apoc. XXI, 21:

              The fourth is the oldness of punishment. “My skin he hath made
              old” (Lam 3:4). And this will be made new by the newness of glory,
              concerning which Isaiah (66:22) states: “Behold I will create a
              new heaven and a new earth.” “And he that sat on the throne said:
              Behold, I make all things new” (Rev 21:5).

              The Apostle therefore writes the Galatians this epistle in which
              he shows that with the coming of the grace of the New Testament,
              the Old Testament should be cast out, so that with the fulfillment
              of the truth, the figure may be abandoned, and with the attainment
              of these two, namely, grace and truth, one may arrive at the truth
              of justice and glory. And these two are acquired, if, abandoning
              the observance of the “ <i>legalia</i> ” [i.e., the ceremonial
              precepts of the Old Law], we concentrate fervently on observing
              the Gospel of Christ.

              As to the first, mention is made first of the person principally
              sending the greeting; and he is described by his name and his
              authority. By his name, indeed, when he says
              <b>Paul</b> which, because it means “humble,” accords with his
              humility. Hence it is said in 1 Corinthians (15:9): “I am the
              least of the apostles, who am not worthy to be called an apostle.”
              Furthermore, it accords with his office, because in another sense
              it means “the mouth of the trumpet,” in which the office of
              preaching is specially signified. “Lift up thy voice like a
              trumpet and announce to my people their sins” (Is 58:1). He is
              described by his authority, when he says, an apostle. Here two
              things are mentioned, namely, his authority and its source.
              Authority, because he says <b>apostle</b>, which is the same as
              “sent.”

              the Epistle to the Romans; in others he calls himself “apostle,”
              thereby showing his authority. The reason for this is that the
              Romans being proud, the Apostle, in order to induce them to
              humility, calls himself a servant as an example of humility. But
              to the Galatians, who were stupid and proud, he calls himself an
              apostle in order to break them down; hence he here sets forth his
              authority.

              The source [of his authority] in their opinion was in keeping with
              the fact that the Galatians had been so deceived by false teachers
              as to believe that the Apostle did not enjoy the same authority as
              the other apostles, as having neither been taught by Christ nor
              lived with Him, but sent by them as their minister. He therefore
              removes this opinion when he says,
              <b>not of men, neither by man</b>. For some had been sent by the
              whole college of apostles and disciples; hence, to show that he
              had not been sent by them, he says, <b>not of men</b>. Others had
              been sent by some particular apostle, as Paul now and then sent
              Luke and Titus. Therefore, to show that he had not been sent in
              that manner, he says, neither by man, i.e., not by any apostle in
              particular, but by the Holy Spirit, Who says: “Separate me Saul
              and Barnabas, for the work whereunto I have taken them “(Acts

              But because the true cause of the origin of this authority is
              Christ Jesus, he says,

              expressed when he says,
              <b>by Jesus Christ <i>and</i> God the Father</b>, can be taken
              with respect to the person of the Father and the person of the
              Son; and then God the Father is one person and Jesus Christ
              another. For the Blessed Apostle Paul was sent to preach by both,
              and indeed, by the whole Trinity, because the works of the Trinity
              are inseparable. Yet no mention is made of the person of the Holy
              Spirit, because, since there is a union and joining of two, by
              mentioning two persons, namely, Father and Son, the Holy Spirit
              too is understood. Or, the aforesaid distinction can be taken with
              respect to the assumed nature, i.e., the human, because according
              to the divine nature there is not a distinction between God the
              Father and Jesus Christ. In this sense, then, Paul was sent by God
              the Father as by the chief sender, and by Jesus Christ as by a
              minister. “For I say that Christ Jesus was minister of the
              circumcision” (Rom 15:8).

              But because the Galatians belittled the Apostle for having neither

              inasmuch as the latter is heavenly and spiritual, and the former
              temporal, Peter, who was called while Christ was yet in mortal
              flesh, appears in papal bulls on the left side, but Paul, who was
              called by Christ now glorified, is set on the right side.

              passed, came into Greece before the time of Alexander the Great.
              There some of the invaders remained in a certain district of
              Greece and intermarried with the Greeks. For this reason that
              province came to be called “Gallic Greece” and the inhabitants
              “Galatians,” as it were, “white.” But whereas the Greeks are
              natively intelligent, those Galatians were stupid and inconstant
              and slow to understand, as the indocile Gauls from whom they
              descended. This is why he later says,
              <b
                >O senseless Galatians, who hath bewitched you that you should
                not obey the truth?</b
              >
              (3:1). To these people, therefore, he writes this epistle, and
              they are the ones greeted.

              The goods he wishes them are twofold, but in them are included all
              spiritual goods. The first is grace, which is the beginning of the
              spiritual life, and to it is ascribed in a Gloss the remission of
              sins, which is first in the spiritual life. For no one can be in
              the true spiritual life, unless he first dies to sin. The second
              is peace, which is the settling down of the mind in its end, and
              which in a Gloss is said to be reconciliation with God. Thus in
              wishing them the beginning and the end of all spiritual goods, the
              Apostle includes, as it were, between the two extremes, the wish
              that every good come to them. “The Lord will give grace and glory”
              (Ps 83:12). “The grace of Our Lord Jesus Christ and the charity of
              God and the communication of the Holy Spirit be with you all” (2
              Cor 13:13).

              The cause and source of good is God the Father as originator,
              precisely as God, and the entire Trinity, the God of all through
              creation. “But Thou, O Father, governest it” (Wis 14:3). Hence he
              says,
              <b>from God the Father</b>. Again, the originator is the Lord
              Jesus Christ as minister; and this insofar as He is man. “For I
              say that Jesus Christ was a minister” (Rom 15:8). But that grace
              comes to us through Christ is plain from John (1:17): “Grace and
              truth came by Jesus Christ.” “Being justified freely by His grace”
              (Rom 3:24). Peace, too, comes to us through Him. “My peace I give
              unto you” (in. 14:27).

              The manner in which these goods are caused is also mentioned when
              he says,
              <b>who gave himself for our sins</b>. Here is mentioned, first of
              all, the efficient cause, which is the death of Christ. Referring
              to this, he says who gave
              <b>himself for our</b>
              sins. As if to say: Christ is the author of grace and peace,
              because He gave Himself to death and endured the cross. Hence the
              very death of Christ is the efficient cause of grace: “You have
              been justified freely by his grace” (Rom 3:24); “Making peace as
              to the things that are in heaven” (Col 1:20). And he says, first
              of all,
              <b>who gave himself</b>, i.e., offered Himself voluntarily.
              “Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered Himself for us” (Eph
              5:2); “That He might taste death for all” (Heb 2:9); “Who gave
              Himself for us” (Tit. 2:14). From this, the Apostle plainly is
              arguing against them that if the death of Christ is the sufficient
              cause of our salvation, and if grace is conferred in the
              sacraments of the New Testament, which have their efficacy from
              the passion of Christ, then it is superfluous to observe, along
              with the New Testament, the rituals of the Old Law in which grace
              is not conferred nor salvation acquired, because the Law has led
              no one to perfection, as is had in Hebrews (7:19).

              Secondly, the end and utility of those goods is mentioned—in other
              words, the final cause. And it is twofold; one is that we be set
              free of past sins; and as to this he says,
              <b>for our sins,</b>
              namely, that past sins be removed and atoned for, which is the
              beginning of our salvation. “He loved us and washed us from our
              sins in his own blood” (Rev 1:5). The other end is that He might
              free us from the power of death; and as to this he says,
              <b>that he might deliver us from this present wicked world.</b>
              “He delivered us from the power of darkness” (Col 1:13). Herein he
              mentions three things: namely, to deliver us from the present, and
              the
              <b>world,</b>
              and wicked. To deliver us from the present by drawing us to
              eternal things through desire and hope;
              <b>from the world,</b>
              i.e., from being conformed to this world which allures us: “And be
              not conformed to this world” (Rom 12:2);
              <b>wicked</b>, leading us back to the truth of justice. And it is
              called a wicked world, not because of its nature, for it was
              created good by God, but because of the evils perpetrated in it,
              as is said in Ephesians (5:16): “The days are evil.” And “Jacob
              said: the days of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty years,
              few and evil” (Gen 47:9).

              Word was God” (Jn 1:1). Also of our Father by adoption: “He gave
              them power to be made the sons of God: (Jn 1:12). In the first
              rendering,
              <b>God the Father</b>
              is taken for the sole person of the Father; in the second, for the
              whole Trinity. And because it is from God our Father, namely, from
              the whole Trinity, that all things come to us through Christ,
              therefore to it, i.e., to the whole Trinity, glory in itself,

              As to the first he does three things: First, he enlarges upon the

              Christ, and although I instructed you well, nevertheless you are
              <b>thus</b>, i.e., so far and so completely removed [transferred],
              that you seem already to have forgotten; <b>so soon</b>, i.e., in
              such a short time, are you removed [transferred]. With this word
              he alludes to their name, for Galatia means “transferred.” As if
              to say: You are Galatians, because you are so quickly transferred.

              Secondly, he amplifies their guilt on the part of that which they
              have abandoned. For if reason withdraws and is removed from evil,
              it is worthy of praise and does well; but when it departs from the
              good, it is culpable. And this is how they were removed from good.
              So he says to them: Although it is amazing that you are so quickly
              and so far removed, there is additional reason for wonder, namely,
              because you have removed yourselves
              <b>from him,</b> i.e., from God, and from faith in Him
              <b>that called you into the grace of Christ,</b>
              i.e., into the sharing of the eternal good which we have through
              Christ: “Giving thanks to God who hath called you into his
              marvelous light” (1 Pet. 2:9). Again: “For it had been better for
              them not to have known the way of justice than, after they have
              known it, to turn back from that holy commandment which was
              delivered to them” (2 Pet. 2:21).

              Tertio aggravat eorum culpam ex eo ad quod conversi sunt, quia non
              sunt conversi ad bonum, sed ad malum. Unde dicit
              <i>in aliud Evangelium</i>, id est, veteris legis, quae
              Annuntiatio bona est inquantum annuntiat quaedam bona, scilicet
              temporalia et carnalia. Is. I, 9:
              <i>si volueritis et audieritis me</i>, et cetera. Sed tamen non
              est perfecta et simpliciter, sicut Evangelium; quia non annuntiat
              perfecta et maxima bona, sed parva et minima. Sed lex nova est
              perfecte et simpliciter Evangelium, id est, bona Annuntiatio, quia
              annuntiat maxima bona, scilicet caelestia, spiritualia et aeterna.
              Et licet sit aliud Evangelium secundum traditionem pseudo, tamen
              secundum meam praedicationem non. Est enim aliud in promissis, sed
              non est aliud in figura, quia idem continetur in veteri testamento
              et in novo: in veteri quidem ut in figura, in novo vero ut in re
              et expresse. Et sic est aliud Evangelium quantum ad ea quae
              exterius apparent, sed quantum ad ea quae interius sunt et
              continentur, non est aliud.

              Thirdly, he amplifies their guilt on the part of that to which
              they have turned, because they have been turned not to good but to
              evil. Hence he says,
              <b>unto another gospel</b>, i.e., of the Old Law, which is a good
              message only insofar as it does announce some good things, namely,
              temporal and carnal: “If you be willing and will hearken to me,
              you shall eat the good things of the land” (Is 1:19). Yet it is
              not completely perfect as is the Gospel, because it does not
              announce the perfect and loftiest goods, but small and slight
              ones. But the New Law is perfectly and in the full sense a Gospel,
              i.e., a good message, because it announces the greatest goods,
              namely, heavenly, spiritual and eternal. And although it is
              another gospel according to the tradition of the deceivers, yet
              according to my preaching it is not. For it is different in the
              promises, but not in the figure, because the same thing is
              contained in the Old Testament and in the New: in the Old, indeed,
              as in a figure, but in the New as in the express reality.
              Therefore it is another gospel if you consider the outward
              appearances; but as to the things that are contained and exist
              within, it is not another gospel.

              Licet autem non sit aliud in se, tamen potest esse aliud ex culpa

              Yet though it is not in itself another gospel, it can be another,
              if you consider the guilt of the others, i.e., of the deceivers.
              Hence in enlarging upon the guilt of the latter he says,
              <b>only there are some,</b>
              namely, the seducers,
              <b>that trouble you,</b> i.e., sully the purity of your
              understanding with which you were imbued with the truth of faith.
              Because although the same thing is contained, so far as the inward
              understanding is concerned, in the Old and New Testament, as has
              been said, yet if the Old is embraced after accepting the New,
              that is seen to show that the New is not perfect, and that the one
              is different from the other. Hence he says,
              <b>which is not another, only there are some that trouble</b>
              you, because those deceivers were compelling them to be
              circumcised after professing faith in the Gospel, showing thereby
              that circumcision is something different from Baptism and does
              something that Baptism cannot do, and for that reason they are
              troubling you.
              <b>I would that they were even cut off who trouble you</b>

              i.e., the truth of the Gospel teaching, into the figure of the
              Law—which is absurd and the greatest of troubles. For a thing
              ought to be converted into that to which it is ordained. But the
              New Testament and the Gospel of Christ are not ordained to the

              not the truth into the figure, or the Gospel of Christ into the
              Old Law. This is plain from the way we ordinarily speak; for we do

              that the image resembles the man: “They shall be turned to thee

              Ad evidentiam autem dictorum tria inquirere oportet. Primo quid
              significat hoc nomen, anathema. Circa quod sciendum est, quod
              anathema est nomen Graecum, et componitur ab ana, quod est sursum,
              et thesis, positio, quasi sursum positio. Et est ortum ex quadam
              antiqua consuetudine. Antiqui enim quando pugnabant, capiebant
              aliquando aliquam praedam ab hostibus, quam nolebant convertere in
              usum proprium, sed suspendebant illam in templis, vel in aliquo
              loco publico civitatis, quasi separatam a communi usu hominum, et
              omne tale sic suspensum nominabant Graeci anathema; et ex hoc
              inolevit consuetudo, quod omne illud quod excludebatur ab usu
              communi, diceretur anathematizatum. Unde dicitur Iosue VI, 17 de
              Iericho et omnibus quae in ea sunt, quod Iosue mox anathematizavit
              ea. Et ideo etiam hoc in Ecclesia inolevit, ut illi qui
              excluduntur a communi societate Ecclesiae, et a participatione
              sacramentorum Ecclesiae, dicantur anathematizati.

              To elucidate the foregoing, three things should be investigated.
              First, the meaning of this word,
              <b>anathema</b>. Apropos of this it should be noted that
              <i>anathema</i>
              is a Greek word composed of
              <i>ana</i>, which means
              <i>above,</i>
              and
              <i>thesis,</i>
              i.e.,
              <i>a placing;</i>
              hence a
              <i>placing above.</i>
              The word arose from an old custom. For the ancients, when they
              waged war, sometimes took from their enemies certain booty which
              they were unwilling to turn to their own use, but hung it in the
              temple or other public place of the city, as though to separate it
              from the common use of men. Everything so hung up, the Greeks
              called
              <i>anathema.</i>
              And from this arose the custom of declaring anathematized anything
              excluded from common use. Hence in Joshua (6:17) it is said of
              Jericho and of everything in it, that Joshua once anathematized
              it. Consequently, even in the Church the practice arose of
              declaring anathema those who are excluded from the common society
              of the Church and from partaking of the sacraments of the Church.

              Secundo inquirenda est ratio eorum, quae dicit
              <i>licet nos aut Angelus</i>, et cetera. Ubi sciendum est, quod
              est triplex doctrina. Prima est philosophorum, qui ex ductu
              rationis propriae in cognitionem suae doctrinae devenerunt.
              Quaedam alia doctrina est, quae est tradita per Angelos, sicut lex
              vetus. Lex enim non est allata voluntate humana (sicut dicitur ad
              Gal. III, 19), sed per Angelos in manu mediatoris, ut dicitur
              infra III, v. 19. Quaedam vero doctrina tradita est a Deo
              immediate, sicut doctrina Evangelii. Io. c. I, 18:
              <i>Deum nemo vidit unquam</i>, et cetera. Ad Hebr. I, 2:
              <i>novissime diebus istis locutus est nobis in filio</i>. Et post:
              <i>quae cum initium accepisset</i>, et cetera. Doctrina ergo quae
              traditur per hominem potest mutari et revocari per alium hominem
              qui melius novit, sicut unus philosophus reprobat dicta alterius;
              item per Angelum qui perspicacius videt veritatem.

            <td>
              Secondly, we must look for an explanation of his statement,
              <b
                >though we, or an angel from heaven, preach a gospel to you
                besides that which we have preached to you, let him be
                anathema.</b
              >
              Here it should be noted that there are three kinds of teachings:
              the first is that of the philosophers who have arrived at a
              knowledge of their doctrine with their own reason guiding them.
              Another is that which has been delivered by angels, as the Old
              Law. For the Old Law was not issued by a human will but by angels
              in the hand of a mediator (Gal. 3:19). But the third teaching was
              given immediately by God Himself, as the teaching of the Gospel:
              “No man has seen God at any time; the only begotten Son who is in
              the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him” (in. 1:18); “In
              these days [He] hath spoken to us by his Son” (Heb 1:2); “Which,
              having begun to be declared by the Lord, was confirmed unto us by
              them that heard him” (Heb 2:3).

              Doctrina etiam quae traditur per Angelum posset forte removeri per
              alium Angelum superiorem, seu per Deum. Sed contra doctrina quae
              immediate a Deo traditur, non potest neque per hominem, neque per
              Angelum irritari. Et ideo si contingat quod homo vel Angelus
              diceret contrarium illi quae per Deum tradita est, dictum suum non
              est contra doctrinam, ut per hoc irritetur et repellatur, sed
              potius doctrina est contra eum, quia ipse qui dicit, debet excludi
              et repelli a communione illius doctrinae. Et ideo dicit apostolus
              quod dignitas doctrinae evangelicae, quae est immediate a Deo
              tradita, est tantae dignitatis, quod sive homo, sive Angelus
              evangelizet aliud praeter id, quod in ea evangelizatum est, est
              anathema, id est, abiiciendus et repellendus est.
            </td>
            <td>
              Now, a teaching passed on by a man can be changed and revoked by
              another man who knows better, as one philosopher refutes the
              sayings of another, or by an angel who has a more penetrating
              knowledge of the truth. Even a teaching handed down by one angel
              could be supplanted by that of a higher angel or by God. But a
              teaching that comes directly from God can be nullified neither by
              man nor angel. Hence if a man or an angel were to state anything
              contrary to what has been taught by God, such a statement would
              not contradict God’s teaching, so as to void or destroy it;
              rather, God’s teaching would be against him, because one who
              speaks thus should be expelled and prevented from sharing his
              teaching. Hence the Apostle says that the dignity of the Gospel
              teaching, which has come directly from God, is so great that if a
              man or even an angel preached another Gospel besides that which he
              has preached among them, be is anathema, i.e., must be rejected
              and expelled.

              Tertio solvere oportet obiectiones quae circa hoc occurrunt.
              Quarum una est,
              <i>cum par in parem non habeat imperium</i>, et multo magis non
              habeat in superiorem, videtur quod apostolus non potuit
              excommunicare apostolos qui erant sibi pares, et minus Angelos qui
              sunt superiores. Matth. XI, v. 11:
              <i>qui minor est in regno caelorum, maior est illo</i>. Non est
              ergo anathema per hoc. Ad hoc dicendum est, quod apostolus hanc
              protulit sententiam, non propria auctoritate, sed auctoritate
              evangelicae doctrinae, cuius minister erat, cuius doctrinae
              auctoritas habet, ut quicumque contra illam dicunt, excludendi et
              repellendi sint. Io. X:
              <i>sermo quem locutus sum, ille iudicabit eum in novissimo die</i
              >, et cetera.
            </td>
            <td>
              Thirdly, we must solve the objections which arise on this point.
              The first is that, since an equal has no authority over his peers
              and much less over his superiors, it seems that the Apostle has no
              power to excommunicate the apostles, who are his peers, and less
              so, angels who are superior. “He that is the lesser in the kingdom
              of heaven is greater than he” (Matt. 11:11). Therefore the
              anathema is invalid. The answer to this is that the Apostle passed
              this sentence not on his own authority, but on the authority of
              the Gospel teaching, of which he was the minister, and the
              authority of which teaches that whoever says aught contrary to it
              must be expelled and cast out. “The word that I have spoken, the
              same shall judge him in the last day” (in. 14:48).

              Alia quaestio est, quia ipse dicit,
              <i>praeterquam quod evangelizatum est</i>. Ergo non debet aliquis
              docere, neque praedicare, nisi quod scribitur in epistolis et in
              Evangelio. Sed hoc est falsum, quia I Thess. III, 10 dicitur:
              <i>ut compleamus ea quae desunt fidei nostrae</i>, et cetera.
              Respondeo. Dicendum quod nihil aliud evangelizandum est, quam
              illud quod continetur in Evangeliis, et in epistolis, et in sacra
              Scriptura implicite vel explicite. Nam sacra Scriptura et
              Evangelium evangelizat esse credendum Christo explicite. Unde
              quidquid continetur in eis implicite, quod facit ad doctrinam
              eius, et ad fidem Christi, evangelizari et doceri potest. Et ideo
              cum dicit <i>praeter id</i>, etc., id est, omnino alienum addendo.
              Apoc. ult.: <i>si quis apposuerit ad haec, aut addiderit</i>,
              scilicet omnino alienum,
              <i>apponat Deus super illum plagas scriptas in libro isto</i>. Et
              Deut. IV: <i>non addetis quidquam</i>, etc., scilicet contrarium
              seu alienum, <i>nec minuetis</i>, et cetera.

            <td>
              A second question arises from the words,
              <b>a gospel besides that which we have preached to you</b>.
              Therefore no one may teach or preach anything but what is written
              in the epistles and Gospels. But this is false, because it is said
              in 1 Thessalonians (3:10): “Praying that we may accomplish those
              things that are wanting to your faith.” I answer that nothing is
              to be taught except what is contained, either implicitly or
              explicitly, in the Gospels and epistles and Sacred Scripture. For
              Sacred Scripture and the Gospels announce that Christ must be
              believed explicitly. Hence whatever is contained therein
              implicitly and fosters its teaching and faith in Christ can be
              preached and taught. Therefore, when he says,
              <b>besides that which you have received</b>, he means by adding
              something completely alien: “If any, man shall add to these
              things, God shall add unto him the plagues written in this book”
              (Rev 22:18). And “Neither add anything,” i.e., contrary or alien,
              “nor diminish” (Deut 12:32).

              Now it may be asked whether all heretics are thereby
              excommunicated. And it seems not, because it is said: “A man that
              is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid” (Tit.
              3:10). I answer that a person might be called a heretic either
              because he errs solely from ignorance, and then he is not on that
              account excommunicated; or because he errs through obstinacy and
              tries to subvert others, and then he falls under the canon of the
              sentence passed. But whether he was then and there passing
              sentence on heretics by these words is open to question, since
              sentence was later passed against heretics in the Councils. Yet it
              can be said that perhaps he was showing that they deserved to be

              <b>persuade men</b>, i.e., is it my intention to please men
              <b>or God</b>
              ? As if to say: The things I do, I do to please God alone: “We
              speak, not as pleasing men, but God” (1 Thes 2:4); nor do we speak
              on the authority of men, but of God. That I do not seek to please
              men is plain from my intention and purpose. For
              <b>I do not seek to please men</b>, i.e., it is not my intention
              in converting men to please men alone, but for the honor of God.
              And this is plain, because if I yet sought to please men, as I
              formerly pleased them,
              <b>I should not be the servant of Christ.</b>
              The reason is that the two are opposed. More precisely, if I were
              to please men for the sake of men without referring it to God; for
              if I intend now and then to please men so that I might draw them
              to God, I do not sin. But if in the first way, I am not the
              servant of Christ: “For the bed is straitened, so that one must
              fall out, and a short covering cannot cover both” (Is 28:20); “No
              man can serve two masters. For either he will hate the one and
              love the other; or he will sustain the one and despise the other”
              (Mt 6:24); “They have been confounded that please men (Ps 52:6).

              <b>For I give you to understand, brethren</b>... As if to say: So

              there is among you envying and contention, are you not carnal, and
              walk according to man?” (1 Cor 3:3). And this is the sense the

              say: Not at all can this Gospel be had from men but from God.

              not receive from man the authority to preach. As to this he says,
              <b>nor of man</b>, i.e., purely man, <b>did I receive it</b>,
              i.e., the authority to preach the Gospel, but of Christ: “And how
              shall they preach unless they be sent?” (Rom 10:15); “1 have given
              thee for a light of the Gentiles, for a covenant of the people”
              (Is 42:6); “This man is to me a vessel of election, to carry my
              name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel”
              (Acts 9:15). Secondly, that he did not receive the science of the
              Gospel from man. Hence he says, <b>nor did I learn it</b>, namely,
              the Gospel, from mere man,
              <b>but by the revelation of Jesus Christ,</b>
              i.e., by Jesus Christ showing everything clearly. “But to us, God
              hath revealed them” (1 Cor 2:10); “The Lord hath opened my ear,
              and I do not resist” (Is 50:5), and “The Lord has given me a
              learned tongue, that I should know how to uphold by word him that
              is weary” (Is 50:4). Now this revelation was made to the Apostle
              when he was rapt into paradise, where “he heard secret words which
              it is not granted to man to utter” (2 Cor 12:4).

              it by the rulers, but he urged even them: “Saul, as yet breathing
              out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord,
              went to the high priest” (Ac 9:1). Also because he did this not

              But a question arises from the fact that the aforesaid Gloss says:
              “The good fathers added.” For it seems that they were not good,
              because, it is said in Deuteronomy (4:2): “You shall not add to
              the word I speak to You. “ Hence in adding traditions they acted
              against the command of God and so were not good. To this one may
              answer that this word of the Lord is taken to mean that you shall
              not add anything contrary or alien to the words which I shall
              speak. But to add certain things not contrary was lawful for them,
              namely, certain solemn days and the like, as was done in the time
              of Mordochai and of Judith, in memory of the blessings they
              received from God.

              It is indeed true to say that God separates one from the womb,
              even though it is a work of nature, which is, as it were, an
              instrument of God, because even our own works are attributed to

              works for us” (Is 26:12), as any effect is attributed to the
              principal agent; hence Job (10:11): “Thou hast clothed me with
              skin and flesh.” And he was separated from this womb to be
              justified, for the same one justifies who makes: “From my mother’s
              womb thou art my God” (Ps 21:11). Or:
              <b>from my mother’s womb</b>, i.e., the synagogue, whose womb is
              the college of Pharisees who trained him in Judaism: “You go round
              about the sea and the land to make one proselyte” (Mt 23:15).
              Thus, therefore, was the synagogue his mother: “The sons of my
              mother have fought against me” (Cant 1:5). Its womb are the
              Pharisees. And from this womb he was separated by the Holy Spirit
              unto faith in the Gospel: “Separated unto the Gospel of God” (Rom

              Now as regards the other cause, he says,
              <b>and called me by his grace</b>. But there are two kinds of
              call. One is exterior, and so he, says: He called me with a voice
              from heaven. “Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me... Go into the
              city, and there it shall be told thee what thou must do” (Acts
              9:4). In a similar fashion He called the other apostles. The other
              call is interior, and in this way He calls through a certain
              interior instinct, whereby God touches the heart to be turned to
              Him, as when He calls one from the path of evil to good; and this
              by His grace and not our own merits: “And whom he predestinated,
              them he also called. And whom he called, them he also justified”
              (Rom 8:30); “1 have raised him up to justice” (Is 45:13); “That
              calleth the waters of the sea and poureth them out upon the face

              The end of his conversion is stated when he says,
              <b>to reveal his Son in</b>
              me. Hence Christ is the end. Now his conversion is ordained to
              Christ in two ways: First of all, by his works. Hence he says, to
              reveal his Son, i.e., by what He did in my regard, by converting
              me and forgiving my sins, He revealed what a great act of mercy
              was bestowed on me: “Jesus Christ came into this world to save
              sinners, of whom I am the chief” (1 Tim 1:15); “But I obtained the
              mercy of God, because I did it ignorantly in unbelief” (1 Tim
              1:13). Thus, therefore, in his conversion he revealed His Son in
              the sense that the Son is called the grace of God. Likewise, he
              revealed Him in his action; hence he says: “For I dare not speak
              of any of those things which Christ worketh not by me, for the
              obedience of the Gentiles by word and deed, by virtue of signs and
              wonders” (Rom 15:18). And this inasmuch as the Son is the power
              [virtue] of God. Furthermore, he revealed Him in his preaching.
              Hence he said: “We preach Christ crucified; unto the Jews indeed a
              stumbling-block, and unto the Gentiles foolishness, but unto them
              that are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God
              and the wisdom of God” (1 Cor 1:23). And this inasmuch as the Son
              is called the wisdom of God.

              because, whereas the other apostles preached the Gospel of Christ
              to the Jews, Paul, on the Lords command, went to convert the
              Gentiles: “It is a small thing that thou shouldst be my servant,
              to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to convert the dregs of
              Israel. Behold, I have given thee to be the light of the Gentiles”

              “Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, for a

              The manner of his conversion is perfect, both as to its
              effect—hence he says,
              <b>immediately I condescended not to flesh and blood</b>, i.e., at
              once I was so completely converted that all carnal affection left
              me: “It is easy in the eyes of God on a sudden to make the poor
              man rich” (Sir 11:23).
              <b>Flesh and blood</b>
              are here taken for vices of the flesh: “Flesh and blood cannot
              possess the kingdom of God” (1 Cor 15:50).
              <b>For the flesh lusteth against the spirit</b>
              (5:17)—or for the affection and love borne toward blood relatives.
              “Flesh and blood hath not revealed it to thee” (Mt 16:17). Thus
              the Apostle overcame his own vices and scorned his fellow Jews.
              Furthermore, his conversion was perfect with respect to his
              understanding, because he was so instructed by Christ that there
              was no need to be instructed by the apostles; hence he says,
              Neither went I to Jerusalem, i.e., to be instructed by them.

              awaited; but seven is the number of the Old Testament, because it
              celebrates the seventh day. And so he stayed with Peter fifteen
              days, conversing with him on the mysteries of the Old and New
              Testament. But lest anyone suppose that, although he was not
              instructed by Peter, he might have been instructed by others, he
              adds that he was not instructed by others. Hence he says,
              <b>But other of the apostles,</b> by whom I might be instructed, I
              saw none, i.e., no one,
              <b>saving James, the brother of the Lord.</b> For I saw him in
              Jerusalem.

              Regarding James, it should be known that he was the Bishop of
              Jerusalem and named James the Less, because he had been called
              after another James. Many things are recorded of him in Acts
              (15:13 ff). He also wrote a canonical epistle. Now there are
              various explanations why he is called the brother of the Lord.
              Elvidius says that it was because he was the son of the Blessed
              Virgin. For according to him, the Blessed Virgin conceived and
              gave birth to Christ, and after the birth of Christ she conceived
              of Joseph and brought forth other sons. But this error is
              condemned and refuted. Furthermore, it is false for the simple
              reason that James was not the son of Joseph but of Alpheus.

              Others say that before the Blessed Virgin, Joseph had another wife

              he took unto wife the Blessed Virgin, from whom Christ was born,
              although she was not known by Joseph, but, as it is said in the
              Gospel, He was conceived by the Holy Spirit. But because progeny
              are named after their father, and Joseph was considered the father
              of Christ, for that reason, James, too, although he was not the
              son of the Virgin, was nevertheless called the brother of the
              Lord. But this is false, because if the Lord did not want as
              mother anyone but a virgin entrusted to the care of a virgin, how
              would He have allowed her husband not to be a virgin and still

              But this opinion is denied on two counts by Jerome: first of all,
              because Salome is not a man’s name, as is plain in Greek, but the
              name of the woman who was the sister of the Blessed Virgin and who
              begot James the Great and John, of Zebedee, just as Mary Cleophas
              begot James the Less, Jude and Simon, of Alpheus. Now this James
              is singled out from his other brothers and called the brother of
              the Lord for two reasons: first, because of a likeness in
              appearance, for he had a facial resemblance to Christ; and because
              of a likeness in their lives, for he imitated the manners of
              Christ. Or he is called the brother of Christ, because Alpheus,
              his father, was related to Joseph. Accordingly, because the Jews
              were accustomed to draw up the lines of ancestry on the father’s
              side, and Christ was considered the son of Joseph, as is said in
              Luke (3:23), he, rather than the others, was called the brother of
              the Lord, because they were related to him only on His mother’s
              side.

              Furthermore, “brother” is taken here in the sense of kinsman. For
              in the Scriptures some are called brothers, who are so by nature:
              “Jacob begot Judas and his brethren” (Mt 1:2). Others, who are
              kinsmen, such as blood relations, are brothers: “Let there be no
              quarrel, I beseech thee, between me and thee... for we are
              brethren” (Gen 13:8). Others who are so by race; hence all who

              man of another nation king, that is not thy brother” (Deut 17:15).
              Others who are so by affection; hence all who are friends and who
              have the same love are called brothers: “Because I found not Titus
              my brother” (2 Cor 2:13). Others who are so by religion; hence all
              Christians who have one rule of life are called brothers: “For one
              is your master; and all you are brethren” (Mt 23:8); “Behold how
              good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in
              unity” (Ps 132:1). And in general, all men are called brothers,
              because they are ruled and protected by one God: “Have we not all
              one father?” (Mal 2:10).

                Barnabas, taking Titus also with me. 2 And I went up according
                to revelation and communicated to them the Gospel which I preach
                among the Gentiles; but apart to them who seemed to be
                something, lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain. 3 But
                neither Titus, who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled
                to be circumcised, 4 But because of false brethren, unawares
                brought in, who came in privately to spy our liberty which we
                have in Christ Jesus, that they might bring us into servitude. 5
                To whom we yielded not by subjection, no, not for an hour, that
                the truth of the gospel might continue with you.

              With respect to the first he touches upon four things: first the
              time, then the place, the witnesses, and the motive. He mentions
              the time when he says,
              <b>Then, after fourteen years</b>. Here some might object that if
              the Apostle was converted in the first year after the passion of
              Christ, and went to Jerusalem three years later, that makes four
              years. But he says, <b>after fourteen years</b> I went once more
              to Jerusalem—which makes a total of eighteen years—at which time
              he found Peter in Jerusalem. But this cannot be, because Peter had
              his See at Antioch seven years, and then at Rome for twenty-five
              years. So that makes eighteen plus seven, i.e., twenty-five years,
              before he went to Rome, and twenty-five years more he remained
              there. Hence Peter would have lived for fifty years after the
              passion of Christ—which is false, for in the fortieth year after
              the passion of Christ, Peter was martyred at Rome in the reign of
              Nero, as is recorded in history.

              Respondeo. Dicendum, quod cum dicitur

              iterum elapsi sint quatuordecim anni, antequam iret in Ierusalem,

              rexit Ecclesiam Antiochenam, quia ante istos annos incepit regere.
              Et cum Antiochia sit prope Ierusalem, potuit esse ut aliquando
              Petrus ivisset in Ierusalem, et tunc Paulus invenerit eum ibi. Et
              sic colligitur ex historia, quod post annos quatuordecim Petrus
              venit Romam tempore Claudii imperatoris, et existens ibi viginti
              quinque annis, complevit numerum triginta novem annorum, et

              I answer that when he says,
              <b>Then, after fourteen years,</b> it is not to be understood that
              after three years there was another lapse of fourteen years before
              he went to Jerusalem, but that he went again in the fourteenth
              year of his conversion. Nor should the seven years that Peter
              ruled the Church at Antioch be added to those fourteen years,
              because he began his rule before those years. Furthermore, since
              Antioch is near Jerusalem, Peter could at times have come to
              Jerusalem and Paul found him there then. Consequently, what is
              gathered from history is that after fourteen years Peter went to
              Rome in the reign of Claudius the Emperor and lived there for
              twenty-five years, making a total of thirty-nine years, and he
              died in the fortieth year after the passion of Our Lord. Yet he
              purposely said <b>fourteen</b> in order to show that he did not
              need instructions from the apostles, if he went for fourteen years
              without them.

              were to say the contrary, I would not believe him, as is plain
              above (1:8). But I conferred for two reasons: namely, to show the
              unity of my teaching with that of the other apostles: “That you
              all speak the same thing and that there be no schisms among you”
              (1 Cor 1:10). Hence he conferred with them as one having the same
              word as they, and not as an adversary. Also, to avoid false
              accusation from others. For the Apostle had not lived with Christ
              or been taught by the apostles, but immediately after his
              conversion began to preach things odious to the Jews, especially
              the vocation of the Gentiles and that they should not observe the
              justifications of the Law. So, then, he conferred about the
              Gospel.

              his teachings about the Law. Hence, in order that the truth might
              prevail over false charges, he spoke apart with those who would

              a Ierusalem usque in Illyricum, et usque in Hispaniam praedicavit
              Evangelium. Unde posset dici de eo illud Ps. CXLVII, 15:
              <i>velociter currit sermo eius</i>, etc.; II Thess. III, 1:
              <i>fratres, orate pro nobis, ut sermo domini currat</i>, et
              cetera. Sed numquid dubitabat quod in vacuum curreret? Dicendum
              est quod sibi non dubitabat, sed illis quibus praedicaverat, quia
              nisi ab illis firmiter teneretur sua doctrina, quantum ad illos in
              vacuum cucurrisset; et ideo voluit conferre cum eis, ut dum
              scirent auditores, quod doctrina sua concordaret cum doctrina
              aliorum apostolorum, et approbaretur ab eis, firmius eius
              doctrinam tenerent, et sic quantum ad eos non in vanum curreret. I

              Then follows the cause, which was
              <b>lest perhaps I should run or had run in vain</b>, i.e., lest I
              be thought to have preached to no purpose. He calls his preaching
              a “running” on account of the rapidity of his teaching, for in a
              short time be preached the Gospel from Jerusalem to Illyricum and
              even as far as Spain. Hence the word of Psalm (147:15) can be said
              of him: “His word runneth swiftly”; “Pray, brethren, that the word
              of God may run and may be glorified, even as among you (2 Thes 3:
              1). But did he really wonder whether he was running in vain? I
              answer that he did not wonder for himself, but for those to whom
              he had preached, because if his teaching was not firmly held by
              them, he would have run in vain as far as they were concerned. So
              he wanted to confer with them, in order that when his hearers
              heard that his teaching was in agreement with that of the other
              apostles and approved by them, they would hold to it more
              firmly—then he would not be running in vain with respect to them:
              “I therefore so run, not as at an uncertainty” (1 Cor 9:26).

              He says, therefore: I say that the result of my discussion with
              them about the teaching of the Gospel was that my teaching and
              opinion remained unaltered concerning the non-observance of
              legalism, i.e., the Gentiles would not be compelled to observe the
              rites of the Law so that
              <b
                >neither Titus who was with me, being a Gentile, was compelled
                to be circumcised,</b
              >
              but was admitted uncircumcised into their fellowship by the
              apostles. This discussion occasioned the decree handed down by the
              apostles on not observing the rites of the law, as is had in Acts
              (15:28). The reason why these rites were not to be observed after
              the passion of Christ is assigned in the following way by
              Chrysostom: “For it is evident that the instrument drawn up for
              any promise or pact binds only until the pact and promise are
              fulfilled; but when fulfilled, the instrument no longer binds on
              that point.” Now circumcision is an instrument of the promise and
              pact between God and believing men. Hence it was that Abraham
              underwent circumcision as a sign of the promise, as is said in
              Genesis (11:26). And because the promise was fulfilled and the
              pact completed by the passion of Christ, neither the pact holds
              after the passion nor is circumcision of any value. Thus,
              therefore, his refusal to permit Titus to be circumcised makes it
              plain that he did not depart from his teaching.

              scilicet servaretur vel non; sed modo cum ageretur de Tito, erat

              he shows that he did not change on any other point. This passage
              is obscure and variant readings are found. It should be read thus:
              You say that you did not permit Titus to be circumcised; but why?
              seeing that in another case you permitted Timothy, as is read in
              Acts (16:3). To this the Apostle can respond that when Timothy was
              circumcised, it was an indifferent matter whether circumcision was
              observed or not; but later on, when it came to Titus, circumcision
              became a matter of paramount importance and I said that it is not
              to be observed. Hence, if I had allowed him to be circumcised,
              whereas I had already settled the question definitively myself, I
              would have been acting to the contrary. Furthermore, it was not
              lawful to raise this question again or to make difficulties about
              a matter now settled.

              Ambrose, however, reads it another way. For according to the
              foregoing the reason he did not yield for the moment was on
              account of those brought in. From this it follows that if they had
              not been brought in, he would have yielded in the matter of
              observing legalism. Therefore it was not on that account, because
              on that account he would not have yielded to them, but on account
              of the truth itself. Therefore, says Ambrose, the text is faulty
              and the words,
              <b>no not even</b>, are superfluous. Hence he would have it that
              those words should not be there. And then the sense is: I did not
              permit Titus to be circumcised, but Timothy I did,
              <b>because of false brethren, unawares brought in</b>, i.e., to
              the place where I was with Timothy and the others
              <b>who were brought in to spy our liberty</b>. But when they
              failed in this, they tried to incite the people to rise up against
              us. <b>To whom</b>, i.e., to the false brethren, we therefore
              <b>yielded in the hour of subjection</b>
              in the matter of circumcision by circumcising Timothy, in order
              that the truth of the gospel might continue with you, i.e., the
              Gospel which teaches that neither circumcision nor uncircumcision
              profits anything, but the faith.

              Their status he describes from three standpoints: first from the
              authority they held in the Church, for it was great. Regarding it
              he says,
              <b>But of them who seemed to be some thing.</b> The text is
              deficient and should be amended to read, “But of them,” namely,
              Peter and John. As if to say: Although I would have yielded to
              them at the time, yet I received from them no new power or
              teaching. And if I received nothing from them, much less so from
              others. But it is to be noted that if his statement,
              <b>who seemed to be something</b>, is understood with reference to
              the grace of God that was in them, it is true that in this respect
              they were great, because “whom he justified, them he also
              glorified,” as is said in Romans (8:30). However, if it is
              understood that they were something according to themselves, then
              it is false, because in that respect they were nothing. For if
              they seemed to be some thing according to themselves, they would
              always have been great, because whatever belongs to a thing
              according to itself is always present. Hence, since they were not
              always great, it was not according to themselves that they were
              seen to be something.

              Secundo describit eorum conditionem ex statu eorum ante
              conversionem, quam habuerunt in synagoga. Et hunc statum caute
              ostendit fuisse abiectum et vilem. Unde dicit
              <i>quales aliquando fuerint</i>, quia rustici, pauperes, idiotae,
              et sine litteris erant. I Cor. I, 26:
              <i>non multi sapientes secundum carnem</i>, et cetera. Sed quales
              fuerint <i>nihil</i>, id est non, <i>mea interest</i>, scilicet
              referre. Et hoc forte introducit, ut considerantes statum quem
              illi habuerunt in synagoga (qui nullus fuit) et statum Pauli (qui
              magnus fuit), manifeste cognoscant quod Paulus in sententia
              quantum ad legalia sit eis praeferendus, et praesertim cum Paulus
              in statu Ecclesiae Christi eis aequaretur, ita quod Paulus eos in
              statu synagogae ante conversionem praecedebat, in statu post
              conversionem eis aequalis erat. Unde cum agebatur de synagoga,
              magis erat standum sententiae Pauli, quam aliorum; sed cum de
              Evangelio ageretur, standum erat sententiae suae sicut sententiae
              aliorum. Et sicut alii non erant magni per legalia, sed per
              Christum, sic et apostolus per Christum magnus erat in fide, et
              non per legalia.

              Secondly, he describes their status on the side of what they were
              before their conversion, i.e., the status they had in the
              synagogue. This status, he hints gently, was mean and lowly. Hence
              he says,
              <b>what they were some time</b>; for they had been coarse, poor,
              ignorant and unlettered: “There are not many wise according to the
              flesh, not many mighty, not many noble” (1 Cor 1:26).
              <b>But what they were is nothing to me,</b> i.e., it is not my
              concern to mention. Perhaps his reason for introducing this was
              that by considering the status they had in the synagogue—which was
              nothing—and the status of Paul—which was great—they might see that
              Paul’s opinion on legalism should be preferred to theirs,
              particularly since Paul has an equal status with them in the
              Church; so that Paul had a higher rank in the synagogue before
              their conversion, but after the conversion, he had a rank equal to
              theirs. Hence when matters concerning the synagogue were
              discussed, the opinion of Paul deserved to prevail over the
              others, but when it came to the Gospel, his opinion was as good as
              theirs. And just as the others were not made great through things
              pertaining to the Law but through Christ, so too in the faith the
              Apostle was great through Christ and not through things pertaining
              to the Law.

              Thirdly, he describes their condition by reason of their election
              by God. Regarding this he says,
              <b>God accepteth not the person.</b> As if to say: They are great
              because God made them great, not by regarding their merits or
              demerits, but by regarding what He intended to accomplish. Hence
              he says:
              <b>God accepteth not the person of man,</b>
              i.e., he does not consider whether the person is great or little:
              “For he made the little and the great, and he hath equally care of
              all” (Wis 6:8). Furthermore, without regard to person, He calls
              everyone to salvation, no longer charging them with their sins for
              they have passed away: “The old things are passed away” (2 Cor
              5:17); “Nor will I be mindful of their name” (Ps 15:5). Therefore
              Peter says: “In very deed I perceive that God is not a respecter
              of persons” (Acts 10:34).

              Circa hoc sciendum est, quod accipere personam proprie est in

              vero conditio personae facit ad negotium, sic considerando illam

              ergo est proprie accipere personam, quam considerare conditionem
              personae, nil facientem ad negotium. Cum ergo Deus in operibus
              suis et beneficiis nihil praeexistens ex parte creaturae
              respiciat, quia ipsum, quod est creaturae, est effectus suae

              voluntatis suae secundum quam omnia operatur, et non secundum
              aliquam conditionem personae, ut dicitur Ephes. IV, 7, manifestum
              est quod non accipit personam hominis.

            <td>
              On this point it should be noted that accepting of persons in any
              transaction is, properly speaking, to take as a deciding factor in
              that transaction some aspect of the person that has nothing to do
              with the matter; for example, when I give a benefice to a person
              just because he is a noble or is handsome. For nobility or beauty
              have nothing to do with the question of getting a benefice. But if
              some aspect of the person does have something to do with the
              matter, then if I consider that aspect in settling the matter, I
              do not accept the person; for example, if I give a benefice to a
              person because he is good and will serve the Church well, or
              because he is well-educated and honorable, I am not an acceptor of
              persons. Therefore to accept the person is nothing other than to
              consider some aspect of the person that has no relation to the
              business. Hence, since God in His works and benefits regards
              nothing that pre-exists on the side of the creature-for that which
              pertains to the creature is an effect of His election—but takes as
              His measure merely what pleases His will, according to which He
              effects all things, and not the condition of their person, as is
              said in Ephesians (1:11), it is evident that He does not regard
              the person of man.

              interjects that it was through certain works of Christ. For just

              Now the reason why the custom prevailed in the early Church for
              those in the Church of the circumcision to sell their goods and
              not those in the Church of the Gentiles was that the believing
              Jews were congregated in Jerusalem and in Judea, which was soon to
              be destroyed by the Romans, as later events proved. Hence the Lord
              willed that no possessions were to be kept in a place not destined
              to endure. But the Church of the Gentiles was destined to grow
              strong and increase, and therefore, by the inspiration of the Holy
              Spirit, it came about that the possessions in it were not to be
              sold.

              <b>I withstood him</b> as an adversary, the answer is that the
              Apostle opposed Peter in the exercise of authority, not in his
              authority of ruling. Therefore from the foregoing we have an
              example: prelates, indeed, an example of humility, that they not
              disdain corrections from those who are lower and subject to them;
              subjects have an example of zeal and freedom, that they fear not
              to correct their prelates, particularly if their crime is public
              and verges upon danger to the multitude.

              He says therefore, as to the first point, that Peter felt that
              legalism ought not be observed. This he showed by the fact that
              <b>before some came</b>, namely, Jews zealous for the Law,
              <b>from James</b>, Bishop of the Church at Jerusalem,
              <b>he did eat</b>, namely, Peter did, <b>with the Gentiles</b>,
              i.e., without compunction he ate the food of Gentiles. He did this
              through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit Who had said to him:
              “That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common,” as is had
              in Acts (10:15), and as he himself in the following chapter said
              in answer to the Jews who rose up against him, because he had
              eaten with the uncircumcised.

              not with a human or worldly fear but a fear inspired by charity,

              became to the Jews as a Jew, pretending that he felt the same as
              they did in their weakness. Yet he feared unreasonably, because

              The occasion of the rebuke was not slight, but just and useful,
              namely, the danger to the Gospel teaching. Hence he says: Thus was
              Peter reprehensible, but I alone,
              <b>when I saw that they</b>, who were doing these things,
              <b>walked not uprightly unto the truth of the gospel,</b>
              because its truth was being undone, if the Gentiles were compelled
              to observe the legal justifications, as will be plain below. That,
              they were not walking uprightly is so, because in cases where
              danger is imminent, the truth must be preached openly and the
              opposite never condoned through fear of scandalizing others: “That
              which I tell you in the dark, speak ye in the light” (Mt 10:27);
              “The way of the just is right: the path of the just is right to
              walk in” (Is 26:7). The manner of the rebuke was fitting, i.e.,
              public and plain. Hence he says,
              <b>I said to Cephas</b>, i.e., to Peter, <b>before them all</b>,
              because that dissimulation posed a danger to all: “Them that sin,
              reprove before all” (1 Tim 5:20). This is to be understood of
              public sins and not of private ones, in which the procedures of
              fraternal charity ought to be observed.

              importance,
              <b>how dost thou compel the Gentiles,</b>
              not indeed by command, but by example of your behavior,
              <b>to live as do the Jews?</b>
              He says,
              <b>compel</b>, because as Pope Leo says, “Example has more force
              than words.” Hence Paul rebukes Peter precisely because he had
              been instructed by God that although he had previously lived as
              the Jews do, he should no longer discriminate among foods: “That
              which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common” (Acts 10:15).

              virtutem suam, in quantum scilicet per circumcisionem tollebatur
              peccatum originale, et per sacrificia et hostias placabatur Deus.
              Sed post passionem non solum dicit ea non fuisse viva vel mortua,

              It should be noted that these words occasioned no small
              controversy between Jerome and Augustine and, as their writings
              clearly show, they are seen to disagree on four points. First, as
              to the time of the legal justifications, namely, when they should
              have been observed. For Jerome distinguishes two periods, one
              before the passion of Christ and one after. Jerome’s opinion is
              that the legal justifications were
              <i>living</i>
              before the passion of Christ, i.e., had validity, inasmuch as
              original sin was removed through circumcision, and God was pleased
              with sacrifices and victims. But after the passion they were,
              according to him, not only not living i.e., dead, but what is
              more, they were
              <i>deadly,</i>
              so that whoever observed them after the passion of Christ sinned
              mortally.

              Augustinus vero distinguit tria tempora. Unum tempus ante

              mortua fuisse, sed tamen non mortifera Iudaeis conversis, dummodo
              ipsa servantes, spem in eis non ponerent, ita quod etiam ipsi
              Iudaei ea servantes tunc non peccarent. Si vero in eis spem

              Augustine, on the other hand, distinguishes three periods. One
              period was before the passion of Christ and, in agreement with
              Jerome, he says that during that period the legal justifications
              were
              <i>living.</i>
              Another was the period immediately following the passion of
              Christ, before grace was promulgated (as the time of the apostles
              in the beginning); during this period, says Augustine, the legal
              justifications were
              <i>dead</i>
              but not yet
              <i>deadly</i>
              to the converted Jews, so long as the ones observing them placed
              no hope in them. Hence the Jews observed them during that period
              without sinning. But had they placed their trust in them when
              observing them after their conversion, they would have sinned
              mortally; because if they placed their trust in them so as to
              believe that they were necessary for salvation, then, as far as
              they were concerned, they would have been voiding the grace of
              Christ. Finally, he posits a third period, after the truth and
              grace of Christ had been proclaimed. It was during that period, he

              Ratio autem dictorum est, quia si Iudaei statim post conversionem

              legalia modico tempore servarentur ea intentione quae dicta est,
              ut per hoc ostenderetur legalia tunc bona fuisse. Unde dicit
              Augustinus quod per hoc ostendebatur quod mater synagoga cum
              honore deducenda ad tumulum erat, dum non statim post passionem
              Christi legalia prohibita sunt. Quicumque vero non eo modo ipsa

              The reasoning that underlies these statements is that if the Jews
              had been forbidden the legal observances right after their
              conversion, it might have seemed that they had previously been on
              an equal footing with idolaters, who were immediately forbidden to
              worship idols, and that just as idolatry had never been good, so
              too the legal observances. Therefore, under the inspiration of the
              Holy Spirit, the legal observances were condoned for a short time
              for the reason given, namely, to show that the legal observances
              had been good in the past. Hence, says Augustine, the fact that
              the legal justifications were not forbidden right after the
              passion of Christ showed that the mother, the synagogue, was
              destined to be brought in honor to the grave. But whosoever did
              not observe them in that manner would not be honoring the mother,
              the synagogue, but disturbing her grave.

              Secundo discordant praedicti Hieronymus et Augustinus de
              observatione legalium quantum ad ipsos apostolos. Hieronymus enim
              dicit quod apostoli numquam secundum veritatem servabant legalia,
              sed simulaverunt se servare, ut vitarent scandalum fidelium qui
              fuerant ex circumcisione. Et hoc quidem modo dicit simulasse
              Paulum, quando persolvit votum in templo Ierosolymitano, ut
              habetur Act. XXI, 26; et quando circumcidit Timotheum, ut habetur
              Act. XVI, v. 3; et quando a Iacobo monitus quaedam legalia
              suscepit, ut habetur Act. XV, 20. Et hoc quidem facientes non
              deludebant alios, quia faciebant hoc, non intendentes legalia
              servare, sed propter aliquas causas, sicut quod quiescebant in
              sabbato non propter observantiam legis, sed propter quietem. Item
              abstinebant ab immundis secundum legem, non propter observantiam
              legis, sed propter alias causas, utpote propter abominationem et
              aliquid huiusmodi. Augustinus vero dicit quod apostoli servabant
              ipsa legalia, et hoc intendentes, sed tamen non ponentes in eis
              spem, quasi essent necessaria ad salutem. Et hoc quidem licebat
              eis, quia fuerunt ex Iudaeis. Ita tamen quod haec servarent ante
              gratiam divulgatam; unde sicut eo tempore alii Iudaei conversi
              sine periculo servare poterant, absque eo quod in eis spem
              ponerent, ita et ipsi.

              Secondly, the aforesaid Jerome and Augustine disagree on the
              observance of the legal justifications with respect to the
              apostles; For Jerome says that the apostles never really observed
              them but pretended to do so, in order to avoid scandalizing the
              believers who had been of the circumcision. He says that even Paul
              made this pretense when he fulfilled a vow in the temple at
              Jerusalem, as is narrated in Acts (21:26), and when he circumcised
              Timothy, as in Acts (16:3), and when on advice from James he
              observed some of the justifications, as recorded in Acts (20:20).
              But in so doing the apostles were not misleading the faithful,
              because they did not act with the intention of observing the
              justifications but for other reasons; for example, they rested on
              the Sabbath, not because it was a legal observance, but for the
              sake of rest. Likewise, they abstained from food legally unclean,
              not for the sake of observing the legal justifications but for
              other reasons; for example, on account of an abhorrence or
              something of that nature. But Augustine says that the apostles
              observed the legal justifications and intended to do so, but
              without putting their trust in them as though they were necessary
              for salvation. Furthermore, this was lawful for them to do,
              because they had been Jews. Nevertheless, they observed them
              before grace was proclaimed. Hence just as certain other Jews
              could safely observe them at that time without putting any trust
              in them, so too could the apostles.

              Tertio discordant de peccato Petri. Nam Hieronymus dicit in
              simulatione praedicta Petrum non peccasse, quia hoc ex charitate
              fecit, et non ex aliquo timore mundano, ut dictum est. Augustinus
              vero dicit eum peccasse, venialiter tamen, et hoc propter
              indiscretionem quam habuit, nimis inhaerendo huic parti (scilicet
              Iudaeorum) ad vitandum eorum scandalum. Et validius argumentum
              Augustini contra Hieronymum est, quia Hieronymus adducit pro se
              septem doctores, quorum quatuor, scilicet Laudicensem, et
              Alexandrinum, Origenem et Didymum excludit Augustinus, utpote de
              haeresi infames. Aliis vero tribus opponit tres, quos pro se et
              pro sua opinione habet, scilicet Ambrosium, Cyprianum, et ipsum
              Paulum, qui manifeste dicit, quod reprehensibilis erat Petrus. Si
              ergo nefas est dicere in Scriptura sacra aliquod falsum contineri,
              non erit fas dicere Petrum reprehensibilem non fuisse. Et propter
              hoc verior est opinio et sententia Augustini, quia cum dictis
              apostoli magis concordat.

            <td>
              Thirdly, they disagree on the sin of Peter. For Jerome says that
              in the dissimulation previously mentioned, Peter did not sin,
              because he did this from charity and, as has been said, not from
              mundane fear. Augustine, on the other hand, says, that he did
              sin—venially, however—on account of the lack of discretion he had
              by adhering overmuch to one side, namely, to the Jews, in order to
              avoid scandalizing them. But the stronger of Augustine’s arguments
              against Jerome is that Jerome adduces on his own behalf seven
              doctors, four of whom, namely, Laudicens, Alexander, Origen, and
              Didymus, Augustine rejects as known heretics. To the other three
              he opposes three of his own, who held with him and his opinion,
              namely, Ambrose, Cyprian, and Paul himself, who plainly teaches
              that Peter was deserving of rebuke. Therefore, if it is unlawful
              to say that anything false is contained in Sacred Scripture, it
              will not be lawful to say that Peter was not deserving of rebuke.
              For this reason the opinion and statement of Augustine is the
              truer, because it is more in accord with the words of the Apostle.

              Quarto discordant in reprehensione Pauli. Nam Hieronymus dicit,
              quod Paulus vere non reprehendit Petrum, sed simulatorie, sicut et
              Petrus simulatorie legalia servabat, ut scilicet sicut Petrus
              nolens scandalizare Iudaeos simulabat se legalia servare, ita
              Paulus ut non scandalizaret gentes, ostendit sibi displicere quod
              Petrus faciebat, et simulatorie reprehendit, faciebantque hoc
              quasi ex condicto, ut utrisque fidelibus sibi subditis
              providerent. Augustinus vero sicut dicit Petrum vere servasse
              legalia, ita dicit Paulum eum vere reprehendisse, et non
              simulatorie. Sed et Petrus quidem servando peccavit, quia inde
              erat scandalum apud gentiles, a quibus se subtrahebat. Paulus vero
              non peccavit reprehendendo, quia ex eius reprehensione nullum
              scandalum sequebatur.
            </td>
            <td>
              Fourthly, they disagree on Paul’s rebuke. For Jerome says that
              Paul did not really rebuke Peter but pretended to do so, just as
              Peter pretended to observe the legal justifications, i.e. just as
              Peter in his unwillingness to scandalize the Jews pretended to
              observe the justifications, so Paul, in order not to scandalize
              the Gentiles, feigned displeasure at Peter’s action and pretended
              to rebuke him. This was done, as it were, by mutual consent, so
              that each might exercise his care over the believers subject to
              them. Augustine, however, just as he says that Peter really did
              observe the justifications, says that Paul truly rebuked him
              without pretense. Furthermore, Peter really sinned by observing
              them, because his action was a source of scandal to the Gentiles
              from whom he separated himself. But Paul did not sin in rebuking
              him, because no scandal followed from his rebuke.

              But against this can be set the word of 1 John (1:8): “If we say
              that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves.” Therefore, the Jews
              were sinners. I answer that it is one thing to sin and another to
              be a sinner. For the first names an act, but the second a
              readiness or habit of sinning. Hence Scripture is wont to call the
              impious and those loaded down with the heavy burden of sin,
              sinners. The Jews therefore, being haughty on account of the Law,
              and as it were, restrained from sin by it, called the Gentiles
              sinners, living as they were without the Laws’ restraint and being
              prone to sin: “Be no more carried about with every wind of
              doctrine” (Eph 4:14). When, therefore, the Apostle says,
              <b>not of the Gentiles, sinners,</b> he means we are not of that
              number of sinners that exist among the Gentiles.

              Therefore the apostolic life rested on the faith of Christ and not
              on the works of the Law. The reason for this is that although we
              were Jews by nature and were nourished in the works of the Law,
              yet <b>knowing</b> for certain that man is
              <b>not justified by the works of the law,</b>
              i.e., through the works of the Law, but
              <b>by the faith of Jesus Christ,</b>
              for that reason we have left the Law and are living according to
              the precepts of the faith: “For we account a man to be justified
              by faith, without the works of the Law” (Rom 3:28); “For there is
              no other name under heaven given to men whereby we must be saved”
              (Acts 4:12).

              However, it is said in Romans (2:13): “For not the hearers of the
              law are just before God; but the doers of the law shall be
              justified.” Therefore, it seems that a man would be justified by
              the works of the Law. I answer that “to be justified” can be taken
              in two senses, namely, doing what is just, and being made just.
              But no one is made just save by God through grace. It should be
              known, therefore, that some works of the Law were moral and some
              ceremonial. The moral, although they were contained in the Law,
              could not, strictly speaking, be called “works of the Law,” for
              man is induced to them by natural instinct and by the natural law.
              But the ceremonial works are properly called the “works of the
              Law.” Therefore, to that extent is man justified by the moral
              laws—so far as the execution of justice is concerned—and also by
              the ceremonial laws that pertain to the sacraments, as their
              observance is a work of obedience. And this is the way it is taken
              in the word of the Apostle to the Romans (2:13).

              But with respect to being made just by the works of the Law, a man
              does not seem to be justified by them, because the sacraments of
              the Old Law did not confer grace.
              <b>How turn you again to the weak and needy elements?</b>
              i.e., that neither confer grace nor contain grace in themselves.
              The sacraments of the New Law however, although they are material
              elements, are not needy elements; hence they can justify. Again,
              if there were any in the Old Law who were just, they were not made
              just by the works of the Law but only by the faith of Christ “Whom
              God hath proposed to be a propitiation through faith,” as is said
              in Romans (3:25). Hence the sacraments of the Old Law were certain
              protestations of the faith of Christ, just as our sacraments are,
              but not in the same way, because those sacraments were configured
              to the grace of Christ as to something that lay in the future; our
              sacraments, however, testify as things containing a grace that is
              present. Therefore, he says significantly, that
              <b
                >it is not by the works of the law that we are justified, but by
                the faith of Christ,</b
              >
              because, although some who observed the works of the Law in times
              past were made just, nevertheless, this was effected only by the
              faith of Jesus Christ.

              From this knowledge which the apostles had, namely, that
              justification is not by the works of the Law but by the faith of
              Christ, he concludes to their manner of life, in which they chose
              the faith of Christ and gave up the works of the Law. Hence he
              adds,
              <b>we also believe in Christ Jesus</b>, because as is said in Acts
              (4:12): “There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby
              we must be saved.” Therefore he continued, that we may be
              justified by the faith of Christ. “Being justified, therefore, by
              faith, let us have peace with God” (Rom 5:1). But lest anyone
              suppose that the works of the Law along with the faith of Christ
              justify, he adds,
              <b>and not by the works of the law:</b>
              “For we account a man to be justified by faith, without the works
              of the Law” (Rom 3:28).

              From this he derives his main proposition, saying that if the

              <b>by the works of the law no flesh shall be justified,</b>
              i.e., no man whatsoever can be justified by the works of the Law.
              For “flesh” is taken here to stand for “Man,” i.e., the part for
              the whole, as does “All flesh shall see the salvation of the Lord”

              <i>a fortiori</i>. For it seems more natural or reasonable for the
              Jews, more than anyone else, to be justified by the works of the

              Now if someone were to object that since he formerly had wasted
              the faith of Christ, he makes himself a prevaricator by trying to
              build it up, the plain answer is that he did indeed try to destroy
              the faith of Christ, yet because of the truth he did not persist:
              “Why persecutest thou me? It is hard for thee to kick against the
              goad” (Acts 9:4). But pride in the Law was vain and this pride
              could be destroyed, never again to be re-established.

              The second way in which it can be developed is to refer his
              statement,
              <b>we ourselves are found sinners</b>, not to their abandoning the
              Law, as in the first explanation, but to the observance of the
              Law. For it is plain that anyone who seeks to be made just does
              not profess himself to be just but a sinner. The sense, therefore,
              is this:
              <b>if we, in seeking to be justified in Christ, are</b>
              by the very fact of seeking to be justified <b>found</b>, i.e.,
              reasonably proved, to have been <b>sinners</b>, because we
              observed the Law,
              <b>is Jesus Christ then the minister of sin?</b>
              i.e., commanding men to observe the works of the Law after His
              passion—something that cannot be done without sin? Note that this
              explanation harmonizes with Jerome’s opinion which posited that
              the legal justifications were deadly immediately after the passion
              of Christ.

              It is possible to explain, we

              referring, indeed, to the state in which the Law was observed; not
              that they offended by observing the Law, but that the Law is
              deficient and cannot remove sin. Hence the meaning is this: If in
              seeking to be justified in it, we ourselves are found to be
              sinners, i.e., still in our sins, because the Law does not remove
              sin—according to Romans (3:9): “For we have charged both Jews and
              Greeks, that they are all under sin”—
              <b>Is Jesus Christ then the minister of sin</b>, so as to bring us
              back to observing the Law in which we are under sin? This
              explanation accords with Augustine’s exposition.

            <td>
              Furthermore, it can be explained in a fourth way, thus: I had said
              that man is not justified by the works of the Law. But someone
              might say, “Nor by the faith of Christ either,” because many sin
              after embracing the faith of Christ. And this is what he says:
              <b>If we, seeking to be justified in Christ,</b>
              i.e., by the faith of Christ,
              <b>are ourselves</b>, who have become believers by embracing the
              faith of Christ, <b>found to be sinners</b>, i.e., living in sin,
              <b>is Jesus Christ then the minister of sin</b>
              and of damnation, as the minister of the Old Law is a minister of
              sin and damnation? Not that the Law led one into sin, but was its
              occasion, because it forbade sin and conferred no grace to help
              one resist sin. Hence it is said: “But sin, taking occasion by the
              commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiscence” (Rom 7:8).
              But Christ gives a helping grace: “Grace and truth came by Jesus
              Christ” (in 1:17). Hence in no way is He the minister of sin,
              either directly or as its occasion.

              carefully considered, say nothing without a purpose. This is plain

              manifests the solution; Secondly, he explains his manifestation of
              the solution; (v. 19):
              <b>with Christ I am nailed to the cross;</b> Thirdly, he settles

              Quia ergo apostolus dixerat

              <i>dissipaverunt iniqui legem tuam</i>, ideo apostolus vult
              ostendere quomodo legem destruat, et tamen non est iniquus, dicens
              <i>ego enim per legem</i>, et cetera. Ubi sciendum est, quod
              quando aliquis dissipat legem per ipsam legem, talis est
              praevaricator legis, non iniquus. Dissipatur autem lex per legem,
              quando in lege datur aliquod praeceptum locale seu temporale, ut
              scilicet lex illa tali tempore, seu tali loco servetur, et non
              alio, et hoc ipsum exprimatur in lege. Si quis tunc in illo
              tempore, seu in illo loco lege non utitur, destruit legem per
              ipsam legem, et hoc modo apostolus destruxit legem. Unde destruxi,
              inquit, quodammodo legem, tamen per legem, quia ego
              <i>mortuus sum legi per legem</i>, id est, per auctoritatem legis
              ipsam dimisi, quasi legi mortuus. Auctoritas enim legis, per quam
              mortuus est legi, in multis sacrae Scripturae locis habetur; Ier.
              XXXI, 31, tamen sub aliis verbis:
              <i>confirmabo testamentum novum super domum Israel</i>, etc.;
              Deut. XVIII, 15:
              <i>prophetam suscitabit dominus de fratribus vestris</i>, etc.; et
              multis aliis locis; non est ergo transgressor apostolus legem
              destruendo.
            </td>
            <td>
              Therefore, because the Apostle had said,
              <b>For, if I build up again the things which I have destroyed</b>,
              which is understood to refer to the Old Law, for one might regard
              him as a destroyer of the Law and consequently impious according
              to Psalm (118:126): “They have dissipated thy law,” for that
              reason the Apostle wishes to show how he destroys the Law without
              being impious, saying,
              <b>For I, through the law, am dead to the law</b>. Here it should
              be noted that when anyone destroys a law by means of the law
              itself, he is indeed a prevaricator of the law, but not impious.
              For a law is destroyed by means of the law when the law itself
              contains some local or temporary precept, such that the law should
              be observed for such a time or in such a place and no other, and
              this fact is expressed in the law. If someone, therefore, after
              that time or outside that place, does not use the law, he destroys
              the law by means of the law itself, and in this way the Apostle
              destroyed the Law. Hence he says: I somehow destroyed the Law, but
              by means of the Law; because
              <b>through the Law I am dead to the Law</b>, i.e., by the
              authority of the Law I have rejected the Law, as being dead to the
              Law. For the authority of the Law, through which he is dead to the
              Law, is cited in many places in Sacred Scripture. For example,
              although not in so many words, it is had in Jeremias (31:31): 1
              will make a new covenant with the house of Israel”; “The Lord will
              raise up to thee a prophet of thy brethren like unto me” (Deut
              18:15), and in many other places. Therefore the Apostle is not a
              destroyer of the Law in the sense of a transgressor of the Law.

              Or else, <b>I by the law</b> spiritual
              <b>am dead to the law</b> carnal. For he dies to the Law when,
              being freed by the Law, he casts it aside, according to Romans
              (7:2): “If her husband be dead, she is loosed from the law of her
              husband.” Now inasmuch as the Apostle was subject to the spiritual
              law, he says that he is dead to the Law, i.e., loosed from the
              observances of the Law: “For the law of the spirit of life, in
              Christ Jesus, hath delivered me from the law of sin and of death”
              (Rom 8:2). Again there is another possible way of setting the law
              aside without prevarication, because, namely, a law, when it is
              written on a scroll is called a dead law, and when it is in the
              mind of the lawgiver it is called a living law. Now it is plain
              that if someone were to act according to the word of the lawgiver
              against the written law and break the law, he would both be set
              free of the dead law and be acting according to the command of the
              lawgiver.

              Et ideo dicit: per legem manuducentem mortuus sum legi scriptae,

              He says, therefore, along these lines,
              <b>I am dead to the law</b>, which is written and dead, i.e., I am
              loosed from it <b>that I may live to God</b>, i.e., that I may
              guide my movements according to His precepts and be ordained to
              His honor. For a law that has been passed does, indeed, hand down
              something in writing on account of those outside and of those who
              cannot hear the words spoken by the lawgiver; but for those in his
              presence he does not lay it down in writing but in words alone.
              For in the beginning, men were weak and unable to approach unto
              God; hence it was necessary for the precepts of the Law to be
              given to them in writing, so that by the Law, as by a pedagogue,
              they might be led by the hand to the point where they might hear
              the things He commands, according to the words given below:
              <b
                >the law was our pedagogue in Christ, that we might be justified
                by faith</b
              >
              (3:24). But after we have access to the Father through Christ, as
              is said in Romans (5:2), we are not instructed about the commands
              of God through the Law, but by God Himself. Hence he says: Through
              the Law leading me by the hand I have died to the written law, in
              order that I may live unto God, i.e., to the maker of the Law,
              i.e., to be instructed and directed by Him.

              Et primum quidem potest exponi dupliciter. Uno modo sicut in
              Glossa, sic: quilibet homo secundum carnalem originem nascitur
              filius irae, Eph. II, 3:
              <i>eramus enim natura filii irae</i>, et cetera. Nascitur etiam in
              vetustate peccati, Bar. III, 11:
              <i>inveterasti in terra aliena</i>, et cetera. Quae quidem
              vetustas peccati tollitur per crucem Christi, et confertur novitas
              vitae spiritualis. Dicit ergo apostolus
              <i>Christo confixus sum cruci</i>, id est, concupiscentia seu
              fomes peccati, et omne huiusmodi, mortuum est in me per crucem
              Christi. Rom. VI, 6:
              <i>vetus homo noster simul crucifixus est</i>, et cetera. Item ex
              quo cum Christo confixus sum cruci, et mortuus sum peccato, et
              Christus resurrexit, cum resurgente etiam resurrexi. Rom. IV, 25:
              <i>traditus est</i>, et cetera. Sic ergo Christus in nobis renovat
              vitam novam, destructa vetustate peccati. Et ideo dicit
              <i>vivo autem</i>, id est, quia <i>Christo confixus sum cruci</i>,
              vigorem bene operandi habeo, <i>iam non ego</i> secundum carnem,
              quia iam non habeo vetustatem quam prius habui,
              <i>sed vivit in me Christus</i>, id est, novitas, quae per
              Christum nobis data est.
            </td>
            <td>
              The first point can be explained in two ways. In one way, as in a
              Gloss, thus: every man according to carnal origin is born a child
              of wrath: “By nature we were children of wrath, even as the rest,
              (Eph 2:3). He is also born in the oldness of sin: “Thou art grown
              old in a strange country” (Bar. 3:11). This oldness of sin is
              removed by the cross of Christ, and the newness of spiritual life
              is conferred. Therefore the Apostle says,
              <b>with Christ I am nailed to the cross</b>, i.e., concupiscence
              or the inclination to sin, and all such have been put to death in
              me through the cross of Christ: “Our old man is crucified with
              him, that the body of sin may be destroyed” (Rom 6:6). Also from
              the fact that I am crucified with Christ and have died to sin; and
              because Christ rose again, I, too, have risen with Him rising:
              “Who was delivered up for our sins, and rose again for our
              justification” (Rom 4:25). Thus, therefore, does Christ beget a
              new life in us, after the oldness of sin has been destroyed. Hence
              he says, <b>And I live</b>, i.e., because I am nailed to the cross
              of Christ, I have the strength to act well,
              <b>now not I</b> according to the flesh, because I no longer have
              the oldness which I formerly had, <b>but Christ liveth in me</b>,
              i.e., the newness which has been given to us through Christ.

              Vel aliter: homo quantum ad illud dicitur vivere, in quo

              cum vero quaerit bona aliorum, dicitur etiam illis vivere. Quia
              ergo apostolus proprium affectum deposuerat per crucem Christi,

            <td>
              Or, in another way: a man is said to live according to that in
              which he chiefly puts his affection and in which he is mainly
              delighted. Hence men who take their greatest pleasure in study or
              in hunting say that this is their life. However, each man has his
              own private interest by which he seeks that which is his own.
              Therefore, when someone lives seeking only what is his own, he
              lives only unto himself; but when he seeks the good of others, he
              is said to live for them. Accordingly, because the Apostle had set
              aside his love of self through the cross of Christ, he said that
              be was dead so far as love of self was concerned, declaring that
              <b>with Christ I am nailed to the cross</b>, i.e., through the
              cross of Christ my own private love has been removed from me.
              Hence he says
              <b
                >God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our Lord
                Jesus Christ</b
              >
              (6:14): “If one died for all, then all were dead. And Christ died
              for all, that they also who live may not now live to themselves,
              but unto him who died for them” (2 Cor 5:14). And I live, now not
              1, i.e., I no longer live as though having any interest in my own
              good,
              <b>but Christ liveth in me</b>, i.e., I have Christ alone in my
              affection and Christ Himself is my life: “To me, to live is
              Christ; and to die is gain” (Phil 1:21).

              corpus, et corpus quidem vivificabatur et movebatur ab anima
              Pauli, sed anima eius a Christo. Quantum ergo ad vitam carnis
              vivebat ipse Paulus, et hoc est quod dicit
              <i>quod autem nunc vivo in carne</i>, id est, vita carnis; sed
              quantum ad relationem ad Deum, Christus vivebat in Paulo, et ideo
              dicit <i>in fide vivo filii Dei</i>, per quam habitat in me et
              movet me. Hab. II, 4: <i>iustus autem meus ex fide vivit</i>. Et

              <b
                >And that I live now in the flesh, I live in the faith of the
                Son of God,</b
              >
              he answers a twofold difficulty that might arise from his words.
              One is how he lives and yet it is not he who lives; the second is
              how he is nailed to the cross. Therefore he clears up these two
              points. First of all, the first one, namely, how he lives and yet
              it is not he who lives. He answers this when he says
              <b
                >And that I live now in the flesh I live in the faith of the Son
                of God</b
              >. Here it should be noted that, strictly speaking, those things
              are said to live which are moved by an inner principle. Now the
              soul of Paul was set between his body and God; the body, indeed,
              was vivified and moved by the soul of Paul, but his soul by
              Christ. Hence as to the life of the flesh, Paul himself lived and
              this is what he says, namely,
              <b>and that I live now in the flesh</b>, i.e., by the life of the
              flesh; but as to his relation to God, Christ lived in Paul.
              Therefore he says,
              <b>I live in the faith of the Son of God</b>
              through which He dwells in me and moves me: “But the just shall
              live in his faith” (Hab. 2:4). And note that he says
              <b>in the flesh</b>, not “by the flesh,” because this is evil.

              A form of repudiation and of ingratitude would exist, if I were to
              say that the Law is necessary in order to be justified. Hence he
              says,
              <b>For if justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain</b>,
              i.e., if the Law is sufficient, i.e., if the works of the Law
              suffice to justify a man, Christ died to no purpose and in vain,
              because He died in order to make us just: “Christ also died once
              for our sins, the just for the unjust, that he might offer us to
              God” (1 Pet. 3:18). Now if this could have been done through the
              Law, the death of Christ would have been superfluous. But He did
              not die in vain or labor to no purpose, as it is said in Isaiah
              (49:4); because through Him alone came justifying grace and truth,
              as it is said in John (1:17). Therefore, if any were just before
              the passion of Christ, this too was through the faith of Christ to
              come, in Whom they believed and in Whose faith they were saved.

              <b>who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth,</b>
              he shows how they had become senseless. Here it is to be noted,
              first of all, that someone becomes senseless in a number of ways:
              either because some truth he could know is not proposed to him; or
              because he departs from a truth that had been proposed and
              accepted, as when he abandons the way of truth. Such were these
              Galatians who rejected the truth proposed to them and abandoned
              the truth of the faith they had accepted:
              <b
                >I wonder that you are so soon removed from him that called you
                into the grace of Christ, unto another gospel</b
              >
              (1:6). This, therefore, is the type of senselessness for which he
              chides them when he says:
              <b>who hath bewitched you that you should not obey the truth</b>
              ?

              Ad sciendum autem quid sit fascinatio, sciendum est, quod secundum

              ludificatus, qui res manifestas aliter accipit, quam sint in rei

              <i>vae qui dicunt bonum malum</i>, et cetera. Alio modo accipitur
              fascinatio secundum quod aliquis ex aspectu malevolo laeditur, et
              hoc maxime in vetulis quae visu urenti et aspectu invido fascinant

              To understand what bewitchment is, it should be noted that
              according to a Gloss, bewitchment is, properly speaking, a sense
              delusion usually produced by magical arts; for example, to make a
              man appear to onlookers as a lion or as having horns. This can
              also be brought about by demons who have the power to set
              phantasms in motion as well as to produce in the senses the very
              alterations that real objects are wont to produce. According to
              this acceptation the Apostle asks, appropriately enough,
              <b>who hath bewitched you?</b> As if to say: You are as deluded
              men who take obvious things to be other than they are in very
              fact, namely, because you are deluded by artifices and sophisms,
              <b>not to obey the truth,</b>
              i.e., you neither see the obvious truth received by you nor
              embrace it by obeying it: “For the bewitching of vanity obscureth
              good things” (Wis 4:12); “Woe to you that call evil good, and good
              evil” (Is 5:20). In another way bewitchment is taken to mean that
              someone is harmed by an evil look, particularly when cast by
              sorcerers whose inflamed eyes and hostile glance cast a spell on
              boys who grow faint from it and vomit their food.

              Huius causam volens assignare Avicenna in libro suo de anima

              magis quam qualitatibus activis et passivis in natura. Et ideo

              caeli et omnium corporalium agentium. Eodem modo dicit, quod

              carnalibus vitiis, accedit ad similitudinem substantiarum
              dictarum, et obedit ei natura. Et hinc est quod aliqui sancti viri
              operantur quaedam mira praeter naturae cursum; et similiter quia
              anima alicuius foedata passionibus carnalibus, habet fortem
              apprehensionem in malitia, obedit ei natura ad transmutationem
              materiae, in illis maxime in quibus materia habilis est: sicut in
              pueris teneris contingit. Et sic contingit, secundum eum, quod ex
              forti apprehensione vetularum, in malitiam immutatur puer et
              fascinatur. Haec autem positio satis videtur vera secundum
              opinionem Avicennae. Nam ipse posuit formas omnes corporales in
              istis inferioribus influi a substantiis incorporalibus separatis,
              et quod agentia naturalia non habent se ad hoc nisi ut disponentia

              Avicenna, attempting to explain this phenomenon in his book On
              <i>the Soul,</i> says that corporeal matter obeys an intellectual
              substance more than it obeys the active and passive qualities at
              work in nature. Accordingly, he supposes that through the mental
              activity of intellectual substance (which he calls the souls or
              movers of the heavenly spheres) many things occur outside the
              order of heavenly movements and of all corporeal forces. Along the
              same lines he says that when a holy soul is purged of all earthly
              affection and carnal vice, it acquires a likeness to the aforesaid
              substances, so that nature obeys it. This is why certain holy men
              achieve marvels that transcend the course of nature. In like
              manner, because the soul of someone defiled by carnal passions has
              a vigorous apprehension of malice, nature obeys it to the point of
              affecting matter, particularly in those in whom the matter is
              pliant, as in the case of tender children. Thus does it happen,
              according to him, that from the vigorous apprehension exercised by
              sorcerers a child can be evilly affected and bewitched. This
              position seems to be true enough according to Avicenna’s tenets.
              For he postulates that all material forms in sublunar bodies are
              influenced by the separated incorporeal substances and that
              natural agents can be no more than dispositive causes in such
              matter.

              However, this is disproved by the Philosopher. For an agent should
              be similar to what is subject to it. Now what comes into existence
              is not a form alone or matter alone but the composite of matter
              and form. Consequently, that which acts to produce the existence
              of corporeal things ought to have matter and form. Therefore he
              says that the only thing which can cause changes of matter and
              form is something that itself has matter and form either
              virtually, as God, who is the maker of form and matter, or
              actually, as a bodily agent. Therefore with respect to forms of
              this kind corporeal matter obeys the nod neither of angels nor of
              any mere creature but of God alone, as Augustine says. Hence what
              Avicenna says about this matter of bewitchment is not true.

              Therefore it is better to say that when a man’s act of imagining
              or apprehending is strong, the sense is affected or at least the
              sense appetite Is Now such as affection does not occur without
              some alteration taking place in the body and the bodily spirits;
              as, for example, we see that when something pleasant is
              apprehended, the sense appetite is moved to desire and as a result
              the body becomes warm. Similarly, as a result of apprehending
              something horrible, the body grows cold. When the spirits are thus
              moved they mainly infect the eyes, which in turn infect certain
              things through their glance, as is plain in the case of a clean
              mirror that becomes defiled when looked into by a woman in her
              monthly purification. Therefore because sorcerers are obstinate
              and hardened in evil, their sense appetite is affected by the
              vigor of their apprehension; as a result, as has been said, the
              infection moves from the veins to the eyes and thence to the
              object upon which they look. Accordingly, because the flesh of
              children is soft, it is influenced and charmed by their hostile
              glance. And demons, too, can sometimes produce this effect.

              Then he tells why he rebukes them, when he says,
              <b
                >before whose eyes Jesus Christ hath been set forth, crucified
                among you.</b
              >
              This can be interpreted in three ways. One way, Jerome’s,
              corresponds to the first meaning of “bewitchment”; as if he says:
              I say that you are bewitched, because
              <b>before your eyes Christ hath been set forth,</b>
              i.e., the outlawing of Christ, Who was condemned to death, is as
              vivid to your eyes as if it were being enacted before your eyes
              and He was being crucified among you, i.e., the crucifixion of
              Christ was as clear in your understanding as though it were taking
              place there. Hence, if you no longer see it, it is because you
              have been deluded and bewitched. Against such a change of heart,
              it is said in the Canticle (8:6): “Put me as a seal upon thy
              heart, as a seal upon thy arm.”

              Alio modo secundum Augustinum; quasi dicat: recte fascinati estis,

              quia quem non deberetis pati quod ab aliis proscriberetur, et
              expelleretur, in vobis proscriptus est, id est, haereditatem suam

              Another way, Augustine’s, is as if he said: You are justifiably
              bewitched, because as children, you vomit out the truth you have
              received, namely, Christ by faith in your hearts. And you do this
              because
              <b>before your eyes</b>, i.e., in your presence,
              <b>Jesus Christ is outlawed</b>, i.e., expelled and refused His
              inheritance. This should trouble you, because the very one whom
              you should not allow to be outlawed and expelled by others has
              been outlawed among you, i.e., has lost His inheritance, namely,
              yourselves, among you. Then that which follows, namely,
              <b>crucified</b>, should be read “with a heavy burden and obvious
              pain,” because he adds this to make them consider the great price
              Christ paid for the inheritance He lost among them, and thus move
              them more deeply. As if to say: Christ has been outlawed among
              you, He Who was crucified, i.e., Who with His cross and His own
              blood purchased this inheritance: “You are bought with a great
              price” (1 Cor 6:20); “Knowing that you were not redeemed with
              corruptible things, as gold or silver, from your vain conversation
              of the tradition of your fathers; but with the precious blood of
              Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled” (1 Pet. 1:18).

              secundum iudicium vestrum, <i>Iesus Christus proscriptus est</i>,

              according to your judgment, <b>Jesus Christ is outlawed</b>, i.e.,
              condemned without saving others.
              <b>And among you,</b>
              i.e., so far as you understand,
              <b>He was crucified</b>, i.e., merely died, but justified no one
              in spite of the fact that it is said of Him, “Although he was
              crucified through weakness, yet he liveth by the power of God” (2
              Cor 13:4).

              Potest, et quarto modo, exponi secundum Glossam, ut per hoc

              Christum deserunt legem observantes, aequaliter quodammodo
              peccabant Pilato, qui Christum proscripsit, id est, damnavit. Ut

              peccando crucifixoribus Christi sint, qui ipsum in ligno
              suspenderunt, morte turpissima condemnantes et afficientes.
              Aequalitas tamen est accipienda ex parte eius, in quem peccatur,
              quia in Christum Galatae peccabant, sicut Pilatus et crucifixores
              Christi.

            <td>
              It can be explained also in a fourth way according to a Gloss to
              the effect that by these words the Apostle proclaims the gravity
              of their guilt, because in deserting Christ by observing the Law,
              they sin somewhat on a par with Pilate who outlawed Christ, i.e.,
              condemned him. For in believing that Christ does not suffice to
              save them, they are made to be sinners similar to Christ’s
              executioners who hung Him on the cross, condemning Him to a most
              shameful death and killing Him. The parity is taken on the side of
              the one against whom they sinned, because the Galatians sinned
              against Christ Jesus as did Pilate and those who crucified Christ.

              and grow, manifest signs of the Holy Spirit took place in the
              hearers immediately after the apostles preached the faith.
              Accordingly, it is said of Peter in Acts (10:44): “While Peter was
              yet speaking these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that
              heard the word.” The Galatians, too, openly received the Holy
              Spirit at Paul’s preaching. The Apostle therefore asks them:
              Whence did they obtain the Holy Spirit? For it is obvious that it
              was not through the works of the Law, because, since they were
              Gentiles, they did not have the Law before they received the Holy
              Spirit. Therefore they had the Holy Spirit, i.e., the gifts of the
              Holy Spirit, by the hearing of faith: “For you have not received
              the spirit of bondage again in fear,” which was given in the Law
              (for the Law was given amid tremors), “but you have received the
              spirit of adoption of sons,” (Rom 8:17). Therefore, if the power
              of the faith could do this, it is vain to seek something else by
              which we are saved, because it is more difficult to make the
              unjust just than to preserve the just in their justice. Hence if
              the faith had made the unjust Gentiles just without the Law, no
              doubt it could without the Law keep them just. Great, therefore,
              was the gift they had received through faith.

              Concerning the first, it should be noted that the Galatians, after
              they left what was great, namely, the Holy Spirit, adhered to
              something less, namely, the carnal observances of the Law—and this
              is foolish. Hence he says,
              <b>Are you so foolish that, whereas you began</b>
              under the inspiration of
              <b>the Holy Spirit,</b> i.e., obtained the beginning of your
              perfection from the Holy Spirit, <b>you would now,</b> while you
              are more perfect,
              <b>be made perfect by the flesh,</b>
              i.e., do you seek to be preserved by the carnal observances of the
              Law from which you could acquire not even the beginning of
              justice? “The flesh profiteth nothing” (Jn 6:64). Thus do you
              pervert right order, because the path of perfection consists in
              going from the imperfect to the perfect. But you, because you are
              doing the opposite, are foolish: “A holy man continueth in wisdom
              as the sun; but a fool is changed as the moon” (Sir 27:12). They
              are as those who begin to serve God with fervor of spirit but
              afterwards desert to the flesh. Again, they are as
              Nabuchodonosor’s statute with head of gold and feet of clay (Dan.
              11:32). Hence it is said: “They who are in the flesh cannot please
              God” (Rom 8:8);
              <b
                >he that soweth in his flesh, of the flesh also shall reap
                corruption</b

              Then when he says,
              <b>Have you suffered so great things in vain?</b>
              he amplifies their desertion by considering the evils they endured
              for Christ. For anyone who receives something without labor does
              not guard it as something precious; but that which is obtained by
              great effort, it is foolish to esteem lightly and not guard it.
              Now it was with labor and tribulation suffered at the hands of
              their fellow citizens that they had received the Holy Spirit. That
              is why he says,
              <b>Have you suffered so great things in vain?</b>
              As if to say: You ought not to despise so great a gift received
              with labor;
              <b>else you have received it in vain,</b>
              i.e., to no purpose, because you endured these things in order to
              attain to eternal life: “Tribulation worketh patience, and
              patience trial, and trial hope; and hope confoundeth not” (Rom
              5:3). Hence, if you shut yourselves out from the door to eternal
              life by deserting the faith and seeking to be preserved by carnal
              observances, it is
              <b>in vain</b>, i.e., uselessly, that
              <b>you have suffered.</b>
              And I say,
              <b>If it be yet in vain.</b>
              He says this because it was still in their power to repent, if
              they willed, as long as they were alive. This shows that certain
              deadened works are revived: “Their labors are without fruit, and
              their works unprofitable” (Wis 3:11);
              <b>I am afraid lest perhaps I have labored in vain among you</b>
              (4:11). If this is applied to evil men who do not repent, it can
              be said that they suffered without cause, i.e., a cause that can
              confer eternal life.

              I answer that in the giving of the Holy Spirit three things
              conspire in a certain order, namely, the indwelling Holy Spirit,
              the gift of grace and charity along with the other habits, and the
              sacrament of the New Law by whose administering He is given. Hence
              He can be given by someone in three ways.

              Now there is a twofold sign of Christ. One is that He is the Lord
              of all; hence it is said: “Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages:
              and thy dominion endureth throughout all generations” (Ps 144:13).
              The other is that He is Sanctifier and Savior, according to Acts
              (4:12): “There is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby
              we must be saved.” Accordingly, He gave them two signs: one was
              the power to perform miracles, so that they could show they were
              sent by God, the Lord of all creatures: “He gave them power and
              authority over all devils and to cure diseases” (Lk 9:1). The
              other was that by their ministry they might give the Holy Spirit,
              in order to show that they had been sent by the Savior of all:
              “They laid their hands upon them, and they received the Holy
              Spirit” (Acts 8:17). Of these two ways it is said in Hebrews
              (2:4): “God also bearing them witness by signs and wonders and
              divers miracles and distributions of the Holy Spirit, according to
              his own will.”

              He says therefore: Truly, justice and the Holy Spirit come from
              faith,
              <b>As it is written</b> in Genesis (15:6) and mentioned again in
              Romans (4:3):
              <b
                >Abraham believed God and it was reputed to him unto justice.</b
              >
              Here it should be noted that justice consists in paying a debt.
              Now man is indebted to God and to himself and to his neighbor. But
              it is on account of God that he owes something to himself and his
              neighbor. Therefore the highest form of justice is to render to
              God what is God’s. For if you render to yourself or your neighbor
              what you owe and do not do this for the sake of God, you are more
              perverse than just, since you are putting your end in man. Now,
              whatever is in man is from God, namely, intellect and will and.
              the body itself, albeit according to a certain order; because the
              lower is ordained to the higher, and external things to internal,
              namely, to the good of the soul. Furthermore, the highest thing in
              man is his mind. Therefore the first element of justice in a man
              is that a man’s mind be subjected to God, and this is clone by
              faith: “Bringing into captivity every understanding unto the
              obedience of Christ” (2 Cor 10:5).

              Therefore in all things it must be said that God is the first
              principle in justice and that whosoever gives to God, namely, the
              greatest thing that lies in him by submitting the mind to Him,
              such a one is fully just: ‘Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God,
              they are the sons of God” (Rom 8:14). And hence he says, Abraham
              believed God, i.e., submitted his mind to God by faith: “Believe
              God, and he will recover thee: and direct thy way, and trust in
              him” (Sir 2:6); and further on (2:8): “ Ye that fear the Lord
              believe him,”
              <b>and it was reputed to him unto justice,</b>
              i.e., the act of faith and faith itself were for him, as for
              everyone else, the sufficient cause of justice. It is reputed to
              him unto justice by men exteriorly, but interiorly it is wrought
              by God, Who justifies them that have the faith. This he does by
              remitting their sins through charity working in them.

                children of Abraham</b

              imitates his works; therefore, “if you be the children of Abraham,
              do the works of Abraham” (Jn 8:39). But Abraham did not seek to be
              justified through circumcision but through faith. Therefore the
              sons of Abraham are they who seek to be justified by faith. And
              this is what he says: Because Abraham is just through faith, in

              But against this it can be said that the ancient fathers were of
              the works of the Law. Therefore they are under a curse and,
              consequently, damned—which is a Manichean error. Hence it is
              necessary to understand this correctly. And it should be noted
              that the Apostle does not say, “As many as observe the works of
              the Law are under a curse,” because this is false when applied to
              the time of the Law. He says rather:
              <b>As many as are of the works of the Law</b>, i.e., whosoever
              trust in the works of the Law and believe that they are made just
              by them <b>are under a curse</b>. For it is one thing to be of the
              works of the Law and another to observe the Law. The latter
              consists in fulfilling the Law, so that one who fulfills it is not
              under a curse. But to be of the works of the Law is to trust in
              them and place one’s hope in them. And they that are of the Law in
              this way <b>are under a curse</b>, namely, of transgression; not
              that the Law produces the curse, for concupiscence does not come
              from the Law, but the knowledge of sin does, to which we are prone
              through concupiscence banned by the Law. Therefore, inasmuch as
              the Law begets a knowledge of sin and offers no help against sin,
              they are said to be under a curse, since they are powerless to
              escape it by those works.

              Furthermore, some works of the Law are ceremonies carried out in
              the observances; others are works that pertain to morals, with
              which the moral precepts deal. Hence, according to a Gloss, that
              which is said here, namely,
              <b>as many as are of the works of the law, are under a curse,</b>
              is to be understood of ceremonial works and not of moral works. Or
              it should be said that the Apostle is speaking here of all works,
              both ceremonial and moral. For the works are not the cause making
              one to be just before God; rather they are the carrying out and
              manifestation of justice. For no one is made just before God by
              works but by the habit of faith, not acquired but infused. And
              therefore, as many as seek to be justified by works are under a
              curse, because sin is not removed nor anyone justified in the
              sight of God by them, but by the habit of faith vivified by
              charity: “And all these being approved by the testimony of faith,
              received not the promise” (Heb 11:39).

              In another way the passage,
              <b>For it is written</b>.... can be taken not as a proof of the
              proposition but as an exposition of the proof. As if to say: I say
              that they are under a curse, i.e., under that one of which the Law
              says,
              <b
                >For it is written: Cursed is every one, that abideth not in all
                things, which are written in the book of the law to do them,</b
              >
              where the curse is understood to refer to sin. For the Law
              commands that good be done and evils avoided, and by commanding it
              puts one under the obligation without giving the virtue to obey.
              And hence he says, Cursed, as though placed in contact with evil,
              is every one, without exception; because, as it is said in the
              Acts (10:34): “God is not a respector of persons”;
              <b>that abideth not</b> to the end: “He that shall persevere to
              the end” (Mt 24:13); <b>in all things</b>, not in some only,
              because as it is said in James (2: 10): “Whosoever shall keep the
              whole law, but offend in one point, is become guilty of all”;
              <b>which are written in the book of the law to do them,</b>
              not only to believe or will but actually to fulfill them in their
              works: “A good understanding to all that do it” (Ps 110:10). Yet
              the holy patriarchs, although they were of the works of the Law,
              were nevertheless saved by faith in one to come, by trusting in
              His grace and by fulfilling the Law at least spiritually. “For
              Moses,” says a Gloss, “did indeed command many things which no one
              could fulfill, in order to tame the pride of the Jews who said:
              ‘There are many willing and able, but no one to command’.”

              But a difficulty arises about saying
              <b

                written in the book of the law to do them.</b
              >
              For it is said: “Bless, and curse not” (Rom 12:14). 1 answer that
              to curse is nothing else but to say evil. I can therefore say that
              good is evil and evil good, and again, that good is good and evil
              evil. The first is what the Apostle forbids when he says, “Curse
              not,” i.e., do not say that good is evil and evil good. But the
              second is lawful. Hence when we denounce sin, we do indeed curse,
              not by way of calling good evil but by saying that evil is evil.
              Therefore it is lawful to curse a sinner, i.e., to say that he is
              addicted to evil or is evil.

              syllogism in the second figure. Justice is by faith, but the Law
              is not by faith. Therefore the Law cannot justify. With respect to
              this, therefore: First, he states the conclusion when he says,
              <b>But that in the law no one is justified;</b>
              Secondly, the major premise (v. 11):
              <b>because the just man lives by faith;</b>
              <b>Thirdly,</b> the minor (v. 12).

              Therefore he says: I say that by the Law a curse was introduced,
              and yet the Law cannot extricate one from that curse, because it
              is obvious that no one is justified before God by the Law, i.e.,
              through the works of the Law. On this point it should be noted
              that those who rejected the Old Testament took occasion to do so
              from this word. Hence it must be said that no one is justified in
              the Law, i.e., through the Law. For through it came the knowledge
              of sin, as is said in Romans (3:20); but justification came not
              through it: “By the works of the law no flesh shall be justified”
              (Rom 3:20).

              acquisitus, sed per gratiam fidei infusus. Et ideo signanter

                apud Deum</i

              But against this, it is said in James (2:21): “Was not Abraham our
              father justified by works?” I answer that “to be justified” can be
              taken in two senses: either as referring to the execution and
              manifestation of justice, and in this way a man is justified,
              i.e., proved just, by the works performed; or as referring to the
              infused habit of justice, and in this way one is not justified by
              works, since the habit of justice by which a man is justified
              before God is not acquired but infused by the grace of faith.
              Therefore the Apostle says significantly,
              <b>with God,</b>
              because the justice which is before God is interior in the heart,
              whereas the justice which is by works, i.e., which manifests that
              one is just, is before men. And it is in this sense that the
              Apostle says, with God: “For not the hearers of the law, but the
              doers are just before God” (Rom 2:13); “For if Abraham were
              justified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God”
              (Rom 4:2). Thus, therefore, the conclusion of his reasoning is
              obvious, namely, that the Law can not justify.

              vivendi. Et hoc est quod hic dicitur

              Then when he says,
              <b>because the just man lives by faith,</b>
              he presents the major premise, which is based on scriptural
              authority, i.e., Habakkuk (2:4) restated in Romans (1:17) and
              Hebrews (10:38). Apropos of this point it should be noted that in
              man there is a twofold life; namely, the life of nature and the
              life of justice. Now the life of nature is from the soul; hence
              when the soul is separated from the body, the body continues but
              is dead. But the life of justice is through God dwelling in us by
              faith. Therefore the first way in which God is in the soul of man
              is by faith: “He that cometh to God must believe” (Heb 11:6);
              “That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts” (Eph 3:17).
              Accordingly, we say that in the soul the first signs of life
              appear in the works of the vegetal soul, because the vegetal soul
              is the first to be present in a generated animal, as the
              Philosopher says. Similarly, because the first principle whereby
              God exists in us is faith, faith is called the principle of
              living. And this is what he means when he says,
              <b>the just man lives by faith.</b>
              Furthermore, this is to be understood of faith acting through
              love.

              I answer that he is speaking here about keeping the commandments
              of the Law insofar as the Law consists of ceremonial precepts and
              moral precepts. This is the Law that is not of faith. For “faith,”
              as is said in Hebrews (11:1), “is the substance of things to be
              hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.” Therefore,
              strictly speaking, he fulfills the command of faith who does not
              hope to obtain from it anything present and visible, but things
              invisible and eternal. Therefore, because the Law promised earthly
              and present things, as it is said: “If you be willing and will
              hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land” (Is
              1:19), it is not of faith but rather of cupidity or fear,
              especially in regard to those who kept the Law in a carnal manner.
              Nevertheless, some did live spiritually in the Law; but this was
              not because of the Law but because of faith in a mediator.

              is to be done, even though it proclaims something that must be
              believed. Therefore its power is not from faith but from works. He
              proves this on the ground that when the Lord willed to confirm it
              He did not say, “He that believeth,” but “He that doth those
              things, shall live in them.” But the New Law is from faith: “He
              that believeth and is baptized shall be saved” (Mk 16:16).

              Nevertheless, the Law is something fashioned and produced by

              of nature to the works of the intellect. For certain works of the
              intellect appear in the works of nature, not as though natural
              things understand, but because they are moved and ordained to
              reach their end by an intellect. In like manner, in the Old Law
              are contained certain things that are of faith: not that the Jews
              held them precisely as being of faith, but that they held them
              only as protestations and figures of the faith of Christ, in
              virtue of Whose faith the just were saved.

              He says therefore first: All who observed the works of the Law
              were under a curse, as has been said, and they could not be
              delivered by the Law. Hence it was necessary to have someone who
              should set us free, and that one was Christ. Hence he says,
              <b>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law:</b>
              “For what the law could not do, in that it was weak through the

              First of all with respect to the evil of guilt, for Christ
              redeemed us from the evil of guilt. Hence, just as in dying He
              redeemed us from death, so He redeemed us from the evil of guilt
              by being made a curse, i.e., of guilt: not that there was really
              any sin in Him—for “He did not sin, neither was guile found in his
              mouth,” as is said in 1 Peter (2:22) —but only according to the
              opinion of men and particularly the Jews who regarded him as a
              sinner: “If he were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered
              him up to thee” (Jn 18:30). Hence it is said of Him, “Him who knew
              no sin He hath made sin for us” (2 Cor 5:21). But he says,
              <b>a curse</b>, and not “accursed,” to show that the Jews regarded
              Him as the worst type of criminal. Hence it is said, “This man is
              not of God who keepeth not the sabbath,” (Jn 9:16) and “For a good
              work we stone thee not, but for sin and for blasphemy” (Jn 10:33).
              Therefore he says, <b>being made for us a curse</b> in the
              abstract. As though to say: He was made “curse” itself.

              Secondly, it is explained with respect to the evil of punishment.
              For Christ freed us from punishment by enduring our punishment and
              our death which came upon us from the very curse of sin.
              Therefore, inasmuch as He endured this curse of sin by dying for
              us, He is said to have been made a curse for us. This is similar
              to what is said in Romans (8:3): “God sent his own Son in the
              likeness of sinful flesh and of sin,” i.e., of mortal sin; “Him
              who knew no sin,” namely, Christ, Who committed no sin, God
              (namely, the Father) “had made sin for us,” i.e., made Him suffer
              the punishment of sin, when, namely, He was offered for our sins
              (2 Cor 5:21).

              This is from Deuteronomy (21:23). Here it should be noted,
              according to a Gloss, that in Deuteronomy, from which this passage
              is taken, our version as well as the Hebrew version has: “Cursed
              by God is everyone that hangs on a tree.” However, the phrase “by
              God” is not found in the ancient Hebrew volumes. Hence it is

              Christ in order to defame Him.

              But it is possible to expound this authority both with respect to
              the evil of punishment and the evil of guilt. Of the evil of
              punishment thus:
              <b>Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree</b>, not precisely
              because he hangs on a tree, but because of the guilt for which he
              hangs. And in this way Christ was thought to be cursed, when He
              hung on the cross, because He was being punished with an
              extraordinary punishment. And according to this explanation, there
              is a continuity with the preceding. For the Lord commanded in
              Deuteronomy that anyone who had been hanged should be taken down
              in the evening; the reason being that this punishment was more
              disgraceful and ignominious than any other. He is saying,
              therefore: Truly was He made a curse for us, because the death of
              the cross which He endured is tantamount to a curse—thus
              explaining the evil of guilt, although it was only in the minds of
              the Jews—because it is written:
              <b>Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree.</b>
              But with respect to the evil of punishment,
              <b>Cursed is everyone that hangeth on a tree</b>
              is explained thus: The punishment itself is a curse, namely, that
              He should die in this way. Explained in this way, He was truly
              cursed by God, because God decreed that He endure this punishment
              in order to set us free.

              curse of the Law, to receive the blessing promised to Abraham: “In
              thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed” (Gen 22:
              18). And this blessing was made to us, i.e., fulfilled, through
              Christ, Who is of the seed of Abraham to whom the promises were
              made
              <b>and to thy seed, who is Christ,</b>
              as is said below (v. 16). Now this blessing, this fruit, is
              <b>that we may receive the promise of the Spirit,</b>
              i.e., the promises which the Holy Spirit, given to us as a pledge

              promises to us, as is said in Ephesians (Ch. 1) and in 2

              guarantee, for a pledge is an assured promise concerning something
              to be received: “For you have not received the spirit of bondage
              again in fear, but you have received the spirit of adoption of
              sons” (Rom 8:15), and, “and if sons, heirs also” (v. 17). Or:

              inheritance: He that cometh to God must believe that He is, and is
              a rewarder to them that seek him” (Heb 11:6). Through faith, too,
              we receive the Holy Spirit, because as is said in Acts (Ch. 5),
              the Lord gives the Holy Spirit to those who obey Him, namely,
              through faith.

                15 Brethren (I speak after the manner of man), yet a man’s
                testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor addeth to
                it. 16 To Abraham were the promises made and to his seed. He
                saith not: And to his seeds, as of many; but as of one: And to
                thy seed, which is Christ. 17 Now this I say: that the testament
                which was confirmed by God, the law which was made after four
                hundred and thirty years doth not disannul, to make the promise
                of no effect. 18 For, if the inheritance be of the law, it is no
                more of promise. But God gave it to Abraham by promise.

              Apostle then proves the same point with human reasons. Concerning

              He says therefore: It is clear that up to now I have been speaking
              according to the authority of Sacred Scripture, which came not by
              the will of man, but by the Holy Spirit, as is said in 2 Peter
              (1:21). But now
              <b>I speak after the manner of man</b> and after the manners which
              human reason and human custom follow. Here, indeed, we have an
              argument to show that in discussions bearing on faith, we may use
              any truth of any science: “If thou seest in the number of the
              captives a beautiful woman and lovest her and wilt have her to
              wife, thou shalt bring her into thy house,” i.e., if you are
              pleased with worldly wisdom and science, bring it within your
              boundaries, “and she shall shave her hair, and pare her nails,”
              i.e., you shall cut away all erroneous opinions (Deut 21:11). This
              is why in many places in his epistles the Apostle uses the
              authority of the Gentiles; for example: “Evil communications
              corrupt good manners” (1 Cor 15:33), and “The Cretans are always
              liars, evil beasts, slothful bellies” (Tit. 1: 12).

              <b>To Abraham were the promises made</b>. As if to say: As the
              testament of a man is valid, so the divine promises are valid. But
              did God make any promises before the Law? He did; because
              <b>To Abraham</b> who lived before the time of the Law
              <b>the promises were spoken</b>, i.e., made,
              <b>and to his seed</b>, by God. However, they were made to Abraham
              as the one for whom they would be fulfilled, and to his seed as
              the one through whom they would be fulfilled. And he says,
              <b>promises</b>, using the plural, because the promise that his
              seed would be blessed contained a number of things: or because the
              same thing, namely, eternal happiness, was promised to him on a
              number of occasions. For example, “In thee shall all the kindred
              of the earth be blessed” (Gen 12:3); “Look up to heaven and number
              the stars if thou canst. So shall thy seed be” (Gen 15:5). Again:
              “To thy seed will I give this land” (Gen 15:18); “I will bless
              thee and I will multiply thy seed as the stars of heaven” (Gen
              22:17). These promises then, are God’s treatment, as it were,
              i.e., a decree concerning the inheritance to be given to Abraham
              and his seed.

                “And to thy seed.”</b

              He explains this according to the very spirit in which the
              testament was made. And this is obvious from the words of the
              testament:
              <b>He saith not: “and to his seeds, as of many</b>, i.e., as He
              would do, if it were valid for many:
              <b>but as of one: “And to thy seed,” which is Christ</b>, because
              He is the only one through Whom and in Whom all could be blessed.
              For He alone and exclusively is the one who does not lie under the
              curse of guilt, in spite of the fact that He deigned to be made a
              curse for us. Hence it is said, “I am alone until I pass” (Ps 140:
              10); and again “There is none that doth good, no not one” (Ps
              13:3); “One man among a thousand I have found” (namely, Christ,
              Who had been without any sin), “a woman among them all I have not
              found,” who would be entirely immune from all sin, at least
              original or venial (Eccl. 7:29).

                God</b
              >, he draws his conclusion. Here let us see, in order, what it is
              that he says. He says therefore that this is what God promised to
              Abraham. But this is a <b>testament</b>, i.e., a promise that he
              would obtain an inheritance: I will make a new covenant with the
              house of Israel and with the house of Juda” (Jer 31:31). He says,
              <b>confirmed</b> (in keeping with what he said above, namely,
              <b
                >a man’s testament, if it be confirmed, no man despiseth nor
                addeth to it) by God,</b
              >
              i.e., by the One who promised.
              <b>The testament was confirmed</b>, namely, with an oath: “By my
              own self have I sworn” (Gen 22:16); “That by two immutable things
              in which it is impossible for God to lie, we may have the
              strongest comfort” (Heb 6:18). This testament, I say, the Law doth
              not disannul: <b>the law</b>, namely, <b>which was made</b> and
              given by God through Moses: “For the law was given by Moses” (Jn
              1:17)
              <b>after four hundred thirty years.</b>
              Then, as if to explain what he had said, he adds,
              <b>doth not disannul to make the promise of no effect</b>. For the
              aforesaid testament would have been disannulled if the promise
              made to Abraham were set aside, i.e., made fruitless, as though
              the seed promised to Abraham were not enough to bless the
              Gentiles. But as a matter of fact, the promises made to the
              patriarchs were not set aside by Christ but confirmed: “For I say
              that Christ Jesus was minister of the circumcision to confirm the
              promises made unto the fathers” (Rom 15:8); “For all the promises
              of God are in him ‘It is’” (2 Cor 1:20).
              <b>After four hundred thirty years—</b>
              this concords with Exodus (12:40): “The abode of the children of
              Israel that they made in Egypt was four hundred thirty years,” and
              with Acts (7:6): “And God said to him,” i.e., to Abraham, “that
              his seed should sojourn in a strange country and that they shall
              bring them under bondage four hundred thirty years.”

              Respondeo. Dicendum quod si fiat computatio annorum a prima
              promissione facta Abrahae, quae legitur Gen. XII, usque ad exitum
              filiorum Israel de Aegypto, quando data est lex, sic sunt anni
              quadringenti triginta, sicut hic scribitur, et Ex. XII, et Act. c.
              VII. Si autem incipiat computatio a nativitate Isaac de qua
              legitur Gen. XXI, sic sunt tantum quadringenti et quinque anni.
              Nam viginti quinque anni fuerunt a promissione facta Abrahae usque
              ad nativitatem Isaac. Abraham enim erat septuaginta quinque
              annorum quando exivit de terra sua, et facta est ei prima
              promissio, ut habetur Gen. XII. Centenarius autem fuit, quando
              natus est Isaac, ut habetur ibidem cap. XXI. Quod autem a
              nativitate Isaac usque ad exitum filiorum Israel de Aegypto
              fuerint quadringenti quinque anni, probatur per hoc, quod Isaac
              fuit sexaginta annorum quando genuit Iacob, ut habetur Gen. XXV;
              Iacob autem erat centum triginta annorum quando intravit Aegyptum,
              ut habetur Gen. XXVII. Et sic a nativitate Isaac usque ad
              introitum Iacob in Aegyptum fuerunt centum nonaginta anni. Ioseph
              autem fuit triginta annorum, quando stetit coram Pharaone, ut
              habetur Gen. XLI. Et postea transierunt septem anni fertilitatis
              et duo sterilitatis, usque ad ingressum Iacob in Aegyptum, ut
              habetur XLV. Vixit autem Ioseph centum et decem annis, ut habetur
              Gen. ult. A quibus si subtrahantur triginta novem anni, remanent
              septuaginta et unus annus. Fuerunt ergo a nativitate Isaac usque
              ad mortem Ioseph ducenti et sexaginta unus annus. Fuerunt autem in
              Aegypto filii Israel post mortem Ioseph centum quadraginta quatuor
              annis, ut Rabanus dicit in Glossa. Fuerunt ergo a nativitate Isaac
              usque ad exitum filiorum Israel de Aegypto et legem datam
              quadringenti et quinque anni; Scriptura autem non curavit de
              minutis. Vel potest dici, quod quinto anno Isaac expulsus fuit
              Ismael, et remansit solus Isaac haeres Abrahae, a quo tempore
              fuerunt quadringenti anni.

              I answer that if you count the years between the first promise
              made to Abraham (Genesis Ch. 12), and the exodus of the children
              of Israel from Egypt (when the Law was given) there will be four
              hundred thirty years, as is written here and in Exodus (Ch. 12)
              and Acts (Ch. 7). But if you begin to count from the birth of
              Isaac, concerning which Genesis (Ch. 21) speaks, there are only
              four hundred five years. For twenty-five years elapsed between the
              promise made to Abraham and the birth of Isaac: for Abraham was
              seventy-five years old when he left his own country and the first
              promise was made to him, as is recorded in Ch. 21 of Genesis; and
              he was one hundred years old when Isaac was born, as is recorded
              in the same chapter. That there were four hundred five years
              between the birth of Isaac and the exodus of the children of
              Israel from Egypt is proved by the fact that Isaac was sixty years
              old when he begot Jacob, as is had in Genesis (Ch. 25). Jacob, on
              the other hand, was one hundred thirty years old when he entered
              Egypt, as is recorded in Genesis (Ch. 47). Therefore from the
              birth of Isaac to Jacob’s entry into Egypt were one hundred ninety
              years. Now Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before
              Pharaoh, as is recorded in Genesis (Ch. 41). After that there were
              seven years of plenty and two of want; and it was after that that
              Jacob came to Egypt, as is recorded in Genesis (Ch. 45). But
              Joseph lived one hundred ten years, as is mentioned in the final
              chapter of Genesis. If thirty-nine years be subtracted from this
              there remain seventy-one years. Consequently from the birth of
              Isaac to Joseph’s death there were two hundred sixty-one years.
              Furthermore, the children of Israel remained in Egypt for one
              hundred forty-four more years after Joseph’s death, as Rabanus
              says in a Gloss on the Acts (Ch. 7). Therefore from the birth of
              Isaac to the exodus from Egypt and the giving of the Law four
              hundred five years elapsed. However, the scripture in Genesis (Ch.
              17) was not concerned with minutiae. Or it can be said that during
              Isaac’s fifth year Ishmael was cast forth, leaving Isaac the sole
              heir of Abraham. Reckoning from this date, we have our four
              hundred years.

                promise</b
              >, he shows how from the foregoing it follows that the Law would
              nullify the promises, if the Law were necessary for justification
              or for the blessing to come to the Gentiles. He says therefore:
              The promise would indeed be disannulled, if the Law were
              necessary; for <b>if the inheritance</b>, namely, of Abraham’s
              blessing, <b>be of the law, it is no more of promise</b>, i.e., of
              the seed promised to Abraham. For if the seed promised to Abraham
              was enough to obtain the inheritance of the blessing, there would
              not be justification through the Law. He rejects the consequent,
              when he says, <b>But God gave it to Abraham</b>, i.e., He promised
              that He would give it; but the promise was as sure as if it had
              been fulfilled then and there, <b>by promise</b>, i.e., through
              the seed promised. Therefore the inheritance, i.e., the blessing
              (about which it is said in 1 Peter (3:9): “For unto this are you
              called, that you may inherit a blessing”) is not of the Law.

              Tim. I, 9:
              <i>iusto lex non est posita, sed iniustis</i>. Cuius ratio potest
              sumi a philosopho in IV Ethicorum. Homines enim bene dispositi ex
              seipsis moventur ad bene agendum, et sufficiunt eis paterna
              monita, unde non indigent lege: sed, sicut Rom. II, 14 dicitur,
              <i
                >ipsi sibi sunt lex, habentes opus legis scriptum in cordibus
                suis</i

              With respect to the first, it should be noted that the Old Law was
              given for a fourfold purpose, corresponding to the four
              consequences of sin enumerated by Bede, namely, because of
              wickedness, weakness, passion, and ignorance. Hence the Law was
              given first of all to suppress wickedness, since by forbidding sin
              and by punishing, it restrained men from sin. This he touches on
              when he says,
              <b>The law was set because of transgressions</b>, i.e., to prevent
              them. On this point it is said: “The law is not made for the just
              man but for the unjust” (1 Tim 1:9). The reason for this can be
              taken from <i>Ethics IV</i> of the Philosopher. For men who are
              well disposed, are inclined to act well of themselves, so that
              fatherly admonitions are enough for them: hence they do not need a
              law; indeed, as it is said, “They are a law to themselves who show
              the work of the law written in their hearts” (Rom 2:14).

              de duobus praesumebant. Primo quidem de scientia, secundo de
              potentia. Et ideo Deus reliquit homines absque doctrina legis,

              est eorum superbia de defectu scientiae, sed adhuc restabat
              praesumptio de potentia. Dicebant enim
              <i>non deest qui impleat, sed deest qui iubeat</i>, ut dicitur in
              Glossa super illud Ex. XXIV:
              <i>quicquid praeceperit dominus, faciemus, et erimus obedientes</i
              >. Et ideo data est lex, quae cognitionem peccati faceret,
              <i>per legem enim cognitio peccati</i>, Rom. III, 20. Quae tamen
              auxilium gratiae non dabat ad vitandum peccata, ut sic homo sub
              lege constitutus et vires suas experiretur, et infirmitatem suam
              recognosceret, inveniens se sine gratia peccatum vitare non posse,
              et sic avidius quaereret gratiam. Et haec etiam causa potest ex
              his verbis accipi, ut dicatur, quod lex posita est propter
              transgressiones adimplendas, quasi illo modo loquendo quo
              apostolus dicit Rom. c. V, 20:
              <i>lex subintravit ut abundaret delictum</i>; quod non est
              intelligendum causaliter, sed consecutive: quia lege subintrante,
              abundavit delictum, et transgressiones sunt multiplicatae, dum
              concupiscentia nondum per gratiam sanata, in id quod prohibebatur,
              magis exarsit, et factum est peccatum gravius, addita
              praevaricatione legis scriptae. Et hoc Deus permittebat, ut
              homines imperfectionem suam cognoscentes, quaererent mediatoris
              gratiam. Unde signanter dicit <i>posita est</i>, quasi debito
              ordine collocata inter legem naturae et legem gratiae.

              Secondly, the Law was set down in order to disclose human
              weakness. For men gloried in two things: First, in their
              knowledge; and secondly, in their power. Hence God left men
              without the instruction of the Law during the period of the Law of
              nature, during which time, as they fell into errors, their pride
              was convinced of its lack of knowledge, even though they still
              presumed on their powers. For they said, “Many are willing and
              able, but there is no one to lead,” as a Gloss says on Exodus
              (24:8): “All things that the Lord hath spoken we will do. We will
              be obedient.” And therefore the Law was given which would cause a
              knowledge of sin, “for by the law is the knowledge of sin” (Rom
              3:20). But it did not give the help of grace to avoid sin, so that
              man, bound by the Law, might test his strength and recognize his
              infirmity. Finding that without grace he was unable to avoid sin,
              he would more ardently yearn for grace. And this cause can also be
              derived from these words, if they are taken to mean that the Law
              was set for the sake of filling up transgressions, in the sense in
              which the Apostle speaks when he says: “Now the law entered in
              that sin might abound” (Rom 5:20). This is to be taken not in a
              causal but in a sequential sense; for after the Law entered in,
              sin abounded and transgressions multiplied, because concupiscence,
              not yet healed by grace, lusted after that which was forbidden,
              with the result that sin became more grievous, being now a
              violation of a written law. But God permitted this in order that
              men, recognizing their own imperfection, might seek the grace of a
              mediator. Hence he says significantly, It was set, i.e.,
              interposed, as it were, between the Law of nature and the Law of
              grace.

              disposition of angels” (Acts 7:53). And it was given by angels,

              greater: “For if the word spoken by angels became steadfast... how
              shall we escape if we neglect so great salvation? Which, having

              Then when he says,
              <b>Now a mediator is not of one</b>, he explains what he meant
              when he said, <b>in the hand of a mediator</b>. This can be
              explained in three ways. In one way, that a mediator is not of one
              alone but of two. Hence, since He is the mediator of God and men,
              it was fitting that He be God and man. For were he purely man or
              solely God, He would not be a true mediator. Therefore, if He is
              true God, then since no one is his own mediator, someone might
              suppose that there are, besides Him, other gods of whom He was the
              mediator. But this he forestalls when he says that although this
              <b>mediator is not of one</b>
              only, there are not on that account other gods,
              <b>but God is one</b>, because, although He is distinct in person
              from God the Father, He is not distinct in nature: “Hear, O
              Israel: the Lord our God is one Lord” (Deut 6:4); “One Lord, one
              faith, one baptism” (Eph 4:6).

                justice should have been by the law. 22 But the scripture hath
                concluded all under sin, that the promise, by the faith of Jesus
                Christ, might be given to them that believe. 23 But, before the
                faith came, we were kept under the law shut up, unto that faith
                which was to be revealed. 24 Wherefore the law was our pedagogue
                in Christ; that we might be justified by faith. 25 But, after
                the faith is come, we are no longer under a pedagogue.

              If the Law was set because of transgressions, does the Law go
              counter to the promises of God, namely, so that what God promised
              He would do through the promised seed, He would do through

              <b>The law doth not disannul to make the promise of no effect</b>
              (3:17); “The law, indeed is holy and the commandment holy” (Rom

              He says, therefore, that although the Law was set because of
              transgressions, nevertheless, it is not contrary to the promise of
              God in being unable to remove those transgressions. For if it were
              to remove them, then it would obviously be against the promises of
              God, because justice would be obtained by means other than God
              promised, since it would be through the Law and not through faith;
              whereas it is said: “The just shall live in his faith” (Hab. 2:4);
              “The justice of God is by faith of Jesus Christ” (Rom 3:22). Hence
              he says that
              <b>if there had been a law given such that it could</b>
              give life, i.e., of such power as to confer grace and eternal
              happiness, then verily and not seemingly, justice should have been
              by the law, if the Law were to effect what faith is said to
              effect. Thus faith would serve no end. But the Law does not give
              life, because “the letter of the law killeth,” as is said in 2 Cor
              (3:6); “For the law of the spirit of life, in Christ Jesus, hath
              delivered me from the law of sin and of death” (Rom 8:2).

              Circa primum sciendum est, quod lex obsequitur promissis Dei in

              20:
              <i>per legem cognitio peccati</i>. Deinde quia manifestat
              infirmitatem humanam, in quantum homo non potest vitare peccatum,
              nisi per gratiam, quae per legem non dabatur. Et sicut ista duo,
              scilicet cognitio morbi et impotentia infirmi, multum inducunt ad
              quaerendum medicum, ita cognitio peccati et propriae impotentiae
              inducunt ad quaerendum Christum. Sic ergo lex obsecuta est
              gratiae, inquantum praebuit cognitionem peccati et experientiam
              propriae impotentiae. Et ideo dicit <i>Scriptura</i>, id est lex
              scripta, <i>conclusit</i>, id est tenuit inclusos Iudaeos,

              solum Iudaeis, sed omnibus <i>credentibus</i>, quia illa gratia
              poterat liberare a peccatis, et haec gratia est
              <i>ex fide Iesu Christi</i>.

            <td>
              With respect to the first it should be noted that in general the
              Law serves the promises of God in two ways. First, because it
              exposes sin: “For by the law is the knowledge of sin” (Rom 3:20).
              Secondly, because it reveals human infirmity, in the sense that
              man cannot avoid sin without grace which was not given by the Law.
              And just as these two things, namely, the knowledge of a disease
              and the infirmity of the patient is a great inducement to seek
              medical treatment, so the knowledge of sin and of one’s impotency
              lead us to seek Christ. Thus, therefore, is the Law the servant of
              grace, inasmuch as it affords a knowledge of sin and actual
              experience of one’s impotency. Hence he says,
              <b>the scripture,</b> i.e., the written Law,
              <b>hath concluded,</b> i.e., held the Jews enclosed,
              <b>under sin</b>, i.e., showed them the sins they committed: “For
              I had not known concupiscence, if the Law did not say: Thou shalt
              not covet” (Rom 7:7). Again, <b>hath concluded,</b> because with
              the coming of the Law they took occasion to sin: “For God hath
              concluded all in unbelief, that He may have mercy on all” (Rom
              11:32). And all this in order that they would search for grace.
              Hence he says, <b>so that the promise,</b> i.e., the promised
              grace, <b>might be given</b> not only to the Jews, but to all them
              that believe, because that grace was able to free from sin; and
              this grace is
              <b>by the faith of Jesus Christ.</b>

              He says therefore: If the scripture, i.e., the written Law, kept
              all things shut up under sin, what benefits did the Jews derive
              from the Law before faith came by grace? He answers and says:
              <b>We</b> Jews, before the coming of faith,
              <b>were kept under the law,</b>
              inasmuch as it made us avoid idolatry and many other evils; we
              were shut up, I say, not as free men, but as servants under fear;
              and this
              <b>under the law,</b> i.e., under the burden and domination of the
              Law: “The law hath dominion over a man as long as it liveth” (Rom
              7:1). And we were kept shut up, i.e., protected, in order that we
              not be cut off from life, but be made ready
              <b>unto that faith which was to be revealed</b>: “My salvation is
              near to come and my justice to be revealed” (Is 56:1). And he
              says, <b>to be revealed</b>, because, since faith surpasses all
              human ingenuity, it cannot be acquired by one’s own skill, but by
              revelation and by the gift of God: “The glory of the Lord shall be
              revealed, and all flesh together shall see that the mouth of the
              Lord hath spoken” (Is 40:5). Or, <b>unto that faith</b>, which was
              to be revealed in the time of grace, but which in olden times was
              hidden under many signs. Hence in the time of Christ the veil of
              the temple was rent (Mt 27:51).

              For as long as the heir cannot obtain the benefits of his
              inheritance, either because be is too young or because of some
              other shortcoming, he is sustained, and guarded by a tutor called
              a pedagogue, from
              <i>paedos</i> (boy) and <i>goge</i> (a guiding). For under the Law
              the just were restrained from evil, as helpless boys are, through
              fear of punishment; and they were led to progress in goodness by
              the love and promise of temporal goods. Further, the Jews were
              promised that through a seed that was to come the blessing of an
              inheritance would be obtained, but the time for obtaining that
              inheritance had not yet come. Consequently, it was necessary that
              until the seed should come, they be kept safe and not do unlawful
              things. And this was effected by the Law. And therefore he says,
              <b>Whrefore the law was our pedagogue.</b>
              As if to say: By being kept shut up under the Law,
              <b>the law was our pedagogue</b>, i.e., it guided and preserved
              us, <b>in Christ</b>, i.e., in the way of Christ. And this was
              done in order
              <b>that we might be justified by the faith</b>
              of Christ: “Israel was a child and I loved him” (Hos 11:1); “Thou
              hast chastised me and I was instructed” (Jer 31:18); “For we
              account a man to be justified by faith without the works of the
              law” (Rom 3:28). And although the Law was our pedagogue, it did
              not bring us the full inheritance, because as is said in Hebrews
              (7:19): “The law brought nothing to perfection.” But the Law’s
              function ended after faith came. Hence he says,
              <b>But, after the faith is come</b>, namely, of Christ,
              <b>we are no longer under a pedagogue</b>, i.e., under constraint,
              which is not necessary for those who are free: “When I was a
              child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a
              child, but when I became a man I put away the things of a child”
              (1 Cor 13:11); “If then any be in Christ a new creature, the old
              things are passed away” (2 Cor 5:17).

              He says therefore: Verily, we are not under the Law, i.e., under a
              pedagogue, or under restraint, because we are the sons of God. In
              like manner, you, too, are neither under the Law nor under a
              pedagogue; for you have attained to grace. Hence
              <b>you are all the children of God by faith</b> and not through
              the Law: “For you have not received the spirit of bondage” (i.e.,
              of fear which was given in the Old Law), “but you have received
              the spirit of adoption of sons,” namely, of charity and love which
              is given in the New Law through faith (Rom 8:15); “He gave them
              power to be made the sons of God, to them that believe in his
              name” (Jn 1: 12). If, then, you are the sons of God by faith, why
              do you wish to become slaves by the observances of the Law? For
              faith alone makes man the adopted son of God. Indeed, no one is an
              adopted son unless he is united to and cleaves to the natural son:
              “For whom he foreknew, he also predestinated to be made
              conformable to the image of his Son; that he might be the
              firstborn among many brethren” (Rom 8:29). For faith makes us sons
              in Jesus Christ: “That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts”
              (Eph 3:17). And this <b>in Christ Jesus,</b> i.e., you are sons of
              God through Jesus Christ.

              With respect to the first, he shows how we are sons of God in
              Christ Jesus. And he says:
              <b

                Christ.</b
              >
              Now this can be explained in four ways. In one way, so that
              <b>as many of you as have been baptized in Christ</b>
              means that it was by Christ’s appointment that you have been
              instructed for baptism: “Go ye into the whole world and preach the
              gospel to every creature. He that believeth and is baptized shall
              be saved” (Mk 16:16). In another way,
              <b
                >as many of you as have been baptized in Christ have put on
                Christ,</b
              >
              i.e., through a likeness and a configuration of the death of
              Christ: “We who are baptized in Christ Jesus are baptized in his
              death” (Rom 6:3). Or: in Christ Jesus, i.e., in the faith of
              Christ. For baptism comes about only through faith, without which
              we derive no effect from baptism: “He that believeth and is
              baptized shall be saved; but he that believeth not shall be
              condemned” (Mk 16:16). Or:
              <b>in Christ Jesus,</b> i.e., through His power and operation: “He
              upon whom thou shalt see the Spirit descending, he it is that
              baptizeth” (Jn 1:33). Therefore, as many
              <b>of you as have been baptized</b> in any of those four ways
              <b>have put on Christ.</b>

              Here it should be noted that when someone puts on clothing he is
              protected and covered by it and his appearance is that of the
              color of the clothing instead of his own. In the same way,
              everyone who puts on Christ is protected and covered by Christ
              Jesus against attack and against the heat; furthermore in such a
              one nothing appears except what pertains to Christ: “Put ye on the
              Lord Jesus Christ” (Rom 13:14). Again, just as burning wood takes
              on fire and shares in fire’s activity, so he who receives the
              virtues of Christ has put on Christ: “Stay you in the city till
              you be endued with power from on high” (Lk 24:49). This applies to
              those who are inwardly clothed with the virtue of Christ: “Put on
              the new man, who according to God is created in justice and
              holiness of truth” (Eph 4:24). And note that some put on Christ

              He elucidates this teaching when he says,

              three differences among men to show that no one is excluded from
              faith in Christ by any of them: the first difference concerns
              one’s rite. Hence he says:
              <b>There is neither Jew nor Greek.</b>
              As if to say: Since you have been baptized in Christ, the rite
              from which you came to Christ, whether it was the Jewish or the
              Greek, is no ground for saying that anyone occupies a less
              honorable place in the faith: “Is he the God of the Jews only? Is
              he not also of the Gentiles? Yes, of the Gentiles also. For there
              is one God that justifieth circumcision by faith and
              uncircumcision through faith” (Rom 3:29). Again: “There is no
              distinction of the Jew and Greek; for the same is Lord over all”
              (Rom 10:12).

              But this seems to militate against what is said in Romans (3:1):
              ‘What advantage then hath the Jew? Much every way.” I answer that
              Jews and Greeks can be considered in two ways. First, according to
              the state in which they were before faith. In this way, the Jew
              was greater because of the benefits he derived from the Law. In
              another way, according to the state of grace; and in this way, the
              Jew is not greater. And this is the sense in which it is taken
              here.

              The underlying reason for this explanation is set forth when he
              says,
              <b>For you are all one in Christ Jesus.</b>
              As if to say: Truly, none of these things makes a difference in
              Christ, because all of you, i.e., believers, are one in Christ
              Jesus, because through baptism you have all been made members of
              Christ and you form one body, even though you are distinct
              individuals: “So we, being many, are one body in Christ, and
              everyone members one of another” (Rom 12:5); “One body, one
              Spirit, as you are called in one hope of your calling” (Eph 4:4).
              Now where there is unity, difference has no place. Indeed it was
              for this unity that Christ prayed: “That they all may be one, as
              thou, Father, in me, and I in thee” (Jn 17:21).

              are the children of the flesh are the children of God; but they
              that are the children of the promise are accounted for the seed”

              <b>long as the heir is a child.</b> This is applied and referred
              both to the Jewish people—who were the heirs of the promise to
              Abraham: “For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself; Israel for
              his own possession” (Ps 134:4)—and to Christ, Who is the heir of

              Secundo eius parvitatem. Unde dicit
              <i>parvulus est</i>, quia et Iudaei parvuli erant secundum statum
              legis. Amos VII, 5:
              <i>quis suscitabit Iacob, quia parvulus est?</i>

              apostolus aliquando assimilat parvulo statum legis, sicut hic,
              aliquando statum praesentis vitae. I Cor. XIII, v. 11:
              <i>cum essem parvulus</i>, et cetera. Cuius ratio est, quia status
              veteris legis est sicut parvulus, propter imperfectionem
              cognitionis, in ipsa comparatione ad statum gratiae et veritatis,

              comparatus statui futurae vitae, in qua est perfecta Dei cognitio,

              Secondly, smallness; hence he says,
              <b>is a child</b>, because the Jews were children according to the
              state of the Law: “Who shall raise up Jacob, for he is a little
              one?” (Am 7:5). Similarly, Christ, too, was become a child through
              the Incarnation: “For a child is born to us and a son is given to
              us” (Is 9:6). But note that the Apostle sometimes compares the
              state of the Law to a child, as he does here, and sometimes the
              state of the present life: “When I was a child, I spoke as a
              child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child” (1 Cor
              13:11). The reason for this is that the state of the Old Law,
              because of the imperfection of knowledge, is as a child, compared
              to the state of grace and truth which came through Christ. In like
              manner, the state of the present life, in which we see through a
              mirror in a dark manner, is as a child, compared to the state of
              the future life, in which there is perfect knowledge of God,
              because He is seen as He Is

                governors.</b

              For a servant is one who is subject to a lord. But a boy, as long
              as he is a child, because he does not have fulness of knowledge
              and use of free will through lack of years, is committed to the
              care of others who defend his possessions—and these are called
              tutors—and who handle his affairs-and these are called governors.
              Therefore, though he be lord of all his things, yet, in so far as
              he is subject to others, he differs nothing from a servant,
              because he does not have free will but is in fact constrained. And
              this is applied to the Jewish people: “And now hear, O Jacob, my
              servant” (Is 44:1).

              dominus omnium, secundum illud Ps. CIX, v. 1:
              <i>dixit dominus domino meo</i>, etc., tamen nihil videbatur
              differre a servo in exterioribus, inquantum homo. Phil. II, 7:
              <i

                inventus ut homo</i

              erat, ut dicitur infra eodem, <i>factum sub lege</i>, et hominibus
              subditus, ut dicitur Lc. II, 51: <i>erat subditus illis</i>.

              Here it should be noted that among the Jewish people some were
              servants in the strict sense; those, namely, who observed the Law
              through fear of punishment and through a desire for the temporal
              things which the Law promised. But there were others who were not
              servants in the strict sense, but living as servants, were really
              sons and heirs. These, although outwardly attending to temporal
              things and avoiding punishments, did not place their end in them
              but took them as a figure of spiritual goods. Hence, even though
              on the surface they seemed to differ nothing from servants,
              inasmuch as they observed the ceremonies and other commandments of
              the Law, they were, nevertheless, lords, because they did not use
              them with the same frame of mind as servants; for they used them
              for love of the spiritual goods they prefigured, whereas servants
              used them chiefly through fear of punishment and with a desire for
              earthly convenience. Christ, too was like a servant, because
              although He is the Lord of all things according to Psalm (109:1):
              “The Lord said to my Lord,” nevertheless outwardly, as man, He
              seemed to differ nothing from a servant: “He emptied himself,
              taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men,
              and in habit found as a man” (Phil 2:7). Furthermore, he was under
              tutors and governors, because He was made under the Law, as is
              said below: made under the law (v. 4); He was also subject to men,
              as is said in Luke (2:51): “He was subject to them.”

              was to endure and how long the heir, i.e., the Jewish people,
              where to be under it. Similarly, there was a time fixed by the

              Or the Old Law is called “element,” because just as boys who are
              to be trained in a science are first taught the elements of that
              science and through them are brought to the fulness of science, so
              to the Jews was proposed the Old Law through which they would be
              brought to faith and justice:
              <b>the law was our pedagogue in Christ</b>
              (3:24). Or,
              <b>under the elements</b>, i.e., the corporeo-religious usages
              which they observed, such as days of the moon, new moons and the
              Sabbath. But one should not object that on this account they
              differed nothing from the pagans who served the elements of this
              world, for the Jews did not serve them or pay them worship; but
              under them they served and worshipped God, whereas the pagans in
              serving the elements rendered them divine worship: “They
              worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is
              blessed forever” (Rom 1:25). Furthermore, it was necessary that
              the Jews serve God under the elements of this world, because such
              an order is in harmony with human nature which is led from
              sensible to intelligible things.

              Ps. LXIV, 10: <i>flumen Dei repletum est aquis</i>, et cetera.

              quod dicit <i>at ubi venit plenitudo temporis</i>, etc., similiter
              et in aliis Scripturae locis, ubi tempus circa Christum impleri
              dicitur, non est referendum ad fatalem necessitatem, sed ad
              divinam ordinationem, de qua dicitur in Ps. CXVIII, 91:

              It should be noted that above, in the simile he proposed, there
              were four items pointed out in order, as has been said. But now,
              in applying them to Christ, he begins with the last, namely, the
              fixing of a time. The reason for this is that the time in which
              Christ was humiliated and in which the faithful were exalted turns
              out to be the same. Hence he says:
              <b>But, when the fulness of the time was come,</b>
              i.e., after the time fixed by God the Father for sending His Son
              had been accomplished. This is bow it is taken in Luke (2:6): “Her
              days were accomplished, that she should be delivered.” This time
              is called “full” because of the fulness of the graces that are
              given in it, according to Psalm (64:10): “The river of God is
              filled with water; thou hast prepared their food: for so is its
              preparation.” Also because of the fulfillment of the figures of
              the Old Law: I am not come to destroy but to fulfill” (Mt 5:17).
              And because of the fulfillment of the promises: “And he shall
              confirm the covenant with many, in one week” (Dan. 9:27). However,
              the fact that he likewise says,
              <b>But, when the fulness of time was come,</b> in other places of
              Scripture where the time respecting Christ is said to be
              accomplished, should not be explained in terms of a necessity
              imposed by fate, but in terms of a divine ordinance, concerning
              which Psalm (118:91) states: “By thy ordinance the day goeth on;
              for all things serve thee.”

              Two reasons are given why that time was pre-ordained for the
              coming of Christ. One is taken from His greatness: for since He
              that was to come was great, it was fitting that men be made ready
              for His coming by many indications and many preparations. “God,
              who, at sundry times and in divers manners, spoke in times past to
              the fathers by the prophets, last of all in these days hath spoken
              to us by his Son” (Heb 1: 1). The other is taken from the role of
              the one coming: for since a physician was to come, it was fitting
              that before his coming, men should be keenly aware of their
              infirmity, both as to their lack of knowledge during the Law of
              nature and as to their lack of virtue during the written Law.
              Therefore it was fitting that both, namely, the Law of nature and
              the written Law, precede the coming of Christ.

              Similiter non misit eum quasi ministrum, quia sua missio fuit

              say, without His being separated from Him, for He was sent by
              assuming human nature, and yet He was in the bosom of the Father:
              “The only begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father”
              eternally (Jn 1:18); “And no man hath ascended into heaven, but he
              that descended from heaven, the Son of Man, who is in heaven,”
              Who, although He descended by assuming flesh is, nevertheless, in
              heaven (Jn 3:13). Again, <b>He sent</b> Him, not to be where
              before He Was not; because, although He came unto His own by His
              presence in the flesh, yet by the presence of His Godhead, He was
              in the world, as is said in John (1:14). Furthermore, He did not
              send Him as a minister, because His mission was the assuming of
              flesh, not the putting off of majesty. God, therefore, sent His
              Son, I say, to heal the errantry of the concupiscible part and to
              illumine the ignorance of the rational part: “He sent his word and
              healed them: and delivered them from their destructions” (Ps
              106:20). He sent Him also to deliver them from the power of the
              devil against the infirmity of the irascible part: “He shall send
              them a Savior and defender to deliver them” (Is 19:20). Also as a
              deliverer from the chains of eternal death: I will deliver them
              out of the hand of death. I will redeem them from death: O death,
              I will be thy death”’ (Hos. 13:14). Also to save them from their
              sins: “For God sent not his Son into the world to judge the world
              but that the world may be saved by him” (Jn 3:17).

              In interpreting the passage,
              <b>made of woman</b>, two errors must be avoided; namely, that of
              Photinus, who said that Christ was solely man and received the
              beginning of His existence from the Virgin; in other words, that
              Christ was made of a woman as though deriving his beginning
              entirely from her. But this is false, because it contradicts what
              is said in Romans (1:3): “Who was made to him of the seed of
              David, according to the flesh”; he does not say “according to His
              person,” which exists from eternity, namely, the hypostasis of the
              Son of God. Hence, just as when a shield newly comes to be white,
              it is not proper to say that the very substance of the shield
              newly came to be, but that the whiteness newly accrued to it; so
              from the fact that the Son of God newly assumed flesh, it is not
              proper to say that the person of Christ newly came to be, but that
              a human nature newly accrued to that person, as when certain
              things affect a body without that body itself being changed. For
              certain items affect a thing and change it, such as forms and
              absolute qualities; but certain other items affect it without
              changing it. Of this sort is the assuming of flesh precisely as
              bespeaking a relationship. Hence the person of the Word is in no
              way changed by it. That is why in divine matters we employ in a
              temporal sense terms that signify a relationship; thus, we say in
              Psalm (89:1): “Lord, thou hast been our refuge”; or we say that
              God became man. But we do not thus use forms and absolute
              qualities, so as to say: God was made good or wise and so on.

              Furthermore, by saying
              <b>made of a woman</b> two errors are destroyed, namely, that of
              Nestorious saying that Christ did not take His body of the Virgin
              but of the heavens and that He passed through the Blessed Virgin
              as through a corridor or channel. But this is false, for if it
              were true, He would not, as the Apostle says, have been made of a
              woman. By the preposition “of” [ <i>ex</i> ] the material cause is
              denoted. Likewise, the error of Nestorious saying that the Blessed
              Virgin is not the mother of the Son of God but of the son of a
              man. But this is shown to be false by the words of the Apostle
              here, that
              <b>God sent his Son made of a woman.</b>
              Now one who is made of a woman is her son. Therefore, if the Son
              of God was made of a woman, namely, of the Blessed Virgin, it is
              obvious that the Blessed Virgin is the Mother of the Son of God.

              Moreover, although he might have said
              <i>“born</i> of a woman,” he distinctly says <b>made</b>, and not
              “born.” Indeed, for something to be born it must not only be
              produced of a principle conjoined to it but be made from a
              principle separate from it. Thus a wooden chest is <i>made</i> by
              an artisan, but fruit is <i>born</i> from a tree. Now the
              principle of human generation is twofold, namely, material—and as
              to this, Christ proceeded from a conjoined principle, because He
              took the matter of His body from the Virgin; and it is according
              to this that He is said to be born of her: “Of whom [Mary] was
              born Jesus Who is called Christ” (Mt 1:16).—The other is the
              active principle, which in the case of Christ, so far as He had a
              principle, i.e., as to the forming of the body, was not conjoined
              but separate, because the power of the Holy Spirit formed it. And
              with respect to this He is not said to have been born of a woman,
              but made, as it were, from an extrinsic principle. From this it is
              obvious that the saying, <b>of a woman</b>, does not denote a
              defloration; otherwise he would have said “born’ and not “made.”

              Fourthly, he applies the simile as to its aspect of subjection
              when he says,
              <b>made under the law</b>. But here a difficulty comes to mind
              from what is said below, namely: If you are
              <b>led by the spirit, you are not under the law</b>
              (5:18). Hence if Christ is not only spiritual but the giver of the
              Spirit, it seems unbecoming to say that He was made under the Law.
              I answer that “to be under the Law” can be taken in two ways: in
              one way so that “under” denotes the mere observance of the Law,
              and in this sense Christ was made under the Law, because He was
              circumcised and presented in the temple: “I am not come to destroy
              but to fulfill” (Mt 5:17). In another way so that “under” denotes
              oppression. And in this way one is said to be under the Law if he
              is oppressed by fear of the Law. But neither Christ nor spiritual
              men are said to be under the Law in this way.

              Then when he says,
              <b>that he might redeem them who were under the law,</b>
              he sets down the fruit of the reality in which the simile is
              applied, namely, that the reason why He willed they be subject
              during that time was that they might become heirs great and free.
              And he mentions both of these things. First, the fruit of freedom
              as against subjection; hence he says,
              <b>that he might redeem them who were under the law,</b>
              i.e., under the curse and burden of the Law;
              <b
                >Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a
                curse for us</b
              >
              (3:13). Secondly, the fruit of being made great, inasmuch as we
              are adopted as sons of God by receiving the Spirit of God and
              being conformed to Him: “Now if any man have not the Spirit of
              Christ, he is none of His” (Rom 8:9). This adoption belongs in a
              special way to Christ, because we cannot become adopted sons
              unless we are conformed to the natural son: “For whom he foreknew,
              he also predestinated to be made conformable to the image of his
              Son” (Rom 8:29). With this in mind, he says,
              <b>that we might receive the adoption of sons,</b>
              i.e., that through the natural Son of God we might be made adopted
              sons according to grace through Christ.

              And because they might have said that the Galatians had not been
              adopted as sons of God, since Christ did not assume flesh from
              them or preach to them, for that reason the Apostle, elucidating
              the manner of this adoption, says that although they were not
              related to Christ according to the flesh, i.e., according to race,
              or by reason of preaching, yet they were united to him through the
              Spirit and thereby adopted and made sons of God. Hence the
              conversion of the Gentiles is in “a special way attributed to the
              Holy Spirit. Consequently, Peter, when he was blamed by the Jews
              for going to preach to the Gentiles, excused himself through the
              Holy Spirit, saying (Acts 11) that he could not resist the Holy
              Spirit by Whose inspiration he had done this. And so, because

              But it should be noted that if in certain passages of Scripture
              the Holy Spirit is said to be sent by the Father—“But the
              Paraclete, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name”
              (Jn 14:26)—and in others to be sent by the Son—“But when the
              Paraclete cometh, whom I will send you from the Father” (Jn
              15:26)—the Holy Spirit is none the less common to Father and Son
              and proceeds from Both and is sent by Both. Accordingly, wherever
              it is said that the Father sends the Holy Spirit, mention is made
              of the Son, as in the aforesaid passage: “Whom the Father will
              send in my name”; and where He is said to be sent by the Son,
              mention is made of the Father; hence He says, “Whom I will send to
              you from the Father.” Even here, when he says,
              <b>God</b> the Father <b>hath sent the</b> Holy
              <b>Spirit,</b> mention is made at once of the Son, for he adds,
              <b>of his Son.</b> Nor does it matter that at times the Holy
              Spirit is only said to proceed from the Father, for the fact that
              the Son sends Him shows that He proceeds from Him. Accordingly,
              the Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of the Son as of the One
              sending and as of the One from Whom He proceeds, as well as of the
              One from Whom the Holy Spirit has whatever He has, just as of the
              Father: “He shall glorify me, because He shall receive of mine”
              (Jn 16:14).

              generation, i.e., man’s mind or heart, because they are born sons
              of God through a renewal of the mind. Furthermore, the spiritual
              seed is the grace of the Holy Spirit: “Whosoever is born of God
              sinneth not: but the generation of God preserveth him and the
              wicked one toucheth him not” (1 Jn 5:18). This seed contains, in
              effect, the whole perfection of beatitude; hence it is called the
              pledge and earnest of beatitude (Eph 1:14); “I will put a new
              spirit within you” (Ez 36:26).

              the fruit of this gift. First, as to removing all evil, from which
              we are freed through adoption by the Holy Spirit. This is freedom
              from bondage. With respect to this he says: <b>Therefore</b>,
              i.e., because the Spirit cries “Father” in us, <b>now</b>, from
              the time of grace, <b>he</b>, i.e., each one of us who believes in
              Christ, <b>is not a servant</b>, i.e., serving in fear—“I will not
              now call you servants but friends” (Jn 15:15); “You have not
              received the spirit of bondage again in fear: but you have
              received the spirit of adoption of sons” (Rom 8:15)—
              <b>but a son</b>: “For the Spirit himself giveth testimony to our
              spirit that we are the sons of God” (Rom 8:16). For although we be
              in the condition of servants (because it is said in Luke (17:10):
              “When you shall have done all these things that are commanded you,
              say: We are unprofitable servants”), we are not ill-disposed
              servants, i.e., serving in fear—for such a servant is deserving of
              torture and chains—but we are good and faithful servants, serving
              out of love. For that reason we obtain freedom through the Son:
              “If, therefore, the son shall make you free, you shall be free
              indeed” (Jn 8:36).

              <b>through God,</b>
              because as the Jews obtained the inheritance through the promise
              and justice of God, so the Gentiles too received it through God,
              i.e., through the mercy of God: “But the Gentiles are to glorify
              God for his mercy” (Rom 15:9). Or,
              <b>through God</b>, i.e., through the working of God: “Thou hast

              But the statement,
              <b>after you are known by God</b>, seems to cause a difficulty,
              for God has known all things from eternity: “All things were known

              answer that this is said causally, so that the sense is:
              <b>you are known by God,</b> i.e., God has caused you to know Him.
              In this way, God is said to know inasmuch as He is the cause of

              <b>after that you have known God,</b>
              which was a true statement, he immediately amends and explains it
              with a figure of speech by intimating that we cannot know God of
              ourselves save by Him: “No man hath seen God at any time: the only
              begotten Son, Who is in the bosom of the Father, He hath declared

              It should be pointed out that this passage is interpreted in two
              ways: in one way, that those Galatians had turned from the faith
              to idolatry. For this reason he says,
              <b>how turn you</b> from the faith <b>again</b>, i.e., a second
              time. “For it had been better for them not to have known the way
              of justice than, after they have known it, to turn back from that
              holy commandment which was delivered to them” (2 Pet. 2:21); “They
              are turned back” (Is 42:17). <b>To the elements</b>, namely, of
              the world, which are <b>weak</b>, unable by themselves to subsist,
              because they would lapse into nothingness unless upheld by the
              hand which rules all things—“Upholding all things by the word of
              his power” (Heb 1:3)— <b>and needy</b>, because they need God and
              one another to fill out the universe, <b>which</b>, namely, the
              elements,
              <b>you desire to serve</b>
              with the service of
              <i>latria</i>
              <b>again</b>, i.e., for a second time. And the proof of this is
              obvious, because <b>You observe days</b>, auspicious and
              inauspicious, <b>and months and times and years</b>, i.e., the
              constellations and the course of the heavenly bodies, all of which
              observances spring from idolatry, against which Jeremias (10:2)
              says: “Be not afraid of the signs of heaven which the heathens
              fear.”

              Et quod observationes huiusmodi malae sint et contra cultum

              That observances of this sort are evil and contrary to the worship
              of the Christian religion is plain, because the distinction of
              days, months, years and times is based on the course of the sun
              and moon. Therefore, those who observe such distinctions of times
              are venerating heavenly bodies and arranging their activities
              according to the evidence of the stars, which have no direct
              influence on the human will or on things that depend on free will.
              By this practice they are put in grave danger. Hence he says:
              <b>I am afraid lest perhaps it was in vain</b>, i.e., fruitlessly,
              <b>that I labored</b>
              among you. Therefore the faithful must avoid observing such
              things. Indeed, no suggestion of these things should be found
              among them, for whatever is done simply out of devotion to God can
              turn out prosperously.

              other things, i.e., of things that depend on free will or on good
              and bad fortune. Hence in such cases to look for the influence of
              the stars pertains to idolatry.

              Sed licet haec lectura sustineri possit, non tamen est secundum

              But although this interpretation might be upheld, it does not
              accord with the Apostle’s intention. For since in the entire
              section preceding this passage, as well as in all that follows it,
              he is censuring the Galatians for removing themselves from the
              faith and turning to the observances of the Law, it is more in
              keeping with his intention to expound it as referring to their
              turning to the legal observances. Hence he says:
              <b>After that you have known God</b>
              through faith,
              <b>how turn you</b>
              from the faith
              <b>to the elements</b>, i.e., to the literal observance of the
              Law? It is called an element, because the Law was the prime
              institution of divine worship. <b>To elements</b>, I say, that are
              weak, because they do not bring to perfection by justifying: “For
              the law brought nothing to perfection” (Heb 7:19), and needy,
              because they do not confer virtues and grace or offer any help of
              themselves.

              But what does he mean by
              <b>are you turned?</b>
              For to say this, as well as to say, again, seems inappropriate,
              for they neither were Jews nor had they formerly observed the Law.
              I answer that the Jewish worship is midway between the worship of
              the Christians and that of the Gentiles: for the Gentiles
              worshipped the elements as though they were living things; the
              Jews, on the other hand, did not serve the elements but served God
              under the elements, inasmuch as they rendered worship, to God by
              the observances of bodily elements:
              <b>We were serving under the elements of the world</b>
              (v. 3); but Christians serve God under Christ, i.e., in the faith
              of Christ. Now when a person reaches a terminus after passing
              through the middle, if he then decides to return to the middle, it
              seems to be the same as returning to the very beginning.
              Therefore, because they had already reached the terminus, namely,
              faith in Christ, and then returned to the middle, i.e., to the
              Jewish worship, then because of a resemblance of middle to
              beginning, the Apostle says that they are turned to the elements
              and are serving them again.

              nimia severitate frangantur. Lc. X, 34 legitur de Samaritano, quod

              pastoribus dicitur Ez. XXXIV, 4:
              <i>cum austeritate imperabatis eis</i>. Et ideo apostolus sicut
              bonus praelatus ostendit, quod non ex odio increpat eos, blande
              loquendo eis quantum ad tria. Primo quantum ad charitatis nomen.
              Unde dicit <i>fratres</i>, Ps. CXXXII, 1:
              <i>ecce quam bonum et quam iucundum habitare fratres in unum</i>.

              With respect to the first it should be noted that it is customary
              for a good pastor in correcting his subjects to mingle gentleness
              with severity, lest they be discouraged by too great severity. For
              it is written in Luke (10) that the Samaritan in caring for the
              wounded man poured in oil and wine. On the other hand, it is
              written of evil pastors in Ezechiel (34:4): “You ruled over them
              with vigor.” Therefore, as a good prelate, the Apostle shows that
              he does not rebuke them in a spirit of hatred, for his words are
              gentle in three respects. First, as to the charitable name he
              uses, for he says, <b>Brethren</b>: “Behold how good and how
              pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity” (Ps
              132:1). Secondly, as to his suppliant language, when he says:
              <b>I beseech you</b>: “The poor will speak with supplications”
              (Prov 18:28). Thirdly, as to freeing them of blame; hence he says,
              <b>You have not injured me at all,</b> and I am not the type of
              person who hates those who do not offend me.

              one another. The first is the mutual help of fellowship, and this
              is also the cause of love being consolidated among men, according
              to Luke (22:28): “And you are they who have continued with me in
              my temptations; and I dispose to you as my Father hath disposed to
              me, a kingdom.” Touching this he says:

                the gospel to you heretofore.</b

              Herein he does two things: First, he recalls the tribulation he
              suffered among them; Secondly, he shows how they stood by him (v.
              13).

              He says, therefore, with respect to the first: I say that
              <b>You have not injured me at all</b>; rather you have come to my
              aid. <b>For you know</b>, i.e., are able to recall,
              <b>that I preached the gospel to you heretofore</b>, i.e., in
              times past, <b>through infirmity of the flesh</b>, i.e., with
              infirmity and affliction in my flesh, or with the many
              tribulations I suffered from the Jews who are of my flesh and
              persecuted me: “And I was with you in weakness and in fear and in
              much tribulation” (1 Cor 2:3); “Power is made perfect in
              infirmity” (2 Cor 12:9). And although this infirmity might have
              been reason for scorning me and a cause of temptation for you,
              according to Zacharias (13:7): “Strike the shepherd and the sheep
              will be scattered”: nevertheless, <b>your temptation</b>, which
              was <b>in my flesh</b>, i.e., my tribulation, which was a source
              of temptation for you, <b>you despised not</b>: “Despise not a man
              for his look” (Sir 11:2) because as the Lord says in Luke (10:16):
              “He that despiseth you, despiseth me.”
              <b>Neither did you reject me</b> and my teaching, but you were
              willing to share my tribulations: “Woe to you that despisest,
              shall you not also be despised?” (Is 33:1).

              The second thing that strengthens love among men is mutual love
              and affection toward one another, according to Proverbs (8:17): 1
              love them that love me.” As to this he says:
              <b>but you received me as an angel of God</b>, i.e., with the
              honor accorded to a messenger announcing God’s words: “When you
              received of us the word of the hearing of God, you received it not
              as the word of men but (as it is indeed) the word of God” (1 Thes
              2:13). For this reason preachers are called angels: “They shall
              seek the law at the priest’s mouth, because he is the angel of the
              Lord of hosts” (Mal 2:7). And not only as an angel did you receive
              me, but <b>even as Christ Jesus</b>, i.e., as though Christ
              Himself had come, Who, indeed, had come to them in him and spoke
              in him, according to 2 Corinthians (13:3): “Do you seek a proof of
              Christ that speaketh in me?” “He that receiveth you receiveth me”
              (Mt 10:40). But he then rebukes them for their change of heart;
              hence he says,
              <b>Where is then your blessedness?</b>
              As if to say: Did not men think you blessed for honoring me and
              accepting my preaching? “Where is thy fear, thy fortitude, thy
              patience and the perfection of thy ways?” (Job 4:6).

              He says therefore: If you have done me so much good, are you to
              believe that
              <b>I am become your enemy because I tell you the truth?</b>
              The word <b>enemy</b> used here can be interpreted in two ways: in
              one way as meaning that he hates them; in this case the
              interpretation is <b>have I become your enemy</b>, i.e., hate you?
              Hence what follows, namely, <b>because I tell you the truth</b>,
              can be taken as an indication of hatred, even though telling the
              truth at the proper time and place is a sign of love. In another
              way, the word <b>enemy</b> can be taken in a passive sense, i.e.,
              so that he is hated by them; then
              <b>have I become your enemy</b>
              is interpreted as
              <b>Do you hate me?</b> and this because I tell you the truth, so
              that telling the truth is set down as the cause of hatred. For men
              who tell the truth are hated by evil men, since the truth
              engenders hatred: “They have hated him that rebuketh in the gate:
              and I have abhorred him that speaketh perfectly” (Am 5: 10).

              But on the other hand, it is said in Proverbs (28:23): “He that
              rebuketh a man shall afterward find favor with him more then he
              that by a flattering tongue deceiveth him.” I answer that the
              solution to this can be gathered from what is said in Proverbs
              (9:9): “Rebuke not a scorner, lest he hate thee. Rebuke a wise man
              and he will love thee.” For if the one corrected loves the
              corrector, it is a sign of virtue; conversely, it is a sign of
              malice, if he should hate him. For since a man naturally hates
              what is contrary to what he loves, then if you hate one who
              corrects you for evil, it is obvious that you love the evil; but
              if you love him, you indicate that you hate sin. For at first,
              when men are corrected, they are attached to their sins—that is
              why a sinner’s first reaction is to hate the one correcting him;
              but after the correction he puts aside his attachment to sin and
              loves the one correcting him. And therefore the passage from
              Proverbs expressly says that later he will find favor with him.

              As to the first it should be noted that, as has been said above,
              certain false brethren, converted from Judaism, went about the
              churches of the Gentiles, preaching the observance of the Law.
              Because Paul opposed them, they slandered him. They did this not
              so much with an eye to their salvation as to get rid of Paul.
              Hence the Apostle says,
              <b>They are zealous in your regard</b>, i.e., they do not allow
              you (whom they love with a love not of friendship but of
              self-interest) to associate with us. For jealous rivalry is zeal
              that arises from any love whatsoever and does not brook what is
              loved to be shared. But because their love for them was not good:
              first of all, because they did not love them so as to advantage
              them but for their own gain—and this is obvious from the fact that
              they wanted to keep the Apostle away from them as one opposed to
              their own advantage—and secondly, because this was a source of
              harm to the Gentiles—for they sought from them an advantage by
              which the latter would suffer harm; for these reasons he says,
              <b>They are zealous in your regard but not well</b>, because they
              are not interested in your welfare. And this is obvious, because
              <b>they would exclude you that you might be zealous for them,</b>
              i.e., that you might admit none but them: “Envy not the unjust man
              and do not follow his ways” (Prov 3:31); “Let not thy heart envy

              zeal for the good, if it continues even when the teacher is
              absent, is an indication that it proceeds from love and fear of
              God Who sees all: “Servants, obey in all things your masters
              according to the flesh, not serving to the eye, as pleasing men,
              but in simplicity of heart, fearing God” (Col 3:22).

              dicit <i>parturio</i>, id est cum labore et dolore ad lucem fidei
              reduco. In quo apparet dolor apostoli. Unde conversio hominis,

              <i>incurvantur ad foetum et pariunt</i>. Apoc. XII, 2:
              <i>clamabat parturiens, et cruciabatur ut pariat</i>. Et inde est
              quod apostolus ex dolore dure eos corrigit, sicut mulier ex dolore
              partus dure clamat. Is. XLII, v. 14:
              <i>quasi parturiens loquar</i>, et cetera.

              It should be noted that during parturition a child is called a
              little one. And this is what they were, because they needed to be
              born again, even though parents according to the flesh bring forth
              their child only once. Accordingly he says to them,
              <b>of whom I am in labor again</b>. For he was in labor of them
              during their first conversion; but since they had now turned from
              the one who called them, to another gospel, they needed to be
              brought forth anew. Hence he says, <b>I am in labor</b>, i.e.,
              with labor and pain I bring them forth into the light of faith. In
              these words the Apostle bares his grief. Hence a man’s conversion
              is called a birth: “They bow themselves to bring forth young” (Job
              39:3); “And being with child she cried, travailing in birth and
              was in pain to be delivered” (Rev 12:2). Therefore it is because
              of his pain that he rebukes them so sharply, as a woman cries
              aloud because of the pains of childbirth: I will speak now as a
              woman in labor” (Is 42:14).

              profectum in fide, Christus in homine proficit, et, e converso,

              The reason for the iterated travail is that you are not perfectly
              formed. Hence he says:
              <b>until Christ be formed in you,</b> i.e., until you receive His
              likeness, which you have lost through your sin. He does not say,
              “That you may be formed in Christ,” but
              <b>until Christ be formed in you,</b> to make it resound more
              terrifyingly on their ears. For Christ is formed in the heart by
              “formed faith”: “That Christ might dwell in your hearts by faith”
              (Eph 3:17). But when one does not have “formed faith,” Christ has
              already died in him: “Until the day dawn and the day star arise in
              your hearts” (2 Petr. 1:19). Thus Christ grows in a man according
              to his progress in the faith; conversely, as it diminishes, He
              recedes. Therefore, when the faith of a man is rendered “unformed”
              by sin, Christ is not formed in him; and so, because there’ was
              not a formed faith in them, they needed to be brought forth in the
              womb again until Christ be formed in them through faith, i.e.,
              “formed faith,” which works through love. Or,
              <b>until Christ be formed in you</b>, i.e., through you Christ
              appear finely formed to others.

              contention: and speaking that which is just, answer me” (Job
              6:29). Now I raise this objection to you. You have either read the
              Law or not. If you have read it, you ought to know the things
              written in it. But those things prove that it should be abandoned.
              If you have not read it, you ought not accept what you do not
              know: “Let thy eyelids go before thy steps” (Prov 4:25). He says
              <b>under the law,</b> i.e., under the burden of the Law. For to
              shoulder something light is not a feat; but to assume a heavy
              burden, such as the burden of the Law, seems to be a mark of
              exceeding stupidity: “This is a yoke which neither our fathers nor
              we have been able to bear” (Acts 15:10); which is to be understood
              of those who wish to live according to the flesh under the Law.

              In fact he had more than two, because after Sara’s death, he

              But the Apostle does not mention them because they have no role in
              this allegory. Now two peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, can be
              signified by those two, i.e., the son of the bondwoman and the son
              of the free woman—and by the other sons of Cetura, schismatics and
              heretics. These two peoples are alike in having one father, for
              the Jews are the children of Abraham according to the flesh, but
              the Gentiles, by imitating him in faith. Or, they are the sons of
              Abraham, i.e., of God, Who is the Father of all: “Have we not all

              approached her in conjugal affection and under God’s ordinance);

              the son of the bondwoman, i.e., Ishmael, was born according to the

              Therefore, it must be said that Ishmael was born according to the

              Here it should be noted that “allegory” is sometimes taken for any
              mystical meaning: sometimes for only one of the four, which are
              the historical, allegorical, mystical and the anagogical, which
              are the four senses of Sacred Scripture, all of which differ in
              signification. For signification is twofold: one is through words;
              the other through the things signified by the words. And this is
              peculiar to the sacred writings and no others, since their author
              is God in Whose power it lies not only to employ words to signify
              (which man can also do), but things as well. Consequently, in the
              other sciences handed down by men, in which only words can be
              employed to signify, the words alone signify. But it is peculiar
              to Scripture that words and the very things signified by them
              signify something. Consequently this science can have many senses.
              For that signification by which the words signify something
              pertains to the
              <i>literal</i> or
              <i>historical</i>
              sense. But the signification whereby the things signified by the
              words further signify other things pertains to the
              <i>mystical</i>
              sense.

              signify things of the New Law, it is the
              <i>allegorical</i>
              sense. Then, according to Dionysius in the book
              <i>On The Heavenly Hierarchy,</i>
              the New Law is a figure of future glory; accordingly, insofar as
              things in the New Law and in Christ signify things which are in
              heaven, it is the
              <i>anagogical</i>
              sense. Furthermore, in the New Law the things performed by the
              Head are examples of things we ought to do—because “What things
              soever were written were written for our learning” (Rom 15:3)
              —accordingly insofar as the things which in the New Law were done
              in Christ and done in things that signify Christ are signs of
              things we ought to do, it is the
              <i>moral</i>
              sense. Examples will clarify each of these. For when I say, “Let
              there be light,” referring literally to corporeal light, it is the
              literal sense. But if it be taken to mean “Let Christ be born in
              the Church,” it pertains to the allegorical sense. But if one
              says, “Let there be light,” i.e., “Let us be conducted to glory
              through Christ,” it pertains to the anagogical sense. Finally, if
              it is said “Let there be light,” i.e., “Let us be illumined in
              mind and inflamed in heart through Christ,” it pertains to the
              moral sense.

              To understand what a testament is, we should consider that a
              testament is a pact or agreement dealing with matters which are
              confirmed by witnesses. Hence in Scripture in many places in lieu
              of testament is put pact or agreement. Now, whenever a pact or
              agreement is struck, a promise is made. Therefore, according to
              the diversity of promises there is a diversity of testaments. But
              two things have been promised to us: temporal things in the Old
              Law, and eternal things in the New: “Rejoice and be glad because
              your reward is great in heaven” (Mt 5:12). Hence these two
              promises are the two testaments. Hence the Apostle, when he says,
              <b>The one from mount Sinai, engendering unto bondage,</b>
              explains them. First, as to the Old; Secondly, as to the New (v.

              To understand this text, it must be noted with respect to the
              first that a citizen of a city is called its son, and the city
              itself his mother: “Daughters of Jerusalem, weep not for me” (Lk
              23:28); “The noble sons of Sion” (Lam 4:2). Therefore, by the fact
              that certain ones become citizens of a city, they are made its
              sons. Now there is a twofold city of God: the one of earth, called
              the earthly Jerusalem, and the other of Heaven, called the
              heavenly Jerusalem. Furthermore, men were made citizens of the
              earthly city through the Old Testament, but of the heavenly
              through the New. Therefore as to this he does two things: First,
              he expounds the mystery; Secondly, he accounts for the mystical
              explanation (v. 25).

              He says therefore first: I say that it signifies the two
              Testaments, namely, the Old and the New. And with respect to this
              he says:
              <b>The one from mount Sinai, engendering unto bondage.</b>
              Wherein is mentioned first of all the place in which it was given,
              namely, on Mount Sinai, as is recorded in Exodus (Ch. 20).
              According to a Gloss the mystical rendition of this is that Sinai
              is interpreted “Commandment.” Hence in Ephesians (Ch. 2) the Old
              Law is called by the Apostle the law of the Commandments. Now a
              mountain signifies pride: “Before your feet stumble upon the dark
              mountains” (Jer. 13:16). Hence by this mountain on which the Law
              was given a twofold pride of the Jews is signified: one by which
              they were arrogant against God: I know thy obstinacy and thy most
              stiff neck” (Deut 31:27); the other by which they boasted at the
              expense of other nations, thus perverting what is said in Psalm
              (147:20): “He hath not done in like manner to every nation; and
              his judgments he hath not made manifest to them.”

              Secondly, he explains the end for which it was given, namely, not
              to make them free, but to make them children of a bondwoman,
              <b>engendering unto bondage, which is Hagar</b>, i.e., which is
              signified by Hagar, who engenders unto bondage, namely, the Old
              Testament. And this it does with respect to three things; namely,
              feeling, understanding and fruit. As to understanding, indeed,
              according to knowledge: because in man is a twofold knowledge. One
              is free, when he knows the truth of things according to
              themselves; the other is servile, i.e., veiled under figures, as
              was the knowledge of the Old Testament. As to feeling, the New Law
              engenders the feeling of love, which pertains to freedom: for one
              who loves is moved by his own initiative. The Old, on the other
              hand, engenders the feeling of fear in which is servitude; for one
              who fears is moved not by his own initiative but by that of
              another: “You have not received the spirit of bondage again in
              fear; but you have received the spirit of adoption of sons” (Rom
              8:15). But as to the fruit, the New Law begets sons to whom is
              owed the inheritance, whereas to those whom the Old Law engenders
              are owed small presents as to servants: “The servant abideth not
              in the house forever; but the son abideth forever” (Jn 8:35).

              quasi servi et alieni sub ea affligebantur carnalibus

              Then he gives the explanation of the mystery when he says:

                Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children</b
              >. But here a difficulty arises: for since Sinai is almost twenty
              days journey from Jerusalem, it seems false that Sinai has
              affinity to [borders on] Jerusalem, as the Apostle says here. To
              this a Gloss responds in a mystical manner that Sinai is in
              Arabia, which stands for the abjection or affliction under which
              the Old Testament was given, because the men under it were
              oppressed by carnal observances after the manner of slaves and
              foreigners: “This is a yoke which neither we nor our fathers were
              able to bear” (Acts 15:10). This mountain neighbors on Jerusalem
              not by a spatial continuity but by a likeness
              <b>to that Jerusalem which now is</b>, i.e., to the Jewish people,
              because just as they love earthly things and for the sake of
              temporal things are under the bondage of sin, so that mountain
              engendered unto bondage.

              But this does not seem to be the Apostle’s intention. For he wants
              to bring out that from the very place of bondage the Old
              Testament, which was given on Mount Sinai, engenders unto bondage,
              because it was given on Sinai not as a place where the children of
              Israel were to remain, but as a stage in their journey to the
              promised land. For Jerusalem, too, engenders sons unto bondage.
              Hence it is with respect to this that Mount Sinai is continuous
              with her. And this is what he says: which hath affinity to that
              (i.e., by being part of the continuous route followed by those
              going to Jerusalem)
              <b
                >Jerusalem which now is, and is in bondage with her children,</b
              >
              i.e., the bondage of legal observances (from which Christ redeemed
              us) and of various sins—“He that commits sins is the servant of
              sin” (Jn 8:34)—and, literally, from bondage under the Romans who
              were their masters.

              The first can be understood in two ways, accordingly as we
              understand this mother to be the one by whom we are engendered,
              which is the Church Militant, or the mother whose sons we become,
              which is the Church Triumphant: “He hath regenerated us unto a
              lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead” (1

              Militant as to arrive at the Triumphant. Therefore in explaining

              She is sublime on account of the face to face vision of God and
              the perfect enjoyment of God; and this, as to the Church
              Triumphant: “Then shalt thou see, and abound, and thy heart shall
              wonder and be enlarged” (Is 60:5); “Mind the things that are
              above” (Col 3:2). Again she is sublime through faith and hope as
              to the Church Militant: “Our conversation is in heaven” (Phil
              3:20); “Who is this that cometh up from the desert, flowing with
              delights?” (Cant 8:5). Further, she is a peacemaker, because she
              is Jerusalem, i.e., vision of peace. This belongs to the Church
              Triumphant as having perfect peace: “Who hath placed peace in thy
              borders” (Ps 147:14); “My people shall sit in the beauty of peace”
              (Is 32:18). Likewise it pertains to the Church Militant which
              possesses the peace of resting in Christ: “In me you shall have
              peace” (Jn 16:33). Furthermore, she is free: “Because the creature
              also itself shall be delivered from the servitude of corruption”
              (Rom 8:21). And this both as to the Church Triumphant and the
              Church Militant according to Apoc (21:2): 1 saw the holy city, the
              new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.” Finally, she
              is fruitful, because she is our mother: Militant as engendering;
              Triumphant as the one whose sons we become: “Shall Sion say: This
              man and that man is born of her” (Ps 86:5); “Thy sons shall come
              from afar, and thy daughters shall rise up at thy side” (Is 60:4).

              <b>For it is written,</b>
              namely in Isaiah (54:1) according to the Septuagint. Here is
              mentioned the prophecy through which is proved, first of all, that
              the mother referred to is free, and secondly, that she is
              fruitful. With respect to the first, it should be noted that in a
              fertile woman there is first sorrow in giving birth, but this is
              followed by joy in beholding the child: “A woman when she is in
              labor hath sorrow, because her hour is come; but when she hath
              brought forth the child, she remembereth no more her anguish for
              joy that a man is born into the world” (Jn 16:21). But a barren
              woman neither suffers the pangs of birth nor has joy in a child.
              Again there is a difference between bearing and travailing. For
              the latter refers to the effort to bear, whereas the former refers
              to the releasing of the foetus now formed. Therefore the fertile
              woman experiences pain in travail but joy in bearing; the sterile
              woman, on the other hand, experiences neither the pain of travail
              nor the joy of bearing.

              But these are the two things which the prophet announces to the
              barren woman:
              <b
                >Rejoice, thou barren, that bearest not: break forth and cry,
                thou that travailest not.</b
              >
              Herein he speaks of Jerusalem, which he calls free and is
              signified by the barren Sara. For the Church was barren, namely,
              the Church Militant, of the Gentiles before their conversion when
              they offered their sons not to God but to the devil. Hence it is
              said to Babylon: “Barrenness and widowhood will come upon thee,
              because of the multitude of thy sorceries” (Is 47:9). The Church
              Triumphant, too, was barren before the passion of Christ, because
              to her were born no sons who entered into glory, save in hope. For
              a mighty engine of war blocked the entrance to Paradise, so that
              no one might enter. To this barren one he says:
              <b>Rejoice thou that bearest not.</b>
              As if to say: The barren, as has been said, are sorrowful, not
              because they bear, but because they bear not: “As Anna had her
              heart full of grief, she prayed to the Lord, shedding many tears”
              (I Kg. 1:10). But you shall rejoice in the great number of your
              children: “Then shall thy heart wonder and be enlarged,” i.e., you
              will show the joy in your soul outwardly (Is 60:5). For there are
              two things in childbirth: the pain from the rupturing of the
              membrane enclosing the child in the womb, and the crying from
              pain. Hence he says,
              <b>thou that travailest not,</b>
              i.e., the Church Militant, that makes no effort to bear through
              desire, and the Church Triumphant, that does not cry for travail;
              or because the time for having sons has not yet come,
              <b>break forth,</b>
              i.e., show outwardly the joy you have within and cry with sounds
              of praise: “Cry, cease not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet” (Is
              58:1). These two things, namely, to cry and to break forth,
              pertain to freedom.—Thus the freedom of the mother is made
              manifest.

              Ecclesiam liberam significari per Saram, videtur esse dubium an
              Sara fuerit deserta. Ad quod sciendum est, quod deserta fuit ab
              Abraham, ut hic dicitur, non per divortium, sed quantum ad opus
              carnale. Nam Abraham vacabat quidem operi carnali, non propter
              concupiscentiam, sed propter prolem suscipiendam. Cum ergo
              innotuit ei Saram sterilem esse, deseruit eam, non frangens
              coniugalem thorum, sed quia non utebatur ea ab illo praecise
              tempore quo Sara introduxit ei ancillam. Per quod datur intelligi,
              quod Ecclesia gentium deserta erat a Christo, quia nondum venerat
              Christus, et quod Ecclesia triumphans deserta erat ab hominibus,
              quibus ad eam nondum patebat accessus. Huius ergo <i>desertae</i>,
              scilicet Ecclesiae gentium, sunt <i>multi filii</i>, id est
              plures, <i>magis quam eius</i>, scilicet synagogae,

              <i>sterilis peperit plurimos, et quae multos filios habebat</i>,
              et cetera. Et hoc veniente sponso, scilicet Christo, a quo deserta

              He follows with the fruitfulness:
              <b
                >for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her
                that hath a husband.</b
              >
              But since it was said above that the free Church is signified by
              Sara, there seems to be some doubt whether Sara was desolate. I
              answer that she was made desolate by Abraham, as it is said here,
              not by a divorce but with respect to the work of the flesh. For
              Abraham resorted to the work of the flesh not for the pleasure but
              to obtain a child. Therefore when he learned that Sara was barren,
              he abandoned her; not by forsaking the marriage bed, but by not
              resorting to her from precisely the time that Sara introduced the
              bondwoman to him. By this we are given to understand that the
              Church of the Gentiles was left desolate by Christ, because Christ
              had not yet come; and that the Church Triumphant was desolate of
              men, for whom no means of entry was open. Of this desolate woman,
              i.e., the Church of the Gentiles, there are many children, i.e.,
              <b>more than of her</b>, namely, the synagogue,
              <b>that hath a husband,</b>
              namely, Moses: “The barren hath borne many: and she that had many
              children is weakened” (I Kg. 2:5). And this is due to the coming
              of the spouse, namely, Christ, by Whom she had been left desolate
              not by want of love, but because the bearing of children had been
              delayed.

              The manner of origin, according to which the sons of Abraham are
              born, is twofold: one is by origin according to the flesh, as
              Ishmael, of the bondwoman; the other not according to the flesh,
              as Isaac, of the free woman-not because he was not born in the way
              of nature, but because, as has been said, it was beyond the
              natural power of the flesh for a son to be born of a barren old
              woman. Two people are understood by these two sons: by Ishmael is
              understood the Jewish people, who derived from Abraham by carnal
              propagation; but by Isaac, the people of the Gentiles, who
              descended from Abraham by imitation of his faith. Hence he says:
              <b>Now we, brethren</b>, i.e., the faithful, both Jew and Gentile,
              as Isaac was, i.e., in the line of Isaac,
              <b>are the children of the promise</b> that was made to Abraham:
              “They that are the children of the promise are accounted for the
              seed” (Gen 21; Rom 9:8). But note that the children of Abraham
              according to the flesh are, literally, the Jewish people; but,
              mystically, the ones who come to the faith for the sake of carnal
              and temporal goods.

              <i>cum vidisset Sara filium ancillae Agar ludentem</i>, et cetera.
              Responsio. Dicendum est, quod apostolus illum ludum dicit
              persecutionem, quia ludus magni ad parvum est quaedam illusio, cum
              maior cum parvo ludens intendit eum decipere. Vel etiam, ut dicunt
              quidam, Ismael cogebat Isaac adorare imagines luteas quas
              faciebat. Per hoc autem docebat eum averti a cultu unius Dei, quod
              est magna persecutio, cum maius malum sit inferre mortem
              spiritualem, quam corporalem. Quod tamen ideo in Genesi appellatur
              ludus, quia sub specie ludi hoc faciebat.

              Secondly, they are distinguished according to affection, because
              <b
                >he that was born according to the flesh persecuted him that was
                after the spirit.</b
              >
              But this raises a difficulty. First, because it is not recorded
              that Ishmael persecuted Isaac, but only that they played together:
              “When Sara had seen the son of Hagar, the Egyptian, playing with
              Isaac her son, she said to Abraham: Cast out this bondwoman and
              her son” (Gen 21:9). I answer that the Apostle calls this playing
              a persecution, because there is deception when an older person
              plays with a younger one; since the older person, in playing with
              the younger, intends to deceive him. Or, as some say, Ishmael
              compelled Isaac to adore the clay images he fashioned. By this he
              was teaching him to be turned from the worship of the one God; and
              this was a considerable persecution, since it is a greater evil to
              cause spiritual death than bodily. Furthermore, in Genesis this is
              called a game because he did this under the guise of a game.

              Est etiam quaestio quomodo filii secundum carnem persecuti fuerint

              responsio, quia a principio primitivae Ecclesiae Iudaei persecuti

              There is another difficulty, namely, how the children according to
              the flesh persecuted and do persecute the children according to
              the spirit? The answer is that from the beginning of the early
              Church the Jews persecuted Christians, as is obvious in the Acts
              of the Apostles, and they would do the same even now, if they were
              able. Now, however, those who are carnal persecute spiritual men
              in the Church even as to the body; those, namely, who seek glory
              and temporal gain in the Church. Hence a Gloss says that “all who
              seek from the Lord earthly aggrandizement in the Church pertain to
              this Ishmael. They are the ones who oppose those who are making
              spiritual progress and slander them. They have iniquity in their
              mouth, and craft and deceit on their tongues.” But the ones who
              spiritually persecute the spiritual sons are the haughty and the
              hypocrites. For sometimes they who are plainly carnal and evil
              recognize their guilt and humble themselves before the good; but
              the foolish persecute in others the goodness they themselves lack.

              Est etiam quaestio, quia haeretici quos nos persequimur, dicunt se

              est, quod duplex est persecutio. Una bona, qua aliquis persequitur
              alium, ut reducat eum ad bonum, et hanc viri iusti faciunt malis

              A further question arises from the fact that heretics whom we
              persecute say that they are the ones born according to the spirit
              and we according to the flesh. I answer that there are two kinds
              of persecution: the good one is that in which a person persecutes
              another to lead him back to good. And this is what just men do to
              evil men, and spiritual men to carnal men; either to correct them,
              if they want to be converted, or, if they are obstinate, to
              destroy them, lest they contaminate the flock of the Lord. The
              other type of persecution is evil, namely, when a person
              persecutes another in order to pervert him; and this is what those
              who are born according to the flesh do to those who are born
              according to the spirit.

              Finally, as to their right to the inheritance, they are
              distinguished by the authority of Scripture:
              <b>Cast out the bondwoman and her son</b>
              (Gen 21:10). By this we are given to understand that the Jews and
              persecutors of the Christian religion, as well as carnal and evil
              Christians, will be cast out from the kingdom of heaven: “Many
              shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with
              Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven” (Mt 8:11);
              “Without are dogs and sorcerers” (Rev 22:15). Furthermore, the
              bondwoman, i.e., vice and sin itself, will be cast out: “Every
              work that is corruptible shall fail in the end” (Sir 14:20). The
              reason for all this is added,
              <b
                >because the son of the bondwoman shall not be heir with the son
                of the free woman.</b
              >
              For in this world the good are mingled with the wicked and the
              wicked with the good: “As the lily among thorns, so is my love
              among the daughters” (Cant 2:2). But in the eternal fatherland
              there will be only the good. In Judges (11:2) it is said to
              Jephtah: “Thou canst not inherit in the house of our father,
              because thou art born of a harlot.” This freedom we obtain from
              Christ; hence he says, by the freedom wherewith Christ has made us
              free: “If therefore the son shall make you free, you shall be free
              indeed” (Jn 8:36).

              In the admonition itself he includes two things: one is an
              inducement to good: the other is a caution against evil. He
              induces to good when he says, Stand fast. As if to say: Since you
              have been set free from the bondage of the Law through Christ,
              stand fast and, with your faith firm and feet planted, persevere
              in freedom. And so when he says, <b>Stand fast,</b> he exhorts
              them to rectitude. For he that stands is erect: “He that thinketh
              himself to stand, let him take heed, lest he fall” (1 Cor 10:12).
              Likewise he exhorts them to be firm: “Therefore, be ye steadfast
              and unmoveable” (1 Cor 15:58); “Stand, therefore, having your
              loins girt about with truth” (Eph 6:14).

              But he cautions and draws them from evil, when he adds:
              <b>and be not held again under the yoke of bondage</b>, i.e., do
              not subject yourself to the Law which engenders unto bondage. Of
              this yoke, it is written in Acts (15:10): “This is a yoke which
              neither we nor our fathers have been able to bear,” a yoke from
              which we have been loosed by Christ alone: “For the yoke of their
              burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their
              oppressor, thou hast overcome” (Is 9:4). The reason for adding,
              again, is not that they had been under the Law before, but that,
              as Jerome says, to observe the legal ceremonies after the Gospel
              is so great a sin as to border on idolatry. Hence, because they
              had been idolaters, if they were to submit themselves to the yoke
              of circumcision and the other legal observances, they would be, as
              it were, returning to the very things wherein they had formerly
              practiced idolatry.

              Secundum Augustinum vero, ut supra dictum est, circa legalium
              observantias triplex tempus distinguitur, scilicet tempus ante
              passionem, ante gratiam divulgatam, et post gratiam divulgatam.
              Post ergo gratiam divulgatam servare legalia est peccatum mortale,
              etiam ipsis Iudaeis. Sed in tempore medio, scilicet ante gratiam
              divulgatam, poterant quidem absque peccato etiam illi, qui ex
              Iudaeis conversi fuerant, legalia servare, dum tamen in eis spem
              non ponerent; conversis vero ex gentibus non licebat ea servare.
              Quia ergo Galatae ex Iudaeis non erant, et tamen legalia servare
              volebant et ponebant in eis spem, ideo revertebantur in iugum
              servitutis. Nam huiusmodi observatio erat eis sicut idololatria,
              inquantum non recte sentiebant de Christo, credentes ab ipso sine
              legalibus salutem consequi non posse.

              However, according to Augustine in
              <i>Epistle 19,</i> three periods of time are distinguished with
              respect to the observance of the legal ceremonies: namely, the
              time before the passion, the time before the spreading of grace
              and the time after the spreading of grace. To observe the legal
              ceremonies after grace had been preached is a mortal sin for the
              Jews. But during the interim, i.e., before the preaching of grace,
              they could be observed without sin even by those who had been
              converted from Judaism, provided they set no hope on them.
              However, those converted from paganism could not observe them
              without sin. Therefore, because the Galatians had not come from
              Judaism but wanted, nevertheless, to observe the legal ceremonies
              and put their hope in them, they were in effect returning to the
              yoke of bondage. For in their case, observances of this sort were
              akin to idolatry, inasmuch as they entertained a false notion
              touching Christ, believing that salvation cannot be obtained by
              Him without the observances of the Law.

              him. I answer that, according to Jerome, Paul did not circumcise
              Timothy as though intending to observe the Law, but he feigned
              circumcision in working circumcision on him. For, according to
              him, the apostles feigned observing the works of the Law to avoid
              scandalizing the believers from Judaism. In other words, they
              performed the actions of the Law without the intention of
              observing them, and so they departed not from the faith. Hence he
              did not deceive Timothy.

              However, according to Augustine, the answer is that the apostles
              did in very truth observe the works of the Law and had the
              intention of observing them; because, according to the teaching of
              the apostles, it was lawful at that time, i.e., before grace had
              become widespread, for converts from Judaism to observe them.
              Therefore, because Timothy was born of a Jewish mother, the
              Apostle circumcised him with the intention of observing the Law.
              But because the Galatians were putting their hope in the legal
              observances after the spreading of grace, as though without them
              grace was not sufficient to save them, and they observed them in
              that frame of mind, for that reason the Apostle declared to them
              that
              <b>if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing</b>. For
              it followed from this that they did not correctly estimate Christ,
              to signify Whom circumcision was given: “That it may be a sign of
              the covenant between me and you” (Gen 17:11). Therefore, those who
              submitted to circumcision believed that the sign was still in
              vogue and that the one signified had not yet come. Thus they were
              fallen away from Christ. In this way, then, it is plain that the
              yoke of the Law is harmful.

              <b>if you be circumcised, Christ shall profit you nothing</b>. But
              in addition to this, <b>I testify to every man</b>, both Jew and
              Gentile, circumcising himself,
              <b>that he is a debtor to do the whole law</b>. For one who
              professes a religion makes himself a debtor to all that pertains
              to the observances of that religion. And, as Augustine says:
              “There has never been a religion without some visible sign to
              which those who live in that religion are obligated; as in the
              Christian religion the visible sign is Baptism, which all
              Christians are held to undergo. Furthermore, they are obligated to
              everything that pertains to the Christian religion.” Now the sign
              of the Mosaic Law was circumcision. Therefore, whoever circumcised
              himself was put under obligation to observe and fulfill all the
              matters of the Law. And that is what he says:
              <b>he is a debtor to do the whole law</b>: “Whosoever offends in
              one point, is become guilty of all” (Jam 2:10). No one, however,
              was able to keep the Law, according to Acts (15:10): “This is a

              conviction remains, he would sin mortally were he not to observe
              the matters of the Law. The reason for this is that the conviction
              that something must be done is nothing else but a judgment that it
              would be against God’s will not to do it. If this is the case, I
              say that unless he did what his convictions dictate, he would sin
              mortally, not by reason of the work done but by reason of his
              conscience. Likewise, if he does it, he sins, because ignorance of
              this kind does not excuse him, since he is ignorant of a precept.
              Nevertheless, he is not absolutely perplexed, but only in a
              qualified sense, because it is within his power to correct his
              erroneous conscience. And this is the way the Apostle is here
              testifying to everyone who circumcises himself that he is obliged
              to observe the ceremonies of the Law.

              And this <b>by faith,</b> “because the justice of God is by faith

              of man but of the Holy Spirit Who inspires it. “You have received

              is hope, and from hope the justice through which we reach eternal
              life. However, this hope does not come from circumcision or from
              paganism, because these contribute nothing to it. Hence he says,

              dead” (Jam 2:26). For faith is a knowledge of the word of
              God—“That Christ may dwell by faith in your hearts” (Eph
              3:17)—which word is not perfectly possessed or perfectly known

              <b>If you be circumcised, Christ will profit you nothing.</b>
              I answer that it is from the general nature of the work that they
              are indifferent, namely, to those who do not put any trust in
              them; however, they are not indifferent, if you consider the
              intention of the one acting. For they are deadly to those who put
              their trust in them.

              I answer that if you consider the nature of the work, they are
              worse; but not if you consider the will. For the demons are
              displeased by the fact of their believing; furthermore, there is
              not as much malice in the will of a man who does not believe as

              harmfulness of anything is reckoned according to the greater good
              it hinders. Therefore, when someone is kept from many spiritual
              goods, it is an indication that he is faced with a great obstacle.
              Accordingly, in order to show them that they have a great
              obstacle, he reminds them of the spiritual goods they have lost,
              when he says:
              <b>You did run well,</b>
              namely, by means of the works of faith formed by charity, which
              incites one to run: “I have run the way of thy commandments, when
              thou didst enlarge my heart” (Ps 118:32). And this did indeed
              apply to you formerly; but while you were thus running, you came
              upon an obstacle. Therefore he says:
              <b>Who hath bewitched you?</b>
              (This has been discussed already in Chapter 3, hence we pass over
              it now).

              namely, of the Gospel,
              <b>that you should not obey it?</b>
              This is appropriately said: for obedience is the application of
              the will to the edict of the one who commands. That is why faith
              is a science of the will and of the understanding. It is suitable,
              therefore, for the will to obey the faith. But this is done by
              willing to believe that the grace of Christ is sufficient for
              salvation without the legal observances.

              Herein he shows what is required on their part to overcome this
              obstacle, namely, that henceforth they not give their consent to
              any deceiver: “We are not of the night nor of the darkness;
              therefore, let us not sleep” (1 Thes 5:5); “Have no fellowship
              with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them”
              (Eph 5:11); “And their speech spreadeth like a canker” (2 Tim
              2:17). From this it can be gathered that they were not yet

              Secundo assignat rationem huius cum dicit
              <i>persuasio enim</i>, et cetera. Et haec est duplex. Prima, quia
              homo cum dat se alicui, nihil debet facere nisi quod utile duxerit
              sibi. Sed vos traditi estis Christo, ergo non debetis audire, vel

              <i>haec persuasio</i>, qua vos volunt mittere sub iugo legis, quia
              non est <i>ex eo</i>, scilicet ex Deo, qui vos vocavit ad vitam,
              sed ex Diabolo, inquantum scilicet deficiens est, et ideo non
              consenseritis eis. Vel <i>non ex eo</i>, id est contra ipsum.

            <td>
              Secondly, he gives an explanation of this, when he says,
              <b>This persuasion is not from him that calleth you,</b>
              and it is twofold. First, because a man, when he gives himself to
              someone, ought to do nothing save what is of advantage to the
              latter. But you have been given to Christ. Therefore, you should
              not heed or consent to anyone but those who come from Him. Hence
              because
              <b>this persuasion,</b>
              by which they wish to set you under the yoke of the Law,
              <b>is not from him,</b>
              i.e., from God
              <b>who calleth you</b>
              to life, but from the devil, for it is degrading, you should not
              consent to them. Or,
              <b>not from him,</b>
              i.e., against Him.

              Secunda ratio est, quia posset dici quod non est magnum si paucis
              consentiatur, cum ex hoc non sit periculum, et ideo dicit quod non
              est eis consentiendum, nec eorum insidiae sunt contemnendae, sed
              debent principiis obstare, quia
              <i>modicum fermentum</i>, etc., id est illi pauci qui vobis
              persuadent. Vel haec persuasio, parva in principio,
              <i>totam massam corrumpit</i>, id est congregationem fidelium.
              Lev. II, 11:
              <i

              The second explanation is that they might suppose that consenting
              to a few is not a great matter, since it constitutes no danger.
              But he says that they must not consent to them at all, nor
              underestimate their artifices; rather they must oppose them at the
              start, because
              <b>a little leaven corrupteth the whole lump,</b>
              i.e., those few who are persuading you. Or,
              <b>This persuasion</b>
              small in the beginning
              <b>corrupts the whole lump,</b>

              eo quod non servabant legalia, quia ita edocti erant ab apostolo,
              et dicebant quod apostolus deceperat eos, et quod in servitutem
              eorum haec persuaserat eis: et confirmabant, dicentes Paulum
              praedicasse in Iudaea, et docuisse legalia debere servari. Et ideo
              excusat se de hoc apostolus, dicens
              <i>ego autem, fratres, si circumcisionem adhuc praedico</i>, sicut
              imponunt mihi pseudo,
              <i>quid adhuc persecutionem patior?</i>
              Scilicet a Iudaeis. I Cor. IV, 12:
              <i>persecutionem patimur</i>, et cetera. Nam Iudaei specialiter
              propter hoc persequebantur Paulum, quod praedicabat legalia non
              debere servari. Act. XXI, 21, dicit Iacobus Paulo:
              <i
                >audierunt de te quia discessionem doceas a Moyse eorum, qui per
                gentes sunt Iudaeorum, dicens eos non debere circumcidere
                filios</i
              >, et cetera. Patet ergo quod non est verum quod mihi imponunt,
              alioquin persecutiones adhuc non paterer.

              With respect to the first, it should be noted that the false
              brethren, when the Galatians excused themselves from observing the
              legal ceremonies because they had been so taught by the Apostle,
              declared that the Apostle misled them and that he persuaded them
              to this in order to lord it over them. As confirmation of this
              they alleged that when he preached in Judea, Paul taught that the
              legal ceremonies should be observed. But the Apostle clears
              himself of this, when he says,
              <b
                >And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
                suffer persecution</b
              >
              from the Jews? “We are persecuted and we suffer it” (1 Cor 4:12).
              For the Jews persecuted Paul precisely because he taught that the
              legal ceremonies should not be observed. Indeed in Acts (21:21)
              James says to Paul: “They have heard of thee that thou teachest
              those Jews who are among the Gentiles to depart from Moses; saying
              that they ought not to circumcise their children nor walk
              according to custom.” It is plain, therefore, that their charge is
              not true; otherwise, he would not have suffered their
              persecutions.

              False, too, is that which they impute to me because of something
              generally held by others; because if I preach circumcision,
              <b>Then is the scandal of the cross made void.</b>
              For not only I but all the apostles “Preach Christ crucified, to
              the Jews indeed a stumbling-block and unto the Gentiles,
              foolishness,” as is said in 1 Corinthians (1:23). And the main
              reason why they are scandalized is because we preach that through
              the Cross of Christ the legal ceremonies are made void. Therefore,
              if I preach circumcision, the stumbling-block is removed, i.e.,
              there will no longer be a stumbling-block for the Jews from the
              Cross. For they would endure it patiently; indeed, they would
              welcome it, if along with the Cross we preached the obligation to
              observe the legal ceremonies. Or, according to Augustine (on this
              passage)
              <b>the scandal of the cross is made void,</b>
              i.e., the Cross is made void; which is a scandal. As if to say:
              The Cross has lost its effect and its power:
              <b>If justice be by the law, then Christ died in vain</b>
              (2:21). Now the Apostle specifically says, the scandal of the
              cross is made void, to denote that the reason the Jews killed
              Christ was because He did not observe the legal ceremonies and
              taught that they were not to be observed: “This man is not of God
              who keepeth not the sabbath” (Jn 9:16).

            <td>
              But this is contrary to Romans (12:14): “Bless, and curse not.” To
              this there are two responses: first, that the Apostle was not
              calling down an evil on them but rather a blessing; because he was
              wishing them to be emasculated spiritually, i.e., abolish the
              legal ceremonies, that they might preserve spiritual chastity:
              “There are eunuchs who have made themselves such for the kingdom
              of heaven” (Mt 19:12). The second is that he is wishing them the
              impotence that eunuchs have, so that they might not procreate.
              Hence he says:
              <b>I would they were even cut off who trouble you</b>, i.e., that
              they lose the power of engendering among you and others. And this
              deservedly, because they engender sons unto error and subject them
              to the bondage of the Law: “Give them a womb without children, and
              dry breasts” (Hos. 9:14).

              The condition of standing is liberty. For the condition of any
              given state pertains either to liberty or to bondage; but the
              state of faith in Christ, to which the Apostle urges them,
              pertains to liberty and is liberty itself. Hence he says:
              <b>For you, brethren, have been called unto liberty</b>. As if to
              say: They are indeed troubling you; for they are drawing you from
              what is better to what is worse, because you have been called by
              God unto the liberty of grace: “You have not received the spirit
              of bondage again in fear, but you have received the spirit of
              adoption of sons” (Rom 8:15);
              <b>We are not the children of the bondwoman but of the free</b>
              (4:31). You, I say, who are free in Christ, they want to lead into
              bondage. But a state is being misused if it declines and if
              liberty of the spirit is perverted into slavery of the flesh. Now
              the Galatians were free of the Law; but lest they suppose this to
              be a license to commit sins forbidden by the Law, the Apostle
              touches on abuse of liberty, saying,
              <b>Only make not liberty an occasion to the flesh.</b>
              As if to say: You are free, but not so as to misuse your liberty
              by supposing that you may sin with impunity: “But take heed, lest
              perhaps this your liberty become a stumbling-block to the weak (1
              Cor 8:9).

              But since he said earlier that they have been called unto liberty,
              why does he now say, <b>serve one another</b> ? I answer that
              charity requires that we serve one another; nevertheless, it is
              free. Here one might interject that, as the Philosopher says, he
              is free who is for his own sake; whereas he is a slave who is for
              the sake of another as of a mover or an end. For a slave is moved
              to his work not by himself but by a master and for the benefit of
              his master. Charity, therefore, has liberty as to its movent
              cause, because it works of itself: “The charity of Christ presseth
              us” spontaneously, to work (2 Cor 5:14). But it is a servant when,
              putting one’s own interests aside, it devotes itself to things

              “Love is the fulfillment of the law” (13:10). Wherefore he says in

              <i

              similiter ad dilectionem proximi pertinent. Caeremonialia vero
              sunt sacrificia et huiusmodi quae reducuntur ad dilectionem Dei.
              Et sic patet, quod omnia in uno praecepto charitatis implentur
              <i>diliges proximum tuum sicut teipsum</i>: et est scriptum Lev.

              However, it is said in Matthew (22:40): “On these two
              commandments,” namely, of the love of God and of neighbor,
              “dependeth the whole law and the prophets.” Therefore, it is not
              fulfilled in the one precept alone. I answer that in the love of
              God is included love of neighbor: “This commandment we have from
              God, that he, who loveth God, love also his brother” (1 Jn 4:21).
              Conversely, we love our neighbor for the love of God.
              Consequently, the whole law is fulfilled in the one precept of
              charity. For the precepts of the law are reduced to that one
              precept. Indeed, precepts are either moral or ceremonial or
              judicial. The moral are the precepts of the decalogue: three
              concern the love of God, and the other seven the love of neighbor.
              The judicial are, for example, that whosoever steals anything
              shall restore fourfold, and others like this; and they pertain
              absolutely to the love of neighbor. The ceremonial concern
              sacrifices and related matters which are reduced to love of God.
              And so it is plain that all are fulfilled in the one precept of
              charity,
              <b>Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself,</b>
              which is also written in Leviticus (19:18).

              He says,
              <b>as thyself</b>, not “as much as thyself,” because according to
              the order of charity a man should love himself more than his
              neighbor. Now this is explained in three ways: First, as referring
              to the genuineness of the love. For to love is to will good to
              someone: hence we are said to love both the one to whom we will a
              good and the very good which we will to someone; but not in the
              same way. For when I will a good to myself, I love myself
              absolutely for myself, but the good which I will to myself, I do
              not love for itself but for myself. Accordingly, I love my
              neighbor as myself in the same way that I love myself, when I will
              him a good for his sake, and not because it is useful or pleasant
              for me.

              therefore, loves himself who wants for himself the good of
              understanding and reason. Accordingly, you then love your neighbor
              as yourself, when you will him the good of understanding and

                consumed one of another</b
              >, he urges them to follow charity, because of the harm we incur
              if we neglect it. Here he continues to speak to the Galatians as
              to spiritual men, not bringing up their greater vices but
              mentioning ones that seem to be minor, such as sins of the tongue.
              Hence he says:
              <b
                >If you bite and devour one another, take heed you be not
                consumed one of another</b
              >. As if to say: All the law is fulfilled in love;
              <b>but if you bite one another</b>, i.e., partially destroy the
              good name of your neighbor by slander (for one who bites takes not
              the whole but a part) <b>and devour</b>, i.e., destroy his good
              name entirely, and completely shame him by slander (for he that
              devours, consumes all): “Detract not one another, my brethren; he
              that detracteth his brother detracteth the law” (Jam 4:11). If you
              neglect charity in that way, I say,
              <b>take heed</b>
              for the calamity that threatens you, namely,
              <b>you might be devoured one of another:</b>
              “Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of the concision”
              (Phil 3:2); “1 have spent my strength without cause and in vain”
              (Is 49:4). For as Augustine says, by the vice of contention and
              envy pernicious rivalries are bred among men, and both life and
              society are thereby brought to ruin.

              Holy Spirit, by acting well. For the Holy Spirit moves and incites
              hearts to do well: “Whosoever are led by the Spirit of God, they
              are the sons of God” (Rom 8:14). One should walk, therefore, by
              the spirit, i.e., the mind, so that one’s reason or mind is in
              accord with the Law of God, as it is said in Romans (7:16). For
              the human spirit is fickle, and unless it is governed from
              elsewhere, it turns now in one direction and now in another, as is
              said in Sirach (34:6): “The heart fancieth as that of a woman in
              travail. Except it be a vision sent forth from the most High, set
              not thy heart upon them.” Hence Ephesians (4:17) says of certain
              ones: “They walk in the vanity of their mind.” Therefore the human
              reason cannot stand perfectly except to the extent that it is
              governed by a divine spirit.

              Now one ought to walk in the spirit, because it frees him from the
              defilement of the flesh. Hence he follows with:
              <b>and you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh,</b>
              i.e., the pleasures which the flesh suggests. This the Apostle
              yearned for, saying: “Unhappy man that I am, who shall deliver me
              from the body of this death?” (Rom 7:24). Later he concludes:
              “There is now therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ
              Jesus, who walk not according to the flesh” (Rom 8: 1). And at
              once he gives the reason for this: “For the law of the spirit of
              life in Christ Jesus hath delivered me from the law of sin and of
              death” (Rom 8:2). And this is the special desire of the saints,
              that they not fulfill the desires to which the flesh stirs them,
              but always understanding that in this are not included desires
              which pertain to the necessities of the flesh, but those that
              pertain to superfluities.

              He says therefore: It is necessary that by the spirit you overcome
              the desires of the flesh,
              <b>for the flesh lusteth against the spirit.</b>
              But one might have a doubt here, because, since lusting is an act
              of the soul alone, it does not seem to come from the flesh. I
              answer that, according to Augustine, the flesh is said to lust
              inasmuch as the soul lusts by means of the flesh, just as the eye
              is said to see, when as a matter of fact, it is the soul that sees
              by means of the eye. Consequently, the soul lusts by means of the
              flesh, when it seeks, according to the flesh, things which are
              pleasurable. But the soul lusts by means of itself, when it takes
              pleasure in things that are according to the spirit, as virtuous
              works, contemplation of divine things, and mediation of wisdom:
              “The desire of wisdom bringeth to the everlasting kingdom” (Wis
              6:21).

              concupiscentiam spiritus. Cum enim delectabilia carnis sint bona
              quae sunt infra nos, delectabilia vero spiritus bona quae sunt

              But if the flesh lusts by means of the spirit, how does it lust
              against it? It does so in the sense that the lusting of the flesh
              hinders the desires of the spirit. For since the pleasures of the
              flesh concern goods which are beneath us, whereas the pleasures of
              the spirit concern goods which are above us, it comes to pass that
              when the soul is occupied with the lower things of the flesh, it
              is withdrawn from the higher things of the spirit.

              But his further statement that
              <b>the spirit lusts against the flesh</b>
              may cause a problem. For if we take “spirit” for the Holy Spirit,
              and the desire of the Holy Spirit is against evil things, it seems
              to follow that the flesh against which the spirit lusts is
              evil—which is the Manichean error. I answer that the spirit does
              not lust against the nature of the flesh, but against its desires,
              namely, those that concern superfluities; hence he said above,
              <b>you shall not fulfil the lusts of the flesh</b>
              (v. 16), i.e., superfluous things. For in things necessary the
              spirit does not contradict the flesh, as we are told in Ephesians
              (5:29): “No man hateth his own flesh.”

              “The good which I will I do not: but the evil which I will not,
              that I do” (Rom 7:19). However, free will is not taken away. For
              since free will consists in having choice, there is freedom of the
              will with respect to things subject to choice. But not all that
              lies in us is fully subject to our choice, but only in a qualified
              sense. In specific cases we are able to avoid this or that
              movement of lust or anger, but we cannot avoid all movements of
              anger or lust in general—and this by reason of the “fomes”

              Here it should be noted that with respect to lusts there are four
              categories of men who do not that which they would. For
              intemperate men, who of set intention follow the passions of the
              flesh—according to Proverbs (2:14): “They are glad when they have
              done evil”—do, indeed, what they will, inasmuch as they follow
              their passions; but inasmuch as their reason complains and is
              displeased, they are doing what they would not. But incontinent
              persons, who resolve to abstain but are, nevertheless, conquered
              by their passions, do what they would not, inasmuch as they follow
              such passions contrary to what they resolved. As between these two
              types the intemperate do more of the things that they would.
              Those, however, who are continent, i.e., who would prefer not to
              lust at all, do what they intend, as long as they are not subject
              to lust; but because they cannot completely repress lust, they do
              what they would not. Finally, those who are temperate do what they
              would, inasmuch as there is no lust in the tamed flesh; but
              because it cannot be totally tamed so as never to rise up against
              the spirit—just as neither can malice so abound that reason would
              never complain—therefore, in those instances in which they do
              lust, they are doing what they would not; but for the most part
              they do what they would.

              Jerome infers from these words that after the coming of Christ no
              one having the Holy Spirit is obliged to observe the Law. But it
              should be recognized that the saying,
              <b>if you are led by the spirit, you are not under the law,</b>
              can be referred either to the ceremonial or to the moral precepts
              of the Law. If it is referred to the ceremonial precepts, then it
              is one thing to observe the Law and another to be under the Law.
              For to observe the Law is to carry out the works of the Law
              without putting any hope in them; but to be under the Law is to
              put one’s hope in the works of the Law. Now in the early Church
              there were some just men who observed the Law without being under
              the Law, inasmuch as they observed the works of the Law; but they
              were not under the Law in the sense of putting their hope in them.
              In this way even Christ was under the Law:
              <b>Made under the law</b> (4:4). Thus Jerome’s opinion is
              excluded.

              But if it is referred to the moral precepts, then to be under the
              Law can be taken in two ways: either as to its obliging force, and
              then all the faithful are under the Law, because it was given to
              all—hence it is said: I have not come to destroy the law but to
              fulfill it” (Mt 5:17)—or as to its compelling forces, and then the
              just are not under the Law, because the movements and breathings
              of the Holy Spirit in them are their inspiration; for charity
              inclines to the very things that the Law prescribes. Therefore,
              because the just have an inward law, they willingly do what the
              Law commands and are not constrained by it. But those who would do
              evil but are held back by a sense of shame or by fear of the Law
              are compelled. Accordingly, the just are under the Law as obliging
              but not as compelling, in which sense the unjust alone are under
              it: “Where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty” (2 Cor
              3:17); “The law,” as compelling, 11 is not made for the just man”

              esse opera carnis, sicut idolorum servitus, sectae, aemulationes,
              et huiusmodi. Respondeo. Dicendum est, secundum Augustinum Lib.
              XIV de Civ. Dei, c. II, quod secundum carnem vivit quicumque vivit
              secundum seipsum. Unde caro hic accipitur pro toto homine.
              Quidquid ergo provenit ex inordinato amore sui, dicitur opus
              carnis. Vel dicendum est, quod aliquod peccatum potest dici
              carnale dupliciter, scilicet quantum ad consummationem: et sic
              dicuntur carnalia illa tantum quae consummantur in delectatione
              carnis, scilicet luxuria et gula; et quantum ad radicem: et sic
              omnia peccata dicuntur carnalia, inquantum ex corruptione carnis
              anima aggravatur, ut dicitur Sap. IX, 15; ex quo intellectus
              debilitatus facilius decipi potest, et impeditur a sua perfecta
              operatione. Unde et ex hoc sequuntur vitia, scilicet haereses,
              sectae, et alia huiusmodi. Et hoc modo dicitur quod fomes est
              principium omnium peccatorum.
            </td>
            <td>
              With respect to the first, two doubts arise. First, as to,the
              Apostle’s mentioning things that do not pertain to the flesh, but
              which he says are works of the flesh, such as idolatry, sects,
              emulations, and the like. I answer that, according to Augustine in
              <i>The City of God</i>, (Bk. 14), he lives according to the flesh
              who lives according to himself. Hence flesh is taken here as
              referring to the whole man. Accordingly, whatever springs from
              disordered self-love is called a work of the flesh. Or, one should
              say that a sin can be called “of the flesh” in two ways: namely,
              with respect to fulfillment, and in this sense only those are sins
              of the flesh that are fulfilled in the pleasure of the flesh,
              namely, lust and gluttony; or with respect to their root, and in
              this sense all sins are called sins of the flesh, inasmuch as the
              soul is so weighed down by the weakness of the flesh (as is
              written in Wisdom 9:15) that the enfeebled intellect can be easily
              misled and hindered from operating perfectly. As a consequence,
              certain vices follow therefrom, namely, heresies, sects and the
              like. In this way it is said that the “ <i>fomes</i> ” is the
              source of all sins.

          <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
            <td>
              Secundo dubitatur, quia cum apostolus dicat
              <i>qui talia agunt, regnum Dei</i>
              non <i>consequentur</i>, et nullus excludatur a regno Dei, nisi
              pro peccato mortali, sequitur ergo quod omnia quae enumerat sint
              peccata mortalia. Cuius contrarium videtur, quia inter ista
              enumerat multa quae non sunt peccata mortalia, sicut est
              contentio, aemulatio, et huiusmodi. Respondeo. Dicendum est quod
              omnia haec enumerata sunt aliquo modo mortalia; sed quaedam quidem
              secundum genus suum, sicut homicidium, fornicatio, idolorum
              servitus et huiusmodi; quaedam vero secundum suam consummationem,
              sicut ira cuius consummatio est in nocumentum proximi. Unde si
              accedit consensus de ipso nocumento, est peccatum mortale. Et
              similiter comestio ordinatur ad delectationem cibi, sed si in
              huiusmodi delectationibus ponat quis finem suum, peccat
              mortaliter: et ideo non dicit comestiones, sed
              <i>comessationes</i>; et similiter intelligendum est de aliis
              similibus.
            </td>
            <td>
              The second doubt is that, since the Apostle says that
              <b
                >they who do such things shall not obtain the kingdom of God,</b
              >
              whereas no one is excluded from the kingdom of God except for
              mortal sin, it follows that all the sins enumerated are mortal
              sins. But the contrary seems to be the case, because in this list
              he enumerates many that are not mortal sins, such as contention,
              emulation, and the like. I answer that all the sins listed here
              are mortal one way or another: some are so according to their
              genus, as murder, fornication, idolatry, and the like; but others
              are mortal with respect to fulfillment, as anger, whose
              fulfillment consists in harm to neighbor. Hence if one consents to
              that harm, there is mortal sin. In like manner, eating is directed
              to the pleasure of food, but if one places his end in such
              pleasures, he sins mortally; accordingly, he does not say “eating”
              but revellings. And the same must be said of the others that are
              like this

              Tertio dubitatur de ordine et numeratione eorum. Circa quod
              dicendum est quod cum apostolus in diversis locis, diversa vitia
              et diversimode enumerat, non intendit enumerare omnia vitia
              ordinate et secundum artem, sed illa tantum in quibus abundant et

            <td>
              Thirdly, there is a doubt about the order followed in this list.
              However, it should be recognized that when the Apostle varies his
              enumeration of various vices in various texts, it is not his
              intention to enumerate all the vices in perfect order and
              according to the rules of the art, but only those in which the
              persons to whom he is writing abound and in which they are
              excessive. Therefore in these lists one should look not for
              completeness but for the cause of the variation.

              immodesty unto the working of all uncleanness” (Eph 4:19). The
              other inwardly, namely, unclean thoughts; as to this he says,

              As to the first, he enumerates the spiritual goods which he calls

              we enjoy; but we should enjoy not our acts, but God alone.
              Therefore, acts of this kind, which the Apostle lists here, ought
              not be called “fruits.” Furthermore, a Gloss says that these works
              of the spirit are to be sought for themselves; but that which is
              sought for itself is not referred to something else. Therefore
              virtues and their works are not to be referred to happiness.

              Respondeo. Dicendum est quod fructus dicitur dupliciter, scilicet
              ut acquisitus, puta ex labore vel studio, Sap. III, 15:
              <i>bonorum laborum gloriosus est fructus</i>, et ut productus,
              sicut fructus producitur ex arbore. Matth. c. VII, 18:
              <i>non potest arbor bona fructus malos facere</i>. Opera autem
              spiritus dicuntur fructus non ut adepti sive acquisiti, sed ut
              producti; fructus autem qui est adeptus, habet rationem ultimi
              finis, non autem fructus productus. Nihilominus tamen fructus sic
              acceptus duo importat, scilicet quod sit ultimum producentis,
              sicut ultimum quod producitur ab arbore est fructus eius, et quod
              sit suave sive delectabile. Cant. II, 3:
              <i>fructus eius dulcis gutturi meo</i>. Sic ergo opera virtutum et
              spiritus sunt quid ultimum in nobis. Nam spiritus sanctus est in
              nobis per gratiam, per quam acquirimus habitum virtutum, et ex hoc
              potentes sumus operari secundum virtutem. Sunt etiam delectabilia,
              et sunt etiam fructuosa. Rom. VI, 22:
              <i>habetis fructum vestrum in sanctificationem</i>, id est in
              operibus sanctificatis, et ideo dicuntur fructus. Dicuntur etiam
              flores respectu futurae beatitudinis, quia sicut ex floribus
              accipitur spes fructus, ita ex operibus virtutum habetur spes
              vitae aeternae et beatitudinis. Et sicut in flore est quaedam
              inchoatio fructus, ita in operibus virtutum est quaedam inchoatio
              beatitudinis, quae tunc erit quando cognitio et charitas
              perficientur.
            </td>
            <td>
              I answer that “fruit” is said in two ways: namely, as something
              acquired, for example, from labor or study-“The fruit of good
              labors is glorious” (Wis 3:15)-and as something produced, as fruit
              is produced from a tree: “A good tree cannot bear evil fruit” (Mt
              7:18). Now the works of the spirit are called fruits, not as
              something earned or acquired, but as produced. Furthermore, fruit
              which is acquired has the character of an ultimate end; not,
              however, fruit which is produced. Nevertheless’ fruit so
              understood implies two things: namely, that it is the last thing
              of the producer, as the last thing produced by a tree is its
              fruit, and that it is sweet or delightful: “His fruit was sweet to
              my palate” (Cant 2:3). So, then, the works of the virtues and of
              the spirit are something last in us. For the Holy Spirit is in us
              through grace, through which we acquire the habit of the virtues;
              these in turn make us capable of working according to virtue.
              Furthermore, they are delightful and even fruitful: “You have your
              fruit unto sanctification, i.e., in holy works (Rom 6:22). And
              that is why they are called fruits. But they are also called
              “flowers,” namely, in relation to future happiness; because just
              as from flowers hope of fruit is taken, so from works of the
              virtues is obtained hope of eternal life and happiness. And as in
              the flower there is a beginning of the fruit, so in the works of
              the virtues is a beginning of happiness, which will exist when
              knowledge and charity are made perfect.

              virtutum propter se sunt appetenda formaliter, sed non finaliter,

              From this the answer to the second objection is plain. For
              something can be said to be worthy of being sought
              <i>for</i> itself in two ways, according as “for” (<i>propter</i>)
              designates formal cause or final cause. Works of the virtues are
              to be sought for themselves formally but not finally, because they
              are a delight in themselves. For a sweet medicine is formally
              sought for itself, because it has something within itself that
              makes it pleasant, namely, sweetness, which however is sought for
              an end, namely, for the sake of health. But a bitter medicine is
              not sought formally for itself, because it does not please by
              reason of its form; yet it is sought for something else finally,
              namely, for health, which is its end.

              Ex his apparet ratio quare apostolus effectus carnis vocat
              <i>opera</i>, fructus autem spiritus, vocat <i>fructus</i>. Dictum
              est enim, quod fructus dicitur aliquod finale et suave, ex re
              productum. Quod autem producitur ex aliquo praeter naturam eius,
              non habet rationem fructus, sed quasi alterius germinis. Opera
              autem carnis et peccata sunt praeter naturam eorum quae Deus
              naturae nostrae inseruit. Deus enim humanae naturae quaedam semina
              inseruit, scilicet naturalem appetitum boni et cognitionem, et
              addidit etiam dona gratiae. Et ideo quia opera virtutum ex his
              naturaliter producuntur, fructus dicuntur, non autem opera carnis.
              Et propter hoc apostolus dicit Rom. VI, 21:
              <i
                >quem ergo fructum habuistis tunc in illis, in quibus nunc
                erubescitis?</i
              >
              Patet ergo ex dictis quod fructus spiritus dicuntur opera
              virtutum, et quia habent in se suavitatem et dulcedinem, et quia
              sunt quoddam ultimum productum secundum convenientiam donorum.
            </td>
            <td>
              This explains why the Apostle calls the effects of the flesh
              “works,” but the fruits of the spirit he calls “fruits.” For it
              has been pointed out that a fruit is something last and sweet,
              produced from a thing. On the other band, that which is produced
              from something but not according to nature, does not have the
              character of fruit but is, as it were, an alien growth. Now the
              works of the flesh and sins are alien to the nature of those
              things which God has planted in our nature. For God planted in
              human nature certain seeds, namely, a natural desire of good and
              knowledge, and He added gifts of grace: And therefore, because the
              works of the virtues are produced naturally from these, they are
              called “fruits,” but the works of the flesh are not. And for this
              reason, the Apostle says: “What fruit, therefore, had you then in
              those things of which you are now ashamed?” (Rom 6:21). It is
              plain, therefore, from what has been said, that the works of the
              virtues are called fruits of the spirit, both because they have a
              sweetness and delight in themselves and because they are the last
              and congruous products of the gifts.

              The difference from one another of the gifts, beatitudes, virtues
              and fruits is taken in the following way. In a virtue can be
              considered the habit and the act. Now the habit of a virtue
              qualifies a person to act well. If it enables him to act well in a
              human mode, it is called a virtue. But if it qualifies one for
              acting well, above the human mode, it is called a gift. Hence the
              Philosopher, above the common virtues, puts certain heroic
              virtues: thus, to know the invisible things of God darkly is in
              keeping with the human mode, and such knowledge pertains to the
              virtue of faith; but to know the same things more penetratingly
              and above the human mode pertains to the gift of understanding.
              But as to the act of a virtue, it is either perfective, and in
              this way is a beatitude; or it is a source of delight, and in this
              way it is a fruit. Of these fruits it is said in the Apocalypse
              (22:2): “On both sides of the river was the tree of life, bearing
              twelve fruits.”

              Now a man is perfected and directed inwardly both as to good
              things and as to evil: “By the armor of justice on the right hand
              and on the left” (2 Cor 6:7). With respect to good things a person
              is perfected, first of all, in his heart through love. For just as
              in natural movements there is first an inclination of a nature’s
              appetite to its end, so the first of the inward movements is the
              inclination to good, i.e., love; accordingly, the first fruit is
              <b>charity:</b> “The charity of God is poured forth in our hearts
              by the Holy Ghost Who is given to us” (Rom 5:5). And through
              charity the others are perfected; wherefore, the Apostle says in
              Colossians (3:14): “But above all these things have ‘charity,
              which is the bond of perfection.” But the ultimate end that
              perfects man inwardly is joy, which proceeds from the presence of
              the thing loved. And he that has charity already has what he
              loves: “He that abideth in charity abideth in God and God in him
              (1 Jn 4:16). And from this springs joy: “Rejoice in the Lord
              always; again I say, rejoice” (Phil 4:4).

              But this joy should be perfect, and for this two things are
              required: first, that the object loved be enough to perfect the
              lover. And as to this he says, <b>peace</b>. For it is then that
              the lover has peace, when he adequately possesses the object
              loved: I am become in his presence as one finding peace” (Cant
              8:10). Secondly, that there be perfect enjoyment of the thing
              loved, which is likewise obtained by peace, because whatever else
              happens, if someone perfectly enjoys the object loved, say God, he
              cannot be hindered from enjoying it: “Much peace have they that
              love thy law and to them there is no stumbling-block” (Ps
              118:165). In this way, therefore, joy connotes the fruition of
              charity, but peace the perfection of charity. And by these is man
              inwardly made perfect as to good things.

              Also with respect to evils, the Holy Spirit perfects and adjusts a
              person: first, against the evil that disturbs peace, which is
              disturbed by adverse objects. Touching this the Holy Spirit
              perfects one by patience, which makes for patient endurance of
              adversities; hence he says,
              <b>patience</b>: “In your patience you shall possess your souls”
              (Lk 21:19). Secondly, against the evil which hinders joy, namely,
              the deferment of the object loved, the Spirit opposes
              long-suffering, which is not broken by delay. As to this he says,
              longanimity: “If it make any delay, wait for it; for it shall
              surely come, and it shall not be slack” (Hab. 2:3): “In

              In regard to his neighbor He perfects men, first of all, from the
              heart with a right and good will. Concerning this he says,
              <b>goodness</b>, i.e., rectitude and gentleness of spirit. For if
              a man has all his other powers good, he cannot be said to be good
              unless he has a good will, according to which he uses all the
              others well. The reason for this is that the good denotes
              something perfect. But perfection is twofold: the first concerns
              the being of a thing; the second, its operation-and the latter is
              greater than the former. For that is called perfect in the
              absolute sense which has attained its perfect operation, which is
              its second perfection. Therefore, since it is by his will that man
              exercises the act of any power, right will makes for the good use
              of all the powers, and, consequently, makes the man himself good.
              Of this fruit it is said in Ephesians (5:9): “The fruit of the
              light is in all goodness and justice and truth.”

              Touching what is beneath us, namely, the body, the Spirit directs
              us first as to the outward acts of the body by
              <b>modesty</b>, which moderates its deeds or utterances—concerning
              this he says, modesty: “Let your modesty be known to all men”
              (Phil 4-5). Secondly, as to the interior appetite, and concerning
              this he says <b>continency</b>, which abstains even from things
              that are lawful; and <b>chastity</b>, which correctly uses what is
              lawful, as a Gloss says. Or, another way: continence refers to the
              fact that although a man be assailed by base desires, yet by the
              vigor of his reason he holds fast lest he be carried away.
              According to this the word “continence” is taken from a person’s
              holding fast under attack. But “chastity” is taken from the fact
              that one is neither attacked nor carried away, and is derived from
              “chastening.” For we call him well-chastened who is rightly
              tempered in all things.

              Concerning the aforesaid, two problems arise. The first is that
              since the fruits of the spirit are opposed to the works of the
              flesh, it seems that the Apostle should have mentioned as many
              fruits of the spirit as he mentioned works of the flesh—which he
              did not do. I answer that he did not do so, because there are more
              vices than virtues.

              Secundo dubitatur, quia fructus spiritus hic positi non respondent
              operibus carnis. Ad hoc dicendum est quod apostolus non intendit
              hic tradere artem virtutum et vitiorum, et ideo non ponit unum
              contra aliud, sed aliqua enumerat de istis et aliqua de illis,

              The second problem is that the fruits of the spirit mentioned do

              is not the Apostle’s intention here to teach the art of the
              virtues and vices, he does not set one against the other; but he
              mentions as many of the one and as many of the other as are suited

              one to them: “For I am delighted with the law of God according to
              the inward man “ (Rom 7:22). Or they do the works of the flesh;

              Therefore, including himself with those to whom he writes, he
              says: I say that we ought to walk by the Spirit, because we live
              by Him and not by the flesh: “We are debtors not to the flesh to
              live according to the flesh” (Rom 8:12). Therefore,
              <b>If we live in the Spirit,</b> we ought in all things to be led
              by Him. For as in bodily life the body is not moved save by the
              soul, by which it has life, so in the spiritual life, all of our
              movements should be through the Holy Spirit: “It is the spirit
              that giveth life” (Jn 6:64); “In him we live and move and are”
              (Acts 17:28). But lest the things said of the spirit be understood
              of the spirit of the world-concerning which it is said in 1
              Corinthians (2:12): ‘We have received not the spirit of this
              world”—the Apostle forestalls this when he says,
              <b
                >Let us not be made desirous of vainglory, provoking one
                another, envying one another</b
              >. Here he excludes things proper to the spirit of the world,
              namely, vainglory, anger and envy, all three of which are aptly
              described by the word “spirit.”

              For “spirit” denotes a swelling. According to this, then, those
              are called vain spirits who are swollen with vainglory: “The blast
              of the mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a wall” (Is
              25:4). Concerning this he says,
              <b>Let us not be made desirous of vainglory,</b>
              i.e., of worldly glory. For since that is vain which is not
              solidly established nor supported by truth nor loved for any
              usefulness, then the glory of this world is vain, because it is
              frail and not solid: “All flesh is grass” (Is 40:6). Furthermore,
              it is false—“The glory of a sinful man is dung and worms” (1 Mac
              2:62)—whereas true glory concerns goods appropriate to man, i.e.,
              the goods of the spirit, such as holy men have: “Our glory is
              this, the testimony of our conscience” (2 Cor 1:12). Furthermore,
              this glory is useless and fruitless: for how great soever the
              glory one acquires from the testimony of men, he cannot on that
              account achieve his end, which is achieved by the testimony of
              God: “He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord” (1 Cor 1:31).

              Therefore, because he had said so much about sin, then, lest
              anyone free of sin be severe toward sinners, he gives them an
              admonition about meekness and mercy, saying:

              admonition. The first consists in being come upon unawares. For
              when some sin out of malice, they are less worthy of forgiveness:
              “Who as it were on purpose have revolted from him and would not
              understand all his ways” (Job 34:27). But when one is overtaken by
              temptation and lured into sin, pardon should be granted him more
              readily. That is why he says,
              <b>and if a man be overtaken in any fault</b>, i.e., fall through
              want of circumspection and because of trickery, so that he could

              Tertium est peccatorum qualitas. Nam quaedam peccata consistunt in

              prima secundis: quia illa opponuntur praeceptis negativis, quae

              The third is the quality of the sin. For some sins consist in

              the second, because the former are opposed to negative precepts
              which bind always and at every moment; whereas the latter, being
              opposed to affirmative precepts, since they do not bind one at
              every moment, it cannot be known definitely when they do bind.
              Hence it is said in Psalm 18 (13): “Who can understand sins?” And
              touching this he says,
              <b>in any fault</b>. Or, according to a Gloss, a fault is a sin

              “The spiritual man judgeth all things, and he himself is judged of
              no man” (1 Cor 2:15). The reason for this is that he has a correct
              judgment of all things, being rightly disposed to each thing, as a
              person with a healthy taste is the best judge of flavor. Now the

              But although the name “spirit” suggests unyielding energy,
              according to the saying of Isaiah (25:4): “For the spirit of the
              mighty is like a whirlwind beating against a wall,” it should not
              be supposed that spiritual men are over-strict in correcting. For
              the spirit of this world does that, but the Holy Spirit produces a
              certain gentleness and sweetness in a man: “0, how good and sweet
              is thy spirit, O Lord, in all things” (Wis 12:1). Hence he says,
              <b>in the spirit of meekness</b>: “The just man shall correct me
              in mercy and shall reprove me” (Ps 140:5). Contrariwise, it is
              said of some in Ezechiel (34:4): “You ruled over them with vigor
              and with a high hand.” Furthermore, he says, <b>instruct</b>, and
              not “correct,” because he is speaking of those who fall by being
              overtaken, and these need instruction; or because every sinner
              falls through some lack of knowledge: “They err that work evil”
              (Prov 14:22).

              Here he admonishes them to support one another, saying,
              <b>Bear ye one another’s burdens</b>. And this is to be done in
              three ways. In one way by patiently enduring the bodily or
              spiritual defects of another: “We that are stronger ought to bear
              the infirmities of the weak” (Rom 15:1). In a second way by coming
              to one another’s aid in their needs: “Communicating to the
              necessities of the saints” (Rom 12:13). In a third way by making
              satisfaction through prayers and works for the punishment one has
              incurred: “A brother that is helped by his brother is like a
              strong city” (Prov 18:19). Now the reason for this admonition is
              the fulfillment of the law of Christ. But this is charity: “The
              fulfillment of the law is love” (Rom 13: 10). Hence he says:

              Dicitur autem charitas specialiter lex Christi triplici ratione.
              Primo, quia per hoc distinguitur lex nova a lege veteri: nam illa
              est timoris, haec vero amoris. Unde Augustinus dicit:
              <i>parva differentia est veteris legis et novae: timor et amor</i
              >. Secundo, quia per charitatem specialiter Christus legem suam
              promulgavit. Io. XIII, 35:
              <i
                >in hoc cognoscent omnes, quia mei estis discipuli, si
                dilectionem</i
              >, etc.; et iterum:
              <i>mandatum novum do vobis, ut diligatis invicem</i>, et cetera.
              Tertio quia ipsam implevit Christus, et exemplum eam implendi
              nobis reliquit. Nam ipse ex charitate peccata nostra tulit. Is.
              LIII, 4: <i>vere languores nostros ipse tulit</i>. I Petr. II, 24:
              <i>qui peccata nostra pertulit in corpore suo super lignum</i>, et
              cetera. Is. XL, 11: <i>foetas ipse portabit</i>. Sic ergo debemus
              alter alterius onera portare ex charitate, ut sic impleamus legem
              Christi.
            </td>
            <td>
              There are three reasons why charity is specifically linked with
              the law of Christ. First, because by it the New Law is
              distinguished from the Old; for the former is a law of fear, but
              the latter of love. Hence Augustine says: “Fear and love is the
              slight difference between the Old Law and the New.” Secondly,
              because Christ expressly promulgated His law in terms of charity:
              “By this shall all men know that you are my disciples, if you have
              love one for another” (Jn 13:35); again: “A new commandment I give
              unto you: that you love one another, as I have loved you” (v. 34).
              Thirdly, because Christ fulfilled it and left us an example bow to
              fulfill it; for he bore our sins out of charity: “Surely he hath
              borne our infirmities”’ (Is 53:4); “Who his own self bore our sins
              in his body upon the tree, that we, being dead to sins, should
              live to justice” (1 Pet. 2:24); “He himself shall carry them that
              are with young” (Is 40:11). Thus, then, ought we to carry one
              another’s burdens out of charity, that so we may fulfill the law
              of Christ.

              He says therefore: Do as I say. But it sometimes happens that one
              does not carry another’s burdens, because he prefers himself to
              others. Hence such a one said in Luke (18:11): “I am not as the
              rest of men, extortioners, unjust, adulterers.” Therefore he says,
              <b>For if any man think himself to be something,</b>

              Now the way to avoid such a failing is to consider one’s own
              defects, for it is because one considers the defects of others and
              not his own that he seems to himself to be some thing in
              comparison to others in whom he observes defects; and not
              considering his own, he has a feeling of pride. Hence he says,
              <b>But let every one prove</b>, i.e., diligently examine,
              <b>his</b>, i.e., his own, work, both inward and outward: “Let a
              man prove himself” (1 Cor 11:28), <b>and so in himself</b>, i.e.,
              in his own conscience, <b>he shall have glory</b>, i.e., shall
              glory and rejoice—“For our glory is this, the testimony of our
              conscience” (2 Cor 1:12)— <b>and not in another</b>, i.e., not in
              being praised by someone else. Or thus: <b>in himself</b>, i.e.,
              in things that are his own, <b>he will have glory</b>, i.e., he
              will glory by considering himself; <b>and not in another</b>,
              i.e., not by considering, others: “Gladly, therefore, will I glory

              account. This, everyone will carry for himself, whether it be a
              burden of reward or of punishment. For “burden” signifies the
              weight sometimes of punishment, sometimes of reward: “Working for
              us an eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor 4:17); “Say to the just man

              the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be given
              him” (Is 3:10). But if some are said to render an account for
              others, as prelates for subjects, according to Ezechiel (3:20): “I
              will require his blood at thy hand”; and Hebrews (13:17): “Obey
              your prelates.... for they watch as being to render an account of
              your souls”; this is not contrary to the words of the Apostle,
              because they are not punished for the sins of their subjects but
              for their own, which they committed in ruling them.

              But it should be noted that a disciple can communicate in two ways
              with his teacher. First, so as to receive good things from the
              teacher; and so it is said,
              <b>Let him that is instructed in the word communicate</b>, i.e.,
              make common to himself what belonged to the teacher, by imitating
              him: “Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ” (1 Cor 11:1).
              But because teachers might at times not do what is good, they are
              not to be imitated in this Hence he adds, in all good things:
              “Whatsoever they shall say to you, observe and do: but according
              to their works, do ye not” (Mt 23:3). Secondly, that he
              communicate his own goods to the teacher. For this is commanded by
              the Lord: “They who preach the gospel should live by the gospel”
              (1 Cor 9:14); “The workman is worthy of his meat” (Mt 10:10); “The
              laborer is worthy of his hire” (Lk 10:7); and the Apostle says,
              “If we have sown unto you spiritual things, is it a great matter
              if we reap your carnal things?” (1 Cor 9:11). And therefore he
              says here,
              <b
                >Let him that is instructed in the word communicate to him that
                instructeth</b
              >, i.e., the one taught should communicate to the teacher,
              <b>in all good things</b> that he has; for even temporal things
              are called goods: “If you be willing and will hearken to me, you
              shall eat the good things of the land” (Is 1:19); “If you then,
              being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children: how much
              more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to them
              that ask him?” (Mt 7:11).

              primam quidem sic: tu dicis quod debemus imitari doctores etiam in

              Error est hoc dicere. Nam mala praelatorum non excusant nos. Non
              enim sunt subditis in exemplum, nisi in his quibus imitantur
              Christum, qui est pastor absque peccato; unde et signanter dicit
              Io. c. X, 11: <i>ego sum pastor bonus</i>, et cetera. Et apostolus
              I Cor. IV, 16 et XI, 1 dicit:
              <i>imitatores mei estote, sicut et ego Christi</i>; quasi dicat:
              in his me imitamini, in quibus ego imitor Christum. Etsi per mala
              praelatorum excusatis vos apud homines, tamen
              <i>Deus non irridetur</i>, id est, non potest falli. Iob XIII, 9:
              <i>aut decipietur ut homo fraudulentiis vestris?</i>
              Unde dicitur Prov. III, 34:

              He says, therefore:
              <b>Be not deceived; God is not mocked.</b>
              This can be taken in two ways, according to the two explanations
              given above. According to the first, this way: You say that we
              ought to imitate our teachers even in good things, but I cannot
              imitate them save in the things they do; and the only thing I
              observe in them is evil. Therefore, I ought to imitate them in
              evil. But he dismisses this, when he says,
              <b>Be not deceived, God is not mocked</b>. As if to say: It is
              erroneous to say this, for the evils of the prelates do not excuse
              us, because they are an example to their subjects only in those
              matters in which they imitate Christ, Who is the shepherd without
              sin. Hence he expressly says in John (10:11): “I am the good
              shepherd”; and the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians (4:16); (11:1):
              “Be imitators of me, as I also am of Christ.” As if to say:
              Imitate me in those things in which I imitate Christ. And although
              you excuse yourself before men because of the evil acts of
              prelates, yet <b>God is not mocked,</b> i.e., cannot be deceived:
              “Shall he be deceived as a man, with your deceitful dealings?”
              (Job 13:9). Hence it is said in Proverbs (3:34): “He shall scorn
              the scorners.”

              i.e., he will be rewarded according to his good deeds, great or
              small, both as to the quality of the works and the quantity of the
              good deeds: “He that soweth sparingly, shall also reap sparingly;
              and he who soweth in blessings, shall also reap blessings” (2 Cor
              9:6).

              To sow in the flesh is to work for the body and for the flesh. As
              though I were to say: I have spent much on that man, i.e., I have
              done many things for him. Hence he sows in the flesh who in all
              that he does, even in things that seem good, does them to favor
              and benefit the flesh. But with respect to reaping corruption of

              on some lands wheat seeds degenerate into siligo or something
              else. Now the condition of the flesh is that it is corruptible;

              <b>he that soweth in his flesh</b>, i.e., directs his works and

              Then when he says,

              perseverance in ministering, because we should do good not only
              for a time but always. This can be referred to those already
              mentioned, namely, to superiors, to equals, and to those who are
              lower. As if to say: Whatever our station, whether prelates
              towards subjects, or equals toward equals, or subjects toward
              prelates, <b>in doing good</b>, let us not fail, i.e., in doing
              good works; because in reaping we shall not fail: “Whatsoever thy
              band is able to do, do it earnestly” (Sir 9:10); “Be ye steadfast
              and unmovable” (1 Cor 15:58). And it is important that we do not
              fail; because we hope for an eternal and unfailing reward. Hence
              he adds: <b>for in due time we shall reap</b>, not failing.
              Therefore Augustine says: “If a man puts no limit on his works,
              God will put none on His reward.” But note that he says,
              <b>in due time</b>: because a farmer does not immediately reap the
              fruit of what he sows, but at the suitable time: “Behold the
              husbandman waits for the precious fruit of the earth; patiently
              bearing till he receive the early and latter rain” (Jam 5:7). Of
              this harvest it is said: “Who soweth in blessings shall also reap
              of the blessings, eternal life” (2 Cor 9:6).

              But this seems to be contrary to Sirach (12:5): “Give to the good
              and receive not the sinner.” Therefore we are not obliged to do
              good to everyone. I answer that in the sinner are two things:
              namely, his nature and his guilt. Now the nature in everyone,
              including an enemy, must be loved and upheld: “Love your enemies”
              (Mt 5:44). But the guilt in them is to be shunned. Therefore, when
              it is said, “Give to the just and receive not the sinner,” the
              meaning is that you ought not to do good to the sinner precisely
              as he is a sinner, but because he is a human being. Hence
              Augustine says: “Be not remiss” in judging, or inhuman in helping.
              Therefore, in evil men let us attack their sin, but show mercy to
              our common condition.”

              But here it might be asked whether it is lawful to love one more
              than another. To answer this, it should be noted that love can be
              called greater or less in two ways. In one way, from the
              standpoint of the object; in another, from the intensity of the
              act. For to love someone is to will good to him. Accordingly, one
              can love one person more than another, either because he wills him
              a greater good, which is the object of love, or because he more
              intensely wills him a good, i.e., with a more intense love.
              Therefore, with respect to the first, we ought to love everyone
              equally, because we ought to wish the good of eternal life to
              everyone; but with respect to the second, it is not necessary that
              we love all equally, because since the intensity of an act results
              from the principle of the action, and the principle of the action
              is union and similarity, we ought to love in a higher degree and
              more intensely those who are more like us and more closely united
              to us.

              depravandi et falsificandi Scripturas canonicas, nec non et
              permiscendi aliqua eorum quae haeresim sapiant; propter hoc
              consuetudo fuit ab apostolo servata, quod quando aliqua contra eos
              scribebat, in fine litterae aliqua scriberet, ut depravari non
              posset, et ita innotesceret eis de eius conscientia processisse,
              sicut I Cor. c. ult. dicit:
              <i>salutatio mea manu Pauli</i>. Totam enim epistolam per alium,
              eo dictante, scribi faciebat, et postea in fine aliquid propria
              manu addebat. Et secundum hunc modum ea quae sequuntur, ab isto
              loco scripsit Paulus manu propria. Unde dicit

              scilicet praedicta firmius teneatis, ut scientes a me hanc
              epistolam missam magis obediatis. Sic ergo praelati debent propria
              manu scribere, ut quod docent verbo et scripto, ostendant exemplo.
              Ideo dicitur Is. XLIX, 16: <i>in manibus</i>, id est in operibus
              meis, <i>descripsi te</i>, et cetera. Ex. XXXII, 15 dicitur de
              Moyse, quod descendit portans duas tabulas lapideas scriptas
              digito Dei.

              As to the first, it should be noted that heretics were wont to
              distort and falsify the canonical scriptures and append things
              that savored of heresy. Because of this, whenever the Apostle
              wrote anything against them, he followed the practice of writing
              something at the end of the epistle, so that it could not be
              distorted. In this way it could be known that it came from him
              with full knowledge of its contents. Thus in 1 Corinthians (16:21)
              he says: “The salutation of me, Paul, with my own hand.” For he
              allowed the entire epistle to be written by someone else at his
              dictation; then, at the end, he added something in his own hand.
              According to this procedure, then, whatever followed from that
              place on, Paul wrote in his own hand. Hence he says;
              <b>See what a letter I have written to you with my own hand</b>;
              to the end, namely, that you might firmly hold to the foregoing,
              and that knowing this epistle is sent by me, you might obey
              better. In this way, then, prelates ought to write in their own
              hand, so that what they teach by word and script, they may show by
              example. Hence it is said in Isaiah (49:16): “1 have graven thee
              in my hands” (i.e., works); and in Exodus (Ch. 32) it is said of
              Moses that he descended carrying two stone tablets written by the
              finger of God.

              sake of the other; namely, that they might thereby please the Jews
              for having introduced the observances of the Law in the Church of
              the Gentiles. And this is what he says:
              <b>As many as desire to please</b>, namely, the unbelieving Jews,
              <b>they constrain you to be circumcised</b>
              not by absolute force, but, as it were, by placing a condition,
              saying: “Except you be circumcised after the manner of Moses, you
              cannot be saved,” as is recorded in Acts (15:1).

              <i
                >ego autem, fratres, si adhuc circumcisionem praedico, quid
                adhuc persecutionem patior</i

              inducebant circumcisionem. Et ideo dicit: et etiam hoc propter hoc
              <i>tantum</i> faciunt,

              They further intended to derive some security from this For the
              Jews persecuted the disciples of Christ, because of the preaching
              of the Cross: “But we preach Christ crucified, unto the Jews,
              indeed, a stumbling-block, and unto the Gentiles, foolishness” (1
              Cor 1:23). And this because through the preaching of the Cross the
              works of the Law were made void. For if the apostles had preached,
              along with the Cross of Christ, that the legal ceremonies were to
              be observed, the Jews would not have persecuted the apostles.
              Hence he said:
              <b
                >And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumcision, why do I yet
                suffer persecution?</b

              (5:11). Therefore, in order to escape persecution from the Jews,
              some urged circumcision. So he says: And they do this for the

              Vel hoc etiam faciebant ad vitandam persecutionem, non solum

              Consequently, anyone who believed in Christ and was not
              circumcised was subject to persecution from the Gentiles and Jews.

              their faith in Christ and that they might live in peace, they

              But because the false brethren might say that they urged
              circumcision not for that reason, but solely because of their zeal
              for the Law, then excluding this, he proves his proposition thus,
              when he says:
              <b
                >For neither they themselves who are circumcised keep the
                law.</b
              >
              For it is obvious that if through zeal for the Law they urged
              certain ones to observe the Law, they should also command the Law
              to be fulfilled in other matters. But neither those who are
              circumcised nor the false brethren keep the Law in other matters,
              namely, in moral matters, which are more important in the Law, and
              in other observances: “None of you keeps the law” (Jn 7:19).
              Therefore it was not from zeal for the Law that they urged
              circumcision: “Circumcision profiteth, indeed, if you keep law”
              (Rom 2:25).
              <b>But</b> the reason why
              <b>they will have you to be circumcised</b>

              <b>they may glory</b> among the Jews for making so many

              because you go round about the sea and the land to make one
              proselyte; and when he is made, you make him the child of hell

              <i>vivo ego, iam non ego, vivit vero in me Christus</i>.

              He says therefore: The intention of the seducers is obvious, for
              they glory in the flesh; but I seek my glory elsewhere, namely, in
              the Cross. And this is what he says:
              <b
                >But God forbid that I should glory, save in the cross of our
                Lord Jesus Christ.</b
              >
              Notice that where the worldly philosopher felt shame, there the
              Apostle found his treasure: what the former regarded as foolish
              became for the Apostle wisdom and glory, as Augustine says. For
              each person glories in that through which he is considered great.
              Thus a person who regards himself as great in his riches, glories
              in them; and so on for other things. For one who regards himself
              to be great in nothing but Christ glories in Christ alone. But the
              Apostle was such a one; hence he says:
              <b>I live now not I; but Christ liveth in me</b>
              (2:20).

              Accordingly he glories in nothing but Christ and particularly in
              the Cross of Christ; and this because in it are found all the
              things about which men usually glory. For some glory in the
              friendship of the great, such as of kings and princes; and this
              friendship the Apostle found most of all in the Cross, because
              there an obvious sign of divine friendship is shown: “But God
              commendeth his charity towards us; because when as yet we were
              sinners according to the time, Christ died for us” (Rom 5:8). For
              nothing shows His mercy to us as much as the death of Christ.
              Hence Gregory: “O inestimable love of charity! To redeem the
              servant, He delivered His Son.”

              The sign of his own intention he shows, saying
              <b>by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</b>
              But since this which he says,
              <b
                >But God forbid that I should glory save in the cross of our
                Lord Jesus Christ</b

              one negative statement, he is really giving two signs that prove
              both statements. First, he proves the negative one, namely, that
              he does not glory save in the cross. He does this when he says,
              <b>by whom the world is crucified to me, and I to the world.</b>
              For that in which a person glories is not dead in his heart, but
              rather that which he scorns: I am forgotten as one dead, from the
              heart” (Ps 30:13). But it is plain that the world and all things
              in it were dead in the heart of Paul: “I count all things as dung,
              that I may gain Christ” (Phil 3:8). Therefore he does not glory in
              the world or in the things that are in the world. And this is what
              he says: Verily,
              <b>I glory in nothing save in the cross of Christ, by whom,</b>
              namely, Christ crucified,
              <b>the world is crucified to me,</b>
              i.e., is dead in my heart, so that I covet nothing in it.

              Secundo probat affirmativam, scilicet quod in cruce Christi
              gloriatur, dicens se crucifixum mundo. Qui enim gloriatur in
              aliquo, illud in se praetendit, et manifestare desiderat; sed
              apostolus nihil in se praetendit, nec manifestare desiderat, nisi
              quod pertinet ad crucem Christi, et ideo tantum in ea gloriatur.
              Et hoc est quod dicit
              <i>et ego mundo</i>, scilicet sum crucifixus; quasi dicat: porto
              insignia crucis, et sum reputatus ut mortuus. Et ideo sicut mundus

              Secondly, he proves the affirmative, namely, that he glories in
              the Cross of Christ, saying that he is crucified to the World. For
              a person who glories in something treasures it and desires to make
              it known; but the Apostle treasures nothing or desires to make
              nothing known except what pertains to the Cross of Christ;
              therefore, he glories in it alone. And this is what he says:
              <b>and I to the world</b>, namely, I am crucified. As if to say: I
              carry the marks of the Cross and I am considered as dead.
              Therefore, as the world abhors the Cross of Christ, so it abhors
              me: “For you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God”
              (Col 3:3).

              Rationem autem quare non in alio gloriatur, ostendit subdens

              gloriatur, quod valet et adiuvat ad coniungendum Christo, hoc enim
              apostolus desiderat, scilicet cum Christo esse. Et quia non valet
              ad hoc ritus Iudaicus, nec gentilium observantia, sed crux Christi
              solum, ideo solum in ea gloriatur. Et hoc est quod dicit
              <i>in Christo neque circumcisio aliquid valet</i>, id est ritus
              Iudaicus, <i>neque praeputium</i>, id est gentilitatis
              observantia, id est ad iustificandum et iungendum Christo, sed ad
              hoc valet <i>nova creatura</i>. Quod quidem patet ex his quae
              dicta sunt supra v. 6 (quasi eisdem verbis):
              <i
                >in Christo enim Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet, neque
                praeputium, sed fides quae per dilectionem operatur</i
              >. Fides ergo charitate formata est nova creatura. Creati namque
              et producti sumus in esse naturae per Adam; sed illa quidem
              creatura vetusta iam erat, et inveterata, et ideo dominus
              producens nos, et constituens in esse gratiae, fecit quamdam novam
              creaturam. Iac. I, 18:
              <i>ut simus initium aliquod creaturae eius</i>. Et dicitur
              <i>nova</i>, quia per eam renovamur in vitam novam; et per
              spiritum sanctum, Ps. CIII, 30:
              <i
                >emitte spiritum tuum, et creabuntur, et renovabis faciem
                terrae</i
              >. Et per crucem Christi, II Cor. V, 17:
              <i>si qua est in Christo nova creatura</i>, et cetera. Sic ergo
              per novam creaturam, scilicet per fidem Christi et charitatem Dei,
              quae diffusa est in cordibus nostris, renovamur, et Christo
              coniungimur.
            </td>
            <td>
              The reason why he glories in nothing else is given when he says,
              <b
                >For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing nor
                uncircumcision, but a new creature</b
              >. Indeed, he glories mainly in that which avails and helps in
              joining him to Christ; for it is this the Apostle desires, namely,
              to be with Christ. And because the Jewish rite and the observances
              of the Gentiles are of no avail in this regard, but only the Cross
              of Christ, therefore he glories in it alone. And this is what he
              says: <b>For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision</b>, i.e., the
              Jewish rite, <b>nor uncircumcision</b>, i.e., Gentile observances,
              <b>availeth any thing</b>, i.e., to justify us and join us to
              Christ,
              <b>but a new creature</b>
              availeth for us. This, indeed, is obvious from what was said
              above, in almost the same words:
              <b
                >For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth anything nor
                uncircumcision; but faith that worketh by charity</b
              >
              (5:6). Therefore, faith informed by charity is the new creature.
              For we have been created and made to exist in our nature through
              Adam, but that creature is already old. Therefore, the Lord in
              producing us and establishing us in the existence of grace has
              made a new creature: “That we might be some beginning of his
              creature” (Jam 1:18). And it is called “new,” because by it we are
              reborn into a new life by the Holy Spirit”—Thou shalt send forth
              thy spirit and they shall be created: and thou shalt renew the
              face I the earth” (Ps 103:30)—and by the Cross of Christ: “If then
              any be in Christ a new creature, the old things are passed away,
              behold all things are made new” (2 Cor 5:17). In this way, then,
              by a new creature, i.e., by the faith of Christ and the charity of
              God which has been poured out in our hearts, we are made new and
              are joined to Christ.

              grace for them to carry out the aforesaid (v. 18).

              First, therefore, he says: My intention is to glory only in the
              Cross of Christ. And you, too, should do this, because
              <b>whosoever shall follow this rule</b> which I follow, namely,
              this proper way of glorying—“But we will not glory beyond our
              measure and according to the measure of the rule which God hath
              measured to us” (2 Cor 10: 13) — <b>peace on them</b>, namely, on
              those who glory, because they glory in Christ alone: peace, I say,
              by which they are set at rest and made perfect in good. (For peace
              is tranquillity of mind: “Since I am become in his presence as one
              finding peace” (Cant 8: 10); and in Colossians (3:15): “And let
              the peace of Christ rejoice in your hearts, wherein also you are
              called in one body”): <b>and mercy</b>, by which we are set free
              of our sins: “The mercies of the Lord that we are not consumed”
              (Lam 3:22); “The grace of God and his mercy is with his saints,
              and he hath respect to his chosen,” namely, who are His Israel
              (Wis 4:15): “For it is not he is a Jew who is so outwardly” (Rom
              2:28). He, therefore, is <b>the Israel of God</b> who is
              spiritually an Israel before God: “Behold an Israelite indeed, in
              whom there is no guile” (Jn 1:47); “For all are not Israelites
              that are of Israel: neither are all they that are the seed of
              Abraham, children; but in Isaac shall thy seed be called; that is
              to say, not they that are the children of the flesh are the
              children of God but they that are the children of the promise, are
              ac counted for the seed” (Rom 9:6). Hence even the Gentiles have
              become the Israel of God by uprightness of mind; for Israel means
              “most upright”: “Israel will be your name” (Gen 32:28).

              <b>From henceforth</b>, i.e., from now on. In another way it might
              be taken as two words <i>[de cetero], so</i> that the sense is:
              Let no man be troublesome to me about anything else. As if to say:
              I glory in the Cross alone; with respect to anything else, let no
              man bother me, because I care about nothing else. But the first is
              better.

              for me, when they were troublesome, I was clothed with haircloth”

              The reason for this admonition he assigns when he says,
              <b>for I bear the marks [stigmata] of the Lord Jesus in my body</b
              >. For stigmata are, strictly speaking, certain marks branded on
              one with a hot iron; as when a slave is marked on the face by his
              master, so that no one else will claim him, but quietly let him
              remain with the master whose marks he bears. And this is the way
              the Apostle says he bears the marks of the Lord, branded, as it
              were, as a slave of Christ; and this, because he bore the marks of
              Christ’s passion, suffering many tribulations in his body for Him,
              according to the saying of 1 Peter (2:21): “Christ suffered for
              us, leaving you an example, that you should follow his steps”;
              “Always bearing about in our body the mortification of Jesus, that
              the life also of Jesus may be made manifest in our mortal flesh”
              (2 Cor 4: 10).

              ego habeo multos alios conflictus et stigmata, quae in
              persecutionibus quas patior me molestant, et grave est addere
              afflictionem afflicto. Unde conqueritur Iob XVI, 15:

              According to this there are two ways of connecting this with the
              preceding. In one way, as has been said:
              <b>let no man be troublesome to me</b>, for I bear the marks of
              Our Lord Jesus Christ in my body; consequently, no one has any
              right over me except Christ. In another way:
              <b>let no man be troublesome</b>
              to me, because I have many other conflicts and marks that trouble
              me in the persecutions I suffer; and it is cruel to add affliction
              to one already afflicted. Hence the complaint of Job (16:15): “He
              hath torn me with wound upon wound.” Nevertheless, the first is
              better.
