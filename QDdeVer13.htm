              Quia, ut Augustinus dicit, intelligentia hominis naturaliter

              1. Augustine says: “Man’s understanding knows God naturally.” But,
              in rapture, man’s understanding is raised to a knowledge of God.
              Therefore, it is not raised to that which is contrary to nature,
              but to that which is according to nature.

              2. A created spirit depends more on the uncreated spirit than a
              lower body depends on a higher body. But impressions from higher
              bodies are natural to lower bodies, as the Commentator says.
              Therefore, elevation of the human spirit, even though it takes
              place in virtue of a higher nature, is only natural.

              Praeterea, Roman. XI, 24, super illud: contra naturam insertus es
              in bonam olivam etc., dicit Glossa, quod Deus auctor naturae nihil
              contra naturam facit; quia hoc est unicuique natura quod ab eo
              accepit a quo est omnis modus et ordo naturae. Sed elevatio raptus
              fit a Deo, qui est conditor humanae naturae. Ergo non est contra

              3. The Gloss on Romans(11:24), “Contrary to nature [thou] wert
              grafted into the good olive tree,” reads that God, the author of
              nature, “does nothing contrary to nature,” since that which each
              one receives from the source of all rule and order of nature is
              the nature for it. But the elevation of rapture is from God, who
              is the creator of human nature. Therefore, it is not against
              nature but according to it.

              Sed dicebat, quod dicitur esse contra naturam, quia fit divinitus,

              de divinis Nomin., quod iustitia Dei in hoc attenditur, quod
              omnibus rebus distribuit secundum suum modum et dignitatem. Sed
              Deus non potest aliquid facere contra suam iustitiam. Ergo nulli

              4. It was said that it is against nature because it is done in a
              divine manner and not in the manner of human spirit.—On the
              contrary, Dionysius says: “We see the justice of God in this that
              He distributes [His goods] to all things according to the measure
              of their worth.” But God cannot do anything contrary to His
              justice. Therefore, He does not give a thing something which is
              not according to its manner of being.

              Praeterea, si modus hominis quantum ad aliquid mutetur, non
              mutatur hoc modo quod hominis bonum auferatur; quia Deus non est
              causa quare homo sit deterior, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. LXXXIII
              quaest. Sed bonum hominis est secundum rationem vivere et
              voluntarie operari, ut patet per Dionysium, IV cap. de divinis
              nominibus. Cum ergo violentia sit contraria voluntario, et bonum
              rationis evacuet: ex hoc enim necessitas est contristans quod est
              contraria voluntati, ut dicitur V Metaph.; videtur quod divinitus
              non fiat in homine aliqua violenta elevatio contra naturam; quod
              esse videtur in raptu, ut ipsum nomen importat, et descriptio

              5. If man’s manner is changed in some respect, it is not changed
              in such a way that man’s proper good would be taken away. For, as
              Augustine says, God is not the cause of man’s deterioration. But
              man’s proper good is to live according to reason and to act in a
              voluntary way, as is clear in Dionysius. Therefore, since violence
              is contrary to what is voluntary and does away with the good of
              reason (for necessity causes sorrow since it is contrary to the
              will, as is said in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>), it seems that God brings about no violent
              elevation in man contrary to nature. Now, this is what seems to
              take place in rapture, as the very name implies, and as the
              previously mentioned description points out in the words, “by the
              power of a higher nature.”

              Praeterea, secundum philosophum in III de anima, excellentiae
              sensibilium corrumpunt sensum, non autem excellentiae
              intelligibilium intellectum. Sed ideo sensus deficit a cognitione
              excellentium sensibilium, quia ab eis corrumpitur. Ergo
              intellectus naturaliter potest quantumcumque excellentia
              intelligibilia cognoscere. Ad quaecumque igitur intelligibilia
              mens hominis elevetur, non erit elevatio contra naturam.

              6. According to the Philosopher,” excessive intensity of sensible
              objects destroys the senses, but excessive intensity of
              intelligible objects does not destroy the understanding. Now, the
              senses fail of knowledge of intense sensible objects because they
              are destroyed by them. Therefore, the understanding can know
              intelligible objects naturally no matter how intense they are.
              Hence, no matter to what intelligible objects the mind of man is
              raised up, the elevation will not be contrary to nature.

              7. Augustine says that angels and souls have similar natures but
              dissimilar duties.” Now, it is not contrary to the nature of an
              angel to know the things to which man is raised in rapture.
              Therefore, for man, the elevation of rapture is not contrary to
              nature.

              8. If any movement is natural, arrival at the term of the movement
              will also be natural, since no movement is infinite. But the mind
              of man is naturally moved toward God. This is clear from the fact
              that it rests only when it has reached God. Hence, Augustine says:
              “You made us for Thee, Lord; and our heart is not at rest until it
              rests in Thee.” Therefore, the elevation by which the mind reaches
              God, as happens in rapture, is not contrary to nature.

              9. It was said that it is not natural for the human mind to be
              drawn to God by reason of the mind itself, but by reason of an
              ordination of God. Thus, it is not natural simply.—On the
              contrary, a lower nature does not engage in activity or tend
              toward any end except by reason of a divine ordination. It is for
              this reason that every natural work is called a work of
              intelligence. Nevertheless, we say that the movements and
              activities of natural things are simply natural. Therefore, to be
              drawn toward God should also be judged simply natural if it is
              natural to the mind by reason of a divine ordination.

              10. The soul, in so far as it exists in itself and is thus called
              a spirit, is prior to the soul as joined to the body and,
              accordingly, called a soul. But the activity of the soul as a
              spirit is to know God and the other separated substances. But, in
              so far as it is joined to the body, its activity is to know
              corporeal and sensible things. Therefore, the capacity of the soul
              to know intelligible things is prior to that to know sensible
              things. Since, therefore, it is natural for the soul to know
              sensible things, it is also natural for it to know divine
              intelligible things. Thus, we conclude as before.

              exists because of the ordination to the final end. But sensible
              things are the means by which we reach the knowledge of God, as we
              see in Romans (1:20): “For the invisible things of him... are
              clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.” But
              the knowledge of sensible things is natural to man. Therefore,
              knowledge of intelligible things is also natural. We conclude as

              12. Nothing that takes place by a natural power can be said to be
              unconditionally contrary to nature. But certain things, as herbs
              or stones, have natural powers to release the mind from the
              senses, so that wonderful visions are beheld. This is what seems
              to happen in rapture. Therefore, rapture is not an elevation
              contrary to nature.

              Now, in physical reality the natural activity of a thing may be
              modified in two ways. In one, the change arises from a deficiency
              of its proper power, whatever be the source of such a deficiency,
              whether an extrinsic or an intrinsic cause. Thus, an abnormal
              fetus is produced because of a lack of formative power in the
              seed. In the other way, the change arises from the activity of the
              divine power, whose will all nature obeys. This happens in
              miracles, as when a virgin conceives or a blind man is made to

              Man’s proper activity, however, is to understand through the
              mediation of sense and imagination. For the activity by which he
              fixes on intellectual things alone, passing over all lower things,
              does not belong to man as man, but in so far as something divine
              exists in him, as is said in the

              him as man, but according to the nature which he has in common
              with the brute animals. Therefore, when man is transported out of
              his senses and sees things beyond sense, his natural mode of
              knowing is modified.

              1. One can know God in many ways: through His essence, through
              sensible things, or through intelligible effects. We have to make
              a similar distinction about that which is natural to man. For
              something is contrary to nature and according to nature for one
              and the same thing according to its different states, because the
              nature of the thing is not the same when it is in the state of
              becoming and when it has complete existence, as Rabbi Moses says.
              Thus, full stature and other things of the kind are natural to man
              when he has reached maturity, but it would be contrary to nature
              for a boy to have full stature at birth.

              cognoscat Deum per creaturas sensibiles. Est autem ei naturale

              knowledge of God through Himself when it reaches its full
              perfection, that is, in heaven. Thus, if in this life it is raised
              to the knowledge of God which it will have in heaven, this will be
              contrary to nature, just as it would be contrary to nature for a

              2. Nature can be taken in two ways: in particular, as proper to

              natural causes. For this reason a thing is said to be according to
              nature or contrary to nature in two ways: in one, with reference
              to nature in particular; in the other, with reference to nature in
              general. Thus, every deficiency, decay, and the weakness of old
              age is contrary to nature in particular, but, according to nature
              in general, it is natural for everything which is composed of
              contraries to decay.

              Therefore, since the universal order of causes is so ordained that

              movement which takes place in lower nature because of the
              impressions of what is higher, whether this be in physical or in
              spiritual things, is natural according to universal nature, but
              not according to particular nature unless the impression made on
              the lower nature by the higher nature is such that the very
              impression is its nature. Thus, it is clear how the effects which
              God brings about in creatures can be called according to nature or

              do something beyond justice. For a thing is contrary to justice
              when something one deserves is taken away from him. This is clear
              in human dealings when someone robs another. But, if out of

              although in time one and the same thing is first in potentiality
              before it is in actuality. In like manner, the activity of the
              soul, in so far as it is a spirit, is prior, relative to the
              intention of nature, but subsequent in time. Hence, if one
              activity takes place at the time for another activity, this is
              contrary to nature.

              Eph. IV, 18, super illud: tenebris obscuratum habentes
              intellectum, dicit Glossa: omnis qui intelligit, quadam luce
              interiori illustratur. Si ergo intellectus elevetur ad videndum
              Deum, oportet quod illustretur aliqua luce ad huiusmodi visionem
              proportionata. Sed lux talis non est aliud quam lux gloriae, de
              qua in Psal.: in lumine tuo videbimus lumen. Ergo Deus per
              essentiam videri non potest nisi ab intellectu beato. Et sic
              Paulus in raptu cum glorificatus non esset, Deum per essentiam

              1. The Gloss on Ephesians (4:18), “Having their understanding
              darkened... “ says: “Everyone who understands is enlightened with
              an inner light.” Therefore, if the understanding is raised up to
              see God, it must be enlightened by some light proportionate to
              this kind of sight. But the only such light is the light of glory,
              of which Psalms (35:10) says: “In your light we shall see light.”
              Therefore, God can be seen through His essence only by an
              intellect enjoying beatitude. And, since Paul was not glorified
              when he was enraptured, he could not see God through His essence.

              state he was made blessed, not without qualification, but only in
              a qualified way.—On the contrary, all that is needed for one to be
              blessed in all respects is the act of glory and the gift of glory,
              which is the principle of that act. Thus, Peter’s body would have
              been glorified if, along with being held up on the water, he had
              also had within him agility, which is the principle of this act.
              But splendor, the principle of the vision of God, which is the act
              of glory, is the gift of glory. Therefore, if Paul’s mind saw God
              through His essence and was enlightened by the light which is the
              source of this vision, he was glorified without qualification.

              rapture Paul was capable of meriting, since his soul had not yet
              been separated from the corruptible body, as Augustine says.
              Therefore, he did not have the charity proper to heaven. But where
              there is the vision proper to heaven, which is perfect, there also
              is the charity proper to heaven, which is perfect, for one loves
              God to the extent that he knows about God. Therefore, Paul did not
              see God through His essence.

              separated from it, nor, on the other hand, did God cut him off

              does not on His part withdraw His gifts. Therefore, Paul would

              est quaedam similitudo intelligibilis essentiae increatae, prout
              dicitur in libro de causis, quod intelligentia scit quod est supra
              se inquantum est causata ab eo. Ut sic etiam intelligatur Paulus
              in raptu vidisse Deum per refulgentiam alicuius luminis
              intellectualis in mentem ipsius. Cognitio vero viae, quae est per
              speculum et aenigma sensibilium creaturarum, est naturalis homini;
              sed cognitio patriae, qua Deus per essentiam suam videtur, est
              soli Deo naturalis. Sed haec opinio repugnat dictis Augustini, qui
              expresse in locis supradictis dicit Paulum in raptu Deum per
              essentiam vidisse.

              Concerning this, some have said that Paul, when he was enraptured,
              did not see God through His essence, but with a vision midway
              between the vision had in this life and the vision had in heaven.
              We can take this intermediate vision to mean the kind of vision
              which is natural to an angel, such that he would see God, not,
              indeed, through His essence with natural knowledge, but through
              intelligible species, in so far as he considers his own essence,
              which is an intelligible likeness of the uncreated essence,
              according to the saying of
              <i>The Causes</i>
              that an intelligence knows what is above it in so far as it is
              caused by it. According to this, Paul, when enraptured, is
              conceived of as having seen God through the refulgence of some
              intelligible light in his mind. However, the knowledge of this
              life, which is through the mirror and obscurity of sensible
              creatures, is natural to man. And the knowledge of heaven, by
              which we see God through His essence, is natural only to God. But
              this opinion is contrary to what Augustine says, for he states
              expressly that, when Paul was enraptured, he saw God through His
              essence.

              Nor is it likely that a minister of God to the Jews of the Old
              Testament would see God through His essence, as appears from
              Numbers (12:8): “Plainly and not by riddles and figures does he
              see the Lord,” and that this would not be granted to the minister
              of the New Testament, the Teacher of the Gentiles. This is
              especially true since the Apostle himself argues in this way: “For
              if the ministration of condemnation be glory, much more the
              ministration of justice abounds in glory” (2 Cor 3:9).

              supernatural light to enable it to see God. This will become clear
              from the example of physical light. For, in some things, we find
              the light from the sun as an abiding form, as though it had become

              become a form abiding in the air, as though connatural to it, but

              In like fashion, also, the light of glory is infused into the mind

              qualification, and is the manner in which it is infused in the
              blessed in heaven. In the other way, the mind receives the light
              of glory as a passing impression. It was in this way that Paul’s
              mind was enlightened with the light of glory when he was
              enraptured. The very name shows that this took place quickly

              did not actually merit, for, just as he had the act of vision
              possessed by those in heaven, so he had the act of charity

              although he had the vision of those in heaven, he did not have the
              act of charity of those in heaven. For, although his understanding
              was rapt, his affections were not. But this is clearly contrary to
              what the Gloss on “He was caught up into paradise” (2 Cor 12:4),
              says: “That is, into that tranquility which those who are in the
              heavenly Jerusalem enjoy.” But enjoyment takes place through love.

              9. In the Scriptures, transport of mind, ecstasy, and rapture are
              all used in the same sense and indicate some raising up of the
              mind from sensible things outside of us toward which we naturally
              turn our attention, to things which are above man. This takes
              place in two ways. For, at times, this transport from things
              outside is taken to refer to attention only, as when someone makes
              use of the external senses and things about him, but his whole
              attention is engaged in contemplating and loving things divine.
              Such is the state of anyone who contemplates and loves things
              divine in transport of the mind, whether ecstasy or rapture. For
              this reason Dionysius says: “Divine love brings about ecstasy.”
              And Gregory, speaking of contemplation, says: “One who is rapt in
              order that he may understand the things within closes his eyes to
              visible things.”

              Evangelist in the Apocalypse, as Augustine says. There is another
              in which the mind is at once transported out of the senses and out
              of the imagination to an intellectual vision. This happens in two

              In one, the intellect understands God through certain intelligible
              communications, and this is proper to angels. Adam’s ecstasy was
              of this sort, as the Gloss on Genesis(2:21)says: “The correct
              interpretation of this ecstasy is that it was given so that Adam’s
              mind might become a member of the heavenly court and, entering
              into the sanctuary of God, might understand the last things.” In
              the other way, the understanding sees God through His essence. It
              was for this that Paul was enraptured, as we have said.

              2. But it was said that, since the body of one in this life is
              corruptible, it weighs down the understanding so that it cannot be
              drawn freely to God unless it is carried out of the senses of the
              body. And this corruption will be gone after the resurrection.—On
              the contrary, nothing is hindered, just as nothing suffers, except
              through the activity of its contrary. But bodily corruption does
              not seem to be opposed to the act of understanding, since
              understanding is not an act of the body. Therefore, corruption of
              the body does not prevent the understanding from being drawn
              freely to God.

              enjoyed the sight of God continuously, although He was not always
              transported out of his external senses. Therefore, corruption does

              things which he had seen in that vision. Otherwise, if he had not
              remembered them, he would not have said: “He heard secret words,
              which it is not granted to man to utter” (2 Cor. 12:4). Therefore,
              while he saw God through His essence, something was being
              imprinted on his memory. But memory belongs to the sensitive part
              of man, as the Philosopher plainly shows. Therefore, when in this
              life someone sees God through His essence, he is not entirely
              transported out of his bodily senses.

              cognition is natural to him, it seems that he does not require
              transport from the senses as a prerequisite to see God through His

              Gentiles, that life which is to be lived forever after this life?
              [God did this] while Paul was raised in rapture to that most lofty

              which will be given to those who see God in the next life, there
              will be no transport out of the bodily senses. Therefore, it seems

              perceived something of the divine glory. Hence, Vincent says:
              “Behold, I am already raised on high, and from above the world I
              look down on all your distinguished men, O tyrant.”And in other
              records of the sufferings of the saints we read many passages
              which seem to have the same tenor. But it is obvious that there
              was no withdrawal from the senses in these people. Otherwise, they
              would not have felt the pain. Therefore, there is no transport out
              of the senses in order for one to share in the glory by which God

              understanding to the activity which has sensible things as its
              object. But, as Avicenna says,, it is not necessary for the
              practical understanding always to pay attention to man's
              operations which are concerned with sensible objects. Otherwise,
              the best harpist Would seem to be the worst if it Were necessary
              for him to give artistic reflection to each stroke of the strings.
              For, in such a case, there would be too much interruption of the

              less necessary for the speculative understanding to pay attention
              to man’s operations which concern sensible things. Thus, it
              remains free to be drawn to any act of understanding, even to the

              4. The activity of an understanding which is raised to see the
              essence of God is more effective than any activity of the
              imagination. But, sometimes, a man is transported out of the
              bodily senses because of the intensity of the activity of the
              imagination. Therefore, he should be transported out of them with
              much greater reason when he is lifted up to the vision of God.

              divine vision does not tolerate sight of anything else along with
              it. Therefore, neither does it tolerate the use of the senses
              along with it.

              6. The greatest cleanness of heart is needed to see God through
              His essence, according to Matthew (5:8): “Blessed are the clean of
              heart.” But the heart is sullied in two ways, namely, by the
              contamination of sin, and by phantasies of material things. This
              is clear from what Dionysius says: “Those [celestial essences]
              should be considered pure, not in the sense that they are free of
              unclean stains and defilements (in which he refers to uncleanness
              because of guilt, which never existed in the blessed angels), nor
              in the sense that they are receptive of phantasies of material
              things” (in which is included the uncleanness which comes through
              phantasies, as is clear from Hugh of St. Victor.) Therefore, the
              mind of one who sees God through His essence must be transported
              not only out of the external senses, but also out of the internal
              phantasms.

              away.” But, here, “perfect” refers to the vision of God through

              Dicendum, quod, sicut ex auctoritate Augustini patet, homo in hoc

              nisi a sensibus corporeis alienetur. Cuius ratio ex duobus potest
              sumi. Primo quidem ex hoc quod est commune intellectui et aliis
              potentiis animae. Hoc enim in omnibus animae potentiis invenimus,
              quod quando una potentia in suo actu intenditur, alia vel
              debilitatur in suo actu, vel ex toto abstrahitur; sicut patet in
              illo in quo operatio visus fortissime intenditur, quod auditus
              eius non percipit ea quae dicuntur, nisi forte sua vehementia ad
              se trahant sensum audientis.

              As is clear from the authoritative statement of Augustine, a man
              living in this mortal body cannot see God through His essence,
              unless he is made unconscious of the bodily senses. We can see the
              reason for this from two things. First, from that which is common
              to the understanding and the other powers of the soul, for with
              all the powers of the soul we find that, when the act of one power
              becomes intense, the act of another is either weakened or entirely
              suppressed. Thus, it is clear that, when one is giving very close
              attention to the activity of sight, his hearing does not perceive
              the things which are being said, unless, perhaps, their force
              attracts the sense of the hearer to them.

              Cuius ratio est, quia ad actum alicuius cognoscitivae potentiae
              requiritur intentio, ut probat Augustinus in Lib. de Trinit.
              Intentio autem unius non potest ferri ad multa simul, nisi forte
              illa multa hoc modo sint ad invicem ordinata, ut accipiantur quasi
              unum; sicut nec alicuius motus vel operationis possunt esse duo
              termini non ad invicem ordinati. Unde, cum sit una anima, in qua
              omnes potentiae cognoscitivae fundantur unius et eiusdem intentio
              requiritur ad omnium potentiarum cognoscitivarum actus: et ideo,
              cum totaliter anima intendit ad actum unius, abstrahitur homo ab
              actu alterius potentiae.
            </td>
            <td>
              The reason for this, as Augustine proves, is that attention is
              needed for the act of any cognoscitive power. Moreover, one’s
              attention cannot be given to many things at once, unless they are
              related to one another in such a way that they can be taken as
              one, just as the motion or activity of a thing cannot have two
              termini not related to each other. Hence, since there is one soul,
              in which all cognoscitive powers are rooted, the attention of one
              and the same soul is needed for the acts of all the cognoscitive
              powers. Therefore, when the soul gives complete attention to the
              act of one power, the man is cut off from the act of another
              power.

              vision, since this is the most intensely intelligible object, and
              the understanding can reach it only by striving for it with a
              total effort. Therefore, it is necessary to have complete
              abstraction from the bodily senses when the mind is raised to the

              Secundo vero potest eiusdem ratio assignari ex eo quod est

              Second, we can find a reason for this in that which is proper to
              the understanding. For, since we know things in so far as they are
              in act, and not in so far as they are in potency, as is said in
              the
              <i>Metaphysics,</i>
              the understanding, which holds the highest place in knowledge,
              properly deals with immaterial things, which are most in act.
              Hence, every intelligible thing is either free from matter or
              separated from it by the activity of the understanding. Therefore,
              the freer the understanding is of contact, as it were, with
              material things, the more perfect it is.

              intelligible species, has less efficacy than the angelic
              understanding, which always considers purely immaterial forms.
              Nevertheless, in so far as the purity of intellectual knowledge is
              not wholly obscured in human understanding, as happens in the
              senses whose knowledge cannot go beyond material things, it has
              the power to consider things which are purely immaterial by the
              very fact that it retains some purity.

              over all the parts of His soul and over His body. Hence, as
              Damascene says, by the power of the Godhead He permitted each
              power of the soul to do that which is proper to it in so far as it
              fitted in with our redemption. Thus, it was not necessary for Him
              to have an overflow from one power to another, nor for one power
              to be deprived of its act because of the intensity of the act of
              another power. Consequently, the fact that His understanding saw
              God did not necessitate any transport out of the bodily senses.
              However, it is different with other men, in whom redundance or
              interference of one power with another necessarily follows from
              the intimate connection of the powers of the soul with one

              essentiam, memor fuit illorum quae in illa visione cognoverat, per
              aliquas species in intellectu eius remanentes, quae erant quasi
              quaedam reliquiae praeteritae visionis. Quamvis enim ipsum Dei
              verbum per essentiam viderit, et ex ipso viso multa cognoverit, et
              sic illa visio nec quantum ad ipsum verbum, nec quantum ad ea quae
              videbantur in verbo, fuerit per species aliquas; sed per essentiam
              solam verbi; tamen ex ipsa inspectione verbi imprimebantur in
              intellectum eius quaedam rerum visarum similitudines, quibus
              postmodum cognoscere poterat ea quae prius per essentiam verbi
              viderat. Et ex illis speciebus intelligibilibus per quamdam
              applicationem ad particulares intentiones vel formas in memoria
              vel in imaginatione conservatas, postmodum poterat memorari eorum
              quae prius viderat, etiam secundum actum memoriae quae est
              potentia sensitiva. Et sic non oportet ponere, quod in ipso actu
              divinae visionis aliquid fieret in eius memoria quae est pars

              4. After Paul had stopped seeing God through His essence, he
              remembered what he had known in that vision by means of certain
              species which remained in his understanding and were relics, so to
              speak, of the previous vision. For, although he saw the very Word
              of God through His essence, and from the vision of that essence
              knew many truths, (and thus neither for the Word Himself nor for
              the things which he saw in the Word did this vision take place
              through any species, but only through the essence of the Word),
              nevertheless, by reason of the vision of the Word, certain
              likenesses of the things which he saw were imprinted on his
              understanding. And with these likenesses he could see afterwards
              the things which he had previously seen through the essence of the
              Word. Later, by applying these intelligible species to the
              individual intentions or forms which were stored in his memory or
              imagination, he could remember the things which he had seen
              previously, and this even through the activity of memory, which is
              a sensitive power. Thus, it is not necessary to hold that in the
              act of seeing God something took place in his memory, which is
              part of the sensitive power, but only in his mind.

              does not combine with the senses in the process of perception, it
              does combine with them in the process of judging. Hence, Augustine
              says: “Through the light of our intelligence we judge even of the
              lower things and we perceive things which are neither bodies nor
              bear forms like those of bodies.”“ Therefore, our intelligence is
              said at times to abstract from the senses when it does not make
              judgments concerning them, but focuses its attention on the vision
              of heavenly things alone.

              the whole reward.” For this reason one could be a suitable witness
              of that beatitude because he had seen the divine essence. Still,
              it would not be necessary for him to experience all the privileges
              which belong to the blessed. But, from that which he did
              experience, he could also know the other things. For he was not

              God through His essence, but, rather, they were refreshed by a
              sprinkling of that glory. Hence, Augustine says: “There,” where
              God is seen through His essence, “the blessed life is drunk from
              its source. From that source some of it is sprinkled on this human

              1. The powers of the vegetative soul are more material than the
              powers of the sensitive soul. But for our understanding to see God
              through His essence it must abstract from the senses, as has been
              said., Therefore, abstraction from the acts of the vegetative soul
              is much more urgently required for the purity of that vision. But
              this abstraction cannot take place where there is brute life as
              long as the soul is united to the body as its form. For, as the
              Philosopher says: “In animals the process of nutrition is always
              going on.” Therefore, for the vision of the divine essence there
              must be an abstraction from the union by which the soul is united
              to the body as its form.

              2. The gloss of Augustine on Exodus (33:20), “For man shall not
              see me and live,” says: “This shows that God cannot appear as He
              is to this life of corruptible flesh. But He can in the other
              life, which one can live. only by dying to this life.” The gloss
              of Gregory reads: “He who sees the wisdom which is God dies
              entirely to this life.” But death is the result of the separation
              of the soul from the body to which it was united as its form.
              Therefore, there has to be a complete separation of the soul from
              the body in order to see God through His essence.

              sense, as has been said. Therefore, for the soul to see God
              through His essence, it must with much greater reason be separated
              from the body.

              “While we are in the body, we are absent from the Lord. (For we
              walk by faith, and not by sight.) “ Therefore, as long as the soul
              is in the body, it cannot see God as He is in Himself.

              1. The gloss of Gregory on the passage from Exodus (33:20), “For
              man shall not see me and live,” says: “The splendor of the eternal
              God can be seen by some who live in this flesh, but who are
              growing in priceless virtue.”“ But the splendor of God is His
              essence, as the same gloss says. Therefore, it is not necessary to
              have complete separation of soul from body to see the essence of
              God.

              2. Augustine says: “The soul is enraptured not only to the vision
              of imagination, but also to the vision of understanding, through
              which the truth itself is clearly seen. Meanwhile, it has been
              carried out of its senses less than in death, but more than in
              sleep.” Therefore, to see the uncreated truth of which Augustine
              is speaking there is no need to dissolve the union whereby the
              soul is united to the body as its form.

              In the same way, the purity of the understanding is not directly
              contaminated by such a union. For the soul is not joined to the
              body as its form through the mediation of its powers, but through
              its essence, since nothing stands as a medium between matter and
              form, as is proved in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>. Furthermore, the essence of the soul is not
              united to body in such a way that it follows the condition of the
              body completely, as other material forms, which are, as it were,
              completely engulfed in matter to such an extent that only material
              power or activity can proceed from them. Now, from the essence of
              the soul there proceed not only the forces and powers which are in
              some sense bodily, as the existent acts of the bodily organs, that
              is, the sensitive and vegetative powers, but also the powers of
              understanding, which are completely immaterial and not the
              existent acts of any body or part of a body, as is proved in
              <i>The Soul.</i>

              From this it is clear that the powers of our understanding do not

              the body, but, rather, in so far as it stays free of the body and
              is not entirely bound down to it. In this sense the union of the
              soul with the body does not extend to the activity of the
              understanding and so cannot interfere with its purity. Hence, if
              we consider what is intrinsic to the acts, the dissolution of the
              union by which the soul is united to the body as its form is not a
              necessary condition for the activity of the understanding, no

              In like manner, there is no need for the suppression of the
              activities of the vegetative soul. For the activities of this part
              of the soul are really natural, as is clear from the fact that
              they are brought to full perfection by the power of the active and
              passive qualities, namely, the warm and the cold, the moist and

              of the soul to the body as its form. In the other sense, “to live”
              is taken to mean the activity of life. Thus the Philosopher
              distinguishes living into understanding, sensing, and the other
              activities of the soul.

              Et similiter, cum mors sit vitae privatio, oportet quod similiter

              privationem operum vitae. Unde Augustinus super Genesim ad
              litteram: ab hac vita quisque quodammodo moritur, sive omnino
              exiens de corpore, sive aversus et alienatus a carnalibus
              sensibus; et sic accipitur mori in Glossis inductis: quod patet ex
              hoc quod subiungitur in Glossa Gregorii: qui sapientiam, inquit,
              quae Deus est, videt, huic vitae funditus moritur, ne eius amore

              Similarly, since death is the loss of life, we must distinguish it
              in like manner. Thus, sometimes it means the loss of that union by
              which the soul is joined to the body as its form, and sometimes it
              means the loss of the vital activities. For this reason Augustine
              says: “One dies to this life to some extent whether he leaves the
              body entirely, or whether he is transported out of the senses of
              the body and made unconscious of them.” Death is thus understood
              in the glosses which have been cited,” as is plain from the words
              following the quotation from the gloss of Gregory: “He who sees
              the wisdom which is God dies entirely to this life, so that he may
              not be held back by love of it.”

              4. Since the union by which the soul is united to the body as its

              5. The reasoning would conclude correctly if the essence of the

              to the body. But we have already said that this is false.

              activity of the imagination and the senses is more immaterial than
              the body itself, it has a closer relation to the activity of the
              understanding. Thus, it is more able to hinder it, as we have
              said.

              1. He knew this better than any of those who followed, But many
              commonly agree that during the rapture Paul’s soul was united to
              his body as its form. Therefore, with much greater reason Paul
              knew this.

              usque ad tertium caelum. Scivit igitur quid esset illud caelum,

              2. In the rapture Paul knew what he saw and with what vision he
              saw it. This is clear from the second Epistle to the Corinthians
              (12:2), because he says: “I know a man... caught up to the third
              heaven.” Therefore, he knew what that heaven was, whether it was
              something corporeal or spiritual, and he knew whether he saw it
              spiritually or corporeally. But it follows from this that he knew
              whether he saw it while in the body or out of it. For bodily
              vision cannot take place except through the body, and the vision
              of understanding is always without the body. Therefore, he knew
              whether he was in the body or out of it.

              of the union of the body and the soul. Therefore, he knew that the
              soul was united to the body.

              4. He himself knew that he was enraptured, as is clear from what

              joined to his body.

              the body or not has very special pertinence to the soul.

              There are many opinions on this point. For some have understood
              the Apostle to say that what he did not know was not whether he
              was in the body or not, but whether the rapture was one of the
              soul and the body together, so that he was carried bodily to
              heaven, as we read in Daniel (14:35) that Habakkuk was
              transported, or whether it was a rapture of the soul alone, that
              is, in the visions of God, as is said in Ezechiel (40:2): “In the
              visions of God he brought me into the land of Israel.” And Jerome
              adopts this interpretation of a certain Jew when he says:
              “Finally, our Apostle, too, did not dare to assert that he was
              caught up in body, but said: “Whether in body or out of the body,
              I know not....”

              was caught up to the third heaven. Therefore, it is clear that
              that heaven to which he was transported was truly heaven, and not

              For, if he had wanted to mean that, when he said he was caught up

              in his imagination, he could have asserted in the same way that he
              was transported in the body, that is, to a likeness of this body.
              Thus, it would not have been necessary to distinguish between what
              he knew and what he did not know, since he would know both
              equally, that is, that he was in heaven and that he was
              transported in the body, that is, to a likeness of the body, as

              Therefore, it remains that the Apostle did not doubt whether he
              was enraptured bodily or only spiritually, but knew that he was
              transported to that heaven only in his understanding. However, he
              did have doubts whether in that rapture his soul was in his body,
              or not.

              Some others concede this, but say that, although during the
              rapture the Apostle did not know this, he did, nevertheless, know
              it afterwards, surmising it from the vision which he had had. For
              in the rapture his whole mind was given over to things divine, and
              he did not perceive whether his soul was in his body or not. But
              this opinion, too, is openly opposed to what the Apostle says.
              For, as he distinguishes what he knew and did not know, so he
              distinguishes the present from the past. And he speaks of the man
              enraptured, as in the past, fourteen years before, but he admits,
              as in the present, that he knows something and does not know
              something. Therefore, fourteen years after that rapture he still
              did not know whether he was in the body or not when the rapture
              took place.

              Hence, others have said that he did not know either during the
              rapture or after it whether his soul was in the body to some
              extent and not completely. For they say that he knew both then and
              afterwards that his soul was united to the body as its form, but
              did not know whether it was so united to it that it could receive
              something from the senses. Or, according to others, he did not
              know whether the nutritive powers exercised their activities by
              means of which the soul takes care of the body.

              to the point to say that he did not know whether the soul was in
              the body in this way or that way, when these did not cut the soul

              Therefore, we have to say that he simply did not know whether his
              soul was united to the body or not. This is the conclusion which
              Augustine reaches after a long investigation, when he says:
              “Perhaps, then, we should conclude that he was ignorant of this
              matter: while he was transported to the third heaven, was he in
              the body—that is, as the soul of one awake, or asleep, or in
              ecstasy and completely unconscious of the bodily senses, is in the
              body when the body is said to be alive—or did he leave the body
              completely so that the body lay dead until, the vision finished,
              the soul returned to the dead members, and he was not as one
              awaking from sleep or returning to his senses from the transport
              of ecstasy, but as one completely dead returning to life?

              1. As Augustine says: “The Apostle doubts whether he was in the
              body or out of it. Hence, if he is in doubt, which of us dares to
              be certain?” Thus, Augustine leaves the question undecided. When
              later writers take a stand on this question, they are speaking
              with probability rather than with certitude. For, since it could
              happen that one would be enraptured in the way the Apostle says he
              was enraptured while his soul remained united to the body, as is
              clear from what has been said, it is more probable that it did
              remain united to the body.

              2. The reason given here holds against the interpretation of the
              words of the Apostle first given, in which he is considered to
              have doubted not about the state of the one enraptured, that is,
              whether the soul was united to the body, but of the manner of the
              rapture, namely, whether the rapture was bodily or only spiritual.

              3. Through synecdoche, sometimes only a part of man is called man,
              especially the soul, which is the more noble part of man. Yet this
              can also be taken to mean that the one who he says was enraptured
              was not a man during the rapture, but was a man fourteen years
              later, that is, when the Apostle said this.

              natural mode of acting, but to the divine power which transported
              the soul out of the body, not to have it remain separated
              permanently, but for a time, and to this extent one can be said to
              be enraptured, although not every dead person can be said to be

              fell short of the full and perfect knowledge of things which the
              angels have, in so far as he did not know whether he was in the
              body or outside of it. And, so, this will not be lacking when this
              corruption puts on incorruption in the resurrection of the dead.”
              Thus, it is clear that his vision was to some extent more
              imperfect than the sight of the blessed, although in some respects
              it was like theirs.

              6. Paul was not transported to see God in order to have beatitude
              without qualification, but to be a witness of the beatitude of the
              saints and of the divine mysteries which were revealed to him.
              Consequently, he saw in the vision of the Word only those things
              the knowledge of which the rapture was ordained to communicate.
              Thus, he did not see everything as the blessed do, especially
              after the resurrection. For, then, as Augustine adds to the words
              already cited: “All things will be plain, and there will be no
              falsity nor ignorance.”
