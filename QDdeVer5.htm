              Quia, sicut dicit Boetius in IV de consolatione Philos., illud
              certe manifestum est, immobilem simplicemque formam gerendarum
              rerum esse providentiam. Sed forma rerum agendarum in Deo est
              idea, quae ad scientiam pertinet. Ergo et providentia ad

              1. Boethius says, “It is certainly clear that Providence is the
              immovable and simple form of things to be done.” Now, in God the
              form of things that should be done is an idea, and an idea
              pertains to His knowledge. Providence, therefore, pertains to His
              knowledge.

              2. But it was said that providence also pertains to God’s will in
              so far as it is the cause of things.—To the contrary, in us
              practical knowledge causes the things that we know. Practical
              knowledge, however, consists merely in knowledge. The same is
              true, therefore, of providence.

              Praeterea, Boetius dicit in Lib. praedicto: modus rerum

              conspicitur, providentia nominatur. Sed puritas intelligentiae ad
              cognitionem speculativam pertinere videtur. Ergo providentia ad

              3. In the same section as cited above, Boethius writes: “The plan
              of carrying things out, when considered in the purity of God’s
              understanding, is called Providence.” Now, purity of understanding
              seems to pertain to speculative knowledge. Providence, therefore,
              pertains to speculative knowledge.

              4. Boethius writes: “Providence is so called because, standing at
              a distance from the lowest things, it looks upon all things from
              their highest summit.” Now, to look upon is to know, especially to
              know speculatively. Providence, therefore, seems to belong to
              speculative knowledge.

              Praeterea, sicut dicit Boetius in IV de consolatione, uti est ad

              intellectus quam ratiocinatio ad cognitionem pertinet communiter

              5. As Boethius says: “Fate is related to Providence as reasoning
              is to understanding.” Now, understanding and reasoning are common
              to both speculative and practical knowledge. Providence,
              therefore, also belongs to both types of knowledge.

              Praeterea, Augustinus in libro LXXXIII quaestionum dicit, lex

              6. Augustine writes: “An unchangeable law controls all changeable
              things, governing them gloriously.” Now, control and government
              belong to providence. Consequently, that unchangeable law is
              providence itself. But law pertains t knowledge. Therefore,
              providence also belongs to knowledge.

              Praeterea, lex naturalis in nobis ex divina providentia causatur.

              7. The natural law as it exists within us is caused by divine
              providence. Now, a cause acts to bring about an effect in its own
              likeness. For this reason we also say that God’s goodness is the
              cause of goodness in things, His essence, the cause of their
              being, and His life, the cause of their living. Divine providence,
              therefore, is a law; hence, our former position stands.

              8. Boethius says: “Providence is the divine plan set up within the
              ruler of all things.” Now, as Augustine says,” the divine plan of
              a thing is an idea. Providence, therefore, is an idea; and since
              an idea pertains to knowledge, providence also pertains to
              knowledge.

              Praeterea, scientia practica ordinatur vel ad producendum res in
              esse, vel ad ordinandum iam productas res. Sed producere res non
              est providentiae, quia providentia praesupponit res provisas;
              similiter etiam nec ordinare res productas, quia hoc ad
              dispositionem pertinet. Ergo providentia non pertinet ad
              cognitionem practicam, sed speculativam tantum.

              9. Practical knowledge is ordained either to bring things into
              existence or to order things already in existence. Now, it does
              not belong to providence to bring things into existence. It rather
              presupposes the things over which it is exercised. Nor does it
              order things that are in existence. This belongs to God’s disposal
              of things. Providence, therefore, pertains not to practical, but
              only to speculative knowledge.

              1. Providence seems to belong to the will, because, as Damascene

              2. We do not call those people provident who know what to do but

              3. As Boethius says, God governs the world by His goodness. Now,
              goodness pertains to the will. Therefore, providence also pertains

              Now, according to Boethius, providence is the plan according to

              who provides, taken as such, is not wise, but good. Hence,
              providence does not pertain to wisdom, but to goodness or to the
              will.

              1. Furthermore, it seems that providence pertains to power. For
              Boethius says: “Providence has given to the things it has created
              the greatest reason for enduring, so that as far as they are able,
              all things naturally desire to endure.” Providence, therefore, is
              a principle of creation. But, since creation is appropriated to
              God’s power, providence pertains to power.

              Praeterea, gubernatio est providentiae effectus, ut dicitur

              2. Government is the effect of providence, for the Book of Wisdom
              (14:3) says: “But thy providence, O Father, governs all.” But, as
              Hugh of St. Victor says, the will commands, wisdom directs, and
              power executes. Power, therefore, is more closely related to
              government than is knowledge or will. Consequently, providence
              pertains more to power than to knowledge or will.

              We should first note that Cicero makes providence a part of
              prudence. Providence, as it were, completes prudence, since the
              other two parts of prudence, memory and understanding, are merely
              preparations for the prudent act. Moreover, according to the
              Philosopher,” prudence is the reasoned plan of doing things. Now,
              things to be done differ from things to be made, because the
              latter start from an agent and terminate in some extrinsic matter,
              as, for example, a bench and a house; and the reasoned plan of
              making them is called art. On the other hand, things to be done
              are actions which do not go outside the agent, but, instead, are
              acts that perfect him, as, for example, chaste living, bearing
              oneself patiently, and the like. The reasoned plan of performing
              these is called prudence. With respect to action, two things
              should be considered: the end and the means.

              However, it is especially the role of prudence to direct the means
              to the end; and, as we read in the
              <i>Ethics</i>, one is called prudent if he deliberates well. But,
              as we also read in the <i>Ethics</i>, deliberation “is not
              concerned with ends, but only with means.” Now, the end of things
              to be done pre-exists in us in two ways: first, through the
              natural knowledge we have of man’s end. This knowledge, of course,
              as the Philosopher says, belongs to the intellect, which is a
              principle of things to be done as well as of things to be studied;
              and, as the Philosopher also points out, ends are principles of
              things to be done. The second way that these ends pre-exist in us
              is through our desires. Here, the ends of things to be done exist
              in us in our moral virtues, which influence a man to live a just,
              brave, or temperate life. This is, in a sense, the proximate end
              of things to be done. We are similarly perfected with respect to
              the means towards this end: our knowledge is perfected by counsel,
              our appetite, by choice; and in these matters we are directed by
              prudence.

              It is clear, therefore, that it belongs to prudence to dispose, in
              an orderly way, the means towards an end. And because this
              disposing of means to an end is done by prudence, it can be said
              to take place by a kind of reasoning process, whose first
              principles are ends. The very reason for the sequence described
              above—and found in all things to be done—is taken from ends, as is
              clear in the case of art products. Consequently, if one would be
              prudent, he must stand in the proper relation to the ends
              themselves, for a reasoned plan cannot exist unless the principles
              of reason are maintained. Hence, prudence requires not only the
              understanding of ends but also moral virtues by which the will is
              settled in a correct end. For this reason, the Philosopher says
              that the prudent man must be virtuous. Finally, this is common to
              all rightly ordered powers and acts of the soul: the virtue of
              what is first is maintained in all the rest. Consequently, in
              prudence, in some way, are included both the will as directed
              towards an end and the knowledge of the end itself.

              From what has been said it is now clear how providence is related
              to God’s other attributes. His knowledge is related both to ends
              and to means toward ends, because through knowledge God knows
              Himself and creatures. But providence pertains only to that
              knowledge which is concerned with means to ends and in so far as
              these means are ordained to ends. Consequently, in God providence
              includes both knowledge and will, although, taken essentially, it
              belongs only to knowledge, that is, to practical, not to
              speculative, knowledge. Providence, moreover, also includes the
              power of execution; hence, an act of power presupposes an act of
              providence, as it were, directing it, and for this reason power is
              not included in providence as the will is.

              1. Two aspects of a creature can be considered: first, its species
              taken absolutely; second, its relation to an end. The form of each
              exists previously in God. The exemplary form of a thing considered
              absolutely in its species is an idea; but the form of a thing
              considered as directed to an end is called providence. Moreover,
              according to Boethius, the order divine providence implants in
              things is called fate. Consequently, providence is related to fate
              as an idea is related to the species of a thing. An idea, however,
              can in some way pertain to speculative knowledge; but providence
              is related only to practical knowledge, since it implies an
              ordering to an end, and, consequently, to something to be done, by
              means of which the end will be reached.

              its name. Consequently, even though looking upon things may be
              considered as speculative knowledge, it does not follow that
              providence may be considered to be such. Besides, Boethius
              explains providence, or foresight, as though it were far-sight,
              because “God Himself surveys all things from their highest
              summit.” But God is on the highest summit of things for the very
              reason that He causes and directs all things. So, even in the
              words of Boethius something pertaining to practical knowledge can

              proportion between a body at rest and a body in motion. For, just
              as understanding is simple and non-discursive but reason is
              discursive, passing from one thing to another, similarly,
              providence is simple and unchangeable but fate is multiple and
              changeable. The conclusion, therefore, does not follow.

              6. Properly speaking, God’s providence is not the eternal law; it
              is something that follows upon the eternal law. The eternal law
              should be thought of as existing in God as those principles of
              action exist in us which we know naturally and upon which we base
              our deliberation and choice. These belong to prudence or
              providence. Consequently, the law of our intellect is related to
              prudence as an indemonstrable principle is related to a
              demonstration. Similarly, the eternal law in God is not His
              providence, but, as it were, a principle of His providence; for
              this reason one can, without any inconsistency, attribute an act
              of providence to the eternal law in the same way that he
              attributes every conclusion of a demonstration to self-evident
              principles.

              7. There are two types of causality to be found in the divine
              attributes. The first type is exemplary causality. Because of this
              type, we say that all living beings come from the first living
              being. This type of causality is common to all the divine
              attributes. The second type of causality is according to the
              relation the attributes have to their objects. We say, for
              example, that divine power is the cause of the possibles, divine
              knowledge is the cause of what is known. An effect of this type of
              causality need not resemble its cause; for the things that are
              made by knowledge need not be knowledge, but merely known. It is
              according to this type of causality that the providence of God is
              said to be the cause of all things. Consequently, even though the
              natural law within our understanding is derived from providence,
              it does not follow that divine providence is the eternal law.

              9. A twofold ordering may be found in things. First, there is that
              order according to which things come from their principles.
              Second, there is the order according to which they are directed to
              an end. Now, the divine disposing pertains to that order according
              to which things proceed from their principles; for things are said
              to be disposed inasmuch as they are put on different levels by
              God, who is like an artist arranging the different parts of his
              work in different ways. Consequently, disposition seems to pertain
              to art. Providence, however, implies the ordering which directs to
              an end; for this reason it differs from the divine art and
              disposition. For divine art is so called because of its relation
              to the production of things, but divine disposition is so called
              because of its relation to the order of what has already been
              produced. Providence, however, implies the ordination to an end.
              Now, we can gather from the end of an art product whatever exists
              in the thing itself. Moreover, the ordering of a thing to an end
              is more closely related to the end than is the ordering of its
              parts to each other. In fact, their ordering to an end is, in a
              sense, the cause of the ordering of the parts to each other.
              Consequently, divine providence is, in a sense, the cause of God’s
              disposition of things, and for this reason an act of His
              disposition is sometimes attributed to His providence. Therefore,
              even if providence is not an art related to the production of
              things or a disposition related to the ordering of things one to
              another, it does not follow that providence does not belong to
              practical knowledge.

              nature is a principle having but one form, because it is
              determined to one. Therefore, nature precedes providence.

              there is no potency to corruption, since there is none to
              generation, as, for example, the celestial bodies and the
              spiritual substances, which are the most important things in the
              universe. Therefore, substances of this sort do not need
              providence to keep them in being.

              This position, however, was criticized by other philosophers on

              cause only the existence of their effects. They are not sufficient
              to produce goodness in them so that they be aptly disposed in
              themselves, so that they could continue to exist, and toward
              others so that they could help them. Heat, for example, of its
              very nature and of itself can break down other things, but this
              breaking down is good and helpful only if it happens up to a
              certain point and in a certain way. Consequently, if we do not
              admit that there exist in nature causes other than heat and
              similar agents, we cannot give any reason why things happen in a
              good and orderly way.

              Moreover, whatever does not have a determinate cause happens by
              accident. Consequently, if the position mentioned above were true,
              all the harmony and usefulness found in things would be the result
              of chance. This was actually what Empedocles held. He asserted
              that it was by accident that the parts of animals came together in
              this way through friendship—and this was his explanation of an
              animal and of a frequent occurrence! This explanation, of course,
              is absurd, for those things that happen by chance, happen only
              rarely; we know from experience, however, that harmony and
              usefulness are found in nature either at all times or at least for
              the most part. This cannot be the result of mere chance; it must
              be because an end is intended. What lacks intellect or knowledge,
              however, cannot tend directly toward an end. It can do this only
              if someone else’s knowledge has established an end for it, and
              directs it to that end. Consequently, since natural things have no
              knowledge, there must be some previously existing intelligence
              directing them to an end, like an archer who gives a definite
              motion to an arrow so that it will wing its way to a determined
              end. Now, the hit made by the arrow is said to be the work not of
              the arrow alone but also of the person who shot it. Similarly,
              philosophers call every work of nature the work of intelligence.

              uniformi. Alio modo secundum respectum ad effectus, ut dicatur
              illud principium multiforme quod ad multa se extendit: et sic

              est simplicius, tanto se extendit ad plura; et per hunc modum

              2. A principle can be said to be multiform in two senses. First,
              the multiformity can refer to the very essence of the
              principle—that is, the principle is composite. A principle that is
              multiform in this sense must be posterior to a principle having
              but one form. Second, the multiformity may refer to the
              principle’s relation to its effects, so that a principle is said
              to be multiform because it extends its influence to many things. A
              principle that is multiform in this sense precedes one that has
              but a single form, because the more simple a principle is, the
              more extensive is its influence. It is in this sense, moreover,
              that the will is said to be a multiform, and nature, a uniform
              principle.

              essence, however, is the cause of things only in so far as it is
              known, and consequently, only in so far as it wills to be
              communicated to a creature by the creature’s being made in its
              likeness. Hence, things proceed from the divine essence through
              the ordering of knowledge and will, and so through providence.

              6. Generation and corruption can be understood in two senses.
              First, generation and corruption can arise from a contrary being
              and terminate in a contrary. In this sense, the potency to
              generation and corruption exists in a thing because its matter is
              in potency to contrary forms; and in this respect celestial bodies
              and spiritual substances have no potency to generation or
              corruption. Second, these terms are commonly used to indicate any
              coming into or passing out of existence that is found in things.
              Consequently, even creation, by which a thing is drawn from
              nothingness into existence, is called generation; and the
              annihilation of a thing is called corruption.

              cuncta enim quae Deus in esse produxit, potest etiam reducere in
              non esse. Cum ad hoc quod creaturae subsistant, oportet quod
              semper in eis Deus esse operetur, ut Augustinus dicit super
              Genesim ad litteram; non per modum quo domus fit ab artifice,
              cuius actione cessante adhuc domus manet, sed per modum quo
              illuminatio aeris est a sole; unde ex hoc ipso quod non praeberet

              Moreover, a thing is said to be in potency to generation in this
              sense if an agent has the power to produce it; and it is said to
              be in potency to corruption if an agent has the power to reduce it
              to nothingness. In this way of speaking, every creature is in
              potency to corruption; for all that God has brought into existence
              He can also reduce to nothingness. For, as Augustine says, for
              creatures to subsist God must constantly work in them. This action
              of God, however, must not be compared to the action of a craftsman
              building a house, for, when his action ceases, the house still
              remains; it should rather be compared to the sun’s lighting up the
              air. Consequently, when God no longer gives existence to a
              creature, whose very existence depends on His will, then this
              creature is reduced to nothingness.

              7. The necessity of the principles mentioned depends upon God’s

              have a particular nature and, in this nature, a determined act of

              upon this distinction is based the principle that affirmation and
              negation cannot be true simultaneously. Moreover, on this
              principle, as we read in the

              Consequently, through them we cannot arrive at a perfect knowledge
              of God. Another reason for our imperfect knowledge is the weakness
              of our intellect, which cannot assimilate all the evidence of God
              that is to be found in creatures. It is for this reason that we
              are forbidden to scrutinize God’s attributes over-zealously in the
              sense of aiming at the completion of such an inquiry, an aim which
              is implied in the very notion of overzealous scrutiny. If we were

              investigating God’s attributes, remembering that we are too weak

              writes as follows: “Even if a man who reverently seeks the

              search will always profit him.”

              As we said above, the providence by which God rules things is

              his household or a king rules a city or kingdom. The common
              element in these rules is the primacy of the common good over the
              good of the individual; for, as we read in the

              the city, family, or person. Consequently, whoever is supervising
              must—if he is to rule wisely—pay more attention to what is good
              for the community than to what is good merely for an individual.

              Some have not kept this point in mind, but considering only that
              there are corruptible things which, if taken in themselves, could
              be better, and not considering the order of the universe in which
              each and every thing is excellently arranged—some, I say, have
              said that those corruptible things are therefore not ruled by God
              but that only incorruptible things are. These persons are
              represented in Job (22:14) by the man who says: “The clouds are
              God’s covert, and he doth not consider our things, and he walks
              about the poles of heaven.” Moreover, they assert that corruptible
              things act necessarily and without any ruler at all or are ruled
              by an opposing principle. The Philosopher, however, has refuted”
              this position by taking an army as an example. In an army we find
              two orders, one by which the parts of the army are related to each
              other, and a second by which the army is directed to an external
              good, namely, the good of its leader. That order by which the
              parts of the army are related to each other exists for the sake of
              the order by which the entire army is subordinated to its leader.
              Consequently, if the subordination to the leader did not exist,
              the ordering of the parts of the army to each other would not
              exist. Consequently, whenever we find a group whose members are
              ordered to each other, that group must necessarily be ordered to
              some external principle.

              Now, the corruptible and incorruptible parts of the universe are
              related to each other essentially, not accidentally. For we see
              that corruptible bodies benefit from celestial bodies, and always,
              or at least ordinarily, in the same manner. Consequently, all
              things, corruptible and incorruptible, must be in one order under
              the providence of an external principle outside the universe. For
              this reason, the Philosopher concluded that it was necessary to
              affirm the existence of a single rule over the universe, and of
              not more than one.

              It must be noted, however, that a thing is provided for in two
              ways: for itself, or for other things. For example, in a home,
              care is taken of some things on their own account, namely, those
              things that constitute the essential goods of a household, such as
              sons, possessions, and the like; and other things, such as
              utensils, animals, and the like are cared for so that the
              essential things can use them. Similarly, in the universe, the
              things in which the essential perfection of the universe consists
              are provided for on their own account, and like the universe
              itself, these things stay in existence. But the things that do not
              endure are provided for, not for their own sake, but for the sake
              of other things. Consequently, spiritual substances and heavenly
              bodies, which are perpetual both as species and as individuals,
              are provided for on their own account both as species and as
              individuals. Corruptible things, however, are perpetual only as a
              species; hence, these species are looked after for their own sake,
              but the individual members of these species are not provided for
              except for this reason: to keep the species in perpetual
              existence.

              because, as Damascene says,’ it is illogical to say that one
              person makes a thing and another provides for it. Now, God is not

              Moreover, the same things that are close to their principle are
              close to their end, and those that are remote from their principle
              are remote from their end. Consequently, not only have
              incorruptible substances an unfailing act of existence, but also
              their actions never fail to keep their direction to an end. For
              example, there are heavenly bodies whose motions never leave their
              natural orbit. However because corruptible bodies have defective
              natures, many of their movements diverge from their proper order.
              It is for this reason that, in regard to the order of the
              universe, the Philosopher compares incorruptible bodies to
              children in a household who always do what is good for the home,
              and corruptible bodies to domestic animals and slaves whose
              actions frequently violate the order laid down by the one in

              It should not be thought, however, that those acts of things here
              below which are outside their proper course are entirely outside
              the order of providence. For a thing comes under God’s providence
              in two ways: it can be something to which something else is
              ordered or it can be something that is ordered to something else.
              Now, as said in the
              <i>Physics</i>
              and in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>, in an order of means to an end, all the
              intermediate members are ends as well as means to an end.
              Consequently, whatever is rightly ordered by providence comes
              under providence not only as something that is referred to
              something else, but also as something to which another thing is
              referred. However, a thing which leaves the right order comes
              under providence only as something referred, to something else,
              not as something to which another thing has been referred. For
              example, the act of the generative powers by which a man generates
              another complete in his nature is directed by God to a particular
              thing, namely, a human form; and to the act itself something else
              is directed, namely, the generative power. A defective act which
              results occasionally in the generation of natural monstrosities
              is, of course, directed by God to some useful purpose; but to this
              defective act itself nothing else was directed. It happened merely
              on account of the failure of some cause. With regard to the
              first-named act of generation, the providence is one of approval;
              with regard to the second, it is one of permission. These two
              kinds of providence are discussed by Damascene.

              It should be noted, however, that some have restricted God’s
              providence to only the species of natural things, and have
              excluded it from individuals except as they participate in a
              common nature. They did this because they did not admit that God
              knows singulars, but said that God directs the nature of a species
              in such a way that the resultant power of a species can bring
              about a certain action, and, if this should fail at times, the
              failure itself is directed to something useful—just as the
              corruption of one thing is directed to the generation of another.
              They denied, however, that a particular force is directed to a
              particular act and that this particular failure is directed to
              this particular use. But since we say that God knows all
              particular things perfectly, we assert that all individual things,
              even as individuals, fall under God’s providence.

              1. That argument touches only the providence of approval. It is
              true, however, that God does not provide for a thing unless He is
              in some way its author. Consequently, since evil does not come
              from God, it does not fall under His providence of approval, but
              falls only under His providence of permission.

              sit prudentissimus, sua providentia non prohibet mala, sed
              permittit unumquodque agere secundum quod natura eius requirit; ut

              4. Any prudent man will endure a small evil in order that a great
              good will not be prevented. Any particular good, moreover, is
              trifling in comparison with the good of a universal nature. Again,
              evil cannot be kept from certain things without taking away their
              nature, which is such that it may or may not fail; and, while this
              nature may harm something in particular, it nevertheless gives
              some added beauty to the universe. Consequently, since God is most
              prudent, His providence does not prevent evil, but allows each
              thing to act as its nature requires it to act. For, as Dionysius
              says, the role of providence is to save, not to destroy, nature.

              5. There are certain goods which can be drawn only from certain

              the evil of persecution, and the good of penitence only from the
              evil of sin. This, however, is not to deny that evil is weak in
              comparison with good, because things of this sort are drawn out of
              evil, not as from an essential cause, but, as it were,
              accidentally and materially.

              6. Inasmuch as it has an act of existence, whatever is made must
              have the form of the one who makes it, because the making of a
              thing terminates in its act of existence. Consequently, an evil
              cannot be produced by a cause that is good. Now, providence
              directs a thing to an end, and this direction to an end follows
              upon the act of existence of the thing. It is not impossible,
              therefore, for something evil to be directed to a good by one who
              is good, but it is impossible for one who is good to direct
              something to an evil. For, just as the goodness of a maker puts
              the form of goodness in the things he makes, so also does the
              goodness of one who is provident put a direction to good in the
              things that are subject to his providence.

              his own counsel.” Human acts, therefore, are not ruled by
              providence.

              Now, since providence is concerned with directing to an end, it
              must take place with the end as its norm; and since the first
              provider is Himself the end of His providence, He has the norm of
              providence within Himself. Consequently, it is impossible that any
              of the failures in those things for which He provides should be
              due to Him; the failures in these things can be due only to the

              has been communicated are not the ends of their own providence.

              Now, man is numbered among these creatures, because his form—that
              is, his soul—is a spiritual being, the root of all his human acts,
              and that by which even his body has a relation to immortality.
              Consequently, human acts come under divine providence according as
              men themselves have providence over their own acts; and the
              defects in these acts are ordained according to what belongs to
              these men themselves, not only according to what belongs to
              others. For example, when a man sins, God orders the sin to the
              sinner’s good, so that after his fall, upon rising again, he may
              be a more humble person; or it is ordered at least to a good which
              is brought about in him by divine justice when he is punished for
              his sin. The defects happening in sensible creatures, however, are
              directed only to what belongs to others; for example, the
              corruption of some particular fire is directed to the generation
              of some particular air. Consequently, to designate this special
              manner of providence which God exercises over human acts, Wisdom
              (12:18) says: “You, with great favour, dispose of us.”

              are like a man who enters a carpenter shop and thinks that there
              is a useless multiplication of tools because he does not know how
              each one is used; but one who knows the trade will see that this
              number of tools exists for a very good reason.

              men’s actions. It seems, therefore, that the acts of irrational

              punishment does not help him in any way, it would not seem that
              human affairs were ruled by providence. Now, brute animals cannot
              come to a particiption in God, nor do they have any fault. And
              when they are killed, their death is not directed to their good,
              because there is no reward for them after death. Their lives,
              therefore, are not ruled by providence.

              Dicendum, quod circa hoc duplex fuit error. Quidam enim dixerunt,
              quod animalia bruta non gubernantur providentia, nisi inquantum
              participant naturam speciei, quae est a Deo provisa et ordinata:
              et ad hunc providentiae modum referunt omnia quae in sacra
              Scriptura inveniuntur, quae videntur importare providentiam Dei
              circa bruta, sicut illud: qui dat iumentis escam ipsorum, et
              pullis etc.; et iterum: catuli leonum rugientes etc.; et multa
              huiusmodi. Sed hic error maximam imperfectionem Deo attribuit: non
              enim potest esse quod sciat singulares actus brutorum animalium,
              et eos non ordinet, cum sit summe bonus, et bonitatem suam per hoc
              in omnia diffundens. Unde praedictus error vel derogat divinae
              scientiae, subtrahens ei particularium cognitionem, vel divinae
              bonitati subtrahens ei ordinationem particularium in quantum sunt
              particularia. Unde alii dixerunt, quod etiam brutorum actus sub
              providentia cadunt, et eodem modo quo actus rationalium; ut
              scilicet nullum malum in eis accidere patiatur quin ordinet in
              bonum ipsorum. Sed hoc est longe etiam a ratione: non enim debetur
              praemium vel poena nisi ei qui liberum arbitrium habet.

              In this matter two errors have been made. Some’ have said that
              brutes are not ruled by providence except as they participate in
              the nature of their species, which alone is provided for and
              directed by God. It is to this kind of providence, they say, that
              all the passage in Scripture refer when they seem to imply God’s
              providence over brutes, for example: “Who gives to beasts their
              food: and to the young...” (Psalms 146:9); “The young lions
              roaring...” (Psalm 103:21); and many similar passages. This error,
              however, attributes very great imperfection to God. Moreover, it
              is not possible that God should know the individual acts of brutes
              and not direct them, since He is most good and, because He is
              good, pours out His goodness upon all things. Consequently, the
              error we have mentioned belittles either God’s knowledge by
              denying that He knows individual things or His goodness by denying
              that He directs individual things as individuals. For this reason,
              others have said that the acts of brutes, also, fall under
              providence in the same way in which the acts of rational being do.
              Consequently, no evil would be found in the acts of brutes that
              would not be directed to their good. This position, however, is
              also far from reasonable, for punishment and reward is due only to
              those who have free choice.

              Et ideo dicendum est, quod bruta et omnes eorum actus etiam in
              singulari sub divina providentia cadunt; non tamen eodem modo quo
              homines, et eorum actus: quia de hominibus etiam in singulari est
              providentia propter se; sed singularia brutorum non providentur
              nisi propter aliud, sicut et de aliis creaturis corruptibilibus
              dictum est. Et ideo malum quod in bruto accidit, non ordinatur in
              bonum eius, sed in bonum alterius, sicut mors asini ordinatur in
              bonum leonis vel lupi. Sed occisio hominis qui a leone occiditur,
              non solum ad hoc ordinatur, sed principalius ad poenam eius, vel
              ad augmentum meriti, quod per patientiam crescit.

            <td>
              It must be said, therefore, that brutes and their acts, taken even
              individually, fall under God’s providence, but not in the same way
              in which men and their actions do. For providence is exercised
              over men, even as individuals, for their own sake; but individual
              brutes are provided for merely for the sake of something else—just
              as other corruptible creatures are, as mentioned previously.
              Hence, the evil that happens to a brute is not ordered to the good
              of the brute but to the good of something else, just as the death
              of an ass is ordered to the good of a lion or that of a wolf. But
              the death of a man killed by a lion is directed not merely to the
              good of the lion, but principally to the man’s punishment or to
              the increase of his merit; for his merit can grow if he accepts
              his sufferings.

              1. The Apostle does not intend to remove brutes entirely from
              God’s care. He simply means to say that God does not care so much
              for brutes that He would impose a law upon men for the sake of
              brutes, commanding men to be good to them or not to kill them; for
              brutes have been made for man’s use. Consequently, providence is
              not exercised over them for their own sake but for the sake of
              men.

              2. God has so ordered fishes and brutes that the weak are subject

              or demerits, but only for the conservation of the good of nature.
              The prophet wondered, therefore, if human affairs were governed in
              the same way. For this to be true, of course, would be
              unreasonable.

              they are guarded by angels. But guardian angels sometimes abandon
              men. From their own lips we have these words: “We would have cured
              Babylon, but she is not healed: let us forsake her (Jeremiah
              51:9). The evil, therefore, are not governed by God’s providence.

              Dicendum, quod providentia divina se extendit ad homines
              dupliciter: uno modo inquantum ipsi providentur; alio modo

              deficiunt, vel rectitudinem servant, boni vel mali dicuntur; ex

              et secundum quod ipsi diversimode se habent in providendo,
              diversimode providetur eis. Si enim rectum ordinem in providendo
              servent; et in eis divina providentia ordinem servat congruum
              humanae dignitati, ut, scilicet, nihil eis eveniat quod in eorum
              bonum non cedat; et quod omnia quae eis proveniunt eos in bonum
              promoveant; secundum id quod dicitur Rom. VIII, 28: diligentibus
              Deum omnia cooperantur in bonum. Si autem in providendo ordinem
              non servent, qui congruit rationali creaturae, sed provideant
              secundum modum animalium brutorum, et divina providentia de eis
              ordinabit secundum ordinem qui brutis competit; ut scilicet ea
              quae in eis bona vel mala sunt, non ordinentur in eorum bonum
              proprium, sed in bonum aliorum, secundum id quod in Psalm. XLVIII,
              13, dicitur: homo, cum in honore esset, non intellexit: comparatus
              et cetera. Ex hoc patet quod altiori modo divina providentia
              gubernat bonos quam malos: mali enim dum ab uno ordine
              providentiae exeunt, ut scilicet Dei voluntatem faciant, in alium
              ordinem dilabuntur, ut scilicet de eis voluntas divina fiat; sed

              Divine providence extends to men in two ways: first, in so far as
              men are provided for; second, in so far as they themselves become
              providers. If they fail in their own providence they are called
              evil; but if they observe the demands of justice they are called
              good. Moreover in so far as they come under providence they are
              given both good and evil. Now, men are provided for in different
              ways according to the different ways they have of providing for
              themselves. For, if they keep the right order in their own
              providence, God’s providence in their regard will keep an ordering
              that is congruent with their human dignity; that is, nothing will
              happen to them that is not for their own good, and everything that
              happens to them will be to their own advantage, according to what
              is said in the Epistle to the Romans (8:2 8): “To them that love
              God, all things work together unto good.” However, if in their own
              providence men do not keep that order which is congruent with
              their dignity as rational creatures, but provide after the manner
              of brute animals, then God’s providence will dispose of them
              according to the order that belongs to brutes, so that their good
              and evil acts will not be directed to their own profit but to the
              profit of others, according to the words of the Psalmist: “And man
              when he was in honour did not understand; he is compared...”
              (Psalms 48:13) —From this it is evident that God’s providence
              governs the good in a higher way than it governs the evil. For,
              when the evil leave the order of providence, that is, by not doing
              the will of God, they fall into another order, an order in which
              the will of God is done to them. The good, however, are in the
              true order of His providence in both respects.

              5. Augustine distinguishes between two types of providential
              operations: “natural and voluntary.” The former he calls natural
              because it makes trees and plants grow; the latter he calls
              voluntary because it takes place through the deeds of angels and
              men. It is clear, therefore, that all material things are ruled by
              the natural operation of providence, not through the mediation of
              angels, as would be true were they ruled by voluntary operation.

              non fecit omnes creaturas rationales vel per se existentes, sed
              quasdam irrationales, et quasdam existentes in alio, sicut
              accidentia. Ergo videtur quod ad maiorem sui manifestationem non
              solum condiderit creaturas quae indigent alieno regimine, sed
              etiam aliquas quae nullo regimine indigeant; et sic idem quod
              prius.

              9. The divine goodness has created the whole world in order to
              manifest itself; for, as we read in Proverbs (16:4): “The Lord has
              made all things for himself...” Now, God’s goodness, as Augustine
              also says, is manifested more by a diversity of natures than by a
              number of things all possessing the same nature. For this reason,
              God did not make all creatures rational or all of them to exist in
              themselves. He made some creatures irrational, and some, like
              accidents, that exist in others. Consequently, it seems that for
              the greater manifestation of Himself God created not only
              creatures that needed the rule of another, but also some creatures
              that needed no rule at all. Hence, our position stands.

              10. There are two types of acts in creatures, first act and second
              act. First act is the form and the act of existence that a form
              gives. Form is called the primarily first act, existence, the
              secondarily first act. Second act, however, is operation. Now, the
              first act of corporeal things comes directly from God. Therefore,
              their second acts are also caused directly by God. But the only
              way in which one thing governs another is by being in some manner
              the cause of its operations. Therefore, material creatures of this
              sort are not governed through the instrumentality of spirits.

              a ruler, his city. The other way is to impart motion to a thing;
              this is the way in which a pilot guides his ship. Now, spiritual
              creatures do not govern material creatures by imparting light or
              knowledge, because these material things cannot receive knowledge,
              nor do they govern them by imparting motion, because, as is proved
              in the
              <i>Physics</i>, a mover must be joined to what he moves, and
              spiritual substances are not joined to these lesser material
              bodies. Consequently, the latter are not governed in any way
              through their mediation.

              As Dionysius and Augustine say, the divine goodness is the cause
              of things’ being brought into existence, for God wished to
              communicate His goodness to others as far as this was possible to
              creatures. God’s goodness, however, has a twofold perfection. We
              can consider it in itself as it contains all perfections in itself
              in a supereminent way, or we can consider it as it flows into
              things, that is, as it is the cause of things. It was fitting,
              therefore, that God’s divine goodness should be communicated to
              creatures in both ways so that because of this goodness created
              things not only would exist and possess goodness but also would
              give existence and goodness to other things, just like the sun’s
              outpoured rays, which not only illumine other bodies but also make
              them to be sources of light, too. However, the following order is
              kept: Those that most resemble the sun receive the most of its
              light and, consequently, have sufficient light not only for
              themselves but also to pour out on other things.

              Similarly, in the ordering of the universe, as a result of the

              that by which they are good in themselves, but also that by which
              they are the cause of goodness for other things which participate

              Inter superiores autem creaturas maxime Deo propinquae sunt
              creaturae rationales, quae ad Dei similitudinem sunt, vivunt et
              intelligunt; unde eis non solum a divina bonitate confertur ut
              super alia influant, sed etiam ut eumdem modum influendi retineant
              quo influit Deus; scilicet per voluntatem, et non per necessitatem
              naturae. Unde Deus inferiores creaturas gubernat et per creaturas
              spirituales, et per corporales digniores; sed per creaturas
              corporales hoc modo providet quod eas non facit providentes, sed
              agentes tantum; per spirituales autem hoc modo providet quod eas
              providentes facit.

              Now, among the superior creatures, the closest to God are those
              rational ones that exist, live and understand in the likeness of
              God. Consequently, God in His goodness gives them the power not
              only of pouring out upon other things but also of having the same
              manner of outpouring that He Himself has—that is, according to
              their will, and not according to any necessity of their nature.
              Hence, God governs inferior creatures both through spiritual
              creatures and through the more noble material creatures. He
              provides through material creatures, not by making them provident
              themselves, but by making them active. He governs through
              spiritual creatures, however, by making them provident themselves.

              But even in rational creatures an order can be found. Rational
              souls hold the lowest place among these, and their light is
              shadowy in comparison with that of the angels. Consequently, as
              Dionysius says, their knowledge is more restricted, and their
              providence is likewise restricted to a few things, namely, to
              human affairs and practical matters of human life. But the
              providence of angels is universal and extends to all material
              creation. Consequently, both saints and philosophers say that all
              corporeal things are governed by divine providence through the
              mediation of angels. We must differ with the philosophers,
              however, in this, that some of them say that corporeal things are
              not only cared for by angels but are also created by them. This
              opinion is contrary to faith. We should follow, instead, the
              opinion of the saints who hold that corporeal things of this sort
              are administered by the providence of angels through motion only;
              that is, the angels move the higher bodies, and these motions
              cause the motions of the lower.

              operation of an instrument; it merely excludes another principal
              agent. Hence, if one were to say, “Socrates alone makes a knife,”
              not the operation of his hammer but only the operation of another
              carpenter is excluded. Similarly, when it is said that God governs
              the world by Himself, this does not exclude the operation of
              inferior causes, which God uses as instrumental means. All that is
              excluded is government by another principal ruler.

              The ordination of a thing to an end, however, presupposes its act
              of existing; but its act of existing presupposes nothing else.
              Consequently, creation, by which all things are brought into
              existence, is the operation of the only cause that presupposes no
              other cause by which it is kept in existence. Government, however,
              can be one of those causes that do presuppose other causes, so it
              is not necessary for God to create through the mediation of
              certain causes through whose instrumentality He governs.

              creatures; but those that express both a perfection and its manner

              <i>omnipotence, supreme wisdom,</i>

              8. As Avicenna says, no effect can remain if its proper cause is
              removed. Now, certain inferior causes are causes of becoming;
              others are causes of existing. A cause of becoming is that which
              educes a form from the potentiality of matter by means of motion,
              such as a cutler who is the efficient cause of a knife. A cause of
              a thing’s existing, however, is that upon which the act of
              existence of a thing essentially depends, as the existence of
              light in the air depends upon the sun. Now, if the cutler is
              removed, the becoming of the knife ceases, but not its existence.
              However, if the sun is taken away, there ceases the very existence
              of the light in the air. Similarly, if God’s action ceases, the
              existence of a creature utterly ceases, since God is the cause not
              only of a thing’s becoming but also of its existence.

              can imply a cause of the operation in so far as this cause issues
              in a result. In this sense it is said that something takes place
              <i>through</i>
              an instrument.
              <i>Through</i>
              can also, however, signify a cause of the operation in so far as
              the operation comes from the one operating. In this sense we say
              that something takes place
              <i>through</i>
              the form of the agent. Now, here it is not the instrument which is
              the cause of the agent’s action, but his form or some superior
              agent is the cause. However, an instrument can be the cause of the
              result which receives the agent’s action.

              2. It was said, however, that the celestial bodies are not called
              the causes of bodies here below merely because they do not
              introduce any necessity into them.—On the contrary, if an effect
              of a heavenly body on bodies here below is impeded, this must have
              been caused by some condition in the lower bodies. Now, if the
              lower bodies are ruled by the heavenly bodies, then that
              obstructing condition must be traced to some influence of a
              heavenly body. Consequently, no impediment could arise from bodies
              here below unless it were due to an exigency of the celestial
              bodies. Therefore, if the celestial bodies rule the lower, and if
              the motions of the celestial bodies are necessary, they will
              introduce necessity into the lower bodies.

              4. According to Augustine, there are three types of things: first,
              things that are acted upon but do not act (e.g., bodies); second,
              things that act but are not acted upon (e.g., God); third, things
              that both act and are acted upon (e.g., spiritual substances).
              Now, celestial bodies are simply corporeal. Consequently, they do
              not have the power of acting upon bodies here below. Hence, the
              latter are not disposed through their instrumentality.

              5. If a celestial body acts upon bodies here below, either it acts
              upon them in so far as it is a body, that is, through its material
              form, or it acts upon them through something else. Now, a
              celestial body does not act in so far as it is a body, because
              this kind of action can be found in all bodies; and this
              explanation seems unlikely from what Augustine says. Consequently,
              if it does act upon lower bodies, its action is due to something
              else; and, in this case, it should be attributed to an immaterial
              power and not to the heavenly bodies. Hence, the conclusion is the
              same as before.

              within it. Consequently, the conclusion is the same as before.

              divine power existing within it. A soul, however, is much more
              noble than a body. Hence, neither can a body do anything to the

              13. The final cause of a thing’s becoming is more noble than the
              thing. But all things were made for the sake of man—even heavenly
              bodies. For we read the following in Deuteronomy (4:19): “Lest
              perhaps lifting up your eyes to heaven,yousee the sun and the
              moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by
              erroryouadore them, which the Lord your God created for the
              service of all the nations that are under heaven.” Therefore, man
              is more noble than the celestial bodies. Now, what is less noble
              does not influence what is more noble. Consequently, celestial
              bodies have no influence on a human body, and, for the same
              reason, none on other bodies such as elements that are prior to
              the human body.

              bodies because of his soul, not because of his body.—On the
              contrary, a nobler perfection is proper to a nobler subject. Now,
              the body of a man has a more noble form than a heavenly body has;
              for the form of the heavens is purely material, and a rational
              soul is much more noble than matter. Therefore, even the body of a
              man is nobler than a heavenly body.

              The common intention of all philosophers was to reduce multitude
              to unity and variety to uniformity as much as possible.
              Consequently, after considering the diversity of actions to be
              found in bodies here below, the ancient philosophers attempted to
              reduce these bodies to some fewer and more simple principles, that
              is, to elements, one or many, and to elementary qualities. But
              their position is not logical; for, in the actions of natural
              things, elementary qualities are like instrumental principles. An
              indication of this is the fact that they do not have the same way
              of acting in all things, nor do their actions always arrive at the
              same term. They have different effects in gold, in wood, and in
              the flesh of an animal. Now, this would not happen unless their
              actions were controlled by something else. Moreover, the action of
              the principal agent is not reduced to the action of an instrument
              as to its principle. Rather, the opposite is true, as, for
              example, a product of handicraft ought not be attributed to the
              saw but to the craftsman. Therefore, neither can natural effects
              be reduced to elementary qualities as to their first principles.

              one cannot keep going back into infinity. Now, even though a
              heavenly body does not undergo change by generation or corruption
              or by a motion which would alter what belongs to its substance, it
              is nevertheless moved locally. Consequently, the reduction must be
              made to some prior principle so that things undergoing qualitative
              change are traced back by a definite order to that which causes
              this change in other things but is not so changed itself, although
              it is moved locally; and then further back to that which does not
              change in any way at all.

              Others have asserted that the heavenly bodies cause not only the
              motion of bodies here below but also their very beginning. For
              example, Avicenna says that, as a result of what is common to all
              heavenly bodies, that is, their circular motion, there is caused
              the common element of bodies here below, namely, first matter;
              and, as a result of those things which differentiate one heavenly
              body from another, there is caused the difference in their forms.
              Thus, the heavenly bodies are media, to some extent, between God
              and things here below even in the line of creation. This position,
              however, is contrary to faith, which teaches that the whole of
              nature in its first beginning was created directly by God. But
              that one creature should be moved by another, presupposing that
              natural powers of each creature are given it as a result of God’s
              work, is not contrary to faith. Consequently, we say that the
              heavenly bodies are the causes of bodies here below merely in the
              line of motion. Thus, these heavenly bodies are instruments in the
              work of governing, but not in the work of creating.

              caelestes non semper inducunt effectus suos in his inferioribus

              1. Damascene intends to exclude from heavenly bodies only first
              causality or any causality which would introduce necessity into
              bodies here below. For, even if heavenly bodies always act in the
              same way, their effects are received in lower bodies according to
              the manner of these lower bodies, which are frequently seen to be
              in a contrary state. Consequently, the forces exercised by the
              heavenly bodies are not always able to bring about their effects
              in the bodies here below, because a contrary disposition prevents
              them from doing so. This is why the Philosopher says that signs of
              storms and winds frequently appear, but the storms and winds do
              not take place because the contrary dispositions are stronger.

              to be cold, and so forth. Consequently, we should not reduce all

              dicunt enim, quod ignis non calefacit, sed Deus in igne. Sed haec
              positio stulta est cum auferat rebus omnibus naturales
              operationes; et contrariatur dictis philosophorum et sanctorum.
              Unde dicimus, quod corpora per virtutem corporalem agunt,

              4. That objection touches a certain opinion found in
              <i>The Fount of Life</i>
              to the effect that no body acts because of any power that it has
              as a body, because the quantity found in matter prevents the form
              from acting. Hence, every action we attribute to a body is really
              the action of some spiritual power operating in it. According to
              Rabbi Moses, this opinion was held by certain teachers among the
              Moors who said that fire does not heat, but God heats in the fire.
              This position, however, is foolish, since it denies all things
              their natural operations. Moreover, it is contrary to what
              philosophers and saints have said. Consequently, we say that
              bodies act by means of their material power; nevertheless, God
              operates in all things as a first cause operating in a second
              cause.

              this sense that Damascene asserted: “Brute animals do not act but
              are only acted upon.” But this does not mean that animals do not
              act if act is taken to mean simply the performance of an action.

              5. As we read in
              <i>Generation and Corruption</i>, that which is active is always
              other than or contrary to that which is passive. Consequently, it
              does not belong to a body to act upon another body with respect to
              that which it has in common with that body, but only with respect
              to that in which it is different from it. A body, therefore, does
              not act in so far as it is a body, but in so far as it is a
              certain kind of body. For example, no animal reasons inasmuch as
              it is simply animal, but some animals reason inasmuch as they are
              also men. Similarly, fire does not heat in so far as it is a body,
              but in so far as it is hot. The same is true of a celestial body.

              6. Before the advent of natural forms, dimensions are presupposed
              as existing in matter in a state of incomplete act, not of
              complete act. Consequently, they are first in the line of matter
              and of generation. Form, however, is first in the line of
              completion. Now, a thing acts in so far as it is completed and is
              an actual being, not in so far as it is in potency. As a being in
              potency it is merely passive. Hence, it does not follow from the
              fact that matter or dimensions pre-existing in matter are not
              active that form is likewise inactive. Instead, the opposite
              follows. It would follow, however, if these dimensions were not
              passive, that the form would not be passive. But, as the

              and passive powers given to creatures by God; and through their
              instrumentality natural effects are brought into existence. He
              writes in
              <i>The Trinity</i>: “Like a mother pregnant with her unborn
              infant, the world is pregnant with the causes of unborn things.”
              While explaining what he said above about seminal principles, he
              also called them “the powers and faculties” that are allotted to
              things.

              powers of celestial bodies, which are more noble than the active

              They are called seminal principles inasmuch as all effects are
              originally in their active causes in the manner of seeds. But if,
              as some hold, seminal principles are understood as being the
              beginnings of forms in first matter, inasmuch as first matter is
              in potency to all forms, then, even though this does not agree
              very much with the words of Augustine, it can be said that the
              simplicity of these principles, like the simplicity of first
              matter, is caused by their imperfection, and, because of it, they
              cannot be moved, just as first matter cannot be.

              causas caelestes reducere. Omne enim agens intendit assimilare
              sibi patiens, secundum quod potest; unde vis activa quae est in
              semine maris, intendit conceptum semper ducere ad sexum
              masculinum, qui perfectior est; unde sexus femineus accidit
              praeter intentionem naturae particularis agentis. Nisi ergo esset
              aliqua virtus quae intenderet femineum sexum, generatio feminae
              esset omnino a casu, sicut et aliorum monstrorum; et ideo dicitur,
              quod quamvis sit praeter intentionem naturae particularis, ratione
              cuius dicitur femina mas occasionatus, tamen de intentione est
              naturae universalis, quae est vis corporis caelestis, ut Avicenna
              dicit.

              9. Differentiation of the sexes must be attributed to celestial
              causes. Our reason for saying this is as follows: Every agent
              tends to form to its own likeness, as far as possible, that which
              is passive in its respect. Accordingly, the active principle in
              the male seed always tends toward the generation of a male
              offspring, which is more perfect than the female. From this it
              follows that conception of female offspring is something of an
              accident in the order of nature-in so far, at least, as it is not
              the result of the natural causality of the particular agent.
              Therefore, if there were no other natural influence at work
              tending toward the conception of female offspring, such conception
              would be wholly outside the design of nature, as is the case with
              what we call “monstrous” births. And so it is said that, although
              the conception of female offspring is not the natural result of
              the efficient causality of the particular nature at work—for which
              reason the female is sometimes spoken of as an “accidental
              male”—nevertheless, the conception of female offspring is the
              natural result of universal nature; that is, it is due to the
              influence of a heavenly body, as Avicenna suggests.

              Matter, however, can cause an impediment which will prevent both
              the celestial force and the particular nature from attaining their
              effect, namely, the production of a male. And so, sometimes, as a
              result of an improper disposition in matter, a female is conceived
              even when the celestial influence tends to the contrary; or the
              opposite may happen, and, despite the influence of the celestial
              body, a male will sometimes be conceived because the formative
              influence of the particular agent is strong enough to overcome the
              defect in the material. In the conception of twins, the matter is
              separated by the operation of nature; and one part of the matter
              yields to the active principle more than the other part does
              because of the latter’s deficiency. Consequently, in one part a
              female is generated, in the other, a male—independently of the
              dispositions of the celestial spheres one way or the other. The
              generation of a female twin, however, happens more often when a
              celestial body disposes to the female sex.

              perfect, it does not need a spiritual substance to perfect it as a

              body is a moved mover, it is the instrument of the spiritual
              substance moving it. Consequently, its motion is not that of a
              body alone but it is also the act of the spirit moving it.
              Therefore, its motion takes place, not only by reason of the body
              moved, but also by reason of the spirit moving it. Now, just as
              that celestial body is superior to a human body, so is that
              spiritual substance superior to a human spirit. Consequently, that

              talents for learning or exercising certain crafts. Hence, some
              become carpenters, others become doctors, and so forth. Now, this

              understand what is meant by
              <i>human acts.</i>
              Human acts, properly speaking, are those over which a man is
              master. A man, however, is the master of his acts through his will
              or free choice. Consequently, this question is concerned with the
              acts of the will and of free choice. There are, of course, other
              acts in man that do not lie under the command of his will, for
              example, the acts of his nutritive and generative powers. These
              acts lie under the influence of celestial forces, just as other
              physical acts do.

              reduced to any cause other than our own providence. As Augustine
              says, this seems to have been the position of Cicero. The
              position, however, is untenable; for, as proved in
              <i>The Soul</i>, our will is a moved mover. Consequently, its act

              For this reason, some have reduced all the acts of the will to the

              soul are material and, therefore, subject to the action of the
              heavenly bodies. The Philosopher, however, destroys this position
              by showing that the intellect is an immaterial power and that its
              action is not material. As he says in
              <i>The Generation of Animals</i>, if the actions of principles are
              immaterial, the principles themselves must be immaterial.
              Consequently, it is impossible for the actions of the will and
              intellect of themselves to be reduced to any material principles.

              Avicenna, therefore, declared that heavenly bodies were made, like

              actions of the soul are reduced to celestial souls as to their
              principles. Consequently, whatever will we have is caused by the
              will of a celestial soul. This position is consistent with his
              opinion on the end of man, which he holds to be the union of the
              human soul with a celestial soul or intelligence. For, since the
              perfection of the will is its end and its good—and this is its

              Faith, however, teaches that God is the direct end of man’s life,
              and that we will be beatified and enjoy the vision of God.
              Consequently, He alone can leave an impression on our will. Now,
              the order of what is moved should correspond to the order of the
              movers. But in our ordination to our end, with which providence is
              concerned, the first thing that is in us is our will; and the
              characters of the good and of an end primarily pertain to the
              will, which uses everything we have as instruments toward
              achieving our end. However, in a certain respect the intellect
              precedes the will, and is, moreover, more closely related to it
              than our bodily powers are. Consequently, God alone, who is the
              first provider in all respects, leaves His imprint on our will;
              the angels, who follow Him in the order of causes, leave their
              imprint on our intellect in so far as we are enlightened,
              cleansed, and perfected by them, as Dionysius says. But the
              celestial bodies, which are inferior agents, can leave their
              imprint only upon our sensible powers and the other powers in our
              organs. Of course, inasmuch as the movement of one power of the
              soul flows over into another, it happens that the impression made
              by a celestial body will, as it were, accidentally flow over into
              the intellect and finally into the will. Similarly, the impression
              made by an angel upon our intellect also accidentally flows over
              into our will.

              Sed tamen quantum ad hoc diversa est dispositio intellectus et

              nisi sit contraria dispositio ex parte mobilis, sicut appetitus
              sensitivus non est naturaliter motivus voluntatis, sed e converso;
              quia appetitus superior movet appetitum inferiorem, sicut sphaera
              sphaeram, ut dicitur in III de anima. Et quantumcumque appetitus
              inferior perturbetur per aliquam passionem ut irae vel
              concupiscentiae, non oportet quod voluntas perturbetur; immo habet
              potentiam repellendi huiusmodi perturbationem, ut dicitur Genes.
              IV, 7: subter te erit appetitus tuus. Et ideo ex corporibus
              caelestibus non inducitur aliqua necessitas, nec ex parte
              recipientium nec ex parte agentium, in actibus humanis; sed
              inclinatio sola, quam etiam voluntas repellere potest per virtutem
              acquisitam vel infusam.

              But the relation of the intellect and of the will to the sensitive
              powers is different in the following respect: the intellect is
              naturally moved by the sensitive apprehension in the way in which
              a potency is moved by an object, because, as is said in
              <i>The Soul</i>, the phantasm is related to the possible intellect
              as color is to sight. Consequently, whenever an interior sensitive
              power is disturbed, the intellect is necessarily also disturbed.
              We see, for example, that when the organ of the imagination is
              injured the action of the intellect is necessarily impeded. By
              this means, therefore, the action or influence of a celestial body
              can flow over into the intellect with a kind of necessity; but
              this influence is accidental, because what it directly influences
              is the body. I say necessity” flows over—unless there is a
              contrary disposition in what is affected. But the sensitive
              appetite is not the natural mover of the will. Instead, the
              opposite is true, because, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>, a higher
              appetite moves a lower “as one sphere” moves another. And no
              matter how much a lower appetite is troubled by the passion, as of
              anger or of concupiscence, the will need not be disturbed. Indeed,
              the will has the power to repel a disturbance of this kind; for,
              as we read in Genesis (4:7): “The lust thereof shall be under
              thee.” Consequently, no necessity is introduced into human acts by
              the influence of celestial bodies, either by the celestial bodies
              themselves or by those things which receive their influence. The
              celestial bodies introduce only an inclination, which the will can
              resist by means of an acquired or infused power.

              2. From what was said above, it is clear that an act of the will
              in the soul does not necessarily follow the disposition of the
              body. From the temperament of the body, only an inclination arises
              to those things which are the object of the will.

              3. That argument would proceed correctly if a heavenly body could
              leave its impression on the essence of the soul directly. But the
              influence of a heavenly body reaches to the essence of the soul
              only indirectly, that is, only in so far as the soul is united to
              a body, whose act the soul is. The will, however, does not have
              its origin in the essence of the soul in so far as the soul is
              joined to a body. Consequently, the argument proves nothing.

              nisi per accidens, scilicet corpore mediante. Sed in corpus

              4. An instrument of a spiritual agent acts through a spiritual
              power only as it acts through its own material power. Because of
              its material power, however, a heavenly body can act upon our
              bodies only. Consequently, the action that arises from its
              spiritual power can arrive at the soul only indirectly, that is,
              through the mediation of man’s body. However, the material and
              spiritual power of a heavenly body can influence man’s body
              directly. Because of its material power it moves elementary
              qualities, such as hot, cold, and so forth; and because of its
              spiritual power it moves to species and to those effects following
              the entire species which cannot be reduced to elementary
              qualities.

              which are not caused by heat or cold, such as the attraction of
              iron by a magnet. In this way some disposition is left in a human
              body by a celestial body; and by reason of this disposition the
              soul that is joined to such a body is inclined to this or that

              7. For the most part, a large group follows its natural
              inclinations, for, as members of a group, men give in to the

              overcome these passions and inclinations. Consequently, it is more
              probable that a large group will do what a celestial body inclines
              it to do than that one individual will; for he may use his reason
              to overcome this inclination. Similarly, if there is a large group
              of hot-tempered men, it is unlikely that they will not be angered,
              although it is more likely that an individual will not.
