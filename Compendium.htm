                To restore man, who had been laid low by sin, to the heights of
                divine glory, the Word of the eternal Father, though containing
                all things within His immensity, willed to become small. This He
                did, not by putting aside His greatness, but by taking to
                Himself our littleness. No one can say that he is unable to
                grasp the teaching of heavenly wisdom; what the Word taught at
                great length, although clearly, throughout the various volumes
                of Sacred Scripture for those who have leisure to study, He has
                reduced to brief compass for the sake of those whose time is
                taken up with the cares of daily life. Man’s salvation consists
                in knowing the truth, so that the human mind may not be confused
                by divers errors; in making for the right goal, so that man may
                not fall away from true happiness by pursuing wrong ends; and in
                carrying out the law of justice, so that he may not besmirch
                himself with a multitude of vices.

                    Cognitionem autem veritatis humanae saluti necessariam
                    brevibus et paucis fidei articulis comprehendit. Hinc est
                    quod apostolus ad Roman. IX, 28, dicit: verbum abbreviatum
                    faciet Deus super terram. Et hoc quidem est verbum fidei,
                    quod praedicamus. Intentionem humanam brevi oratione
                    rectificavit: in qua dum nos orare docuit, quomodo nostra
                    intentio et spes tendere debet, ostendit. Humanam iustitiam
                    quae in legis observatione consistit, uno praecepto
                    caritatis consummavit. Plenitudo enim legis est dilectio.
                    Unde apostolus, I Cor. XIII, 13, in fide, spe et caritate,
                    quasi in quibusdam salutis nostrae compendiosis capitulis,
                    totam praesentis vitae perfectionem consistere docuit,
                    dicens: nunc autem manent fides, spes, caritas. Unde haec
                    tria sunt, ut beatus Augustinus dicit, quibus colitur Deus.

                    Knowledge of the truth necessary for man’s salvation is
                    comprised within a few brief articles of faith. The Apostle
                    says in Romans 9:2 8: “A short word shall the Lord make upon
                    the earth”; and later he adds: “This is the word of faith,
                    which we preach” (Rom. 15:8). In a short prayer Christ
                    clearly marked out man’s right course; and in teaching us to
                    say this prayer, He showed us the goal of our striving and
                    our hope. In a single precept of charity He summed up that
                    human justice which consists in observing the law: “Love
                    therefore is the fulfilling of the law” (Rom. 13:15). Hence
                    the Apostle, in 1 Corinthians 13:13, taught that the whole
                    perfection of this present life consists in faith, hope, and
                    charity, as in certain brief headings outlining our
                    salvation: “Now there remain faith, hope, and charity.”
                    These are the three virtues, as St. Augustine says, by which
                    God is worshiped [ <i>De doctrina christiana</i>, 1, 35]

                        statuatur; nec hoc esse potest, si veritatis agnitio
                        desit. Primo igitur necessaria est fides, per quam

                        Wherefore, my dearest son Reginald, receive from my
                        hands this compendious treatise on Christian teaching to
                        keep continually before your eyes. My whole endeavor in
                        the present work is taken up with these three virtues. I
                        shall treat first of faith, then of hope, and lastly of
                        charity. This is the Apostle’s arrangement which, for
                        that matter, right reason imposes. Love cannot be
                        rightly ordered unless the proper goal of our hope is
                        established; nor can there be any hope if knowledge of
                        the truth is lacking. Therefore the first thing
                        necessary is faith, by which you may come to a knowledge
                        of the truth. Secondly, hope is necessary, that your
                        intention may be fixed on the right end. Thirdly, love
                        is necessary, that your affections may be perfectly put
                        in order.

                    Fides autem praelibatio quaedam est illius cognitionis quae
                    nos in futuro beatos facit. Unde et apostolus dicit quod est
                    substantia sperandarum rerum: quasi iam in nobis sperandas
                    res, idest futuram beatitudinem, per modum cuiusdam
                    inchoationis subsistere faciens. Illam autem beatificantem
                    cognitionem circa duo cognita dominus consistere docuit,
                    scilicet circa divinitatem Trinitatis, et humanitatem
                    Christi; unde ad patrem loquens, dicit: haec est vita
                    aeterna, ut cognoscant te Deum verum, et quem misisti Iesum
                    Christum. Circa haec ergo duo tota fidei cognitio versatur:
                    scilicet circa divinitatem Trinitatis, et humanitatem
                    Christi. Nec mirum: quia Christi humanitas via est qua ad
                    divinitatem pervenitur. Oportet igitur et in via viam
                    cognoscere, per quam possit perveniri ad finem; et in patria
                    Dei gratiarum actio sufficiens non esset, nisi viae, per
                    quam salvati sunt, cognitionem haberent. Hinc est quod
                    dominus discipulis dixit: et quo ego vado scitis, et viam
                    scitis.

                    Faith is a certain foretaste of that knowledge which is to
                    make us happy in the life to come. The Apostle says, in
                    Hebrews 11:1, that faith is “the substance of things to be
                    hoped for,” as though implying that faith is already, in
                    some preliminary way, inaugurating in us the things that are
                    to be hoped for, that is, future beatitude. Our that this
                    beatific knowledge has to do with Lord has taught us two
                    truths, namely, the divinity of the Blessed Trinity and the
                    humanity of Christ. That is why, addressing the Father, He
                    says: “This is eternal life: that they may know You, the
                    only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom You sent” (John 17:3).
                    All the knowledge imparted by faith turns about these two
                    points, the divinity of the Trinity and the humanity of
                    Christ. This should cause us no surprise: the humanity of
                    Christ is the way by which we come to the divinity.
                    Therefore, while we are still wayfarers, we ought to know
                    the road leading to our goal. In the heavenly fatherland
                    adequate thanks would not be rendered to God if men had no
                    knowledge of the way by which they are saved. This is the
                    meaning of our Lord’s words to His disciples: “And where I
                    go you know, and the way you know” (John 14:4).

                Regarding the unity of the divine essence, we must first believe
                that God exists. This is a truth clearly known by reason. We
                observe that all things that move are moved by other things, the
                lower by the higher. The elements are moved by heavenly bodies;
                and among the elements themselves, the stronger moves the
                weaker; and even among the heavenly bodies, the lower are set in
                motion by the higher. This process cannot be traced back into
                infinity. For everything that is moved by another is a sort of
                instrument of the first mover. Therefore, if a first mover is
                lacking, all things that move will be instruments. But if the
                series of movers and things moved is infinite, there can be no
                first mover. In such a case, these infinitely many movers and
                things moved will all be instruments. But even the unlearned
                perceive how ridiculous it is to suppose that instruments are
                moved, unless they are set in motion by some principal agent.
                This would be like fancying that, when a chest or a bed is being
                built, the saw or the hatchet performs its functions without the
                carpenter. Accordingly there must be a first mover that is above
                all the the rest; and this being we call God.

                Ex hoc apparet quod necesse est Deum moventem omnia, immobilem

                ipsum vel a se ipso, vel ab alio moveri. Ab alio quidem moveri
                non potest: oporteret enim esse aliquid movens prius eo; quod
                est contra rationem primi moventis. A se ipso autem si movetur,
                hoc potest esse dupliciter. Vel quod secundum idem sit movens et
                motum; aut ita quod secundum aliquid sui sit movens, et secundum
                aliquid motum. Horum quidem primum esse non potest. Cum enim

                autem movet, sit in actu; si secundum idem esset movens et

                actu; quod est impossibile. Secundum etiam esse non potest. Si
                enim esset aliquod movens, et alterum motum, non esset ipsum
                secundum se primum movens, sed ratione suae partis quae movet.
                Quod autem est per se, prius est eo quod non est per se. Non
                potest igitur primum movens esse, si ratione suae partis hoc ei
                conveniat. Oportet igitur primum movens omnino immobile esse.

                We clearly infer from this that God, who moves all things, must
                Himself be immovable. If He, being the first mover, were Himself
                moved, He would have to be moved either by Himself or by
                another. He cannot be moved by another, for then there would
                have to be some mover prior to Him, which is against the very
                idea of a first mover. If He is moved by Himself, this can be
                conceived in two ways: either that He is mover and moved
                according to the same respect, or that He is a mover according
                to one aspect of Him and is moved according to another aspect.
                The first of these alternatives is ruled out. For everything
                that is moved is, to that extent, in potency, and whatever moves
                is in act. Therefore if God is both mover and moved according to
                the same respect, He has to be in potency and in act according
                to the same respect, which is impossible. The second alternative
                is likewise out of the question. If one part were moving and
                another were moved, there would be no first mover Himself as
                such, but only by reason of that part of Him which moves. But
                what is <i>per se</i> is prior to that which is not
                <i>per se</i>. Hence there cannot be a first mover at all, if
                this perfection is attributed to a being by reason of a part of
                that being. Accordingly the first mover must be altogether
                immovable.

                    Among things that are moved and that also move, the
                    following may also be considered. All motion is observed to
                    proceed from something immobile, that is, from something
                    that is not moved according to the particular species of
                    motion in question, Thus we see that alterations and
                    generations and corruptions occurring in lower bodies are
                    reduced, as to their first mover, to a heavenly body that is
                    not moved according to this species of motion, since it is
                    incapable of being generated, and is incorruptible and
                    unalterable. Therefore the first principle of all motion
                    must be absolutely immobile.

                The same line of reasoning clearly shows that God necessarily

                not being, is mutable. But God is absolutely immutable, as has
                been demonstrated. Therefore it is impossible for God to be and
                not to be. But anything that exists in such a way that it is
                impossible for it not to exist, is necessarily Being itself,
                <i>ipsum esse</i>. Necessary existence, and impossibility of
                nonexistence, mean one and the same thing. Therefore God must

                    Moreover, everything that has a possibility of being and of
                    not being, needs something else to make it be, for, as far
                    as it itself is concerned, it is indifferent with regard to
                    either alternative. But that which causes another thing to
                    be, is prior to that thing. Hence something exists prior to
                    that which has the possibility of being and of not being.
                    However, nothing is prior to God. Therefore it is impossible
                    for Him to be and not to be; of necessity, He must be. And
                    since there are some necessary things that have a cause of
                    their necessity, a cause that must be prior to them, God,
                    who is the first of all, has no cause of His own necessity.
                    Therefore it is necessary for God to be through Himself.

                From all this it is evident that God exists always. For whatever
                necessarily exists, always exists; it is impossible for a thing
                that has no possibility of not being, not to be. Hence such a
                thing is never without existence. But it is necessary for God to
                be, as has been shown.” Therefore God exists always.

                    Again, nothing begins to be or ceases to be except through
                    motion or change. But God is absolutely immutable, as has
                    been proved. Therefore it is impossible for Him ever to have
                    begun to be or to cease to be.

                        Likewise, if anything that has not always existed begins
                        to be, it needs some cause for its existence. Nothing
                        brings itself forth from potency to act or from
                        non-being to being. But God can have no cause of His
                        being, since He is the first Being; a cause is prior to
                        what is caused. Of necessity, therefore, God must always
                        have existed.

                            pertains to him of himself. But existence does not
                            come to God from any external cause, since such a
                            cause would have to be prior to Him. Therefore God
                            has existence of Himself, <i>per se ipsum</i>. But

                Per hoc autem manifestum est quod in Deo non est aliqua
                successio; sed eius esse totum est simul. Successio enim non
                invenitur nisi in illis quae sunt aliqualiter motui subiecta;
                prius enim et posterius in motu causant temporis successionem.
                Deus autem nullo modo est motui subiectus, ut ostensum est. Non

                Clearly, therefore, no succession occurs in God. His entire
                existence is simultaneous. Succession is not found except in
                things that are in some way subject to motion; for prior and
                posterior in motion cause the succession of time. God, however,
                is in no sense subject to motion, as has been shown. Accordingly
                there is no succession in God. His existence is simultaneously
                whole.

                    futurum expectatur. Deo autem nihil deperit nec accrescit,

                    Again, if a being’s existence is not simultaneously whole,
                    something can be lost to it and something can accrue to it.
                    That which passes is lost, and what is expected in the
                    future can be acquired. But nothing is lost to God or
                    accrues to Him, since He is immutable. Therefore His
                    existence is simultaneously whole.

                        esse est totum simul; secundum quod Boetius dicit, quod

                        exists, in such a way that its existence is
                        simultaneously whole. This agrees with the definition
                        proposed by Boethius: “Eternity is the simultaneously

                A similar course of reasoning clearly shows that the first mover
                must be simple. For any composite being must contain two factors
                that are related to each other as potency to act. But in the
                first mover, which is altogether immobile, all combination of
                potency and act is impossible, because whatever is in potency
                is, by that very fact, movable. Accordingly the first mover
                cannot be composite.

                  <td>
                    Moreover, something has to exist prior to any composite,
                    since composing elements are by their very nature antecedent
                    to a composite. Hence the first of all beings cannot be
                    composite. Even within the order of composite beings we
                    observe that the simpler things have priority. Thus elements
                    are naturally prior to mixed bodies. Likewise, among the
                    elements themselves, the first is fire, which is the
                    simplest of all. Prior to all elements is the heavenly body,
                    which has a simpler construction, since it is free from all
                    contrariety. Hence the truth remains that the first of
                    beings must be absolutely simple.

                The further conclusion follows that God is His own essence. The
                essence of anything is that which its definition signifies. This
                is identical with the thing of which it is the definition,
                unless <i>per accidens</i> something is added to the thing
                defined over and above its definition. Thus whiteness is added
                to man, over and above the fact that he is a rational and mortal
                animal. Hence rational and mortal animal is the same as man; but
                whiteness, so far as it is white, is not the same as man. In any
                being, therefore, in which there are not found two factors
                whereof one is <i>per se</i> and the other <i>per accidens</i>,
                its essence must be altogether identical with it. In God,
                however, since He is simple, as has been shown, there are not
                found two factors whereof one is <i>per se</i> and the other
                <i>per accidens</i>. Therefore His essence must be absolutely
                the same as He Himself.

                God’s essence cannot be other than His existence. In any being
                whose essence is distinct from its existence, what it is must be
                distinct from that whereby it is. For in virtue of a thing’s
                existence we say that it is, and in virtue of its essence we say
                what it is. This is why a definition that signifies an essence
                manifests what a thing is. In God, however, there is no
                distinction between what He is and that whereby He is, since
                there is no composition in Him, as has been shown. Therefore
                God’s essence is nothing else than His existence.

                    Likewise, we have proved that God is pure act without any
                    admixture of potentiality. Accordingly His essence must be
                    the ultimate act in Him; for any act that has a bearing on
                    the ultimate act, is in potency to that ultimate act. But
                    the ultimate act is existence itself, <i>ipsum esse</i>.
                    For, since all motion is an issuing forth from potency to
                    act, the ultimate act must be that toward which all motion
                    tends; and since natural motion tends to what is naturally
                    desired, the ultimate act must be that which all desire.
                    This is existence. Consequently the divine essence, which is
                    pure and ultimate act, must be existence itself,
                    <i>ipsum esse</i>.

                We infer from the above that God is not contained as a species
                within any genus. Species is constituted by specific difference
                added to genus. Hence the essence of any species possesses
                something over and above its genus. But existence itself,
                <i>ipsum esse</i>, which is God’s essence, does not comprise
                within itself any factor that is added to some other factor.
                Accordingly God is not a species of any genus.

                    Furthermore, since genus potentially contains specific

                    shown that God is pure act without any commingling of
                    potency. (Cf. chap. 9.) Therefore His essence is not
                    composed of genus and differences; and so He is not in any

                    share in existence, since non-being is not the specific
                    difference of anything. Accordingly God cannot be a genus

                        in a subject. Thus whiteness, if it were to subsist
                        without a subject, would not be more than one. But the
                        divine essence is very existence, <i>ipsum esse</i>,
                        which does not admit of specific differences, as we have
                        shown. Since, therefore, the divine existence is a
                        quasi-form subsisting by itself, seeing that God is His
                        existence, the divine essence cannot be more than one.
                        Accordingly a plurality of gods is impossible.

                It is evident, further, that God Himself cannot be a body. For
                in every body some composition is found, since a body has parts.
                Hence that which is absolutely simple cannot be a body.

                God cannot be the form of a body or any kind of force existing
                in a body. For, since all bodies are found to be mobile,
                whatever is present in a body must be moved, at least
                <i>per accidens</i> or concomitantly, if the body itself is

                <i>per se</i> or <i>per accidens</i>, for it must be absolutely
                immobile, as has been shown. Therefore God cannot be a body or a

                    Again, in order to move an object, every mover must have
                    dominion over the thing that is moved. For we observe that
                    motion is more rapid in proportion as the motive force
                    exceeds the resisting force of the mobile object. Therefore
                    that which is the very first among all movers, must
                    predominate supremely over all the things moved. But this
                    would be impossible if the mover were in any way attached to
                    the mobile object, as it would have to be if it were the
                    form or motive power of the latter. Consequently the first
                    mover cannot be a body or a force in a body or a form in a
                    body. This is why Anaxagoras postulated an intelligence

                igitur primum movens est actus absque potentiae permixtione,

              <td>
                This leads to the question of God’s infinity. God is not
                infinite by way of privation, according to which infinity is a
                passion of quantity; in this sense whatever lacks limits, but is
                nevertheless capable of having limits by reason of its genus, is
                said to be infinite. Rather, God is infinite negatively, in the
                sense that a being that is unlimited in every way is infinite.
                No act is found to be limited except by a potency that is
                receptive of the act; thus we observe that forms are limited in
                accordance with the potency of matter. Hence, if the first mover
                is an act without any admixture of potency, as not being the
                form of any body or a force inhering in a body, it must be
                infinite.

                    maiora inveniuntur. Inter elementa enim quae sunt superiora,
                    maiora quantitative inveniuntur, sicut etiam in
                    simplicitate; quod eorum generatio demonstrat, cum
                    multiplicata proportione ignis ex aere generetur, aer ex
                    aqua, aqua autem ex terra. Corpus autem caeleste manifeste
                    apparet totam quantitatem elementorum excedere. Oportet
                    igitur id quod inter omnia entia primum est, et eo non
                    potest esse aliud prius, infinitae quantitatis suo modo

                    The very order perceived in things is a proof of this. The
                    higher the position occupied in the scale of being, the
                    greater are things found to be in their own way. Among the
                    elements, nobler things are found to be greater in quantity,
                    as also in simplicity. Their generation demonstrates this:
                    as the proportion of the respective elements is increased,
                    fire is generated from air, air from water, and water from
                    earth. And a heavenly body clearly exceeds the total
                    quantity of the elements. Necessarily, therefore, that which
                    is the first among beings and which has nothing above it,
                    must in its own fashion be of infinite quantity.

                The further inference is drawn that God is infinite in power.
                For power is consequent upon a thing’s essence; anything
                whatever possesses a power of activity consonant with its manner
                of being. Therefore, if God is infinite in His essence, His

                    Hoc etiam apparet, si quis rerum ordinem diligenter
                    inspiciat. Nam unumquodque quod est in potentia, secundum
                    hoc habet virtutem receptivam et passivam; secundum vero
                    quod actu est, habet virtutem activam. Quod igitur est in
                    potentia tantum, scilicet materia prima, habet virtutem
                    infinitam ad recipiendum, nihil de virtute activa
                    participans; et supra ipsam quanto aliquid formalius est,
                    tanto id abundat in virtute agendi: propter quod ignis inter
                    omnia elementa est maxime activus. Deus igitur, qui est
                    actus purus, nihil potentialitatis permixtum habens, in
                    infinitum abundat in virtute activa super alia.

                    This is clear to anyone who will inspect the order of
                    things. Whatever is in potency, is thereby endowed with
                    receptive and passive power; and so far as a thing is in
                    act, it possesses active power. Hence what is exclusively in
                    potency, namely, prime matter, has an unlimited power of
                    receptivity, but has no part in active power. And in the
                    scale of being above matter, the more a thing has of form,
                    the more it abounds in the power of acting. This is why fire
                    is the most active of all the elements. Therefore God, who
                    is pure act without any admixture of potency, infinitely
                    abounds in active power above all things.

                perfectionem in ipso demonstrat. Infinitum enim quod est in
                quantitatibus ad materiam pertinet, prout fine privatur.
                Imperfectio autem accidit rei secundum quod materia sub
                privatione invenitur; perfectio autem omnis ex forma est. Cum
                igitur Deus ex hoc infinitus sit quod tantum forma vel actus
                est, nullam materiae vel potentialitatis permixtionem habens,
                sua infinitas ad summam perfectionem ipsius pertinet.

                Although the infinity discerned in quantities is imperfect, the
                infinity predicated of God indicates supreme perfection in Him.
                The infinity that is in quantities pertains to matter, in the
                sense that matter lacks limits. Imperfection occurs in a thing
                for the reason that matter is found in a state of privation. On
                the other hand, perfection comes exclusively from form.
                Consequently, since God is infinite because He is exclusively
                form or act and has no admixture of matter or potentiality, His
                infinity pertains to His supreme perfection.

                    Hoc etiam ex rebus aliis considerari potest. Nam licet in

                    prius sit aliquid imperfectum quam perfectum, sicut prius

                    perfecto trahat originem: non enim oritur puer nisi ex viro,
                    nec semen nisi ex animali vel planta. Illud igitur quod est

                    This can also be gathered from a consideration of other
                    things. Although in one and the same being that evolves from
                    imperfect to perfect, something imperfect precedes the
                    perfect stage, as, for example, the boy is prior to the man,
                    everything imperfect must derive its origin from what is
                    perfect. The child is not begotten except by a man and the
                    seed does not receive existence except from an animal or a
                    plant. Accordingly that which is by nature prior to all
                    other things and sets them all in motion, must be more
                    perfect than all the rest.

                esse. Nam omne quod movet aliquid ad perfectionem, prius habet
                in se perfectionem ad quam movet, sicut magister prius habet in
                se doctrinam quam aliis tradit. Cum igitur Deus sit primum

                The further inference clearly follows that all perfections found
                in anything at all must originally and superabundantly be
                present in God. Whatever moves something toward perfection, must
                first possess in itself the perfection it confers on others.
                Thus a teacher has in his own mind the knowledge he hands on to
                others. Therefore, since God is the first mover, and moves all
                other beings toward their perfections, all perfections found in
                things must pre-exist in Him superabundantly.

                    essentiae: nam oportet quod ultima differentia per quam in

                    speciem notificans, definitio vel finis dicitur. Si ergo
                    divina essentia infinita est, impossibile est quod alicuius

                    Besides, whatever has a particular perfection but lacks
                    another perfection, is contained under some genus or
                    species. For each thing is classed under a genus or a
                    species by its form, which is the thing’s perfection. But
                    what is placed under species and genus cannot be infinite in
                    essence; for the ultimate difference whereby it is placed in
                    a species necessarily closes off its essence. Hence the very
                    ratio or description that makes a species known is called
                    its definition, or even <i>finis</i>. Therefore, if the
                    divine essence is infinite, it cannot possess merely the
                    perfection of some genus or species and be lacking in other
                    perfections; the perfections of all genera or species must

                If we gather together the various points established thus far,

                simplicity, there can be no distinction among the perfections
                that are present. Hence, if the perfections of all things are in
                God, they cannot be distinct in Him. Accordingly they are all
                one in Him.

                    This will become evident to anyone who reflects on our
                    cognitive powers. A higher faculty has a unified knowledge
                    of all that is known through the lower faculties according
                    to diverse aspects. All that the sight, the hearing, and the
                    other senses perceive, the intellect judges with the one,
                    simple power that belongs to it. Something similar appears
                    in the sciences. The lower sciences are multiplied in accord
                    with the various classes of beings that constitute their
                    objects. Yet one science which holds the primacy among them
                    is interested in all classes of beings. This is known as
                    first philosophy. The same situation is observed in civil
                    power; in the royal power, which is but one, are included
                    all the powers that are distributed through various offices
                    within the jurisdiction of the kingdom. In the same way
                    perfections, which in lower things are multiplied according
                    to the diversity of these things, must be united in the
                    pinnacle of being, that is, in God.

                It is also clear that there can be no accident in God. If all

                all identical with His essence. Therefore none of these

                    Furthermore, a being to whose perfection something can be
                    added, cannot be infinite in perfection. But if a being has
                    some perfection that is an accident, a perfection can be
                    added to its essence, since every accident is super-added to
                    essence. Hence infinite perfection will not be found in its
                    essence. But, as we have shown, God is of infinite
                    perfection according to essence. Consequently there can be

                        the first among beings. For some sort of composition
                        obtains between an accident and its subject. Likewise,
                        that which is a subject of this kind cannot be pure act,
                        since an accident is a certain, form or act of the

                sufficiat, in eius cognitionem consurgit ex rebus quae apud nos
                sunt, in quibus inveniuntur diversae perfectiones, quarum omnium
                radix et origo in Deo una est, ut ostensum est. Et quia non
                possumus aliquid nominare nisi secundum quod intelligimus (sunt
                enim nomina intellectuum signa), Deum non possumus nominare nisi
                ex perfectionibus in aliis rebus inventis, quarum origo in ipso
                est: et quia hae in rebus istis multiplices sunt, oportet multa
                nomina Deo imponere. Si autem essentiam eius in se ipsa
                videremus, non requireretur nominum multitudo, sed esset simplex
                notitia eius, sicut est simplex essentia eius: et hoc in die
                gloriae nostrae expectamus, secundum illud Zachar. ultimo: in
                illa die erit dominus unus, et nomen eius unum.

                This enables us to perceive the reason for the many names that
                are applied to God, even though in Himself He is absolutely
                simple. Since our intellect is unable to grasp His essence as it
                is in itself, we rise to a knowledge of that essence from the
                things that surround us. Various perfections are discerned in
                these things, the root and origin of them all being one in God,
                as has been shown. Since we cannot name an object except as we
                understand it (for names are signs of things understood), we
                cannot give names to God except in terms of perfections
                perceived in other things that have their origin in Him. And
                since these perfections are multiple in such things, we must
                assign many names to God. If we saw His essence as it is in
                itself, a multiplicity of names would not be required; our idea
                of it would be simple, just as His essence is simple. This
                vision we hope for in the day of our glory; for, according to
                Zacharias 14:9, “In that day there shall be one Lord, and His
                name shall be one.”

                Ex his autem tria possumus considerare. Quorum primum est, quod
                diversa nomina, licet idem in Deo secundum rem significent, non
                tamen sunt synonima. Ad hoc enim quod nomina aliqua sint
                synonima, oportet quod significent eamdem rem, et eamdem
                intellectus conceptionem repraesentent. Ubi vero significatur
                eadem res secundum diversas rationes, idest apprehensiones quas
                habet intellectus de re illa, non sunt nomina synonima, quia non
                est penitus significatio eadem, cum nomina immediate significent
                conceptiones intellectus, quae sunt rerum similitudines. Et ideo
                cum diversa nomina dicta de Deo significent diversas
                conceptiones quas intellectus noster habet de ipso non sunt
                synonima, licet omnino eamdem rem significent.
              </td>
              <td>
                In this connection three observations are in order. The first is
                that the various names applied to God are not synonymous, even
                though they signify what is in reality the same thing in God. In
                order to be synonymous, names must signify the same thing, and
                besides must stand for the same intellectual. conception. But
                when the same object is signified according to diverse aspects,
                that is, notions which the mind forms of that object, the names
                are not synonymous. For then the meaning is not quite the same,
                since names directly signify intellectual conceptions, which are
                likenesses of things. Therefore, since the various names
                predicated of God signify the various conceptions our mind forms
                of Him, they are not synonymous, even though they signify
                absolutely the same thing.

                Secundum est: quod cum intellectus noster secundum nullam earum
                conceptionum quas nomina dicta de Deo significant, divinam
                essentiam perfecte capiat, impossibile est quod per definitiones

                similiter in aliis.
              </td>
              <td>
                A second point is this: since our intellect does not adequately
                grasp the divine essence in any of the conceptions which the
                names applied to God signify, the definitions of these terms
                cannot define what is in God. That is, any definition we might
                formulate of the divine wisdom would not be a definition of the
                divine power, and so on regarding other attributes.

                    genere et differentiis constat: id etiam quod proprie
                    definitur, species est. Ostensum est autem, quod divina
                    essentia non concluditur sub aliquo genere, nec sub aliqua

                    The same is clear for another reason. A definition is made
                    up of genus and specific differences, for what is properly
                    defined is the species. But we have shown that the divine
                    essence is not included under any genus or species.
                    Therefore it cannot be defined.

                Tertium est quod nomina de Deo et aliis rebus dicta, non omnino

                possunt, cum definitio eius quod de creatura dicitur, non sit

                The third point is that names applied to God and to other beings
                are not predicated either quite univocally or quite equivocally.
                They cannot be predicated univocally, because the definition of
                what is said of a creature is not a definition of what is said
                of God. Things predicated univocally must have the same
                definition.

                    respectu ad rem aliam: unde per unum non potest ratiocinari
                    de alio. Haec autem nomina quae dicuntur de Deo et de aliis
                    rebus, attribuuntur Deo secundum aliquem ordinem quem habet

                    considerat; unde et per alias res ratiocinari de Deo
                    possumus. Non igitur omnino aequivoce dicuntur ista de Deo

                  <td>
                    Nor are these names predicated in all respects equivocally.
                    In the case of fortuitous equivocation, a name is attached
                    to an object that has no relation to another object bearing
                    the same name. Hence the reasoning in which we engage about
                    one cannot be transferred to the other. But the names
                    predicated of God and of other things are attributed to God
                    according to some relation He has to those things; and in
                    their case the mind ponders what the names signify. This is
                    why we can transfer our’ reasoning about other things to
                    God. Therefore such terms are not predicated altogether
                    equivocally about God and about other things, as happens in
                    fortuitous equivocation.

                        significatam per nomen, per prius dicuntur de Deo, a quo

                        Consequently they are predicated according to analogy,
                        that is, according to their proportion to one thing.
                        For, from the fact that we compare other things with God
                        as their first origin, we attribute to God such names as
                        signify perfections in other things. This clearly brings
                        out the truth that, as regards the assigning of the
                        names, such names are primarily predicated of creatures,
                        inasmuch as the intellect that assigns the names ascends
                        from creatures to God. But as regards the thing
                        signified by the name, they are primarily predicated of
                        God, from whom the perfections descend to other beings.

                    Moreover, we pointed out above that God is pure act without
                    any admixture of potentiality. On the other hand, matter is
                    being in potency. Consequently God must be utterly free from
                    matter. But freedom from matter ii the cause of
                    intellectuality. An indication of this is that material
                    forms are rendered intelligible in act by being abstracted
                    from matter and from material conditions. Therefore God is
                    intelligent.

                Since in God nothing is in potency but all is in act, as has
                been shown. God cannot be intelligent either potentially or
                habitually but only actually. An evident consequence of this is
                that He undergoes no succession in understanding. The intellect
                that understands a number of things successively is able, while
                actually understanding one thing, to understand another only
                potentially. But there is no succession among things that exist
                simultaneously. So, if God understands nothing in potency, His
                understanding is free from all succession. Accordingly, whatever
                He understands, He understands simultaneously. Furthermore, He
                does not begin to understand anything. For the intellect that
                begins to understand something, was previously in potency to
                understanding.

                    It is likewise evident that God’s intellect does not
                    understand in discursive fashion, proceeding from one truth
                    to a knowledge of another, as is the case with our intellect
                    in reasoning. A discursive process of this sort takes place
                    in our intellect when we advance from the known to a
                    knowledge of the unknown, or to that which previously we had
                    not actually thought of. Such processes cannot occur in the

                    The reason is, that any intellect which understands through
                    a species other than itself, is related to that intelligible
                    species as potency to act. For an intelligible species is a
                    perfection of the intellect, causing it to understand in
                    act. Therefore, if nothing in God is in potency, but He is
                    pure act, He must understand through His own essence, and
                    not through any other kind of species.

                        In consequence of this, He directly and principally
                        understands Himself. For the essence of a thing does not
                        properly and directly lead to the knowledge of anything
                        else than of that being whose essence it is. Thus man is
                        properly known through the definition of man, and horse
                        is known through the definition of horse. Therefore, if
                        God understands through His essence, that which is
                        directly and principally understood by Him must be God
                        Himself. And, since God is His own essence, it follows
                        that, in Him, understanding and that whereby He
                        understands and that which is understood are absolutely

                God must be His own intelligence. Since “to understand” is
                second act, for example, to consider, whereas the corresponding
                first act is the intellect or knowledge, any intellect that is
                not its own understanding is related to its understanding as
                potency to act. For in the order of potencies and acts, what is
                first is always potential with respect to what follows, and what
                is last is perfective. This is true only with reference to one
                and the same being, for among different beings the converse
                obtains; thus a mover and an agent are related to the thing
                moved and actuated as act to potency. In God, however, who is
                pure act, there is nothing that is related to anything else as
                potency to act. Accordingly God must be His own intelligence.

                    Another consideration: among the various perfections of
                    things, the chief are intellect and will. A sign of this is
                    that they are found in the nobler beings. But the
                    perfections of all things are one in God, and this is His
                    essence, as we showed above.” In God, therefore, intellect
                    and will are identical with His essence.

                Hinc etiam patet quod voluntas divina est ipsum velle Dei.
                Ostensum est enim, quod voluntas in Deo est idem quod bonum
                volitum ab ipso. Hoc autem esse non posset, nisi velle esset

                Hence it is also clear that the divine will is the very act of
                willing in God. As has been pointed out, God’s will is identical
                with the good willed by Him. But this would be impossible if His
                willing were not the same as His will; for willing is in the
                will because of the object willed. Accordingly God’s will is His
                willing.

                    Item. Voluntas Dei idem est quod eius intellectus et eius
                    essentia. Intellectus autem Dei est suum intelligere, et
                    essentia est suum esse. Ergo oportet quod voluntas sit suum
                    velle. Et sic patet quod voluntas Dei simplicitati non
                    repugnat.
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    Again, God’s will is the same as His intellect and His
                    essence. But God’s intellect is His act of understanding,
                    and His essence is His existing. Therefore His will must be
                    His act of willing. And so we see clearly that God’s will is
                    not opposed to His simplicity.

                From all the details of doctrines thus far discussed, we can
                gather that God is one, simple, perfect, and infinite, and that
                He understands and wills. All these truths are assembled in a
                brief article of our Creed, wherein we profess to believe “in
                one God, almighty.” For, since this name “God” (<i>Deus</i>), is
                apparently derived from the Greek name <i>Theos</i>, which comes
                from <i>theasthai</i>, meaning to see or to consider, the very
                name of God makes it clear that He is intelligent and
                consequently that He wills. In proclaiming that He is one, we
                exclude a plurality of gods, and also all composition; for a
                thing is not simply one unless it is simple. The assertion that
                He is almighty is evidence of our belief that He possesses
                infinite power, from which nothing can be taken away. And this
                includes the further truth that He is infinite and perfect; for
                the power of a thing follows the perfection of its essence.

                The truths about God thus far proposed have been subtly
                discussed by a number of pagan philosophers, although some of
                them erred concerning these matters. And those who propounded
                true doctrine in this respect were scarcely able to arrive at
                such truths even after long and painstaking investigation. But
                there are other truths about God revealed to us in the teaching
                of the Christian religion, which were beyond the reach of the
                philosopher. These are truths about which we are instructed, in
                accord with the norm of Christian faith, in a way that
                transcends human perception. The teaching is this: although God
                is one and simple, as has been explained, God is Father, God is
                Son, and God is Holy Spirit. And these three are not three gods,
                but are one God. We now turn to a consideration of this truth,
                so far as is possible to us.

                Accipiendum autem est ex his quae supra dicta sunt, quod Deus se

                velle non sit aliud quam eius esse. Quia vero Deus se ipsum
                intelligit, omne autem intellectum in intelligente est, oportet
                Deum in se ipso esse sicut intellectum in intelligente.
                Intellectum autem prout est in intelligente, est verbum quoddam
                intellectus: hoc enim exteriori verbo significamus quod interius

                We take from the doctrine previously laid down that God
                understands and loves Himself; likewise, that understanding and
                willing in Him are not something distinct from His essence.
                Since God understands Himself, and since all that is understood
                is in the person who understands, God must be in Himself as the
                object understood is in the person understanding. But the object
                understood, so far as it is in the one who understands, is a
                certain word of the intellect; we signify by an exterior word
                what we comprehend interiorly in our intellect. For words,
                according to the Philosopher, are signs of intellectual concepts
                [De interpretatione, I, 1, 16 a 3]. Hence we must acknowledge in
                God the existence of His Word.

                What is contained in the intellect, as an interior word, is by

                them in species.

                    it were, the active principle, and the intellect the passive
                    principle. That which is thus comprehended by the intellect,

                    to the moving intelligible object, of which it is a certain

                But here a point of difference must be noted. What is conceived
                in the intellect is a likeness of the thing understood and
                represents its species; and so it seems to be a sort of
                offspring of the intellect. Therefore, when the intellect
                understands something other than itself, the thing understood
                is, so to speak, the father of the word conceived in the
                intellect, and the intellect itself resembles rather a mother,
                whose function is such that conception takes place in her. But
                when the intellect understands itself, the word conceived is
                related to the understanding person as offspring to father.
                Consequently, since we are using the term “Word” in the latter
                sense, that is, according as God understands Himself, the Word
                itself must be related to God, from whom the Word proceeds, as
                Son to Father.

                Hinc est quod in regula Catholicae fidei, patrem et filium in
                divinis confiteri docemur, cum dicitur: credo in Deum patrem et

                dicitur et filius, Ioannes Evangelista, cui revelata sunt
                secreta caelestia, loco filii ponit verbum, ut generationem

                Hence in the rule of Catholic faith we are taught to profess
                belief in the Father and Son in God by saying: “I believe in God
                the Father, and in His Son.” And lest anyone, on hearing Father
                and Son mentioned, should have any notion of carnal generation,
                by which among us men father and son receive their designation,
                John the Evangelist, to whom were revealed heavenly mysteries,
                substitutes “Word” for “Son,” (John 1: 14) so that we may
                understand that the generation is intellectual.

                Since natural existence and the action of understanding are
                distinct in us, we should note that a word conceived in our
                intellect, having only intellectual existence, differs in nature
                from our intellect, which has natural existence. In God,
                however, to be and to understand are identical. Therefore the
                divine Word that is in God, whose Word He is according to
                intellectual existence, has the same existence as God, whose
                Word He is. Consequently the Word must be of the same essence
                and nature as God Himself, and all attributes whatsoever that
                are predicated of God, must pertain also to the Word of God.

                Hence we are instructed in the rule of Catholic faith to profess
                that the Son is “consubstantial with the Father,” a phrase that
                excludes two errors. First, the Father and the Son may not be
                thought of according to carnal generation, which is effected by
                a certain separation of the son’s substance from the father. If
                this were so in God, the Son could not be consubstantial with
                the Father. Secondly, we are taught not to think of the Father
                and the Son according to intellectual generation in the way that
                a word is conceived in our mind. For such a word comes to our
                intellect by a sort of accidental accretion, and does not exist
                with the existence proper to the essence of the intellect.

                    eius fuit: et ideo in regula Catholicae fidei dicimus: ex

                    There can be no difference according to time. The divine
                    Word is present in God for the reason that God understands
                    Himself, thereby conceiving His intelligible Word. Hence, if
                    at any time there were no Word of God, during that period
                    God would not understand Himself. But God always understood
                    Himself during His whole existence, for His understanding is
                    His existence. Therefore His Word, also, existed always. And
                    so in the rule of Catholic faith we say that the Son of God
                    “is born of the Father before all ages.”

                        intelligat quam sit. Verbum autem perfectam speciem
                        habet: quia id cuius est verbum, perfecte intelligitur.

                        generationibus aequivocis: a sole enim non generatur
                        sol, sed quoddam animal. Ut ergo talis imperfectio a
                        generatione divina excludatur, confitemur natum Deum de
                        Deo. Alio modo quod procedit ex aliquo, differt ab eo
                        propter defectum puritatis, dum scilicet ab eo quod est
                        in se simplex et purum, per applicationem ad extraneam
                        materiam aliquid producitur a prima specie deficiens:
                        sicut ex domo quae est in mente artificis, fit domus
                        quae est in materia; et a lumine recepto in corpore
                        terminato, fit color; et ex igne adiuncto aliis
                        elementis, fit mixtum; et ex radio per oppositionem
                        corporis opaci, fit umbra. Ut hoc ergo a divina
                        generatione excludatur, additur lumen de lumine. Tertio
                        modo quod ex aliquo procedit, non consequitur speciem

                        recipit eius naturam, sed quamdam eius similitudinem
                        tantum, sicut imago in speculo vel sculptura, aut etiam
                        similitudo rei in intellectu vel sensu. Non enim imago
                        hominis dicitur verus homo, sed similitudo; nec lapis
                        est anima, ut dicit philosophus, sed species lapidis. Ut
                        igitur haec a divina generatione excludantur, additur:
                        Deum verum de Deo vero.

                      <td>
                        According to species, too, it is impossible for the Word
                        of God to differ from God, as though He were inferior;
                        for God does not understand Himself to be less than He
                        is. The Word has a perfect likeness to the Father,
                        because that whereof He is the Word is perfectly
                        understood. Therefore the Word of God must be absolutely
                        perfect according to the species of divinity. Some
                        beings, it is true, that proceed from others, are found
                        not to inherit the perfect species of those from whom
                        they proceed. One way in which this can happen is in
                        equivocal generations: the sun does not generate a sun,
                        but an animal of some kind. To exclude imperfection of
                        this sort from divine generation, we proclaim that the
                        Word is born “God of God.” The same thing occurs in
                        another way when that which proceeds from another
                        differs from the latter because of a defect in purity;
                        that is, when something is produced from what is simple
                        and pure in itself by being applied to extraneous
                        matter, and so turns out to be inferior to the original
                        species. Thus, from a house that is in the architect’s
                        mind, a house is fashioned in various materials; and
                        from light received in the surface of a body, color
                        results; and from fire, by adding other elements, a
                        mixture is produced; and from a beam of light, by
                        interposing an opaque body, shadow is caused. To exclude
                        any imperfection of this kind from divine generation, we
                        add: “Light of Light.” In yet a third way, what proceeds
                        from another can fail to equal the latter’s species,
                        because of a deficiency in truth. That is, it does not
                        truly receive the nature of its original, but only a
                        certain likeness thereof; for example, an image in a
                        mirror or in a picture or in a statue; also, the
                        likeness of a thing in the intellect or in one of the
                        senses. For the image of a man is not said to be a true
                        man, but is a likeness of a man; and a stone is not in
                        the soul, as the Philosopher notes [ <i>De anima</i>,
                        III, 8, 431 b 29], but a likeness of the stone is in the
                        soul. To exclude all this from divine generation, we
                        subjoin: “True God of true God.”

                            Lastly it is impossible for the Word to differ from
                            God according to nature, since it is natural for God
                            to understand Himself. Every intellect has some
                            objects which it naturally understands. Thus, our
                            intellect naturally understands first principles.
                            Much more does God, whose intellectual activity is
                            His existence, naturally understand Himself.
                            Therefore His Word proceeds from Him naturally, not
                            in the way that things proceed otherwise than by
                            natural origin, that is, not in the way that
                            artificial objects, which we are said to make, take
                            shape from us. On the other hand, whatever proceeds
                            from us naturally we are said to generate, for
                            example, a son. Accordingly, to preclude the error
                            of thinking that the Word of God proceeds from God,
                            not by way of nature, but by the power of His will,

                As the object known is in the knower, to the extent that it is
                known, so the beloved must be in the lover, as loved. The, lover
                is, in some way, moved by the beloved with a certain interior
                impulse. Therefore, since a mover is in contact with the object
                moved, the beloved must be intrinsic to the lover. But God, just
                as He understands Himself, must likewise love Himself; for good,
                as apprehended, is in itself lovable. Consequently God is in
                Himself as beloved in lover.

                Since the object known is in the knower and the beloved is in
                the lover, the different ways of existing in something must be
                considered in the two cases before us. The act of understanding
                takes place by a certain assimilation of the knower to the
                object known; and so the object known must be in the knower in
                the sense that a likeness of it is present in him. But the act
                of loving takes place through a sort of impulse engendered in
                the lover by the beloved: the beloved draws the lover to
                himself. Accordingly the act of loving reaches its perfection,
                not in a likeness of the beloved, in the way that the act of
                understanding reaches perfection in a likeness of the object
                understood, but in. a drawing of the lover to the beloved in
                person.

                    The transferring of the likeness of the original is effected

                    begetter is called father, and the begotten is called son.
                    Among such beings, moreover, the first motion occurs
                    conformably to the species. Therefore, as within the Godhead

                Another point to consider is this. Since good that is loved has
                the nature of an end, and since the motion of the will is
                designated good or evil in terms of the end it pursues, the love
                whereby the supreme good that is God is loved must possess the
                supereminent goodness that goes by the name of holiness. This is
                true whether “holy” is taken as equivalent to “pure,” according
                to the Greeks, the idea being that in God there is most pure
                goodness free from all defect, or whether “holy” is taken to
                mean “firm,” in the view of the Latins, on the score that in God
                there is unchangeable goodness. In either case, everything
                dedicated to God is called holy, such as a temple and the
                vessels of the temple and all objects consecrated to divine
                service. Rightly, then, the Spirit, who represents to us the
                love whereby God loves Himself, is called the Holy Spirit. For
                this reason the rule of Catholic faith proclaims that the Spirit
                is holy, in the clause, “I believe in the Holy Spirit.”

                Just as God’s understanding is His existence, so likewise is His
                love. Accordingly God does not love Himself by any act that is
                over and above His essence, but He loves Himself by His very
                essence. Since God loves Himself for the reason that He is in
                Himself as the beloved in the lover, God the beloved is not in
                God the lover in any accidental fashion, in the way that the
                objects of our love are in us who love them, that is,
                accidentally. No, God is substantially in Himself as beloved in
                lover. Therefore the Holy Spirit, who represents the divine love
                to us, is not something accidental in God, but subsists in the
                divine essence just as the Father and the Son do. And so in the
                rule of Catholic faith He is exhibited as no less worthy of
                adoration and glorification than the Father and the Son are.

                We should recall that the act of understanding proceeds from the
                intellectual power of the mind. When the intellect actually
                understands, the object it understands is in it. The presence of
                the object known in the knower results from the intellectual
                power of the mind, and is its word, as we said above. Likewise,
                what is loved is in the lover, when it is actually loved. The
                fact that an object is actually loved, results from the lover’s
                power to love and from the lovable good as actually known.
                Accordingly the presence of the beloved object in the lover is
                brought about by two factors: the appetitive principle and the
                intelligible object as apprehended, that is, the word conceived
                about the lovable object. Therefore, since the Word in God who
                knows and loves Himself is the Son, and since He to whom the
                Word belongs is the Father of the Word, as is clear from our
                exposition, the necessary consequence is that the Holy Spirit,
                who pertains to the love whereby God is in Himself as beloved in
                lover, proceeds from the Father and the Son. And so we say in
                the Creed: “Who proceeds from the Father and the Son.”

                We must conclude from all we have said that in the Godhead there
                is something threefold which is not opposed to the unity and
                simplicity of the divine essence. We must acknowledge that God
                is, as existing in His nature, and that He is known and loved by
                Himself.

                    But this occurs otherwise in God than in us. Man, to be
                    sure, is a substance in his nature; but his actions of
                    knowing and loving are not his substance. Considered in his
                    nature, man is indeed a subsisting thing; as he exists in
                    his mind, however, he is not a subsisting thing, but a
                    certain representation of a subsisting thing; and similarly
                    with regard to his existence in himself as beloved in lover.
                    Thus man may be regarded under three aspects: that is, man
                    existing in his nature, man existing in his intellect, and
                    man existing in his love. Yet these three are not one, for
                    man’s knowing is not his existing, and the same is true of
                    his loving. Only one of these three is a subsisting thing,
                    namely, man existing in his nature.

                        Holy Spirit.

                A certain contradiction, arising from truths previously
                established, seemingly makes its appearance at this point. If
                threefold personality is assumed in God, then, since number
                always follows division, some division will have to be
                acknowledged in God, whereby the three may be distinguished from
                one another. Thus supreme simplicity will be lacking in God. If
                three agree in some respect and differ in another, composition
                must be present; which is contrary to what was set forth above.”
                Again, if God must be strictly one, as was shown above, 118 and
                if one and the same thing cannot originate or proceed from
                itself, it seems impossible for God to be begotten or to
                proceed. Wrongly, therefore, the names of Father and of Son and
                of proceeding Spirit are given place in the Godhead.

                The principle for solving this difficulty must be derived from
                the fact that, among different classes of beings, the various
                ways in which one thing may arise or proceed from another,
                depend on the diversity of their natures. Among lifeless beings,
                which do not move themselves and are capable of being moved only
                from outside, one thing arises from another by being, as it
                were, outwardly altered and changed. In this way fire is
                generated from fire and air from air.

                    nisi aliquid corporale corporaliter distinctum, et tamen
                    aliquo modo coniunctum in viventibus ei a quo procedit.

                    But among living beings, which have the property of moving
                    themselves, something is generated within the parent; for
                    example, the young of animals and the fruits of plants.
                    Moreover, the different manner of procession in living
                    beings must be viewed according to their different powers
                    and kinds of proceeding. Among such beings, there are
                    certain powers whose operations extend only to bodies, so
                    far as they are material. This is clear with regard to the
                    powers of the vegetative soul, which serve nutrition,
                    growth, and generation. In virtue of this class of the
                    soul’s powers, there proceeds only what is corporeal and
                    what is bodily distinct although, in the case of living
                    beings, somehow joined to that from which it proceeds.

                        There are other powers whose operations do not transcend
                        the limits of bodies and yet extend to the species of
                        bodies, receiving them without their accompanying
                        matter. This is the case with all the powers of the
                        sensitive soul. For sense is capable of receiving
                        species without matter, as the Philosopher says [De
                        anima, III, 4, 429 b 21]. But such faculties, although
                        they are receptive of the forms of things in a sort of
                        immaterial way, do not receive them without a bodily
                        organ. If procession takes place within these powers of
                        the soul, that which proceeds will not be something
                        corporeal, nor will it be distinct or joined to that
                        faculty whence it proceeds in a corporeal way, but in a
                        certain incorporeal and immaterial fashion, although not
                        entirely without the help of a bodily organ. Thus the
                        representations of things imagined, which exist in the
                        imagination not as a body in a body, but in a certain
                        spiritual way, proceed in animals. This is why imaginary
                        vision is called spiritual by Augustine [
                        <i>De Genesi ad littera</i> m, XII, vii, 16; xxiv, 50].

                            processionem quae fit secundum operationem animae
                            vegetabilis:

                            But if something proceeds in a way that is not
                            corporeal when the imagination is in action, this
                            will be the case much more in the operation of the
                            intellectual faculty, which can act without any
                            bodily organ at all; its operation is strictly
                            immaterial. For in intellectual operation a word
                            proceeds in such a way that it exists in the very
                            intellect of the speaker, not as though contained
                            therein locally, nor as bodily separated therefrom,
                            but as present there in a manner that is conformable
                            to its origin. The same is true in that procession
                            which is observed to take place in the operation of
                            the will, so far as the thing loved exists in the
                            lover, in the sense described above. However,
                            although the intellectual and sensitive powers are
                            nobler in their own scale of being than the powers
                            of the vegetative soul, nothing that subsists in the
                            nature of the same species proceeds either in men or
                            in other animals according to the procession of the
                            imaginative or sensitive faculties. This occurs only
                            in that procession which takes place through the
                            operation of the vegetative soul.

                                The reason for this is that in all beings
                                composed of matter and form, the multiplication
                                of individuals in the same species is effected
                                by a division of matter. Hence among men and
                                other animals, composed as they are of form and
                                matter, individuals are multiplied in the same
                                species by the bodily division which ensues in
                                the procession that is proper to the operation
                                of the vegetative soul, but that does not take
                                place in other operations of the soul. In beings
                                that are not composed of matter and form, no
                                distinction can be discerned other than that of
                                the forms themselves. But if the form, which is
                                the reason for the distinction, is the substance
                                of a thing, the distinction must obtain between
                                subsistent things. Of course, this is not the
                                case if the form in question is not the
                                substance of the thing.

                                    As is clear from our discussion, every
                                    intellect has this in common, that what is
                                    conceived in the intellect must in some way
                                    proceed from the knower, so far as he is
                                    knowing; and in its procession it is to some
                                    extent distinct from him, just as the
                                    conception of the intellect, which is the
                                    intellectual likeness, is distinct from the
                                    knowing intellect. Similarly the affection
                                    of the lover, whereby the beloved is in the
                                    lover, must proceed from the will of the
                                    lover so far as he is loving. But the divine
                                    intellect has this exclusive perfection:
                                    since God’s understanding is His existence,
                                    His intellectual conception, which is the
                                    intelligible likeness, must be His
                                    substance; and the case is similar with
                                    affection in God, regarded as loving.
                                    Consequently the representation of the
                                    divine intellect, which is God’s Word, is
                                    distinct from Him who produces the Word, not
                                    with respect to substantial existence, but
                                    only according to the procession of one from
                                    the other. And in God considered as loving,
                                    the same is true of the affection of love,
                                    which pertains to the Spirit.

                                        Thus it is plain that nothing prevents
                                        God’s Word, who is the Son, from being
                                        one with the Father in substance, and
                                        that, nevertheless, the Word is distinct
                                        from the Father according to the
                                        relation of procession, as we have said.
                                        Hence it is also evident that the same
                                        thing does not arise or proceed from
                                        itself; for the Son, as proceeding from
                                        the Father, is distinct from Him. And
                                        the same observation holds true of the
                                        Holy Spirit, relative to the Father and
                                        the Son.

                The relations by which the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
                are distinguished from one another are real relations, and not
                merely mental relations. Those relations are purely mental which
                do not correspond to anything found in the nature of things, but
                depend on intellectual apprehension alone. Thus right and left
                in a stone are not real relations, but only mental relations;
                they do not correspond to any real disposition present in the
                stone, but exist only in the mind of one who apprehends the
                stone as left, because it is, for instance, to the left of some
                animal. On the other hand, left and right in an animal are real
                relations, because they correspond to certain dispositions found
                in definite parts of the animal. Accordingly, since the
                relations whereby the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are
                distinguished really exist in God, the relations in question
                must be real relations, and are not merely mental relations.

                These relations cannot inhere in God accidentally, because the
                operations on which the relations follow directly are the very
                substance of God, and also because, as was shown above ‘48 there
                can be no accident in God. Hence, if the relations are really in
                God, they cannot be accidentally inherent, but must be
                subsistent. How it is that what is an accident in other things,
                can exist substantially in God, is clear from the doctrine
                previously set forth.

                is discerned, it necessarily follows that personal distinction
                in God is constituted by the relations in question. Therefore
                the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit are three persons,

                There cannot be more than three persons in God. For the divine
                persons cannot be multiplied by a division of their substance,
                but solely by the relation of some procession; and not by any
                sort of procession, but only by such as does not have its term
                in something outside of God. If the relation had something
                external as its term, this would not possess the divine nature,
                and so could not be a divine person or hypostasis. But
                procession in God that does not terminate outside of God must be
                either according to the operation of the intellect, whereby the
                Word proceeds, or according to the operation of the will,
                whereby love proceeds, as is clear from our exposition.
                Therefore no divine person can proceed unless He proceeds as the
                Word, whom we call the Son, or as love, whom we call the Holy
                Spirit.

                    diligat, impossibile est in Deo esse plura verba aut plures
                    amores. Si igitur filius procedit ut verbum, et spiritus

                    by a single act of His will, there cannot be several words

                        nothing. Hence a being that would tolerate anything of
                        its own class to be outside itself, would fall short of
                        absolute perfection. This is why things that are simply
                        perfect in their natures are not numerically multiplied;
                        thus God, the sun, the moon, and so on. But both the Son
                        and the Holy Spirit must be simply perfect, since each
                        of them is God, as we have shown. Therefore several Sons
                        or several Holy Spirits are impossible.

                            be numerically multiplied, for the reason that an

                            of the Father and the Holy Spirit. Hence there

                Father is not God as proceeding from another person, whereas the
                Son and the Holy Spirit do proceed from another person. The
                third property is that whereby the Father along with the Son is
                distinguished from the Holy Spirit. This is called their common
                spiration. But a property whereby the Father may be
                distinguished from the Holy Spirit alone is not to be assigned,
                for the reason that the Father and the Son are a single
                principle of the Holy Spirit, as has been shown.

                Two properties must pertain to the Son: one whereby He is
                distinguished from the Father, and this is filiation; another
                whereby, along with the Father, He is distinguished from the
                Holy Spirit; and this is their common spiration. But no property
                is to be assigned whereby the Son is distinguished from the Holy
                Spirit alone, because as we said above, the Son and the Father
                are a single principle of the Holy Spirit. Similarly, no single
                property is to be assigned whereby the Holy Spirit and the Son
                together are distinguished from the Father. For the Father is
                distinguished from them by one property, namely, innascibility,
                inasmuch as He does not proceed. However, since the Son and the
                Holy Spirit proceed, not by one procession, but by several, they
                are distinguished from the Father by two properties. The Holy
                Spirit has only one property by which He is distinguished from
                the Father and the Son, and this is called procession. That
                there cannot be any property by which the Holy Spirit may be
                distinguished from the Son alone or from the Father alone, is
                evident from this whole discussion.

                These five properties can be called notions of the persons, for
                the reason that the distinction between the persons in God is
                brought to our notice through them. On the other hand, they
                cannot be called properties, if the root meaning of a property
                is insisted on, so that a property is taken to mean a
                characteristic pertaining to one individual alone; for common
                spiration pertains to the Father and the Son. But if the word
                “property” is employed in the sense of an attribute that is
                proper to some individuals as setting them off from others, in
                the way that “two-footed,” for example, is proper to man and
                bird in contradistinction to quadrupeds, there is nothing to
                prevent even common spiration from being called a property.
                Since, however, the persons in God are distinguished solely by
                relations, and distinction among the divine persons is
                manifested by the notions, the notions must in some sense
                pertain to relationship. But only four of the notions are real
                relations, whereby the divine persons are related to one
                another. The fifth notion, innascibility, pertains to relation
                as being the denial of relation; for negations are reduced to
                the genus of affirmations, and privations are reduced to the
                genus of habits, as, for example, not man is reduced to the
                genus of man, and not white is reduced to the genus of
                whiteness.

                    We should note that among the relations whereby the divine
                    persons are related to one another, some have definite
                    names, such as paternity and filiation, which properly
                    signify relationship. But others lack a definite name: those
                    whereby the Father and the Son are related to the Holy
                    Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is related to them. So for these
                    we use names of origin in place of relative names. We
                    perceive clearly that common spiration and procession
                    signify origin, but not relations that follow origin. This
                    can be brought out in the case of the relations between the
                    Father and the Son. Generation denotes active origin, and is
                    followed by the relation of paternity; and nativity
                    signifies the passive generation of the Son, and is followed
                    by the relation of filiation. In like manner, some relation
                    follows common spiration, and the same is true of
                    procession. But as these relations lack definite names, we
                    use the names of the actions instead of relative names.

                Considerandum autem, quod quamvis relationes subsistentes in

                consequitur. Sicut autem unum est indivisibile vel indivisum,
                ita pluralitas est divisibile vel divisum. Ad pluralitatem enim
                personarum requiritur quod relationes vim distinctivam habeant
                ratione oppositionis, nam formalis distinctio non est nisi per
                oppositionem. Si ergo praedictae relationes inspiciantur,
                paternitas et filiatio oppositionem ad invicem habent relativam,

                filii. Processio autem oppositionem relativam habet ad communem
                spirationem. Unde, cum communis spiratio conveniat patri et

                We must realize that, although the relations subsisting in the
                Godhead are the divine persons themselves, as was stated above,
                we are not to conclude that there are five or four persons
                corresponding to the number of relations. For number follows
                distinction of some sort. just as unity is indivisible or
                undivided, so plurality is divisible or divided. For a plurality
                of persons requires that relations have power to distinguish by
                reason of opposition, since formal distinction necessarily
                entails opposition. If, then, the relations in question are
                closely examined, paternity and filiation will be seen to have
                relative opposition to each other; hence they are incompatible
                in the same suppositum. Consequently paternity and filiation in
                God must be two subsistent persons. Innascibility, on the other
                hand, although opposed to filiation, is not opposed to
                paternity. Hence paternity and innascibility can pertain to one
                and the same person. Similarly, common spiration is not opposed
                either to paternity or to filiation, nor to innascibility. Thus
                nothing prevents common spiration from being in both the person
                of the Father and the person of the Son. Accordingly common
                spiration is not a subsisting person distinct from the persons
                of the Father and the Son. But procession has a relation of
                opposition to common spiration. Therefore, since common
                spiration pertains to the Father and the Son, procession must be
                a person distinct from the persons of the Father and the Son.

                    Accordingly the reason is clear why God is not called
                    “quiune,” quinus, on account of the notions, which are five
                    in number, but is called triune, on account of the Trinity
                    of persons. The five notions are not five subsisting things,
                    but the three persons are three subsisting things. Although
                    several notions or properties may pertain to a single
                    person, only one of them constitutes the person. For a
                    divine person is constituted by the properties, not in the
                    sense that He is constituted by several of them, but in the
                    sense that the relative, subsisting property itself is a
                    person. If several properties were understood as subsisting
                    in themselves apart, they would be several persons, and not
                    one person. Hence we must understand that, of the several
                    properties or notions belonging to a single person, the one
                    that precedes according to the order of nature constitutes
                    the person; the others are understood as inhering in the
                    person already constituted.

                        affirmatio negationem praecedit. Communis autem spiratio
                        ordine naturae praesupponit paternitatem et filiationem,

                        Thus it is evident that innascibility cannot be the
                        first notion of the Father, constituting His person,
                        because nothing is constituted by a negation, and also
                        because affirmation naturally precedes negation.
                        Further, common spiration presupposes paternity and
                        filiation in the order of nature, just as the procession
                        of love presupposes the procession of the Word.

                            of the Father is paternity and the first notion of
                            the Son is filiation, whereas procession alone is
                            the notion of the Holy Spirit.

                                Relinquitur igitur quod tres sunt notiones

                                seu notiones personarum, non autem personales,
                                quia personam non constituunt.

                                Accordingly the notions constituting persons are
                                three in number: paternity, filiation, and
                                procession. And these notions must be strict
                                properties. For that which constitutes a person
                                must pertain to that person alone; individuating
                                principles cannot belong to several individuals.
                                For this reason the three notions in question
                                are called personal properties, in the sense
                                that they constitute the three persons in the
                                manner described. The remaining notions are
                                called properties or notions of the persons, but
                                not personal properties or notions, because they
                                do not constitute a person.

                Ex hoc autem apparet quod remotis per intellectum proprietatibus
                personalibus, non remanent hypostases. In resolutione enim quae
                fit per intellectum, remota forma, remanet subiectum formae,
                sicut remota albedine remanet superficies, qua remota, remanet
                substantia, cuius forma remota remanet materia prima; sed remoto
                subiecto nihil remanet. Proprietates autem personales sunt ipsae
                personae subsistentes, nec constituunt personas, quasi
                praeexistentibus suppositis advenientes: quia nihil in divinis
                potest esse distinctum quod absolute dicitur, sed solum quod
                relativum est. Relinquitur igitur quod proprietatibus remotis
                personalibus per intellectum, non remanent aliquae hypostases
                distinctae; sed remotis notionibus non personalibus, remanent
                hypostases distinctae.

                This makes it clear that if we were to remove the personal
                properties by intellectual abstraction, the hypostases could not
                remain. If a form is removed by intellectual abstraction, the
                subject of the form remains. Thus if whiteness is removed, the
                surface remains; if the surface is removed, the substance
                remains; if the form of the substance is removed, prime matter
                remains. But if the subject is removed, nothing remains. In the
                case of God, the personal properties are the subsisting persons
                themselves. They do not constitute the persons in the sense that
                they are added to pre-existing supposita; for in the Godhead
                nothing that is predicated absolutely, but only what is
                relative, can be distinct. Therefore, if the personal properties
                are removed by intellectual abstraction, no distinct hypostases
                remain. But if non-personal notions are thus removed, distinct
                hypostases do remain.

                If the question were to be asked whether, in consequence of the
                removal of the personal properties by intellectual abstraction,
                the divine essence would remain, the answer is that in one
                respect it would remain, but in another it would not.
                Intellectual abstraction can take place in two ways. The first
                is by abstracting form from matter. In this abstraction the mind
                proceeds from the more formal to the more material; the first
                subject remains until the end, and the ultimate form is removed
                first. The second way of abstracting is by the abstraction of
                the universal from the particular, and this proceeds according
                to an order that is, in a sense, the opposite; the individuating
                material conditions are first removed, so that what is common
                may be retained.

                    Quamvis autem in divinis non sit materia et forma, neque

                    proprium, et suppositum naturae communi. Personae enim
                    comparantur ad essentiam, secundum modum intelligendi, sicut
                    supposita propria ad naturam communem. Secundum igitur

                    In God, of course, there are neither matter and form, nor
                    universal and particular. Nevertheless there is in the
                    Godhead something that is common, and something that is
                    proper and that supposes the common nature; for, in our
                    human way of thinking, the divine persons are to the divine
                    essence what individual supposita are to a common nature.
                    According to the first type of intellectual abstraction,
                    therefore, if we remove the personal properties, which are
                    the subsisting persons themselves, the common nature does
                    not remain. But in the second type of abstraction it does
                    remain.

                naturam in virtute suae naturae; nam forma speciei est
                principium generandi simile secundum speciem. Cum igitur actus

                We can perceive from this discussion the nature of the order
                between the personal acts and the personal properties. The
                personal properties are subsistent persons. But a person
                subsisting in any nature whatsoever, acts in virtue of his
                nature when he communicates his nature; for the form of a
                species is the principle for generating a product that is of
                like species. Consequently, since personal acts in God have to
                do with communicating the divine nature, a subsisting person
                must communicate the common nature in virtue of the nature
                itself.

                    Et ex hoc duo possunt concludi. Quorum unum est quod
                    potentia generativa in patre sit ipsa natura divina, nam
                    potentia quodcumque agendi, est principium cuius virtute
                    aliquid agitur. Aliud est quod actus personalis, scilicet
                    generatio, secundum modum intelligendi praesupponit et
                    naturam divinam et proprietatem personalem patris, quae est
                    ipsa hypostasis patris, licet huiusmodi proprietas,
                    inquantum relatio est, ex actu consequatur. Unde si in patre
                    attendatur quod subsistens persona est, dici potest, quod
                    quia pater est, generat; si autem attendatur quod relationis
                    est, e converso dicendum videtur, quod quia generat, pater
                    est.
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    Two conclusions follow from this. The first is, that the
                    generative power of the Father is the divine nature itself;
                    for the power of performing any action is the principle in
                    virtue of which a thing acts. The second conclusion is that,
                    according to our way of conceiving, the personal act of
                    generation presupposes both the divine nature and the
                    personal property of the Father, which is the very
                    hypostasis of the Father. This is true even though such
                    property, regarded as a relation, follows from the act.
                    Thus, in speaking of the Father, if we attend to the fact
                    that He is a subsistent person, we can say that He generates
                    because He is the Father. But if we are thinking of what
                    pertains to relationship, it seems we should say,
                    contrariwise, that He is the Father because He generates.

                passivae, sive nativitatis ad filiationem. Generatio enim activa
                praesupponit ordine naturae personam generantis; sed generatio
                passiva sive nativitas ordine naturae praecedit personam
                genitam, quia persona genita nativitate sua habet ut sit. Sic
                igitur generatio activa secundum modum intelligendi praesupponit
                paternitatem, secundum quod est constitutiva personae patris;
                nativitas autem non praesupponit filiationem, secundum quod est
                constitutiva personae filii, sed secundum intelligendi modum
                praecedit eam utroque modo, scilicet et secundum quod est
                constitutiva personae, et secundum quod est relatio. Et
                similiter intelligendum est de his quae pertinent ad
                processionem spiritus sancti.

                However, we should understand that the order of active
                generation, with reference to paternity, is to be taken in one
                way, and that the order of passive generation, or nativity, with
                reference to filiation, is to be taken in another way. In the
                order of nature, active generation presupposes the person of the
                begetter. But in the same order of nature, passive generation,
                or nativity, precedes the begotten person, for the begotten
                person owes his existence to his birth. Hence active generation,
                according to our way of representing the matter, presupposes
                paternity, understood as constituting the person of the Father.
                Nativity, however, does not presuppose filiation, understood as
                constituting the person of the Son but, according to our manner
                of conceiving, precedes it in both respects, that is, both as
                being constitutive of the person and as being a relation. And
                whatever pertains to the procession of the Holy Spirit is to be
                understood in a similar way.

                filius filiatione quidem ad patrem, communi vero spiratione ad
                spiritum sanctum.

                In thus indicating the order between the notional acts and the
                notional properties, we do not mean to imply that the notional
                acts differ from the personal properties in objective reality,
                for they are distinct only according to our manner of
                conceiving. just as God’s act of understanding is God Himself
                understanding, so the Father’s act of begetting is the begetting
                Father, although the modes of signifying are different.
                Likewise, although one divine person may have several notions,
                there is no composition in Him. Innascibility cannot cause any
                composition, since it is a negative property. And the two
                relations in the person of the Father, namely, paternity and
                common spiration, are in reality identical as referring to the
                person of the Father; for, as the paternity is the Father, so
                common spiration in the Father is the Father, and in the Son is
                the Son. But these two properties differ according to the terms
                to which they refer; for by paternity the Father is related to
                the Son, and by common spiration He is related to the Holy
                Spirit. Similarly, the Son is related to the Father by
                filiation, and to the Holy Spirit by common spiration.

                The relative properties must be the divine essence itself. For

                than the divine essence; and the divine essence is God Himself,

                The view proposed by Gilbert de la Porrée and some of his
                followers, that the properties under discussion are not in the
                persons, but are external to them, cannot be defended. Real
                relations must be in the things that are related. This is
                evident in the case of creatures, for real relations are in them
                as accidents in their subjects. But the relations whereby the
                persons are distinguished within the Godhead are real relations,
                as was demonstrated above.” Hence they must be in the divine
                persons; but not, of course, as accidents. Other perfections,
                too, which in creatures are accidents, cease to be accidents
                when transferred to God, as was shown above; such are wisdom,
                justice, and the like.

                    Praeterea. In divinis non potest esse distinctio nisi per
                    relationes: nam quaecumque absolute dicuntur, communia sunt.
                    Si igitur relationes exterius se habeant ad personas, nulla
                    in ipsis personis distinctio remanebit. Sunt igitur
                    proprietates relativae in personis, ita tamen quod sunt
                    ipsae personae, et etiam ipsa essentia divina; sicut
                    sapientia et bonitas dicuntur esse in Deo, et sunt ipse Deus

                  <td>
                    Besides, there can be no distinction in God except through
                    the relations; all perfections that are predicated
                    absolutely are common. Therefore, if the relations were
                    external to the persons, no distinction would remain among
                    the persons themselves. And so there are relative properties
                    in the persons; but they are the persons themselves, and
                    also the divine essence itself. In the same way wisdom and
                    goodness are said to be in God, and are God Himself, as well
                    as the divine essence, as was said above.

                After considering the truths which pertain to the unity of the
                divine essence and to the Trinity of persons, we turn to a study
                of the effects produced by the Trinity. The first effect wrought
                by God in things is existence itself, which all other effects
                presuppose, and on which they are based. Anything that exists in
                any way must necessarily have its origin from God. In all things
                that are arranged in orderly fashion, we find universally that
                what is first and most perfect in any order, is the cause of
                whatever follows in that order. Thus fire, which is hot in the
                highest degree, is the cause of heat in all other heated bodies.
                Imperfect objects are always found to have their origin from
                perfect things; seeds, for instance, come from animals and
                plants. But, as we proved above, God is the first and most
                perfect Being. Therefore He must be the cause of being in all
                things that have being.
                <tr valign="top" style="text-align: justify">
                  <td>
                    Adhuc. Omne quod habet aliquid per participationem,
                    reducitur in id quod habet illud per essentiam, sicut in
                    principium et causam; sicut ferrum ignitum participat
                    igneitatem ab eo quod est ignis per essentiam suam. Ostensum
                    est autem supra, quod Deus est ipsum suum esse, unde esse
                    convenit ei per suam essentiam, omnibus autem aliis convenit
                    per participationem: non enim alicuius alterius essentia est
                    suum esse, quia esse absolutum et per se subsistens non
                    potest esse nisi unum, ut supra ostensum est. Igitur oportet
                    Deum esse causam existendi omnibus quae sunt.
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    Again, whatever has some perfection by participation, is
                    traced back, as to its principle and cause, to what
                    possesses that perfection essentially. Thus molten iron has
                    its incandescence from that which is fire by its essence. We
                    showed above that God is existence itself; hence existence
                    belongs to Him in virtue of His essence, but pertains to all
                    other things by way of participation. The essence of no
                    other thing is its existence, for being that is absolute and
                    <i>per se</i> subsistent cannot be more than one, as was
                    brought out above. Therefore God must be the cause of
                    existence of all things that are.

                This makes it clear that, in creating, God has no need of
                pre-existing matter from which to fashion things. No agent
                needs, prior to his action, what he produces by his action; he
                needs only what he is unable to produce by his action. The
                builder requires stones and lumber before he can set to work,
                because he is unable to produce these materials by his action.
                On the other hand, he does not presuppose a house, but produces
                it by his activity. But matter must be produced by God’s action
                since, as has just been proved, everything that exists in any
                way at all has God as the cause of its existence. Therefore the
                conclusion follows that God does not presuppose matter in His
                activity.

                    quod in creando aliud principium praesupponit, per posterius
                    habet rationem principii. Cum igitur Deus sit principium
                    rerum sicut actus primus, materia autem sicut ens in

                  <td>
                    Besides, act naturally precedes potency, and hence the
                    notion of principle primarily befits act. But any principle
                    that in creating would presuppose some other principle,
                    would verify the concept of principle only in a secondary
                    way. Accordingly, since God is the principle of things as
                    the first act, whereas matter is a principle as a being in
                    potency, it is unthinkable that matter should be presupposed
                    before God can act.

                        Furthermore, the more universal a cause is, the more
                        universal its effect is. Particular causes make use of
                        the effects of universal causes for something
                        determinate; and such determination is related to a
                        universal effect as act to potency. Hence any cause that
                        causes something to be in act, utilizing pre-existing
                        material that is in potency to that act, is a particular
                        cause with respect to some more universal cause. But
                        this sort of procedure cannot pertain to God, since He
                        is the first cause, as we showed above. Consequently God
                        does not need matter as a prerequisite to His action.
                        Therefore He has the power to bring things into
                        existence from nothing or, in other words, to create.
                        This is why the Catholic faith professes that He is the
                        Creator.

                From this it appears, further, that God alone can be Creator.
                For to create is the prerogative of that cause which does not
                presuppose another cause that is more universal, as we saw in
                the preceding chapter. But such causality pertains to God alone.
                He alone, therefore, is Creator.

                    Item. Quanto potentia est magis remota ab actu, tanto
                    oportet esse maiorem virtutem per quam reducatur in actum.
                    Sed quantacumque distantia potentiae ad actum detur, semper
                    remanet maior distantia, si ipsa potentia subtrahatur.
                    Creare igitur aliquid ex nihilo requirit infinitam virtutem.
                    Sed solus Deus est infinitae virtutis, cum ipse sit

                    Besides, the more remote a potency is from act, the greater
                    must be the power that reduces it to act. But whatever
                    distance may be imagined between potency and act, the
                    distance will ever be still greater if the very potency
                    itself is withdrawn. To create from nothing, then, requires
                    infinite power. But God alone is infinite in power, since He
                    alone is infinite in essence. Consequently God alone can
                    create.

                The foregoing exposition shows clearly that the cause of
                diversity in things is not diversity on the part of matter. For,
                as we have proved, the divine action which brings things into
                being does not suppose the pre-existence of matter. The cause of
                diversity in things could not be on the side of matter unless
                matter were needed prior to the production of things, so that
                the various forms induced would follow diversity in matter.
                Therefore the cause of diversity in the things produced by God
                is not matter.

                    Again, the plurality or unity of things is dependent on
                    their existence. For, to the extent that anything is a
                    being, it is also one. But forms do not possess existence on
                    account of matter; on the contrary, matter receives
                    existence from form. For act is more excellent than potency;
                    and that which is the reason for a thing’s existence must be
                    the more excellent component. Consequently forms are not
                    diverse in order that they may befit various types of
                    matter, but matter is diversified that it may befit various

                Diversity among things was rightly established according to a
                definite order, so that some things might be more excellent than
                others. For this pertains to the lavishness of the divine
                goodness, that God should communicate a likeness of His goodness
                to created things, so far as possible. God is not only good in
                Himself, but exceeds other beings in goodness, and guides them
                toward goodness. Consequently, that the likeness which created
                beings bear to God might be heightened, it was necessary for
                some things to be made better than others, and for some to act
                upon others, thus leading them toward perfection.

                    Prima autem diversitas rerum principaliter in diversitate
                    formarum consistit. Formalis autem diversitas secundum
                    contrarietatem est. Dividitur enim genus in diversas species
                    differentiis contrariis. In contrarietate autem ordinem
                    necesse est esse, nam semper alterum contrariorum perfectius
                    est. Oportet igitur rerum diversitatem cum quodam ordine a
                    Deo esse institutam, ut scilicet quaedam sint aliis potiora.

                    The basic diversity among things consists chiefly in
                    diversity of forms. Formal diversity is achieved by way of
                    contrariety; for genus is divided into various species by
                    contrary differences. But order is necessarily found in
                    contrariety, for among contraries one is always better than
                    the other. Therefore diversity among things had to be
                    established by God according to a definite order, in such a
                    way that some beings might be more excellent than others.

                    Since God is eternal and immutable in His being, those
                    things are lowest in the scale of being, as possessing less
                    likeness to God, which are subject to generation and
                    corruption. Such beings exist for a time, and then cease to
                    be. And, since existence follows the form of a thing, beings
                    of this kind exist while they have their form, but cease to
                    exist when deprived of their form. Hence there must be
                    something in them that can retain a form for a time, and can
                    then be deprived of the form. This is what we call matter.
                    Therefore such beings, which are lowest in degree among
                    things, must be composed of matter and form. But beings that
                    are supreme among created entities approach most closely to
                    likeness with God. They have no potency with regard to
                    existence and non-existence; they have received everlasting
                    existence from God through creation. Since matter, by the
                    very fact that it is what it is, is a potency for that
                    existence which is imparted through form, those beings which
                    have no potency for existence and nonexistence, are not
                    composed of matter and form, but are forms only, subsisting
                    in their being which they have received from God. Such
                    incorporeal substances must be incorruptible. For all
                    corruptible beings have a potency for non-existence; but
                    incorporeal beings have no such potency, as we said. Hence
                    they are incorruptible.

                        Since the substances in question are subsisting forms,
                        they cannot be separated from their forms, and so cannot
                        lose existence. Therefore they are incorruptible.

                            local presence. Thus in some beings there is found
                            matter as well as motion. For motion is the act of a

                The substances mentioned above, which are called immaterial,
                must also be intellectual. A being is intellectual for the
                reason that it is free from matter. This can be perceived from
                the very way it understands. The intelligible in act and the
                intellect in act are the same thing. But it is clear that a
                thing is intelligible in act because it is separated from
                matter, we cannot have intellectual knowledge of material things
                except by abstracting from matter. Accordingly we must pronounce

                        degree, such as lifeless beings, share in the divine

                        animals, with respect to sense perception. But the
                        highest degree, and that which makes us most like to
                        God, is conferred by the intellect. Consequently the
                        most excellent creatures are intellectual. Indeed, they

                Intellectus enim non agit aut appetit sine iudicio, sicut
                inanimata; neque est iudicium intellectus ex naturali impetu,
                sicut in brutis, sed ex propria apprehensione: quia intellectus
                et finem cognoscit, et id quod est ad finem, et habitudinem
                unius ad alterum; et ideo ipse sui iudicii causa esse potest,
                quo appetat et agat aliquid propter finem. Liberum autem dicimus
                quod sui causa est. Appetit igitur et agit intellectus libero
                iudicio, quod est esse liberum arbitrio. Supremae igitur
                substantiae sunt arbitrio liberae.

                This fact shows that such beings have freedom of choice. The
                intellect does not act or desire without forming a judgment, as
                lifeless beings do, nor is the judgment of the intellect the
                product of natural impulse, as in brutes, but results from a.
                true apprehension of the object. For the intellect perceives the
                end, the means leading to the end, and the bearing of one on the
                other. Hence the intellect can be the cause of its own judgment,
                whereby it desires a good and performs an action for the sake of
                an end. But what is a cause unto itself, is precisely what we
                call free. Accordingly the intellect desires and acts in virtue
                of a free judgment, which is the same as having freedom of
                choice. Therefore the highest substances enjoy freedom of
                choice.

                    Furthermore, that is free which is not tied down to any one
                    definite course. But the appetite of an intellectual
                    substance is not under compulsion to pursue any one definite
                    good, for it follows intellectual apprehension, which
                    embraces good universally. Therefore the appetite of an
                    intelligent substance is free, since it tends toward all
                    good in general.

                Intellectual substances are superior to other substances in the
                scale of perfection. These same substances must also differ from
                one another in degree. They cannot differ from one another by
                material differentiation, since they lack matter; if any
                plurality is found among them, it must be caused by formal
                distinction, which establishes diversity of species. In beings
                that exhibit diversity of species, the degree and order existing
                in them must be taken into consideration. The reason is that,
                just as addition or subtraction of a unit causes variation of
                species in numbers, so natural entities are found to vary in
                species by the addition or subtraction of differences. For
                instance, what is merely alive, differs from what is both alive
                and endowed with sense perception; and the latter differs from
                what is alive, endowed with sense, and rational. Therefore the
                immaterial substances under discussion must be distinct
                according to various degrees and orders.

                    Et hoc quidem taliter potest esse manifestum. Intelligere

                    denudatum ab eo quod recipitur. Intellectus autem
                    cognoscitivus est omnium naturarum sensibilium. Si igitur
                    cognosceret per organum corporale, oporteret illud organum
                    esse denudatum ab omni natura sensibili, quod est
                    impossibile.

                  <td>
                    This can be explained in the following way. Understanding is
                    proper to man beyond all the other animals. Evidently, man
                    alone comprehends universals, and the relations between
                    things, and immaterial objects, which are perceptible only
                    to the intelligence. Understanding cannot be an act
                    performed by a bodily organ, in the way that vision is
                    exercised by the eye. No faculty endowed with cognitive
                    power can belong to the genus of things that is known
                    through its agency. Thus the pupil of the eye lacks color by
                    its very nature. Colors are recognized to the extent that
                    the species of colors are received into the pupil; but a
                    recipient must be lacking in that which is received. The
                    intellect is capable of knowing all sensible natures.
                    Therefore, if it knew through the medium of a bodily organ,
                    that organ would have to be entirely lacking in sensible
                    nature; but this is impossible.

                        principium cognoscendi. Intellectus autem cognoscit res
                        immaterialiter, etiam eas quae in sua natura sunt
                        materiales, abstrahendo formam universalem a
                        materialibus conditionibus individuantibus. Impossibile

                        Moreover, any cognitive faculty exercises its power of
                        knowing in accord with the way the species of the object
                        known is in it, for this is its principle of knowing.
                        But the intellect knows things in an immaterial fashion,
                        even those things that are by nature material; it
                        abstracts a universal form from its individuating
                        material conditions. Therefore the species of the object
                        known cannot exist in the intellect materially; and so
                        it is not received into a bodily organ, seeing that
                        every bodily organ is material.

                            altiora intelligibilium, non minus potest
                            intelligere alia, sed magis. Si igitur homo

                            ,The same is clear from the fact that a sense is
                            weakened and injured by sensible objects of extreme
                            intensity. Thus the ear is impaired by excessively
                            loud sounds, and the eye by excessively bright
                            lights. This occurs because the harmony within the
                            organ is shattered. The intellect, on the contrary,
                            is perfected in proportion to the excellence of
                            intelligible objects; he who understands the higher
                            objects of intelligence is able to understand other
                            objects more perfectly rather than less perfectly.
                            Consequently, if man is found to be intelligent, and
                            if man’s understanding is not effected through the
                            medium of a bodily organ, we are forced to
                            acknowledge the existence of some incorporeal
                            substance whereby man exercises the act of
                            understanding. For the substance of a being that can
                            perform an action by itself, without the aid of a
                            body, is not dependent on a body. But all powers and
                            forms that are unable to subsist by themselves
                            without a body, cannot exercise any activity without
                            a body. Thus heat does not by itself cause warmth;
                            rather a body causes warmth by the heat that is in
                            it. Accordingly this incorporeal substance whereby
                            man understands, occupies the lowest place in the
                            genus of intellectual substances, and is the closest
                            to matter.

                Since intellectual being is superior to sentient being, just as
                intellect is superior to sense, and since lower beings imitate
                higher beings as best they may, just as bodies subject to
                generation and corruption imitate in some fashion the
                circulatory motion of heavenly bodies, it follows that sensible
                beings resemble, in; their own way, intellectual beings. Thus
                from the resemblance of sense to intellect we can mount to some

                        We expect to find something similar in the intellectual
                        world. The supreme intellectual being, God, is pure act.
                        Other intellectual substances have something of act and
                        of potency, but in a way that befits intellectual being.
                        And the lowest among intellectual substances, that
                        whereby man understands, has, so to speak, intellectual
                        being only in potency. This is borne out by the fact
                        that man is at first found to be only potentially
                        intelligent, and this potency is gradually reduced to
                        act in the course of time. And this is why the faculty
                        whereby man understands is called the possible
                        intellect.

                As was stated above, the higher an intellectual substance is in
                perfection, the more universal are the intelligible forms it
                possesses. Of all the intellectual substances, consequently, the
                human intellect, which we have called possible, has forms of the
                least universality. This is the reason it receives its
                intelligible forms from sensible things.

                    This can be made clear from another point of view. A form
                    must have some proportion to the potency which receives it.
                    Therefore, since of all intellectual substances man’s
                    possible intellect is found to be the closest to corporeal
                    matter, its intelligible forms must, likewise, be most

                However, we must realize that forms in corporeal things are
                particular, and have a material existence. But in the intellect
                they are universal and immaterial. Our manner of understanding
                brings this out. That is, we apprehend things universally and
                immaterially. This way of understanding must conform to the
                intelligible species whereby we understand. Consequently, since
                it is impossible to pass from one extreme to another without
                traversing what lies between, forms reaching the intellect from
                corporeal objects must pass through certain media.

                    These are the sense faculties, which receive the forms of
                    material things without their matter; what lodges in the eye
                    is the species of the stone, but not its matter. However,
                    the forms of things received into the sense faculties are
                    particular; for we know only particular objects with our
                    sense faculties. Hence man must be endowed with senses as a
                    prerequisite to understanding. A proof of this is the fact
                    that if a man is lacking in one of the senses, he has no
                    knowledge of sensible objects that are apprehended by that

                This discussion brings out the truth that knowledge of things in
                our intellect is not caused by any participation or influence of
                forms that are intelligible in act and that subsist by
                themselves, as was taught by the Platonists and certain other
                philosophers who followed them in this doctrine. No, the
                intellect acquires such knowledge from sensible objects, through
                the intermediacy of the senses. However, since the forms of
                objects in the sense faculties are particular, as we just said,
                they are intelligible not in act, but only in potency. For the
                intellect understands nothing but universals. But what is in
                potency is not reduced to act except by some agent. Hence there
                must be some agent that causes the species existing in the sense
                faculties to be intelligible in act. The possible intellect
                cannot perform this service, for it is in potency with respect
                to intelligible objects rather than active in rendering them
                intelligible. Therefore we must assume some other intellect,
                which will cause species that are intelligible in potency to
                become intelligible in act, just as light causes colors that are
                potentially visible to be actually visible. This faculty we call
                the agent intellect, which we would not have to postulate if the
                forms of things were intelligible in act, as the Platonists
                held.

                    perfected by the intelligible species, it is called the
                    habitual intellect (intellectus in habitu), for then it
                    possesses intelligible species in such a way that it can use
                    them at will; in other words, it possesses them in a fashion
                    that is midway between pure potency and complete act. But
                    when it has these species in full actuality, it is called
                    the intellect in act. That is, the intellect actually
                    understands a thing when the species of the thing is made
                    the form of the possible intellect. This is why we say that
                    the intellect in act is the object actually understood.

                A necessary consequence of the foregoing doctrine is that the
                intellect whereby man understands is incorruptible. Every being
                acts in a way that is conformable to its existence. The
                intellect has an activity which it does not share with the body,
                as we have proved. This shows that it can act by itself. Hence
                it is a substance subsisting in its own being. But, as was
                pointed out above, intellectual substances are incorruptible.”
                Accordingly the intellect whereby man understands is
                incorruptible.

                    materia et forma, sunt per se corruptibilia; formae autem
                    materiales sunt corruptibiles per accidens, et non per se;

                    excedunt, sunt incorruptibiles omnino. Intellectus autem
                    omnino secundum suam naturam supra materiam elevatur, quod
                    eius operatio ostendit: non enim intelligimus aliqua nisi
                    per hoc quod ipsa a materia separamus. Est igitur

                    Again, the proper subject of generation and corruption is
                    matter. Hence a thing is immune to corruption to the extent
                    that it is free from matter. Things composed of matter and
                    form are <i>per se</i> corruptible; material forms are
                    corruptible indirectly (<i>per accidens</i>), though not
                    <i>per se</i>. Immaterial forms, which are above material
                    conditions, are wholly incorruptible. The intellect by its
                    very nature is elevated completely beyond matter, as its
                    activity shows: we do not understand anything unless we
                    separate it from matter. Consequently the intellect is by
                    nature incorruptible.

                        Moreover, corruption cannot take place without
                        contrariety; for nothing is corrupted except by its
                        contrary. This is why the heavenly bodies, which do not
                        admit of contrariety, are incorruptible. But all
                        contrariety is far removed from the nature of the
                        intellect, so much so that things which are contraries
                        in themselves, are not contraries in the intellect. The
                        intelligible aspect of contraries is one, inasmuch as
                        one thing is understood in terms of another. Thus it is
                        impossible for the intellect to be corruptible.

                An objector may say: the intellect is indeed incorruptible, but

                    First, on the part of the intelligible species. If I have
                    one intellect and you have another, there will have to be
                    one intelligible species in me and another in you, and
                    consequently there will be one object that I understand and
                    another that you understand. Hence the intelligible species
                    will be multiplied according to the number of individuals,
                    and so it will not be universal but individual. The
                    conclusion would then seem to follow that it is understood
                    not in act, but only in potency; for individual species are
                    intelligible in potency, not in act.

                        intellectual substances that are numerically many do not
                        belong to one species, as we have also seen, it follows

                        is numerically different, the two must differ

                            Furthermore, since all individuals share in one
                            specific nature, there must be something besides
                            specific nature whereby individuals may be
                            distinguished from one another. Accordingly, if
                            there is one specific intellect in all men, but many
                            intellects that are numerically distinct, something
                            must be found that will make one intellect differ
                            numerically from another. This cannot be anything
                            pertaining to the substance of the intellect, since
                            the intellect is not composed of matter and form.
                            Consequently any difference that might be admitted,
                            on the part of the substance of the intellect, would
                            be a formal difference that would cause diversity in
                            the species. The only possibility left is that the
                            intellect of one man cannot differ numerically from
                            the intellect of another man except by reason of the
                            diversity of their bodies. Therefore, when the
                            various bodies corrupt, it seems that only one
                            intellect, and not a plurality of intellects, would
                            remain.

                                could not deny that the man understands, unless
                                he knew that it ought to be denied. By denying
                                he affirms, for affirmation and denial are
                                intelligent actions. If, then, the man in
                                question understands, that whereby he formally
                                understands must be his form, since nothing acts
                                unless it is in act. Hence that whereby an agent
                                acts, is his act; just as the heat by which a
                                heated body causes warmth, is its act. Therefore
                                the intellect whereby a man understands is the
                                form of this man, and the same is true of
                                another man. But the same numerical form cannot
                                belong to numerically different individuals, for
                                numerically different individuals do not possess
                                the same existence; and yet everything has
                                existence by reason of its form. Accordingly the
                                intellect whereby a man understands cannot be
                                but one in all men.

                                    Perceiving the force of this difficulty,
                                    some endeavor to find a way of escaping it.
                                    They say that the possible intellect, of
                                    which there was question above, receives the
                                    intelligible species by which it is reduced
                                    to act. These intelligible species are, in
                                    some way, in the phantasms. Hence the
                                    possible intellect is continuous and is
                                    joined to us so far as the intelligible
                                    species is both in the possible intellect
                                    and in the phantasms that are in us. It is
                                    thus that we are able to understand through
                                    the agency of the possible intellect.

                                        Haec autem responsio omnino nulla est.
                                        Primo quidem, quia species
                                        intelligibilis secundum quod est in
                                        phantasmatibus, est intellecta in
                                        potentia tantum, secundum autem quod est
                                        in intellectu possibili, est intellecta
                                        in actu. Secundum igitur quod est in
                                        intellectu possibili non est in
                                        phantasmatibus, sed magis a
                                        phantasmatibus abstracta. Nulla ergo
                                        remanet unio intellectus possibilis ad
                                        nos. Deinde dato quod sit aliqua unio,
                                        non tamen sufficeret ad hoc quod faceret
                                        nos intelligentes. Per hoc enim quod
                                        species alicuius est in intellectu, non
                                        sequitur quod se ipsum intelligat, sed
                                        quod intelligatur: non enim lapis
                                        intelligit, etiam si eius species sit in
                                        intellectu possibili. Neque igitur per
                                        hoc quod species phantasmatum quae sunt
                                        in nobis, sunt in intellectu possibili,
                                        sequitur quod nos simus intelligentes,
                                        sed magis quod nos simus intellecti, vel
                                        potius phantasmata quae sunt in nobis.

                                        Unfortunately for this solution, it is
                                        utterly valueless. In the first place,
                                        the intelligible species, as it exists
                                        in the phantasms, is a concept only in
                                        potency; and as it exists in the
                                        possible intellect, it is a concept in
                                        act. As existing in the possible
                                        intellect, it is not in the phantasms,
                                        but rather is abstracted from the
                                        phantasms. Hence no union of the
                                        possible intellect with us remains.
                                        Secondly, even granting that there may
                                        be some sort of union, this would not
                                        suffice to enable us to understand. The
                                        presence of the species of some object
                                        in the intellect does not entail the
                                        consequence that the object understands
                                        itself, but only that it is understood;
                                        a stone does not understand, even though
                                        a species of it may be in the possible
                                        intellect. Hence, from the fact that
                                        species of phantasms present in us are
                                        in the possible intellect, it does not
                                        follow that we thereupon understand. It
                                        only follows that we ourselves, or
                                        rather the phantasms in us, are
                                        understood.

                                            facit Aristoteles in III de anima,

                                            phantasmata sicut visus ad colores.
                                            Manifestum est autem quod per hoc
                                            quod species colorum qui sunt in

                                            videatur. Neque ergo etiam ex hoc
                                            quod species phantasmatum quae sunt
                                            in nobis, fiunt in intellectu,

                                            intellectum formaliter intelligimus,
                                            oportet quod ipsum intelligere

                                            non enim diversorum operantium

                                            This will appear more clearly if we
                                            examine the comparison proposed by
                                            Aristotle in Book III of
                                            <i>De anima</i> [7, 431 a 14], where
                                            he says that the intellect is to
                                            phantasm what sight is to color.
                                            Manifestly, the fact that the
                                            species of colors on a wall are in
                                            our vision does not cause the wall
                                            to see, but to be seen. Likewise,
                                            the fact that the species of the
                                            phantasms in us come to be in the
                                            intellect, does not cause us to
                                            understand, but to be understood.
                                            Further, if we understand formally
                                            through the intellect, the
                                            intellectual action of the intellect
                                            must be the intellectual action of
                                            the man, just as the heating action
                                            of fire and of heat are the same.
                                            Therefore, if intellect is
                                            numerically the same in me and in
                                            you, it follows that, with respect
                                            to the same intelligible object, my
                                            action of understanding must be the
                                            same as yours, provided, of course,
                                            both of us understand the same thing
                                            at the same time. But this is
                                            impossible, for different agents
                                            cannot perform one and the same
                                            numerical operation. Therefore it is
                                            impossible for all men to have but a
                                            single intellect. Consequently, if
                                            the intellect is incorruptible, as
                                            has been demonstrated many
                                            intellects, corresponding to the
                                            number of men, will survive the
                                            destruction of their bodies.

                                                    The first argument has many
                                                    defects. First of all, we
                                                    concede that the same thing
                                                    may be understood by all. By
                                                    the thing understood I mean
                                                    that which is the object of
                                                    the intellect. However, the
                                                    object of the intellect is
                                                    not the intelligible
                                                    species, but the quiddity of
                                                    the thing. The intellectual
                                                    sciences are all concerned
                                                    with the natures of things,
                                                    not with intelligible
                                                    species; just as the object
                                                    of sight is color, not the
                                                    species of color in the eye.
                                                    Hence, although there may be
                                                    many intellects belonging to
                                                    different men, the thing
                                                    understood by all may be but
                                                    one; just as a colored
                                                    object which many look at is
                                                    but one. Secondly, the
                                                    consequence does not
                                                    necessarily follow that, if
                                                    a thing is individual, it is
                                                    understood in potency and
                                                    not in act. This is true
                                                    only of things that are
                                                    individuated by matter. Of
                                                    course, what is understood
                                                    in act must be immaterial.
                                                    Accordingly immaterial
                                                    substances, even though they
                                                    may be individuals existing
                                                    by themselves, are
                                                    understood in act. The same
                                                    holds for intelligible
                                                    species, which are
                                                    immaterial; although they
                                                    differ numerically in me and
                                                    in you, they do not on that
                                                    account lose their property
                                                    of being intelligible in
                                                    act. The intellect that
                                                    understands its objects by
                                                    means of them reflects upon
                                                    itself, thereby
                                                    understanding its very
                                                    action of understanding as
                                                    well as the species whereby
                                                    it understands. Moreover, we
                                                    should realize that, even if
                                                    we admit but one intellect
                                                    for all men, the difficulty
                                                    is still the same. There
                                                    would still remain many
                                                    intellects, because there
                                                    are many separate substances
                                                    endowed with intelligence.
                                                    And so it would follow,
                                                    pursuing our adversaries’
                                                    line of reasoning, that the
                                                    objects understood would be
                                                    numerically different, hence
                                                    individual and not
                                                    understood in first act.
                                                    Obviously, therefore, if the
                                                    objection under discussion
                                                    had any cogency, it would do
                                                    away with a plurality of
                                                    intellects simply as such,
                                                    and not merely in men. Since
                                                    this conclusion is false,
                                                    the argument manifestly does
                                                    not conclude with necessity.

                                                            itself, but has only
                                                            an aptitude for
                                                            union with the body.
                                                            Therefore it is

                There were also some philosophers who argued that, even granting
                the diversification of the possible intellect in men, at any
                rate the agent intellect was but one for all. This view, while
                less objectionable than the theory discussed in the preceding
                chapter, can be refuted by similar considerations.

                    Est enim actio intellectus possibilis recipere intellecta et

                    et recipit intellecta, et abstrahit, et intelligit
                    abstracta. Oportet igitur quod tam intellectus possibilis

                    The action of the possible intellect consists in receiving
                    the objects understood and in understanding them. And the
                    action of the agent intellect consists in causing things to
                    be actually understood by abstracting species. But both
                    these functions pertain to one particular man. This man, for
                    example, Socrates or Plato, receives the objects understood,
                    abstracts the species, and understands what is abstracted.
                    Hence the possible intellect as well as the agent intellect
                    must be united to this man as a form. And so both must be
                    numerically multiplied in accord with the number of men
                    concerned.

                        Moreover, agent and patient must be proportionate to
                        each other. Examples are matter and form, for matter is
                        reduced to act by an agent. This is why an active
                        potency of the same genus corresponds to every passive
                        potency; for act and potency pertain to one genus. But
                        the agent intellect is to the possible intellect what
                        active potency is to passive potency, as is clear from
                        this discussion. Hence they must both pertain to one
                        genus. Therefore, since the possible intellect has no
                        separate existence apart from us, but is united to us as
                        a form and is multiplied according to the number of men,
                        as we have shown, the agent intellect must likewise be
                        something that is united to us as a form, and must be
                        multiplied according to the number of men.

                Since the agent intellect and the possible intellect are united
                to us as form, we must acknowledge that they pertain to the same
                essence of the soul. Whatever is formally united to another
                thing, is united to it either in the manner of a substantial
                form or in the manner of an accidental form. If the possible
                intellect and the agent intellect were united to man after the
                fashion of a substantial form, we would have to hold that they
                share in the one essence of that form which is the soul, since
                one thing cannot have more than one substantial form. On the
                other hand, if they are united to man after the fashion of an
                accidental form, neither of them, evidently, can be an accident
                of the body. Besides, the fact that their operations are
                performed without a bodily organ, as we proved above, shows that
                each of them is an accident of the soul. But there is only one
                soul in one man. Therefore the agent intellect and the possible
                intellect must inhere in the one essence of the soul.

                    Furthermore, every action that is proper to a species
                    proceeds from principles that emanate from the form which
                    confers the species. But the action of understanding is an
                    operation proper to the human species. Therefore the agent
                    intellect and the possible intellect, which are principles
                    of this action, as has been shown, emanate from the human
                    soul, whence man has his species. However, they do not issue
                    from the soul in such a way as to extend to the body,
                    because, as we have said, the operation in question takes
                    place independently of a bodily organ. Since, therefore,
                    action pertains to the same subject as does potency, the
                    possible intellect and the agent intellect inhere in the one
                    essence of the soul.

                We have still to consider how this union is possible. Some
                difficulty may seem to arise in this matter. The possible
                intellect is in potency with respect to all that is
                intelligible, whereas the agent intellect causes what is
                intelligible in potency to be intelligible in act, and so must
                be related to what is intelligible as act to potency. But the
                same thing, seemingly, cannot be both in potency and in act with
                respect to the same object. Thus it would appear that the
                possible intellect and the agent intellect cannot be united in
                the same substance of the soul.

                    Haec autem dubitatio de facili solvitur, si quis consideret
                    qualiter intellectus possibilis sit in potentia respectu
                    intelligibilium, et qualiter intellectus agens faciat ea
                    esse in actu. Est enim intellectus possibilis in potentia ad
                    intelligibilia secundum quod non habet in sui natura aliquam
                    determinatam formam rerum sensibilium, sicut pupilla est in
                    potentia ad omnes colores. Inquantum ergo phantasmata a

                    This doubt is easily resolved if we examine how the possible
                    intellect is in potency with respect to intelligible
                    objects, and how the agent intellect renders them actually
                    intelligible. The possible intellect is in potency with
                    regard to intelligible objects in the sense that it does not
                    contain within its nature any determinate form of sensible
                    things. In the same way the pupil of the eye is in potency
                    with regard to all colors. To the extent, then, that
                    phantasms abstracted from sensible things are likenesses of
                    definite sensible things, they are related to the possible
                    intellect as act to potency. Nevertheless the phantasms are
                    in potency with regard to something that the intellectual
                    soul possesses in act, namely, being as abstracted from
                    material conditions. And in this respect the intellectual
                    soul is related to the phantasms as act to potency. No
                    contradiction is involved if a thing is in act and potency
                    with regard to the same object according to different points
                    of view. Thus natural bodies act upon each other and are
                    acted upon by each other, for each is in potency with
                    respect to the other. The same intellectual soul, therefore,
                    can be in potency with regard to al I intelligible objects
                    and nevertheless, without any contradiction, can be related
                    to them as act, if both a possible intellect and an agent
                    intellect are acknowledged in the soul.

                        This will be seen more clearly from the way the
                        intellect renders objects actually intelligible. The
                        agent intellect does not render objects actually
                        intelligible in the sense that the latter flow from it
                        into the possible intellect. If this were the case, we
                        would have no need of phantasms and sense in order to
                        understand. No, the agent intellect renders things
                        actually intelligible by abstracting them from
                        phantasms; just as light, in a certain sense, renders
                        colors actual, not as though it contained the colors
                        within itself, but so far as it confers visibility on
                        them. In the same way we are to judge that there is a
                        single intellectual soul that lacks the natures of
                        sensible things but can receive them in an intelligible
                        manner, and that renders phantasms actually intelligible
                        by abstracting intelligible species from them. The power
                        whereby the soul is able to receive intelligible species
                        is called the possible intellect, and the power whereby
                        it abstracts intelligible species from phantasms is
                        called the agent intellect. The latter is a sort of
                        intelligible light communicated to the intellectual
                        soul, in imitation of what takes place among the higher
                        intellectual substances.

                to the soul alone; for power and action belong to the same
                subject. Some of them, on the other hand, are in the soul both
                as principle and as subject, for their operations pertain to the

                That there cannot be several souls in one body is proved as
                follows. The soul is evidently the substantial form of any being
                possessing a soul, because a living being is constituted in
                genus and species by its soul. But the same thing cannot have
                several substantial forms. A substantial form differs from an
                accidental form in this, that a substantial form causes a
                particular thing simply to be, whereas an accidental form is
                added to a particular being already constituted as such, and
                determines its quality or quantity or its mode of being. Hence,
                if several substantial forms belong to one and the same thing,
                either the first of them causes it to be this particular thing
                or it does not. If it does not, the form is not substantial; if
                it does, then all the subsequent forms accrue to what is already
                this particular thing. Therefore none of the subsequent forms
                will be the substantial form, but only some accidental form.

                        Furthermore, it is evident that a man is said to be
                        living because he bas a vegetative soul, that he is
                        called an animal because he has a sensitive soul, and
                        that he is a man because he has an intellectual soul.
                        Consequently, if there were three souls in man, namely,
                        vegetative, sensitive, and rational, man would be placed
                        in a genus because of one of his souls, and in a species
                        because of another. But this is impossible. For thus
                        genus and specific difference would constitute, not what
                        is simply one, but what is one <i>per accidens</i>, or a
                        sort of conglomeration, such as musical and white; but
                        such is not a being that is simply one. Accordingly a
                        man can have only one soul.

                Videntur autem quaedam huic sententiae adversari. Primo quidem
                quia differentia comparatur ad genus ut forma ad materiam.
                Animal autem est genus hominis, rationale autem est differentia
                constitutiva eius. Cum igitur animal sit corpus animatum anima
                sensitiva, videtur quod corpus animatum anima sensitiva adhuc
                sit in potentia respectu animae rationalis, et sic anima
                rationalis esset anima alia a sensitiva.

                Certain considerations seem opposed to our doctrine. In the
                first place, specific difference is to genus what form is to
                matter. Animal is the genus of man, and rational is the
                difference that makes man what he is. Accordingly, since animal
                is a body animated by a sensitive soul, it seems that a body
                animated by a sensitive soul is still in potency with respect to
                the rational soul. Thus the rational soul would be distinct from
                the sensitive soul.

                    Item. Intellectus non habet organum corporale; sensitivae

                    Moreover, the intellect does not possess a bodily organ. But
                    the sensitive and nutritive powers do possess bodily organs.
                    Hence it seems impossible for the same soul to be both
                    intellectual and sensitive, because the same thing cannot
                    both be separated and not separated from another thing.

                        Furthermore, the rational soul is incorruptible, as was

                        sensitive souls are corruptible, as they are acts of
                        corruptible organs. Therefore the rational soul is not
                        the same as the vegetative and the sensitive souls, for
                        the same thing cannot be both corruptible and

                            Besides, in the generation of man the life conferred
                            by the vegetative soul appears before the fetus is
                            observed to be an animal from its sense activity and
                            motion; and this same being is discerned to be an
                            animal through its sense activity and movement
                            before it has an intellect. Therefore, if the soul
                            by which the fetus first lives the life of a plant,
                            then the life of an animal, and thirdly the life of
                            a man, is the same, it would follow that the
                            vegetative, sensitive, and rational principles come
                            from an outside source, or else that the
                            intellectual soul arises from the energy in the
                            semen. Both of these alternatives are inadmissible.
                            On the one hand, since the operations of the
                            vegetative and sensitive soul are not exercised
                            apart from the body, their principles cannot be
                            without a body. On the other hand, the operation of
                            the intellectual soul is exercised without a body;
                            and so, apparently, no bodily energy can be its
                            cause. Therefore the same soul cannot be vegetative,
                            sensitive, and rational.

                that, in numbers, species are diversified by adding one to
                another. Whatever perfection is found in lifeless bodies, plants
                also possess, and more besides. Again, whatever plants have,
                animals have too, and something else in addition. And thus we
                proceed until we come to man, the most perfect of bodily
                creatures. All that is imperfect is related as matter to what is
                more perfect. This is clear in the various classes of beings.

                    The elements constitute the matter of bodies that are
                    composed of similar parts; and again, bodies having similar
                    parts are matter with respect to animals. And this is
                    likewise to be observed in one and the same being. Among
                    natural things, that which is endowed with a higher degree
                    of perfection has, in virtue of its form, whatever
                    perfection is found in lower nature, and in virtue of the
                    same form has, besides, its own added perfection. Through
                    its soul, the plant is a substance, and is corporeal, and
                    besides is an animated body. Through its soul, an animal has
                    all these perfections, and moreover is sentient. In addition
                    to all this, man is intelligent through his soul. Thus, in
                    any object, if we consider what pertains to the perfection
                    of a lower grade of being, this will be material when
                    compared with what pertains to the perfection of a higher
                    grade. For example, if we observe that an animal has the
                    life of a plant, this life is in some fashion material with
                    respect to what pertains to sensitive life, which is
                    characteristic of an animal.

                        Genus, of course, is not matter, for then it would not
                        be predicated of the whole. But it is something derived
                        from matter; for the designation attaching to a thing in
                        terms of what is material in it, is its genus. Specific
                        difference is derived from the form of a thing in the
                        same way. This is the reason why living or animated body
                        is the genus of animal, and sensitive is the specific
                        difference that constitutes it. Similarly, animal is the
                        genus of man, and rational is the difference that
                        constitutes him. Therefore, since the form of a higher
                        grade of being comprises within itself all the
                        perfections of a lower grade, there is not, in reality,
                        one form from which genus is derived, and another from
                        which specific difference is derived. Rather, genus is
                        derived from a form so far as it has a perfection of
                        lower degree, and specific difference is derived from
                        the same form so far as it has a perfection of higher
                        degree.

                                being is higher in proportion as it is less
                                subject to matter. And so the nobler a form is,
                                the more it must be elevated above matter.

                                    sunt principia operationum quae exercentur

                                    Hence the human soul, which is the noblest
                                    of all forms of matter, attains to the
                                    highest level of elevation, where it enjoys
                                    an activity that is independent of the
                                    concurrence of corporeal matter. Yet, since
                                    the same soul includes the perfection of
                                    lower levels, it also has activities in
                                    which corporeal matter shares. However, an
                                    activity is exercised by a thing in
                                    accordance with the thing’s power. Therefore
                                    the human soul must have some powers or
                                    potentialities that are principles of
                                    activities exercised through the body, and
                                    these must be actions of certain parts of
                                    the body. Such are the powers of the
                                    vegetative and sensitive parts. The soul has
                                    also certain powers that are the principles
                                    of activities exercised without the body.
                                    Such are the powers of the intellectual
                                    part, whose actions are not performed by any
                                    organs. For this reason both the possible
                                    intellect and the agent intellect are said
                                    to be separate; they have no organs as
                                    principles of their actions, such as sight
                                    and hearing have, but inhere in the soul
                                    alone, which is the form of the body. Hence
                                    we need not conclude, from the fact that the
                                    intellect is said to be separate and lacks a
                                    bodily organ, whereas neither of these is
                                    true of the senses, that the intellectual
                                    soul is distinct from the sensitive soul in
                                    man.

                                        This also makes it clear that we are not
                                        forced to admit an intellectual soul
                                        distinct from the sensitive soul in man
                                        on the ground that the sensitive soul is
                                        corruptible whereas the intellectual
                                        soul is incorruptible, as the third
                                        objection set out to prove.
                                        Incorruptibility pertains to the
                                        intellectual part so far as it is
                                        separate. Therefore, as powers that are
                                        separate, in the sense mentioned above,
                                        and powers that are not separate, are
                                        all rooted in the same essence of the
                                        soul, there is nothing to prevent some
                                        of the powers of the soul from lapsing
                                        when the body perishes, while others
                                        remain incorruptible.

                                            The points already made lead to a
                                            solution of the fourth objection.
                                            All natural movement gradually
                                            advances from imperfect to perfect.
                                            The same quality is receptive of
                                            greater and less; hence alteration,
                                            which is movement in quality, being
                                            unified and continuous in its
                                            progress from potency to act,
                                            advances from imperfect to perfect.
                                            But substantial form is not
                                            receptive of greater and less, for
                                            the substantial nature of each being
                                            exists indivisibly. Therefore
                                            natural generation does not proceed
                                            continuously through many
                                            intermediate stages from imperfect
                                            to perfect, but at each level of
                                            perfection a new generation and
                                            corruption must take place. Thus in
                                            the generation of a man the fetus
                                            first lives the life of a plant
                                            through the vegetative soul; next,
                                            when this form is removed by
                                            corruption it acquires, by a sort of
                                            new generation, a sensitive soul and
                                            lives the life of an animal;
                                            finally, when this soul is in turn
                                            removed by corruption, the ultimate
                                            and complete form is introduced.
                                            This is the rational soul, which
                                            comprises within itself whatever
                                            perfection was found in the previous

                This ultimate and complete form, the rational soul, is brought
                into existence, not by the power that is in the semen, but by a
                higher cause. For the power that is in the semen is a bodily
                power. But the rational soul exceeds the whole nature and power
                of the body, since no body can rise to the heights of the soul’s
                intellectual activity. Nothing can act in a way that surmounts
                its species, because the agent is nobler than the patient, and
                the maker excels his product. Hence the power possessed by a
                body cannot produce the rational soul, nor, consequently, can
                the energy inherent in the semen do so.

                    Moreover, a thing that has new existence must also have a
                    new becoming; for that which is, must first become, since a
                    thing becomes in order that it may be. Thus things which
                    have being in their own right must have becoming in their
                    own right; such are subsistent beings. But things that do
                    not possess being in their own right do not properly have a
                    becoming; such are accidents and material forms. The
                    rational soul has being in its own right, because it has its
                    own operation, as is clear from our previous discussion.
                    Therefore becoming is properly predicated of the rational
                    soul. Since the soul is not composed of matter and form, as
                    was shown above, it cannot be brought into being except by
                    creation. But God alone can create, as we said above.
                    Consequently the rational soul is produced by God alone.

                        We can readily understand why this should be so. In all
                        arts that are hierarchically related to one another, we
                        observe that the highest art induces the ultimate form,
                        whereas the lower arts dispose matter for the reception
                        of the ultimate form. The rational soul, evidently, is
                        the ultimate and most perfect form that the matter of
                        beings subject to generation and corruption can achieve.
                        Therefore natural agents, which operate on lower levels,
                        appropriately cause preliminary dispositions and forms,
                        whereas the supreme agent, God, causes the ultimate
                        form, which is the rational soul.

                However, we are not to imagine that the rational soul is derived
                from the substance of God, as some have erroneously thought. We
                demonstrated above that God is simple and indivisible. Therefore
                He does not join the rational soul to a body as though He had
                first severed it from His own substance.

                    Furthermore, we pointed out above that God cannot be the
                    form of any body. But the rational soul is united to the
                    body as the latter’s form. Hence it is not derived from the
                    substance of God.

                        Himself or by reason of some other thing that is moved.
                        But the contrary of this is observed to take place in
                        the rational soul, which is moved from ignorance to
                        knowledge, from vice to virtue. Accordingly the soul is
                        not of the substance of God.

                The doctrine established above necessarily leads to the
                conclusion that things that cannot be brought into existence
                except by creation, come immediately from God. Thus the heavenly
                bodies, as is manifest, cannot be produced except by creation.
                They cannot be said to be made from some preexisting matter, for
                then they would be capable of generation and corruption, and
                would also be subject to contrariety. But they are not, as their
                motion proves. For they move in circles, and circular motion has
                no contrary. Consequently the heavenly bodies were produced
                immediately by God.

                    Similiter etiam elementa secundum se tota non sunt ex aliqua

                    Similarly the elements, regarded as complete units, do not
                    come from any pre-existing matter. Anything that would thus
                    pre-exist would have some form. And thus some body, other
                    than the elements, would exist prior to them in the order of
                    material cause. But if the matter existing prior to the
                    elements had a distinct form, one of the elements would have
                    to be prior to the others in the same order, supposing that
                    the pre-existing matter had the form of an element.
                    Therefore the very elements must have been produced
                    immediately by God.

                        It is even more impossible for incorporeal and invisible
                        substances to be created by some one else, for all such
                        substances are immaterial. Matter cannot exist unless it
                        is subject to dimension, whereby it is capable of being
                        marked off, so that many things can be made from the
                        same matter. Hence immaterial substances cannot be made
                        from pre-existing matter. Consequently they can be
                        produced only by God through creation. For this reason
                        the Catholic faith professes that God is the “Creator of
                        heaven and earth, and of all things visible,” and also
                        “of all things invisible.”

                The truth set forth in the preceding chapter also discloses the
                fact that God has brought things into existence not through any
                necessity of His nature but by His will. A single natural agent
                produces immediately but one effect, whereas a voluntary, agent
                can produce a variety of effects. The reason for this is that
                every agent acts in virtue of its form. The natural form,
                whereby a cause operates naturally, is limited to one for each
                agent. But intellectual forms, whereby an agent operates through
                his will, are many. Therefore, since many things are immediately
                produced by God, as we have just shown, God evidently produces
                things by His will, and not under the impulse of natural
                necessity.

                    Adhuc. Agens per intellectum et voluntatem est prius in
                    ordine agentium agente per necessitatem naturae: nam agens
                    per voluntatem praestituit sibi finem propter quem agit;
                    agens autem naturale agit propter finem sibi ab alio
                    praestitutum. Manifestum est autem ex praemissis, Deum esse
                    primum agens. Est igitur agens per voluntatem, et non per
                    necessitatem naturae.

                  <td>
                    Besides, in the order of causes, an agent operating through
                    intellect and will is prior to an agent operating by the
                    necessity of its nature. For an agent operating through his
                    will predetermines for himself the end for the sake of which
                    he acts, whereas a natural cause operates on account of an
                    end predetermined for it by another. But, as is clear from
                    all that has gone before, God is the first agent. Hence He
                    acts through His will, and not by a necessity of His nature.

                        necessitatem naturae, sed per voluntatem. Inde est quod
                        fides Catholica Deum omnipotentem non solum creatorem,
                        sed etiam factorem nominat: nam facere proprie est
                        artificis qui per voluntatem operatur. Et quia omne
                        agens voluntarium, per conceptionem sui intellectus
                        agit, quae verbum ipsius dicitur, ut supra ostensum est,
                        verbum autem Dei filius est: ideo fides Catholica
                        confitetur de filio, quod per eum omnia facta sunt.

                        Moreover, we demonstrated above that God is infinite in
                        power. Consequently He is not determined to this or that
                        effect, but is undetermined with regard to all effects.
                        But what is undetermined regarding various effects, is
                        determined to produce one of them by desire or by the
                        determination of the will. Thus a man who is free to
                        walk or not to walk, walks when he wills. Hence effects
                        proceed from God according to the determination of His
                        will. And so He acts, not by a necessity of His nature,
                        but by His will. This is why the Catholic faith calls
                        the omnipotent God not only “Creator,” but also “Maker.”
                        For making is properly the action of an artificer who
                        operates by his will. And since every voluntary agent
                        acts in virtue of the conception of his intellect, which
                        is called his word, as we indicated above, and since the
                        Word of God is His Son, the Catholic faith professes
                        that “all things were made” by the Son.

                The fact that God produces things by His will clearly shows that
                He can produce new things without any change in Himself. The
                difference between a natural agent and a voluntary agent is
                this: a natural agent acts consistently in the same manner as
                long as it is in the same condition. Such as it is, thus does it
                act. But a voluntary agent acts as he wills. Accordingly it may
                well be that, without any change in himself, he wishes to act
                now and not previously. For there is nothing to prevent a person
                from willing to perform an action later, even though he is not
                doing it now; and this without any change in himself. Thus it
                can happen, without any change in God, that God, although He is
                eternal, did not bring things into existence from eternity.

                We might imagine that, although God can produce a new effect by
                His eternal and immutable will, some sort of motion would have
                to precede the newly produced effect. For we observe that the
                will does not delay doing what it wishes to do, unless because
                of some motive that is operative now but will cease later, or
                because of some motive that is inoperative now but is expected
                to become operative in the future. In summer a man has the will
                to clothe himself with a warm garment, which, however, he does
                not wish to put on at present, but in the future; for now the
                weather is warm, although it will cease to be warm with the
                advent of a cold wave later in the year.

                    Accordingly, if God wished from eternity to produce some
                    effect, but did not produce it from eternity, it seems
                    either that something was expected to happen in the future
                    that had not yet occurred, or else that some obstacle had to
                    be removed that was then present. Neither of these
                    alternatives can take place without motion. Thus it seems
                    that a subsequent effect cannot be produced by a preceding
                    will unless some motion previously occurs. And so, if God’s
                    will relative to the production of things was eternal, and
                    nevertheless things were not produced from eternity, their
                    production must have been preceded by motion, and
                    consequently by mobile objects. And if the latter were
                    produced by God, but not from eternity, yet other motions
                    and mobile objects must have preceded, and so on, in
                    infinite recession.

                        The solution to this objection readily comes to mind if
                        we but attend to the difference between a universal and
                        a particular agent. A particular agent has an activity
                        that conforms to a norm and measure prescribed by the
                        universal agent. This is clear even in civil government.
                        The legislator enacts a law which is to serve as a norm
                        and measure. Any particular judge must base his
                        decisions on this law. Again, time is the measure of
                        actions which occur in time. A particular agent is
                        endowed with activity regulated by time, so that he acts
                        for some definite reason now, and not before. But the
                        universal agent, God, instituted this measure, which is
                        time, and He did so in accord with His will. Hence time
                        also is to be numbered among the things produced by God.
                        Therefore, just as the quantity and measure of each
                        object are such as God wishes to assign to it, so the
                        quantity of time is such as God wished to mete out; that
                        is, time and the things existing in time began just when
                        God wished them to begin.

                            The objection we are dealing with argues from the
                            standpoint of an agent that presupposes time and
                            acts in time, but did not institute time. Hence the
                            question, why God’s eternal will produces an effect
                            now and not earlier, presupposes that time exists;
                            for “now” and “earlier” are segments of time. With
                            regard to the universal production of things, among
                            which time is also to be counted, we should not ask:
                            “Why now and not earlier?” Rather we should ask:
                            “Why did God wish this much time to intervene?” And
                            this depends on the divine will, which is perfectly
                            free to assign this or any other quantity to time.
                            The same may be noted with respect to the
                            dimensional quantity of the world. No one asks why
                            God located the material world in such and such a
                            place rather than higher up or lower down or in some
                            other position; for there is no place outside the
                            world. The fact that God portioned out so much
                            quantity to the world that no part of it would be
                            beyond the place occupied in some other locality,
                            depends on the divine will. However, although there
                            was no time prior to the world and no place outside
                            the world, we speak as if there were. Thus we say
                            that before the world existed there was nothing
                            except God, and that there is no body lying outside
                            the world. But in thus speaking of “before” and
                            “outside,” we have in mind nothing but time and
                            place as they exist in our imagination.

                enim quod habet esse post non esse, mutatur de non esse ad esse.

                However, even though finished products were not in existence
                from eternity, we might be inclined to think that matter had to
                exist from eternity. For everything that has being subsequent to
                non-being, is changed from non-being to being. Therefore if
                created things, such as heaven and earth and the like, did not
                exist from eternity, but began to be after they had not been, we
                must admit that they were changed from non-being to being. But
                all change and motion have some sort of subject; for motion is
                the act of a thing existing in potency. However, the subject of
                the change whereby a thing is brought into existence, is not the
                thing itself that is produced, because this thing is the
                terminus of the motion, and the terminus and subject of motion
                are not the same. Rather, the subject of the change is that from
                which the thing is produced, and this is called matter.
                Accordingly, if things are brought into being after a state of
                non-being, it seems that matter had to exist prior to them. And
                if this matter is, in turn, produced subsequent to a period of
                non-existence, it had to come from some other, pre-existing
                matter. But infinite procession along these lines is impossible.
                Therefore we must eventually come to eternal matter, which was
                not produced subsequent to a period of non-existence.

                    Again, if the world began to exist after it had first not
                    existed, then, before the world actually existed, it was
                    either possible for the world to be or become, or it was not
                    possible. If it was not possible for the world to be or to
                    become, then, by equipollence, it was impossible for the
                    world to be or to become. But if it is impossible for a
                    thing to become, it is necessary for that thing not to
                    become. In that case we must conclude that the world was not
                    made. Since this conclusion is patently false, we are forced
                    to admit that if the world began to be after it had first
                    not been, it was possible for it to be or to become before
                    it actually existed. Accordingly there was something in
                    potency with regard to the becoming and being of the world.
                    But what is thus in potency to the becoming and existence of
                    something, is the matter of that something, as we see
                    exemplified in the case of wood relative to a bench.
                    Apparently, therefore, matter must have existed always, even
                    if the world did not exist always.

                        As against this line of reasoning, we showed above that
                        the very matter of the world has no existence except
                        from God. Catholic faith does not admit that matter is
                        eternal any more than it admits that the world is
                        eternal. We have no other way of expressing the divine
                        causality in things themselves than by saying that
                        things produced by God began to exist after they had
                        previously not existed. This way of speaking evidently
                        and clearly brings out the truth that they have
                        existence not of themselves, but from the eternal
                        Author.

                            creation, extends to all the reality that is found
                            in a thing, production of this kind cannot properly
                            verify the idea of change, even though the things
                            created are brought into existence subsequently to
                            non-existence. Being that succeeds to non-being,
                            does not suffice to constitute real change, unless
                            we suppose that a subject is first in a state of
                            privation, and later under its proper form. Hence
                            “this” is found coming after “that” in certain
                            things in which motion or change do not really
                            occur, as when we say that day turns into night.
                            Accordingly, even though the world began to exist
                            after having not existed, this is not necessarily
                            the result of some change. In fact, it is the result
                            of creation, which is not a true change, but is
                            rather a certain relation of the created thing, as a
                            being that is dependent on the Creator for its
                            existence and that connotes succession to previous
                            non-existence. In every change there must be
                            something that remains the same although it
                            undergoes alteration in its manner of being, in the
                            sense that at first it is under one extreme and
                            subsequently under another. In creation this does
                            not take place in objective reality, but only in our
                            imagination. That is, we imagine that one and the
                            same thing previously did not exist, and later
                            existed. And so creation can be called change,
                            because it has some resemblance to change.

                                esset, possibile erat mundum esse vel fieri, non
                                tamen oportet hoc secundum aliquam potentiam
                                dici. Dicitur enim possibile in enuntiabilibus

                                scilicet neque est necessarium neque

                                philosophus docet in VII Metaphysic. Si autem

                                The second objection, too, lacks cogency.
                                Although we can truly say that before the world
                                was, it was possible for the world to be or to
                                become, this possibility need not be taken to
                                mean potentiality. In propositions, that which
                                signifies a certain modality of truth, or in
                                other words, that which is neither necessary nor
                                impossible, is said to be possible. What is
                                possible in this sense does not involve any
                                potentiality, as the Philosopher teaches in Book
                                V of his <i>Metaphysics</i> [12, 1019 b 19].
                                However, if anyone insists on saying that it was
                                possible for the world to exist according to
                                some potency, we reply that this need not mean a
                                passive potency, but can mean active potency;
                                and so if we say that it was possible for the
                                world to be before it actually was, we should
                                understand this to mean that God could have
                                brought the world into existence before He
                                actually produced it. Hence we are not forced to
                                postulate that matter existed before the world.
                                Thus Catholic faith acknowledges nothing to be
                                co-eternal with God, and for this reason
                                professes that He is the “Creator and Maker of
                                all things visible and invisible.”

                We showed above that God has brought things into existence, not
                through any necessity of His nature, but by His intellect and
                Will. Any agent that works in this way, acts for an end: the end
                is a principle for the operative intellect. Accordingly
                everything that is made by God necessarily exists for an end.

                    Moreover, things were produced by God in a supremely
                    excellent way; for the most perfect Being does everything in
                    the most perfect way. But it is better for a thing to be
                    made for an end than to be made without the intention of
                    achieving an end; for the goodness that is in things which
                    are made comes from their end. Hence things were made by God
                    for an end.

                        it is absurd to say that things produced by nature are
                        in better order than is the very constituting of nature

                        derived from the latter. Clearly, therefore, things

                The ultimate end of things is necessarily the divine goodness.
                For the ultimate end of things produced by one who works through
                his will is that which is chiefly and for its own sake willed by
                the agent. It is for this that the agent does all that he does.
                But the first object willed by the divine will is God’s
                goodness, as is clear from a previous discussion. Hence the
                ultimate end of all things made by God must necessarily be the
                divine goodness.

                    Furthermore, the end of the generation of everything that is
                    generated is its form. Once this is achieved, generation
                    ceases. For everything that is generated, whether by art or
                    by nature, is in some way rendered similar to the agent in
                    virtue of its form, since every agent produces an effect
                    that has some resemblance to the agent himself. Thus the
                    house that is realized in matter proceeds from the house
                    existing ideally in the mind of the architect. In the realm
                    of nature, likewise, man begets man. And if anything that is
                    generated or effected by natural processes is not like its
                    generating cause according to species, it is at any rate
                    likened to its efficient causes as imperfect to perfect. The
                    fact that a generated product is not assimilated to its
                    generating cause according to species, is explained by its
                    inability to rise to perfect likeness with its cause; but it
                    does participate in that cause to some extent, however
                    imperfectly. This occurs, for example, in animals and plants
                    that are generated by the power of the sun. Hence in all
                    things that are made, the end of their generation or
                    production is the form of their maker or generator, in the
                    sense that they are to achieve a likeness of that form. But
                    the form of the first agent, who is God, is nothing else
                    than His goodness. This, then, is the reason why all things
                    were made: that they might be assimilated to the divine
                    goodness.

                Ex hoc igitur accipienda est ratio diversitatis et distinctionis
                in rebus. Quia enim divinam bonitatem perfecte repraesentari
                impossibile fuit propter distantiam uniuscuiusque creaturae a
                Deo, necessarium fuit ut repraesentaretur per multa, ut quod
                deest ex uno, suppleretur ex alio. Nam et in conclusionibus
                syllogisticis quando per unum medium non sufficienter
                demonstratur conclusio, oportet media multiplicari ad
                conclusionis manifestationem, ut in syllogismis dialecticis
                accidit. Nec tota tamen universitas creaturarum perfecte divinam
                bonitatem repraesentat per aequiparantiam, sed secundum
                perfectionem creaturae possibilem.

                This enables us to grasp the reason for diversity and
                distinction in things. Since the divine goodness could not be
                adequately represented by one creature alone, on account of the
                distance that separates each creature from God, it had to be
                represented by many creatures, so that what is lacking to one
                might be supplied by another. Even in syllogistic conclusions,
                when the conclusion is not sufficiently demonstrated by one
                means of proof, the means must be multiplied in order to make
                the conclusion clear, as happens in dialectic syllogisms. Of
                course, not even the entire universe of creatures perfectly
                represents the divine goodness by setting it forth adequately,
                but represents it only in the measure of perfection possible to
                creatures.

                    Item. Illud quod inest causae universali simpliciter et
                    unite, invenitur in effectibus multipliciter et distincte:
                    nobilius est enim aliquid in causa quam in effectibus.
                    Divina autem bonitas una et simplex principium est et radix
                    totius bonitatis quae in creaturis invenitur. Necesse est
                    igitur sic creaturas divinae bonitati assimilari sicut multa
                    et indistincta assimilantur uni et simplici. Sic igitur
                    multitudo et distinctio provenit in rebus non casualiter aut
                    fortuito, sicut nec rerum productio est a casu vel a
                    fortuna, sed propter finem. Ex eodem enim principio est esse
                    et unitas et multitudo in rebus.

                    Moreover, a perfection existing in a universal cause simply
                    and in a unified manner, is found to be multiple and
                    discrete in the effects of that cause. For a perfection has
                    a nobler existence in a cause than in its effects. But the
                    divine goodness is one, and is the simple principle and root
                    of all the goodness found in creatures. Hence creatures must
                    be assimilated to the divine goodness in the way that many
                    and distinct objects are assimilated to what is one and
                    simple. Therefore multiplicity and distinction occur in
                    things not by chance or fortune but for an end, just as the
                    production of things is not the result of chance or fortune,
                    but is for an end. For existence, unity, and multiplicity in
                    things all come from the same principle.

                            Furthermore, multiplicity in things is not explained
                            by the order obtaining among intermediate agents, as
                            though from one, simple first being, there could
                            proceed directly only one thing that would be far
                            removed from the first being in simplicity, so that
                            multitude could issue from it, and thus, as the
                            distance from the first, simple being increased, the
                            more numerous a multitude would be discerned. Some
                            have suggested this explanation. But we have shown
                            that there are many things that could not have come
                            into being except by creation, which is exclusively
                            the work of God, as has been proved. Hence we
                            conclude that many things have been created directly
                            by God Himself. It is likewise evident that,
                            according to the view under criticism, the
                            multiplicity and distinction among things would be
                            fortuitous, as not being intended by the first
                            agent. Actually, however, the multiplicity and
                            distinction existing among things were devised by
                            the divine intellect and were carried out in the
                            real order so that the divine goodness might be
                            mirrored by created things in variety, and that
                            different things might participate in the divine
                            goodness in varying degree. Thus the very order
                            existing among diverse things issues in a certain
                            beauty, which should call to mind the divine wisdom.

                The divine goodness is not only the end of the creation of
                things; it must also be the end of every operation and movement
                of any creature whatever. The action of every being corresponds
                to its nature; for example, what is hot, causes heat. But every

                    Hence every movement and action of anything whatever tend

                    supreme Good, just as all being is an imitation of the first

                        directed to the good of the first agent as to their
                        ultimate end. For lower agents are moved by the higher
                        agent, and every mover moves in the direction of his own
                        end. Consequently the actions and movements of lower
                        agents must tend toward the end of the first agent. Thus

                        His end is nothing else than His goodness. Therefore all
                        the actions and movements of all creatures exist on
                        account of the divine goodness, not, of course, in the
                        sense that they are to cause or increase it, but in the
                        sense that they are to acquire it in their own way, by
                        sharing to some extent in a likeness of it.

                            their operations in different ways, as they also
                            represent it in different ways conformably to their
                            being. For each of them acts in a manner
                            corresponding to its being. Therefore, as all
                            creatures in common represent the divine goodness to
                            the extent that they exist, so by their actions they
                            all in common attain to the divine likeness in the
                            conservation of their being and in the communication
                            of their being to others. For every creature
                            endeavors, by its activity, first of all to keep
                            itself in perfect being, so far as this is possible.
                            In such endeavor it tends, in its own way, to an
                            imitation of the divine permanence. Secondly, every
                            creature strives, by its activity, to communicate
                            its own perfect being, in its own fashion, to
                            another; and in this it tends toward an imitation of
                            the divine causality.

                                The rational creature tends, by its activity,
                                toward the divine likeness in a special way that
                                exceeds the capacities of all other creatures,
                                as it also has a nobler existence as compared
                                with other creatures. The existence of other
                                creatures is finite, since it is hemmed in by
                                matter, and so lacks infinity both in act and in
                                potency. But every rational nature has infinity
                                either in act or in potency, according to the
                                way its intellect contains intelligibles. Thus
                                our intellectual nature, considered in its first
                                state, is in potency to its intelligibles; since
                                these are infinite, they have a certain
                                potential infinity. Hence the intellect is the
                                species of species, because it has a species
                                that is not determined to one thing alone, as is
                                the case with a stone, but that has a capacity
                                for all species. But the intellectual nature of
                                God is infinite in act, for prior to every
                                consideration it has within itself the
                                perfection of all being, as was shown above.
                                Accordingly intellectual creatures occupy a
                                middle position between potency and act. By its
                                activity, therefore, the intellectual creature
                                tends toward the divine likeness, not only in
                                the sense that it preserves itself in existence,
                                or that it multiplies its existence, in a way,
                                by communicating it; it also has as its end the
                                possession in act of what by nature it possesses
                                in potency. Consequently the end of the
                                intellectual creature, to be achieved by its
                                activity, is the complete actuation of its
                                intellect by all the intelligibles for which it
                                has a potency. In this respect it will become
                                most like to God.

                A thing may be in potency in two ways: either naturally, that
                is, with respect to perfections that can be reduced to act by a
                natural agent; or else with respect to perfections that cannot
                be reduced to act by a natural agent but require some other
                agent. This is seen to take place even in corporeal beings. The
                boy grows up to be a man; the spermatozoon develops into an
                animal. This is within the power of nature. But that lumber
                becomes a bench or that a blind man receives sight, is not
                within the power of nature.

                    The same is the case with our minds. Our intellect has a
                    natural potency with regard to certain intelligible objects,
                    namely, those that can be reduced to act by the agent
                    intellect. We possess this faculty as an innate principle
                    that enables us to understand in actuality. However, we
                    cannot attain our ultimate end by the actuation of our
                    intellect through the instrumentality of the agent
                    intellect. For the function of the agent intellect consists
                    in rendering actually intelligible the phantasms that of
                    themselves are only potentially intelligible. This was
                    explained above. These phantasms are derived from the
                    senses. Hence the efficacy of the agent intellect in
                    reducing our intellect to act is restricted to intelligible
                    objects of which we can gain knowledge by way of sense
                    perception. Man’s last end cannot consist in such cognition.

                        reached, natural desire ceases. But no matter how much
                        we may advance in this kind of understanding, whereby we
                        derive knowledge from the senses, there still remains a
                        natural desire to know other objects. For many things
                        are quite beyond the reach of the senses. We can have
                        but a slight knowledge of such things through
                        information based on sense experience. We may get to
                        know that they exist, but we cannot know what they are,
                        for the natures of immaterial substances belong to a
                        different genus from the natures of sensible things and
                        excel them, we may say, beyond all proportion.

                                Accordingly we reach our last end when our
                                intellect is actualized by some higher agent
                                than an agent connatural to us, that is, by an
                                agent capable of gratifying our natural, inborn
                                craving for knowledge. So great is the desire
                                for knowledge within us that, once we apprehend
                                an effect, we wish to know its cause. Moreover,
                                after we have gained some knowledge of the
                                circumstances investing a thing, our desire is
                                not satisfied until we penetrate to its essence.
                                Therefore our natural desire for knowledge
                                cannot come to rest within us until we know the
                                first cause, and that not in any way, but in its
                                very essence. This first cause is God.
                                Consequently the ultimate end of an intellectual
                                creature is the vision of God in His essence.

                The possibility of such knowledge must be investigated.
                Manifestly, since our intellect knows nothing except through an
                intelligible species of the thing known, the species of one
                thing cannot disclose the essence of another thing. In
                proportion as the species, whereby the mind knows, is remote
                from the thing known, the less perfect is the knowledge our
                intellect has of that thing’s essence. For example, if we should
                know an ox by the species of an ass, we would have an imperfect
                knowledge of the essence of the ox, for our concept would be
                limited to its genus. Our knowledge would be still more
                defective if we were to know the ox through the medium of a
                stone, because then we would know it by a more remote genus. And
                if our knowledge were gained through the species of a thing that
                did not agree with the ox in any genus, we could not know the
                essence of the ox at all.

                    Previous discussion has brought out the fact that no
                    creature is associated with God in genus. Hence the essence
                    of God cannot be known through any created species whatever,
                    whether sensible or intelligible. Accordingly, if God is to
                    be known as He is, in His essence, God Himself must become
                    the form of the intellect knowing Him and must be joined to
                    that intellect, not indeed so as to constitute a single
                    nature with it, but in the way an intelligible species is
                    joined to the intelligence. For God, who is His own being,
                    is also His own truth, and truth is the form of the
                    intellect.

                        in Psal. XXXV, 10, dicitur: in lumine tuo videbimus

                        Whatever receives a form, must first acquire the
                        disposition requisite to the reception of that form. Our
                        intellect is not equipped by its nature with the
                        ultimate disposition looking to that form which is
                        truth; otherwise it would be in possession of truth from
                        the beginning. Consequently, when it does finally attain
                        to truth, it must be elevated by some disposition newly
                        conferred on it. And this we call the light of glory,
                        whereby our intellect is perfected by God, who alone by
                        His very nature has this form properly as His own. In
                        somewhat the same way the disposition which heat has for
                        the form of fire can come from fire alone. This is the
                        light that is spoken of in Psalm 35: 10: “In Your light
                        we shall see light.”

                    part of Him, for He has no parts. It means that we shall not

                observe this, for instance, in the earth’s gravity with respect
                to whatever is borne downward. No object would move naturally
                toward a definite end unless it had a proportion to that end. We
                may consider, secondly, the motion itself toward its end;
                thirdly, the form or place toward which there is motion; and
                fourthly, the repose in the form educed or in the place reached.

                    Similarly, with regard to intellectual movement toward an
                    end, there is, first, the love inclining toward the end;
                    secondly, the desire which is a sort of motion toward the
                    end, and the actions issuing from such desire; thirdly, the
                    form which the intellect receives; and fourthly, the
                    resulting delight, which is nothing else than the repose of
                    the will in the end as reached.

                        In the same way, the end of natural generation is a form
                        and the end of local motion is a place. However, repose
                        in a form or a place is not the end, but follows upon
                        the attainment of the end; and much less does the end
                        consist in motion or in proportion to the end. Likewise
                        the ultimate end of an intellectual creature is the
                        direct vision of God, but not delight in God. Such
                        delight accompanies attainment of the end and, as it
                        were, perfects it. Much less can desire or love be the
                        ultimate end, because they are present even before the
                        end is reached.

                Clearly, therefore, they are in error who seek happiness in
                various things outside of God. Some look for happiness in carnal
                pleasures, which are shared even by brute animals. Others seek
                happiness in wealth, which is rightly directed to the sustenance
                of those who have such possessions; this is an end common to
                every created being. Others place their happiness in power,
                which is ordained to the communication of one’s own perfection
                to others; this, too, we said, is common to all beings. Yet
                others seek happiness in honors or reputation, which are due to
                a person because of the end he has already reached, or because
                of the noble dispositions which equip him to reach an end.
                Finally, happiness does not consist in the knowledge of any
                created things whatever, even though they may be far above man;
                for man’s desire comes to rest in the knowledge of God alone.

                All this brings to light the different relationship that God and
                creatures have to goodness. We may examine this difference from
                the standpoint of the two kinds of goodness discerned in
                creatures. Since the good has the nature of perfection and of
                end, the twofold perfection and end of the creature disclose its
                twofold goodness. A certain perfection is observed in the
                creature inasmuch as it persists in its nature. This perfection
                is the end of its generation or formation. The creature has a
                further perfection which it reaches by its motion or activity.
                This perfection is the end of its movement or operation.

                    In both kinds of perfection the creature falls short of the
                    divine goodness. The form and existence of a thing are its
                    good and perfection when considered from the standpoint of
                    the thing’s nature. But a composite substance is neither its
                    own form nor its own existence; and a simple substance,
                    although it is its own form, is not its own existence. God,
                    however, is His own essence and His own existence, as was

                        Likewise, all creatures receive their perfect goodness
                        from an end extrinsic to them. For the perfection of
                        goodness consists in attainment of the ultimate end. But
                        the ultimate end of any creature is outside the
                        creature. This end is the divine goodness, which is not
                        ordained to any ulterior end. Consequently God is His
                        own goodness in every way and is essentially good. This
                        cannot be said of simple creatures, because they are not
                        their own existence, and also because they are ordained
                        to something external as to their ultimate end. As for
                        composite substances, clearly they are not their own
                        goodness in any way. Hence God alone is His own
                        goodness, and He alone is essentially good. All other
                        beings are said to be good according as they
                        participate, to some extent, in Him.

                The foregoing account clearly shows that God cannot in any way

                cannot be lacking; animality, for instance, cannot be
                dissociated from man. Hence it is impossible for God not to be
                good. We can use a more appropriate example to illustrate this:
                as it is impossible for a man not to be a man, so it is
                impossible for God not to be perfectly good.

                secondly, the creature’s goodness is something determinate.

                    essentialiter sint formae. Secundo autem modo bonum quod est

                    since they are essentially forms. As regards the second
                    point of view, such substances cannot lose the good which is
                    existence. For form is not like matter, which is indifferent
                    to existence and nonexistence. On the contrary, form goes
                    with existence, even though it is not existence itself.

                        Therefore simple substances cannot lose the good of
                        nature wherein they subsist, but are immutably
                        established in such good. But composite substances,

                The goodness of a creature may also be regarded otherwise than
                as the creature’s subsistence in its nature; for the perfection
                of its goodness is realized in its destiny to its end. And since
                creatures are to attain their end by their activity, we have
                still to inquire how creatures may be lacking in goodness from
                the point of view of their actions, whereby they are destined to
                attain their end.

                    In this connection we should first note that a judgment
                    concerning natural operations is equivalent to a judgment
                    concerning the nature which is the principle of these
                    operations. Therefore in beings whose nature cannot suffer
                    defect, no defect in natural operations can develop; but in
                    beings whose nature can admit of defect, a defect in
                    activity can occur.

                        or corporeal, no defect in natural activity can take
                        place. Thus angels forever retain their natural power of
                        exercising their proper activity. Likewise the movements
                        of heavenly bodies are found never to leave their
                        appointed orbits. But in lower bodies many defects in
                        natural activity result from the corruptions and defects
                        incidental to their natures. Thus from a defect in some
                        natural principle come the sterility of plants,
                        monstrosities in the generation of animals, and other

                There are certain actions whose principle is not nature but the
                will. The object of the will is the good, which consists
                primarily in the end, secondarily in whatever leads to the end.
                Voluntary action is related to the good as natural action is
                related to the form by which a thing acts. Consequently, just as
                a defect in natural activity cannot ensue in things that do not
                admit of defect in their forms, but can occur only in
                corruptible things whose forms are defectible, so voluntary
                actions can be deficient only in beings whose will can deflect
                from their proper end. Hence, if the will cannot deflect from
                its proper end, deficiency in voluntary action is clearly
                impossible.

                    Voluntas autem deficere non potest respectu boni quod est
                    ipsius volentis natura: quaelibet enim res suo modo appetit
                    suum esse perfectum, quod est bonum uniuscuiusque; respectu
                    boni vero exterioris deficere potest bono sibi connaturali

                    The will cannot be deficient with regard to the good which
                    is the very nature of the being that wills; for every being
                    seeks in its own way its perfection, which is each one’s
                    good. But as regards an external good the will can be
                    deficient, by resting content with a good connatural to it.
                    Therefore if the nature of the being that wills is the
                    ultimate end of its will, no deficiency in voluntary action
                    can arise.

                        the nature of other beings endowed with will is not the
                        ultimate end of their will. Hence a defect in voluntary
                        action can occur in them, if their will remains fixed on
                        their own good and does not push on to the supreme good,

                A question worthy of consideration arises at this point. As the
                term “good” signifies perfect being, so the term “evil”
                signifies nothing else than privation of perfect being. In its
                proper acceptation, privation is predicated of that which is
                fitted by its nature to be possessed, and to be possessed at a
                certain time and in a certain manner. Evidently, therefore, a
                thing is called evil if it lacks a perfection it ought to have.
                Thus if a man lacks the sense of sight, this is an evil for him.
                But the same lack is not an evil for a stone, for the stone is
                not equipped by nature to have the faculty of sight.

                Evil cannot be a nature. Every nature is either act or potency
                or a. composite of the two. Whatever is act, is a perfection and
                is good in its very concept. And what is in potency has a
                natural appetite for the reception of act; but what all beings
                desire is good. Therefore, too, what is composed of act and
                potency participates in goodness to the extent that it
                participates in act. And potency possesses goodness inasmuch as
                it is ordained to act; an indication of this is the fact that
                potency is esteemed in proportion to its capacity for act and
                perfection. Consequently no nature is of itself an evil.

                    by being mixed with the other, but is rather destroyed or
                    weakened thereby. Therefore evil does not realize its full
                    capacity by sharing in good. But every nature realizes its
                    full capacity by having existence in act; and so, since to
                    be good is the object of every being’s natural tendency, a
                    nature achieves fulfillment by participating in good.
                    Accordingly no nature is an evil.

                        of its being, and shuns destruction to the full extent
                        of its power. Consequently, since good is that which all
                        desire, and evil, on the contrary, is that which all
                        shun, we must conclude that for any nature existence is
                        in itself good, and non-existence is evil. To be evil,
                        however, is not good; in fact, not to be evil is
                        included in the notion of good. Therefore no nature is
                        an evil.

                    ordinantur, secundum bonum et malum differunt, et per
                    consequens contrarii habitus differunt bono et malo quasi

                    habentibus, non propter privationem ex qua dicitur malum,

                    We must note that, as physical entities receive their
                    species from their form, so moral entities receive their
                    species from the end which is the object of the will and on
                    which all morality depends, In physical entities, moreover,
                    the presence of one form entails the privation of another,
                    as, for instance, the form of fire entails the privation of
                    the form of air. In moral entities, similarly, one end
                    involves the privation of another end. Since the privation
                    of a due perfection is an evil in physical entities, the
                    reception of a form which implies the privation of the form
                    that ought to be possessed, is an evil; not, indeed, because
                    of the form itself, but because of the privation its
                    presence involves. In this sense, to be on fire is an evil
                    for a log of wood. In the field of morality, likewise, the
                    pursuit of an end that entails the privation of the right
                    end is an evil, not on account of the end itself, but
                    because of the privation necessarily implied. It is in this
                    way that two moral actions, directed to contrary ends,
                    differ as good and evil. Consequently the corresponding
                    contrary habits differ in good and evil as by specific
                    differences, and as being contrary to each other. This is
                    so, not on account of the privation from which evil receives
                    its designation, but on account of the end which involves
                    the privation.

                        Per hunc etiam modum quidam intelligunt ab Aristotele

                        scilicet moralium. Sed si recte attendatur, bonum et

                        qui omnia reduxit ad bonum et malum sicut ad prima
                        genera: quae quidem positio habet aliquid veritatis,

                        amaro, et sic de aliis. Semper autem quod perfectum est,
                        pertinet ad rationem boni, quod autem diminutum ad

                        This is the sense in which some philosophers understand
                        Aristotle’s assertion, that good and evil are genera of
                        contraries [ <i>Categories</i>, XI, 14 a 25], namely, of
                        moral contraries. But if we examine the matter closely,
                        we shall find that in the sphere of morals, good and
                        evil are differences rather than species. Hence it seems
                        better to say that good and evil are called genera
                        according to the opinion of Pythagoras, who reduced
                        everything to good and evil as to supreme genera. This
                        position does, indeed, contain some truth, in the sense
                        that in all contraries one member is perfect, whereas
                        the other is deficient. This is clear in the case of
                        white and black, sweet and bitter, and so on. But
                        invariably, what is perfect, pertains to good, and what
                        is deficient, pertains to evil.

                Knowing that evil is the privation of a due perfection, we can
                easily understand how evil corrupts good; this it does to the
                extent that it is the privation of good. Thus blindness is said
                to corrupt sight because it is the privation of sight. However,
                evil does not completely corrupt good, because, as we remarked
                above, not only form, but also potency to form, is good; and
                potency is the subject of privation as well as of form.
                Therefore the subject of evil must be good, not in the sense
                that it is opposed to evil, but in the sense that it is a
                potency for the reception of evil. This brings out the fact that
                not every good can be the subject of evil, but only such a good
                as is in potency with respect to some perfection of which it can
                be deprived. Hence in beings which are exclusively act, or in
                which act cannot be separated from potency, there can, to this
                extent, be no evil.

                    subiecto bono fundari: ac per hoc nihil potest esse summe

                    As a result, nothing can be essentially evil, since evil
                    must always have as its foundation some subject, distinct
                    from it, that is good. And so there cannot be a being that
                    is supremely evil, in the way that there is a being that is
                    supremely good because it is essentially good.

                      <td>
                        Further, we see clearly that evil cannot be the object
                        of desire, and that it cannot act except in virtue of
                        the good connected with it. For only perfection and end
                        are desirable; and the principle of action is form.
                        However, since a particular perfection or form involves
                        the privation of some other perfection or form, it can
                        happen incidentally that privation or evil may be
                        desired and may be the principle of some action; not
                        precisely because of the evil, but because of the good
                        connected with it. An example of what I here mean by
                        “incidentally” is the musician who constructs a house,
                        not in his capacity of musician, but in the capacity of
                        being also a builder.

                Some may feel impelled to lodge a difficulty against this
                presentation: good cannot be the substratum of evil, for one of
                a pair of opposites cannot be the substratum of the other, nor
                do extremes ever exist together in other kinds of opposition.
                But let such quibblers reflect that other kinds of opposition
                belong to some definite genus, whereas good and evil are common
                to all genera. Every being, as such, is good; and every
                privation, as such, is evil. The substratum of a privation must
                be a being, hence good. But the subject of a privation need not
                be white or sweet or endowed with sight, because none of these
                predicates belongs to being as such. And so black is not in
                white, nor blindness in the person who sees; but evil is in
                good, just as blindness is in the sense that is the subject of
                sight. The reason why the subject of sight, in the case of a
                blind man, is not called “seeing,” is that “seeing” is not a
                predicate common to every being.

                Since evil is privation and defect, and since defect, as is
                clear from what we said above, can occur in a thing both as
                regarded in its nature and as regarded in its relation to an end
                by its action, we may speak of evil in both senses: that is, by
                reason of a defect in the thing itself (thus blindness is a
                certain evil in an animal), and by reason of a defect in a
                creature’s action (thus lameness connotes action with a defect).
                Evil in an action that is directed to an end in such a way that
                it is not rightly related to the end, is called fault
                (<i>peccatum</i>) both in voluntary agents and in natural
                agents. A physician is faulty (<i>peccat</i>) in his action,
                when he does not proceed in such a way as to procure health.
                Nature, too, is faulty in its activity when it fails to advance
                a generated being, to its proper disposition and form; this is
                why monsters occur in nature.

                We should observe that sometimes action is in the power of the
                agent. Such are all voluntary actions. By voluntary action I
                mean an action that has its principle in an agent who is
                conscious of the various factors constituting his action.
                Sometimes actions are not voluntary. In this class are violent
                actions, whose principle is outside the agent; also natural
                actions, and actions performed in ignorance. These do not
                proceed from a conscious principle. If a defect occurs in
                non-voluntary actions that are directed to an end, it is called
                simply a fault (<i>peccatum</i>). But if such a defect occurs in
                voluntary actions, it is called not only fault, but sin
                (<i>culpa</i>). For in this case the voluntary agent, being
                master of his own action, deservedly draws blame and punishment
                on himself. If actions are mixed, that is, are partly voluntary
                and partly involuntary, the sin is diminished in proportion to
                the admixture of the involuntary element.

                    Quia vero naturalis actio naturam rei consequitur,

                    natura transmutari non potest, naturalis actionis peccatum

                    Since natural action follows the nature of a being, a fault
                    in natural activity clearly cannot occur in incorruptible
                    things, for their nature is incapable of change. But the
                    will of an intellectual creature can suffer defect in
                    voluntary action, as was shown above. Consequently freedom
                    from evil in nature is common to all incorruptible things.
                    But freedom, in virtue of natural necessity, from the evil
                    of sin, of which rational nature alone is capable, is found
                    to be an exclusive property of God.

                Just as defect in voluntary action constitutes fault and sin, so
                the withdrawing of some good, in consequence of sin, against the
                will of him on whom such privation is inflicted, has the
                character of punishment. Punishment is inflicted as a medicine
                that is corrective of the sin, and also to restore right order
                violated by the sin. Punishment functions as a medicine inasmuch
                as fear of punishment deters a man from sinning; that is, a
                person refrains from performing an inordinate action, which
                would be pleasing to his will, lest he have to suffer what is
                opposed to his will. Punishment also restores right order; by
                sinning, a man exceeds the limits of the natural order,
                indulging his will more than is right. Hence a return to the
                order of justice is effected by punishment, whereby some good is
                withdrawn from the sinner’s will. As is quite clear, a suitable
                punishment is not assigned for the sin unless the punishment is
                more galling to the will than the sin was attractive to it.

                Not all punishment is opposed to the will in the same way. Some
                punishments are opposed to what man actually wills; and this
                kind of punishment is felt most keenly. Some punishments are
                opposed not to the actual but to the habitual tendency of the
                will, as when a person is deprived of something, for instance,
                his son or his property, without his knowledge. In this case,
                nothing actually thwarts his will; but the withdrawal of the
                good would be against his will if he were aware of what was
                happening. At times a punishment is opposed to the will
                according to the very nature of that faculty. For the will is
                naturally turned to what is good. Thus if a person is lacking in
                a virtue, this need not always be opposed to his actual will,
                for he may, perhaps, despise this virtue; nor need it be against
                his habitual will, for he may, perhaps, have a habitual
                disposition of will toward what is contrary to the virtue.
                Nevertheless such a privation is opposed to the natural
                rectitude of the will, whereby man naturally desires virtue.

                    Consequently, as is evident, the degrees of punishment may
                    be measured by two standards: first, by the quantity of the
                    good of which a man is deprived for his punishment;
                    secondly, by the greater or less opposition it arouses in
                    the will. For the withdrawal of a greater good is more
                    opposed to the will than the withdrawal of a lesser good.

                We can see from the foregoing that all things are governed by
                divine providence. Whatever is set in motion toward the end
                intended by any agent, is directed by that agent to the end.
                Thus all the soldiers in an army are subordinated to the end
                intended by the commander, which is victory, and are directed by
                him to that end. We showed above that all things tend by their
                actions to the divine goodness as their end. Hence all things
                are directed to this end by God Himself, to whom this end
                pertains. To be thus directed is the same as to be ruled and
                governed by providence. Therefore all things are ruled by divine
                providence.

                    always remain constant, are found to be under the direction
                    of beings that do remain constant. Thus all the movements of
                    lower bodies, being defectible, are regulated in accordance
                    with the undeviating movement of a heavenly body. But all
                    creatures are changeable and defectible. As regards
                    intellectual creatures, their very nature is such that
                    deficiency in voluntary action can develop in them. Other
                    creatures have some part in movement, either by way of
                    generation and corruption, or at least according to place.
                    God Himself is the only being in whom no defect can arise.
                    Consequently all creatures are kept in order by Him.

                        Furthermore, whatever has existence by way of
                        participation, is traced back, as to its cause, to that
                        which exists in virtue of its own essence; for example,
                        what is on fire has, in some way or other, fire as the
                        cause that ignited it. Since God alone is good by His
                        very essence, and all other things receive their
                        complement of goodness by some sort of participation,
                        all beings must be brought to their complement of
                        goodness by God. This, again, involves rule and
                        government; for things are governed or ruled by being
                        established in the order of good. And so all things are
                        governed and ruled by God.

                We can see from this that lower creatures are ruled by God
                through the agency of higher creatures. Some creatures are said
                to be higher, because they are more perfect in goodness.
                Creatures receive their order of good from God, inasmuch as they
                are under His rule. Consequently higher creatures have a greater
                share in the order of divine government than lower creatures.
                But what has a greater share in any perfection is related to
                what has a smaller share in that perfection, as act is related
                to potency, and agent to patient. Therefore higher creatures are
                related to lower creatures in the order of divine providence as
                agent is related to patient. Accordingly lower creatures are
                governed by higher creatures.

                    Divine goodness has this characteristic, that it
                    communicates a likeness of itself to creatures. This is the
                    sense in which God is said to have made all things for the
                    sake of His goodness, as is clear from a previous chapter.
                    The perfection of divine goodness entails the double truth
                    that God is good in Himself, and that He leads other beings
                    to goodness. He communicates goodness to creatures under
                    both aspects: they are good in themselves, and some lead
                    others to goodness. In this way God brings some creatures to
                    goodness through ‘cither creatures. The latter must be
                    higher creatures; for what receives a likeness of both form
                    and action from some agent, is more perfect than what
                    receives a likeness of form but not of action. Thus the
                    moon, which not only glows with light but also illuminates
                    other bodies, receives light from the sun more perfectly
                    than do opaque bodies, which are merely illuminated but do
                    not illuminate. Accordingly God governs lower creatures by
                    higher creatures.

                        Likewise, the good of many is better than the good of an
                        individual, and so is more representative of the divine
                        goodness, which is the good of the whole universe. If a
                        higher creature, which receives more abundant goodness
                        from God, did not cooperate in procuring the good of
                        lower creatures, that abundance of goodness would be
                        confined to one individual. But it becomes common to
                        many by the fact that the more richly endowed creature
                        cooperates in procuring the good of many. Hence the
                        divine goodness requires that God should rule lower
                        creatures by higher creatures.

                creatures. Likewise, since some intellectual creatures excel
                others, God rules the lower through the higher. Accordingly men,
                who occupy the lowest place in the order of nature among
                intellectual substances, are governed by the higher spirits.
                These are called angels, that is, messengers, because they
                announce divine messages to men. Among angels, too, the lower
                are directed by the higher. For they are distributed among
                various hierarchies, or sacred principalities; and each
                hierarchy is divided into different orders.

                are more universal.

                    quae in tres ordines dividitur secundum tria quae in
                    qualibet operativa arte considerantur: quorum primum est
                    finis, ex quo rationes operum sumuntur; secundum est

                    effectibus edoceri: unde ab ardore amoris Seraphim dicuntur,
                    quasi ardentes vel incendentes: amoris enim obiectum est
                    bonum. Secundi vero ordinis est effectus Dei in ipsius
                    rationibus intelligibilibus contemplari, prout sunt in Deo:
                    unde Cherubim dicuntur a plenitudine scientiae. Tertii vero

                    applicatis: unde ab habendo in se Deum insidentem throni
                    sunt dicti.

                    The first way of understanding suitable to intellectual
                    substances is the knowledge imparted to them of effects, and
                    hence of their own works, in the first cause itself, namely
                    in God; for it is through them that God carries out lower
                    effects. This knowledge is proper to the first hierarchy,
                    which is divided into orders corresponding to the three
                    characteristics discerned in any operative art. The first of
                    these is the end from which the exemplars of the works are
                    derived; the second is the exemplars of the works as
                    existing in the mind of the artificer; the third is the
                    application of the work to the effects. Consequently the
                    first order has the privilege of being instructed about the
                    effects of things in the supreme Good itself, regarded as
                    the last end. For this reason angels of the first order are
                    called seraphim, as though they were aflame or on fire, with
                    reference to the fire of love; for the object of love is the
                    good. The second order has the function of contemplating
                    God’s effects in their intelligible exemplars as they exist
                    in God. Hence angels of this order are called cherubim, from
                    the fullness of their knowledge. The third order has the
                    office of meditating, in God Himself, how creatures share in
                    intelligible exemplars as adapted to effects. And so angels
                    of this order are called thrones, from the fact that God
                    resides in them.

                        The second way of understanding is to contemplate the
                        exemplars of effects as they exist in universal causes.
                        This is suitable to the second hierarchy, which is
                        likewise divided into three orders, corresponding to the
                        three characteristics that pertain to universal causes,
                        especially such as operate under the guidance of the
                        intellect. The first of these characteristics is to plan
                        beforehand what is to be done. Thus among artificers the
                        highest arts are directive, and are called
                        architectonic. From this fact angels belonging to the
                        first order of this hierarchy are known as dominations;
                        for direction and planning are functions of a master or
                        <i>dominus</i>. The second characteristic observed in
                        universal causes is the initiating of action for an
                        undertaking, with authority to oversee its execution.
                        For this reason angels belonging to the second order of
                        this hierarchy are called principalities, according to
                        Gregory [ <i>In Evangelia</i>, 11, hom. xxxiv, 7], or
                        virtues, according to Dionysius [
                        <i>Coel. hierarch.</i>, VIII, 1], understanding virtues
                        in the sense that to take the initiative in action is
                        virtuosity in a high degree. The third characteristic
                        discerned in universal causes is the removal of
                        obstacles to execution. And so the third order of this
                        hierarchy is that of the powers, whose office is to
                        constrain whatever could impede the execution of the
                        divine command; hence, also, the powers are said to hold
                        demons in check.

                            huius hierarchiae ordo secundum Gregorium virtutes
                            dicuntur, ex eo quod ea quae sunt supra naturam

                            The third way of understanding is to contemplate the
                            exemplars of effects in the effects themselves. And
                            this is proper to the third hierarchy, which is
                            placed in immediate charge of us, who obtain
                            knowledge of effects from effects themselves. This
                            hierarchy, too, has three orders. The lowest of
                            these is that of the angels, who are so called
                            because they announce to men details that pertain to
                            their government; hence they are also called
                            guardians of men. Above this order is that of the
                            archangels. The office of this order is to announce
                            to men matters that transcend reason, such as the
                            mysteries of faith. The highest order of this
                            hierarchy is said by Gregory to be that of the
                            virtues, for the reason that they perform deeds
                            beyond the power of nature, in proof of the
                            messages, transcending reason, they announce to us.
                            Consequently the working of miracles is said to
                            pertain to the virtues. According to Dionysius,
                            however, the highest order of this hierarchy is that
                            of the principalities; in his reckoning we are to
                            understand that the princes are they who have charge
                            over individual peoples, while the angels have
                            charge over individual men, and the archangels
                            announce to individual men those affairs that
                            pertain to the salvation of all.

                                Since a lower power acts in virtue of a higher
                                power, a lower order performs actions proper to
                                a higher order by acting in virtue of that
                                higher power. But the higher orders possess in a
                                more eminent way whatever is proper to the lower
                                orders. Thus all things are in a certain sense
                                common to the various orders. However, they
                                receive their proper names from properties that
                                are characteristic of each order. Nevertheless
                                the lowest order of all retains the common name
                                of angels for itself, for the reason that it
                                acts, as it were, in virtue of all the rest.
                                Furthermore, since the higher naturally
                                influences the lower, and since intellectual
                                action consists in instructing or teaching, the
                                higher angels, in instructing the lower angels,
                                are said to purify, illuminate, and perfect
                                them.

                Among intellectual substances, therefore, some are divinely
                governed by others, that is, the lower by the higher. Similarly
                lower bodies are controlled, in God’s plan, by higher bodies.
                Hence every movement of lower bodies is caused by the movements
                of heavenly bodies. Lower bodies acquire forms and species from
                the influence thus exercised by heavenly bodies, just as the
                intelligible exemplars of things descend to lower spirits
                through higher spirits.

                    However, since an intellectual substance is superior to all
                    bodies in the hierarchy of beings, the order of providence
                    has suitably disposed matters in such a way that no
                    intellectual substance is ruled by God through a corporeal
                    substance. Accordingly, since the human soul is an
                    intellectual substance, it cannot, so far as it is endowed
                    with intelligence and will, be subject to the movements of
                    heavenly bodies. Heavenly bodies cannot directly act upon or

                        Again, no body acts except by movement. Hence whatever
                        is acted upon by a body, is moved by it. But the human
                        soul, regarded as intellectual, according as it is the
                        principle of the will, cannot be moved by bodily
                        movement, since the intellect is not the act of any
                        bodily organ. Therefore the human soul cannot be
                        subject, in its intellect or will, to any influence
                        emanating from heavenly bodies.

                            the impact of heavenly bodies are natural.
                            Therefore, if the operations of the intellect and

                            bodies, they would proceed from natural instinct.

                Nevertheless we should not lose sight of the fact that the human
                intellect is indebted to the sense powers for the origin of its
                knowledge. This is why intellectual knowledge is thrown into
                confusion when the soul’s faculties of phantasm, imagination, or
                memory are impaired. On the other hand, when these powers are in
                good order, intellectual apprehension becomes more efficient.
                Likewise, a modification in the sensitive appetite tends to
                bring about a change in the will, which is a rational appetite,
                as we know from the fact that the object of the will is the good
                as apprehended. According as we are variously disposed in the
                matter of concupiscence, anger, fear and other passions, a thing
                will at different times appear to us as good or evil.

                    On the other hand, all the powers of the sensitive part of
                    our soul, whether they are apprehensive or appetitive, are
                    the acts of certain bodily organs. If these undergo
                    modification, the faculties themselves must, indirectly,
                    undergo some change. Therefore, since change in lower bodies
                    is influenced by the movement of the heavens, the operations
                    of the sensitive faculties are also subject to such
                    movement, although only <i>per accidens</i>. And thus
                    heavenly movement has some indirect influence on the
                    activity of the human intellect and will, so far as the will
                    may be inclined this way or that by the passions.

                Everything that is changeable and multiform is traced back, as
                to its cause, to some first principle that is immobile and is
                one. Since man’s intellect and will are clearly changeable and
                multiform, they must be reduced to some higher cause that is
                immobile and uniform. The heavenly bodies are not the cause to
                which they are reduced, as we have shown; therefore they must be
                reduced to yet higher causes.

                    In this matter the case of the intellect differs from that
                    of the will. The act of the intellect is brought about by
                    the presence of the things understood in the intellect; but
                    the act of the will is accounted for by the inclination of
                    the will toward the things willed. Thus the intellect is
                    adapted by its nature to be perfected by something external
                    that is related to it as act to potency. Hence man can be
                    aided to elicit an act of the intellect by anything external
                    that is more perfect in intelligible being: not only by God
                    but also by an angel or even by a man who is better
                    informed; but differently in each instance. A man is helped
                    to understand by a man when one of them pro. poses to the
                    other an intelligible object not previously contemplated;
                    but not in such a way that the light of the intellect of one
                    man is perfected by the other, because each of these natural
                    lights is in one and the same species.

                        an angel can aid a man to understand, not only on the
                        part, of the object proposed to him by the angel, but

                        the angel’s light. However, man’s natural light does not
                        come from an angel, for the nature of the rational soul,
                        which receives existence through creation, is produced
                        by God alone.

                            God helps man to understand, not only on the part of
                            the object proposed by God to man, or by an increase
                            of light, but also by the very fact that man’s
                            natural light, which is what makes him intellectual,
                            is from God. Moreover, God Himself is the first

                                With regard to the will, its act is a certain
                                impulse flowing from the interior to the
                                exterior, and has much in common with natural
                                tendencies. Accordingly, as natural tendencies
                                are placed in natural things exclusively by the
                                cause of their nature, the act of the will is
                                from God alone, for He alone is ‘the cause of a
                                rational nature endowed with will. Therefore, if
                                God moves man’s will, this is evidently not
                                opposed to freedom of choice, just as God’s
                                activity in natural things is not contrary to
                                their nature. Both the natural inclination and
                                the voluntary inclination are from God; each of
                                them issues in action according to the condition
                                of the thing to which it pertains. God moves

                                nature.

                order of His government, can act only through the power of God
                Himself. The action of any of them is caused by God, just as the

                simultaneous. Hence God must be inwardly present to any agent as
                acting therein whenever He moves the agent to act.

                    Another point: not only the action of secondary agents but
                    their very existence is caused by God, as was shown above.
                    However, we are not to suppose that the existence of things
                    is caused by God in the same way as the existence of a house
                    is caused by its builder. When the builder departs, the
                    house still remains standing. For the builder causes the
                    existence of the house only in the sense that be works for
                    the existence of the house as a house. Such activity is,
                    indeed, the constructing of the house, and thus the builder
                    is directly the cause of the becoming of the house, a
                    process that ceases when he desists from his labors. But God
                    is directly, by Himself, the cause of very existence, and
                    communicates existence to all things just as the sun
                    communicates light to the air and to whatever else is
                    illuminated by the sun. The continuous shining of the sun is
                    required for the preservation of light in the air; similarly
                    God must unceasingly confer existence on things if they are
                    to persevere in existence. Thus all things are related to
                    God as an object made is to its maker, and this not only so
                    far as they begin to exist, but so far as they continue to
                    exist. But a maker and the object made must be simultaneous,
                    just as in the case of a mover and the object moved. Hence
                    God is necessarily present to all things to the extent that
                    they have existence. But existence is that which is the most
                    intimately present in all things. Therefore God must be in
                    all things.

                        Otherwise the effects would occur outside the order he
                        has foreseen. The prearranged plan of a governor is more
                        perfect in proportion as his knowledge and design
                        descend to details. For if any detail escapes the
                        advertence of the governor, the disposition of that
                        detail will elude his foresight. We showed above that
                        all things are necessarily subject to divine providence;
                        130 and divine providence must evidently be most
                        perfect, because whatever is predicated of God must
                        befit Him in the highest possible degree. Consequently
                        the ordinations of His providence must extend to the
                        most minute effects.

                In the light of the foregoing, it is clear that, although God’s
                government of things is effected through the agency of secondary
                causes, as far as the carrying out of His providence is
                concerned, yet the plan itself or ordination of divine
                providence extends directly to all details. In arranging all
                matters from first to last, God does not turn over to others the
                disposal of the final particulars. Men act thus because of the
                limitations of their knowledge, which cannot at any one time
                take in many items. This is why higher rulers personally take
                charge of great concerns, and entrust the management of
                unimportant affairs to others. But God can take cognizance of a
                multitude of things simultaneously, as was indicated above.
                Hence the fact that He attends to the slightest details does not
                keep Him from organizing the weightiest matters.

                Some may think that details are not regulated by God. For no one
                disposes anything in his planning unless he has knowledge
                thereof. But knowledge of particulars may well seem to be
                lacking in God, for the reason that particulars are known, not
                by the intellect, but by the senses. God, who is wholly
                incorporeal, can have no sense knowledge, but only intellectual
                knowledge. Consequently details may seem to lie outside the
                scope of divine providence.

                    Moreover, details are infinite, and knowledge of infinity is

                    details seemingly escape the divine knowledge and
                    providence.

                        Accordingly, since God’s knowledge must be absolutely
                        certain, it seems that details are not known or

                            knowledge of non-existent things. Hence, if God has
                            knowledge of details, there must be some things
                            which He begins and ceases to know, and this

                These objections are easily answered if we but penetrate to the

                He must have knowledge of all that exists in Himself in any
                manner whatever. Since every essence and power of created being
                is from Him, and since whatever comes from anyone exists
                virtually in him, we necessarily conclude that in knowing
                Himself He knows the essence of created being and whatever is
                virtually contained in the latter. And thus He knows all
                particulars that are virtually in Himself and in all His other
                causes.

                    principio virtute continentur non solum forma, sed etiam

                    The knowledge possessed by the divine intellect is not like

                    derives knowledge of things through the species it
                    abstracts, and these are the likenesses of forms and not of
                    matter or of material dispositions, which are principles of
                    individuation. Therefore our intellect cannot know
                    particulars, but only universals. But the divine intellect
                    knows things through its own essence, in which, as in the
                    first principle of being, is virtually contained not only
                    form, but matter. And so God knows not only universals but

                        Likewise God is able to know an infinite number of
                        objects, even though our intellect cannot know the
                        infinite. Our intellect cannot actually contemplate many
                        things at the same time. Hence, if it knew an infinite
                        number of objects, it would have to review them one
                        after another as it contemplated them, which is contrary
                        to the very notion of infinity. However, our intellect
                        can know infinity virtually and potentially, for
                        example, it can know all the species of numbers or of
                        proportions, seeing that it possesses an adequate
                        principle for knowing all things. But God can know many
                        things simultaneously, as was indicated above; and that
                        whereby He knows all things, namely, His essence, is an
                        adequate principle for knowing, not only all that is,
                        but all that can be. Therefore, as our intellect
                        potentially and virtually knows those infinite objects
                        for which it has a principle of cognition, so God
                        actually contemplates all infinities.

                            particulars do not exist simultaneously, God surely
                            has simultaneous knowledge of them. For He knows
                            them according to His manner of being, which is
                            eternal and without succession. Consequently, as He
                            knows material things in an immaterial way, and many
                            things in unity, so in a single glance He beholds
                            objects that do not exist at the same time. And so
                            His knowledge of particulars does not involve the
                            consequence that anything is added to, or subtracted
                            from, His cognition.

                                This also makes it clear that He has certain
                                knowledge of contingent things. Even before they
                                come into being, He sees them as they actually
                                exist, and not merely as they will be in the
                                future and as virtually present in their causes,
                                in the way we are able to know some future
                                things. Contingent things, regarded as virtually
                                present in their causes with a claim to future
                                existence, are not sufficiently determinate to
                                admit of certain knowledge about them; but,
                                regarded as actually possessing existence, they
                                are determinate, and hence certain knowledge of
                                them is possible. Thus we can know with the
                                certitude of ocular vision that Socrates is
                                sitting while he is seated. With like certitude
                                God knows, in His eternity, all that takes place
                                throughout the whole course of time. For His
                                eternity is in present contact with the whole
                                course of time, and even passes beyond time. We
                                may fancy that God knows the flight of time in
                                His eternity, in the way that a person standing
                                on top of a watchtower embraces in a single
                                glance a whole caravan of passing travelers.

                estis vos. Sed cognoscere futura in suis causis etiam aliis

                coniecturalis magis, nisi circa effectus qui de necessitate ex

                To know contingent futures in this way, as being actually in.
                existence, that is, to have certitude about them, is evidently
                restricted to God alone, of whom eternity is truly and properly
                predicated. For this reason, certain prediction of future events
                is accounted a proof of divinity. This accords with Isaiah
                41:23: “Show the things that are to come hereafter, and we shall
                know that ye are gods.” Knowledge of future events in their
                causes is, indeed, possible for others. Such knowledge, however,
                is not certain, but is rather conjectural, except as regards
                effects that necessarily flow from their causes. In this way a
                physician foretells future illnesses, and a sailor predicts
                storms.

                Thus there is no reason why God should not have knowledge of
                individual effects, or why He should not directly regulate them
                by Himself, even though He may carry them out through
                intermediate causes. However, in the very execution He is, in
                some fashion, in immediate touch with all effects, to the extent
                that all intermediate causes operate in virtue of the first
                cause, so that in a certain way He Himself appears to act in
                them all. Thus all the achievements of secondary causes can be
                attributed to Him, as the effect produced by a tool is ascribed
                to the artisan; when we say that a smith makes a knife, we are
                more correct than when we say that a hammer did it. God is also
                in immediate contact with all effects so far as He is
                <i>per se</i> the cause of their existence, and so far as
                everything is kept in being by Him.

                The entire order of secondary causes, as well as their power,
                comes from God. He Himself, however, produces His effects not
                out of necessity, but by free will, as was shown above. Clearly,
                then, He can act outside the order of secondary causes, as when
                He cures those who are incurable from the standpoint of natural
                causality, or when He does something else of this kind that is
                not within the sphere of natural causes but is nevertheless
                consonant with the order of divine providence. What God
                occasionally does in this way, independently of the order of
                natural causes, is designed by Him for a definite end. When
                effects are thus wrought by divine power outside the order of
                secondary causes, they are called miracles; for when we perceive
                an effect without knowing its cause, our wonder is excited (<i
                  >mirum est</i
                >). God is a cause that is completely hidden from us. Therefore,
                when some effect is wrought by Him outside the order of
                secondary causes known to us, it is called simply a miracle. But
                if an effect is produced by some other cause that is unknown to
                this or that person, it is not a miracle simply as such, but
                only with regard to him who is ignorant of the cause. Thus an
                event may appear marvelous to one person without seeming
                marvelous to another who is acquainted with its cause.

                    To act in this way, outside the order of secondary causes,
                    is possible for God alone, who is the founder of this order
                    and is not confined to it. All other beings are subject to
                    this order; and so God alone can work miracles, as the
                    Psalmist says: “Who alone doth wonderful things” (Ps.
                    71:18). Therefore, when miracles are apparently worked by
                    some creature, either they are not true miracles, but are
                    effects produced by the power of natural agents, which may
                    be concealed from us, as happens in the case of miracles
                    wrought by demons with their magical arts; or else, if they
                    are true miracles, someone obtains the power to work them by
                    praying to God. Since such miracles are wrought exclusively
                    by divine power, they are rightly appealed to in proof of
                    the faith, which has God alone as its author. For a
                    pronouncement issued by a man with a claim to divine
                    authority, is never more fittingly attested than by works
                    which God alone can perform.

                        Although such miracles occur outside the order of
                        secondary causes, we should not simply say that they are
                        against nature. The natural order makes provision for
                        the subjection of the lower to the activity of the
                        higher. Thus effects brought about in lower bodies in
                        consequence of the influence emanating from the heavenly
                        bodies, are not said to be simply against nature,
                        although they may at times be against the particular
                        nature of this or that thing, as we observe in the
                        movement of water in the ebb and flow of the tide, which
                        is produced by the action of the moon. In the same way,
                        effects produced in creatures by the action of God may
                        seem to be against some particular order of secondary
                        causes; yet they are in accord with the universal order
                        of nature. Therefore miracles are not contrary to
                        nature.

                yet not be accidental or fortuitous with respect to a higher
                cause, inasmuch as the effect does not take place apart from the
                latter’s intention. For example, a master may send two servants
                to the same place, but in such a way that neither is aware of
                the mission of the other. Their meeting is accidental so far as

                This suggests what we ought to think of fate. Many effects are
                found to occur haphazard if they are regarded from the
                standpoint of secondary causes. Some thinkers are unwilling to
                refer such effects to a higher cause that ordains them. In
                consequence, they must utterly reject fate. On the other hand,
                others have desired to trace back these seemingly accidental and
                fortuitous effects to a higher cause that plans them. But,
                failing to rise above the order of corporeal entities, they
                attributed such devising to the highest bodies, namely, the
                heavenly bodies. And so they contended that fate is a force
                deriving from the position of the stars, and that this accounts
                for happenings of this kind. But we showed above that the
                intellect and will, which are the true principles of human acts,
                are not in any proper sense subject to heavenly bodies. Hence we
                cannot maintain that events which seemingly occur at random and
                by chance in human affairs, are to be referred to heavenly
                bodies as to the cause that charts them.

                    There seems to be no place for fate except in human affairs,
                    in which hazard has a part to play. It is only about such
                    events that men are accustomed to inquire in their craving
                    to know the future, and it is also about these that an
                    answer is usually given by fortunetellers. Hence fate
                    (fatum) is a word formed from the Latin verb fari, to
                    foretell. To acknowledge fate thus understood is opposed to
                    faith. Since, however, not only natural things but also
                    human affairs are under divine providence, those events that
                    seem to happen at random in men’s lives must be referred to
                    the ordination of divine providence. Consequently those who
                    hold that all things are subject to divine providence, must
                    admit the existence of fate. Fate taken in this sense is
                    related to divine providence as a real effect of the latter.
                    For it is an explanation of divine providence as applied to
                    things, and is in agreement with the definition given by
                    Boethius, who says that fate is a “disposition,” that is, an
                    unchangeable ordination, “inherent in changeable things” [
                    <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>, IV, pros. 6].

                        Yet, since we ought not to have even words in common
                        with infidels, so far as possible, lest an occasion for
                        going astray be taken by those who do not understand, it
                        is more prudent for the faithful to abstain from the
                        word “fate,” for the reason that fate is more properly
                        and generally used in the first sense. Therefore
                        Augustine says that if anyone believes in the existence
                        of fate in the second sense, he may keep to his opinion
                        but should correct his language [

                Quamvis autem ordo divinae providentiae rebus adhibitus certus
                sit, ratione cuius Boetius dicit quod fatum est dispositio

                vel contingentes dicuntur secundum conditionem proximarum
                causarum. Manifestum est enim quod si causa prima fuerit
                necessaria, et causa secunda fuerit contingens, effectus
                sequitur contingens, sicut prima causa generationis in rebus
                corporalibus inferioribus est motus caelestis corporis, qui
                licet ex necessitate proveniat, generatio tamen et corruptio in
                istis inferioribus provenit contingenter, propter hoc quod
                causae inferiores contingentes sunt, et deficere possunt.
                Ostensum est autem quod Deus suae providentiae ordinem per
                causas inferiores exequitur. Erunt igitur aliqui effectus
                divinae providentiae contingentes secundum conditionem
                inferiorum causarum.

                The order of divine providence as carried out in things is
                certain. This is why Boethius could say that fate is an
                unchangeable disposition inherent in changeable things [
                <i>De consolatione philosophiae</i>, IV, pros. 6]. But we may
                not conclude from this that all things happen of necessity. For
                effects are said to be necessary or contingent according to the
                condition of proximate causes. Evidently, if the first cause is
                necessary and the second cause is contingent, a contingent
                effect will follow. Thus in the case of lower bodies, the first
                cause of generation is the movement of a heavenly body; although
                this movement takes place necessarily, generation and corruption
                in those lower bodies occur contingently, because the lower
                causes are contingent and can fail. As we demonstrated above,
                God carries out the order of His providence through the
                intermediacy of lower causes. Therefore some of the effects of
                divine providence will be contingent, in keeping with the
                condition of the lower causes.

                The contingency of effects or of causes cannot upset the
                certainty of divine providence. Three things seem to guarantee
                the certainty of providence: the infallibility of divine
                foreknowledge, the efficaciousness of the divine will, and the
                wisdom. of the divine management, which discovers adequate ways
                of procuring an effect. None of these factors is opposed to the
                contingency of things.

                        Moreover, God’s will, since it is the universal cause of
                        things, decides not only that something will come to
                        pass, but that it will come about in this or that
                        manner. The efficaciousness of the divine will demands
                        not only that what God wishes will happen, but that it
                        will happen in the way He wishes. But He wills that some
                        things should happen necessarily and that other things
                        should happen contingently; both are required for the
                        perfection of the universe. That events may occur in
                        both ways, He applies necessary causes to some things
                        and contingent causes to others. In this manner, with
                        some things happening necessarily and other things
                        happening contingently, the divine will is efficaciously
                        carried out.

                            providence is safeguarded by the wisdom of the
                            divine dispensation, without prejudice to the
                            contingency of things. Even the providence exercised
                            by man can enable him so to bolster up a cause which
                            can fail to produce an effect that, in some cases,
                            the effect will inevitably follow. We find that a
                            physician acts thus in exercising his healing art,
                            as also does the vine-dresser who employs the proper
                            remedy against barrenness in his vines. Much more,
                            then, does the wisdom of the divine economy bring it
                            about that, although contingent causes left to
                            themselves can fail to produce an effect, the effect
                            will inevitably follow when certain supplementary
                            measures are employed; nor does this do away with
                            the contingency of the effect. Evidently, therefore,
                            contingency in things does not exclude the certainty
                            of divine providence.

                The same process of reasoning enables us to perceive that,
                without prejudice to divine providence, evil can arise in the
                world because of defects in secondary causes. Thus in causes
                that follow one another in order, we see that evil finds its way
                into an effect owing to some fault in a secondary cause,
                although this fault is by no means the product of the first
                cause. For example, the evil of lameness is caused by a
                curvature in the leg, not by the motive power of the soul.
                Whatever movement there is in the progress of a lame man, is
                attributed to the motive power as to its cause; but the
                unevenness of the progress is caused by the curvature of the
                leg, not by the motive power. Similarly the evil that arises in
                things, so far as it has existence or species or a certain
                nature, is referred to God as to its cause; for there can be no
                evil unless it resides in something good,. as is clear from what
                we said above. But with regard to the defect that disfigures it,
                the evil is referred to a lower, defectible cause. Accordingly’
                although God is the universal cause of all things, He is not the
                cause of evil as evil. But whatever good is bound up with the
                evil, has God as its cause.

                inconsistent with the divine goodness. For, in the first place,
                the function of providence is not to destroy but to save the
                nature of the beings governed. The perfection of the universe
                requires the existence of some beings that are not subject to
                evil, and of other beings that can suffer the defect of evil in
                keeping with their nature. If evil were completely eliminated
                from things, they would not be governed by divine providence in
                accord with their nature; and this would be a greater defect
                than the particular defects eradicated.

                    Secundo, quia bonum unius non potest accidere sine malo
                    alterius, sicut videmus quod generatio unius non est sine
                    corruptione alterius, et nutrimentum leonis non est sine
                    occisione alterius animalis, et patientia iusti non est sine
                    persecutione iniusti. Si igitur malum totaliter excluderetur
                    a rebus, sequeretur quod multa etiam bona tollerentur. Non
                    igitur pertinet ad divinam providentiam ut malum totaliter
                    excludatur a rebus, sed ut mala quae proveniunt, ad aliquod
                    bonum ordinentur.

                    Secondly, the good of one cannot be realized without the
                    suffering of evil by another. For instance, we find that the
                    generation of one being does not take place without the
                    corruption of another being, and that the nourishment of a
                    lion is impossible without the destruction of some other
                    animal, and that the patient endurance of the just involves
                    persecution by the unjust. If evil were completely excluded
                    from things, much good would be rendered impossible.
                    Consequently it is the concern of divine providence, not to
                    safeguard all beings from evil, but to see to it that the
                    evil which arises is ordained to some good.

                        divina bonitas magis declaratur in bonis, et sapientia

                        Thirdly, good is rendered more estimable when compared
                        with particular evils. For example, the brilliance of
                        white is brought out more clearly when set off by the
                        dinginess of black. And so, by permitting the existence
                        of evil in the world, the divine goodness is more
                        emphatically asserted in the good, just as is the divine
                        wisdom when it forces evil to promote good.

                Accordingly, divine providence governs individual beings in
                keeping with their nature. Since rational creatures, because of
                the gift of free will, enjoy dominion over their actions in a
                way impossible to other creatures, a special providence must be
                exercised over them in two respects. First, with regard to the
                aids God gives to rational creatures in their activity,
                secondly, with regard to the recompense allotted for their
                works. God gives to irrational creatures only those aids by
                which they are naturally moved to act. But to rational creatures
                are issued instructions and commands regulating their lives. A
                precept is not fittingly given except to a being that is master
                of his actions, although in an analogous sense God is said to
                give commands to irrational creatures also, as is intimated in
                Psalm 148:6: “He made a decree, and it shall not pass away.” But
                this sort of decree is nothing else than the dispensation of
                divine providence moving natural things to their proper actions.

                    Similiter etiam actiones creaturarum rationalium imputantur

                    actus, non solum hominibus ab homine praesidente, sed etiam
                    a Deo, cum homines non solum regantur ab homine, sed etiam a

                    ut supra dictum est, creaturae rationales secundum iustitiam
                    divinae providentiae et puniuntur pro malis, et praemiantur
                    pro bonis. In creaturis autem irrationabilibus non habet

                    The deeds of rational creatures are imputed to them in blame
                    or in praise, because they have dominion over their acts.
                    The actions of men are ascribed to them not only by a man
                    who is placed over them, but also by God. Thus any
                    praiseworthy or blameworthy action that a man performs is
                    imputed to him by the person to whose rule he is subject.
                    Since good actions merit a reward and sin calls for
                    punishment, as was said above, rational creatures are
                    punished for the evil they do and are rewarded for the good.
                    they do, according to the measure of justice fixed by divine
                    providence. But there is no place for reward or punishment
                    in dealing with irrational creatures, just as there is none
                    for praise or blame.

                        Since the last end of rational creatures exceeds the

                        the end must be proportionate to the end according to
                        the right order of providence, rational creatures are
                        given divine aids that are not merely proportionate to
                        nature but that transcend the capacity of nature. God
                        infuses into man, over and above the natural faculty of
                        reason, the light of grace whereby he is internally
                        perfected for the exercise of virtue, both as regards
                        knowledge, inasmuch as man’s mind is elevated by this
                        light to the knowledge of truths surpassing reason, and
                        as regards action and affection, inasmuch as man’s
                        affective power is raised by this light above all
                        created things to the love of God, to hope in Him, and
                        to the performance of acts that such love imposes.

                            These gifts or aids supernaturally given to man are
                            called graces for two reasons. First, because they
                            are given by God gratis. Nothing is discoverable in
                            man that would constitute a right to aids of this
                            sort, for they exceed the capacity of nature.
                            Secondly, because in a very special way man is made
                            <i>gratus</i>, or pleasing to God, by such gifts.
                            Since God’s love is the cause of goodness in things
                            and is not called forth by any pre-existing
                            goodness, as our love is, a special intensity of
                            divine love must be discerned in those whom He
                            showers with such extraordinary effects of His
                            goodness. Therefore God is said chiefly and simply
                            to love those whom He endows with these effects of
                            His love by which they are enabled to reach their
                            last end, which is He Himself, the fountainhead of
                            all goodness.

                    Furthermore, God’s providence over things is in harmony with
                    their mode of being. Changeable things are so constituted
                    that contraries can succeed each other in them; examples are
                    generation and corruption in corporeal matter, and white and
                    black in a colored object. Man is changeable in will as long
                    as he lives his earthly life. Hence man receives from God
                    the gifts of grace in such a way that he is able to forfeit
                    them by sin; and the sins man commits are such that they can
                    be remitted by the gifts of grace.

                        Besides, in supernatural acts, possible and impossible
                        are regarded from the standpoint of divine power, not
                        from the standpoint of natural power. The fact that a
                        blind man can be made to see or that a dead man can
                        rise, is owing not to natural power but to divine power.
                        But the gifts of grace are supernatural. Therefore a
                        person’s capacity to receive them depends on divine
                        power. To say that, once a person has sinned, he cannot
                        receive the gifts of grace, is derogatory to the power
                        of God. Of course, grace cannot co-exist with sin; for
                        by grace man is rightly ordered to his end, from which
                        he is turned away by sin. But the contention that sin is
                        irremissible, impugns the power of God.

                The suggestion might be put forward that sins are unforgivable,
                not through any lack of power on God’s part, but because divine
                justice has decided that anyone who falls from grace shall never
                more be restored to it. But such a position is clearly
                erroneous. There is no provision in the order of divine justice
                to the effect that, while a person is on the road, he should
                have assigned to him what belongs to the end of the journey, But
                unyielding adherence to good or to evil pertains to the end of
                life’s course; immobility and cessation from Activity are the
                terminus of movement. On the other hand, the whole of our
                present life is a time of wayfaring, as is shown by man’s
                changeableness both in body and in soul. Accordingly divine
                justice does not determine that after sinning a man must remain
                immovably in the state of sin.

                    praesertim cum peccata quae gratiam praecedunt, remittantur
                    per gratiam, quae interdum maiora sunt his quae post gratiam
                    susceptam homo committit. Non est igitur dicendum quod

                    Moreover, divine benefits do not expose man to danger,
                    particularly in affairs of supreme moment. But it would be
                    dangerous for man, while leading a life subject to change,
                    to accept grace if, after receiving grace, he could sin but
                    could not again be restored to grace. This is so especially
                    in view of the fact that sins preceding grace are remitted
                    by the infusion of grace; and at times such sins are more
                    grievous than those man commits after receiving grace.
                    Therefore we may not hold that man’s sins are unforgivable
                    either before or after they are committed.

                God alone can forgive sin. For only the one against whom an
                offense is directed can forgive the offense. Sin is imputed to
                man as an offense not only by another man, but also by God, as
                we said above. However, we are now considering sin as imputed to
                man by God. Accordingly, God alone can forgive sin.

                    his end. This is accomplished through the gifts of grace
                    which come from God alone, since they transcend the power of
                    nature. Therefore only God can remit sin.

                This, then, is the second of God’s effects, namely, the
                government of things, and especially of rational creatures, to
                whom God gives grace and whose sins He forgives. This effect is
                touched on in the Creed. When we profess that the Holy Spirit is
                God, we imply that all things are ordained to the end of divine
                goodness, since it belongs to God to order His subjects to their
                end. And the words of the Creed which express our belief that
                the Holy Spirit is “the Life-giver,” suggest that God moves all
                things. For, as the movement flowing from the soul to the body
                is the life of the body, so the movement, whereby the universe
                is moved by God is, so to speak, a certain life of the universe.

                    Further, since the entire process of divine government is

                finis est quodammodo purgationis, sicut etiam potionis purgatio.

                All things are directed to the divine goodness as to their end,
                as we have shown. Among things ordained to this end, some are
                closer to the end than others, and so participate in the divine
                goodness most abundantly. Therefore lesser creatures, which have
                a smaller share in the divine goodness, are in some way
                subordinated to higher beings as to their ends. In any hierarchy
                of ends, beings that are closer to the ultimate end are also
                ends with respect to beings that are more remote. For instance,
                a dose of medicine is administered to procure a purge, the purge
                is designed to promote slimness, and slimness is desirable for
                health; and thus slimness is, in a sense, the purpose of the
                purging, as the purging is the purpose of the medicine. And such
                subordination is reasonable. As in the order of efficient
                causes, the power of the first agent reaches the ultimate
                effects through intermediate causes, so in the order of ends,
                whatever is farther removed from the end attains to the ultimate
                end through the intermediacy of beings that are closer to the
                end. Thus, in our example, the medicine has no relation to
                health except through purging. Similarly, in the order of the
                universe, lower beings realize their last end chiefly by their
                subordination to higher beings.

                    The same conclusion is manifest if we turn our attention to
                    the order of things in itself. Things that come into being
                    by a natural process, act as they are equipped by nature to
                    act. As we observe, however, imperfect beings serve the
                    needs of more noble beings; plants draw their nutriment from
                    the earth, animals feed on plants, and these in turn serve
                    man’s use. We conclude, then, that lifeless beings exist for
                    living beings, plants for animals, and the latter for men.
                    And since, as we have seen, intellectual nature is superior
                    to material nature, the whole of material nature is
                    subordinate to intellectual nature. But among intellectual
                    natures, that which has the closest ties with the body is
                    the rational soul, which is the form of man. In a certain
                    sense, therefore, we may say that the whole of corporeal
                    nature exists for man, inasmuch as he is a rational animal.
                    And so the consummation of the whole of corporeal nature
                    depends, to some extent, on man’s consummation.

                Man’s consummation consists in the attainment of his last end,
                which is perfect beatitude or happiness, and this consists in
                the vision of God, as was demonstrated above. The beatific
                vision entails immutability in the intellect and will. As
                regards the intellect, its questing ceases when at last it comes
                to the first cause, in which all truth can be known. The will’s
                variability ceases, too; for, when it reaches its last end, in
                which is contained the fullness of all goodness, it finds
                nothing further to be desired. The will is subject to change
                because it craves what it does not possess. Clearly, therefore,
                the final consummation of man consists in perfect repose or
                unchangeableness as regards both intellect and will.

                We showed in an earlier chapter that the idea of eternity
                involves immutability. As motion causes time, in which priority
                and posteriority are discerned, so the cessation of motion puts
                a stop to priority and posteriority; and so nothing remains but
                eternity, which is simultaneously whole. Therefore in his final
                consummation man attains eternal life, not only in the sense
                that he lives an immortal life in his soul, for this is a
                property of the rational soul by its very nature, as was shown
                above, but also in the sense that he is brought to the
                perfection of immobility.

                We should note that the disquiet of the will cannot be wholly
                overcome unless natural desire is completely satisfied. Elements
                that are by nature destined for union, naturally desire to be
                united to each other; for any being seeks what is suited to it
                by nature. Since, therefore, the natural condition of the human
                soul is to be united to the body, as was pointed out above, it
                has a natural desire for union with the body. Hence the will
                cannot be perfectly at rest until the soul is again joined to
                the body. When this takes place, man rises from the dead.

                    Besides, final perfection requires possession of a being’s
                    original perfection. But the first perfection of anything
                    requires that it be perfect in its nature, and final
                    perfection consists in attainment of the last end. In order,
                    therefore, that the human soul may be brought to complete
                    perfection with regard to its end, it must be perfect in its
                    nature. This is impossible unless the soul is united to the
                    body. For by nature the soul is a part of man as his form.
                    But no part is perfect in its nature unless it exists in its
                    whole. Therefore man’s final happiness requires the soul to
                    be again united to the body.

                We may have a suspicion that separation of the soul from the
                body is not <i>per accidens</i> but is in accord with nature.
                For man’s body is made up of contrary elements. Everything of
                this sort is naturally corruptible. Therefore the human body is
                naturally corruptible. But when the body corrupts the soul must
                survive as a separate entity if the soul is immortal, as in fact
                it is. Apparently, then, separation of the soul from the body is
                in accord with nature.

                    In view of these considerations, we must take up the
                    question, how this separation is according to nature, and
                    how it is opposed to nature. We showed above that the
                    rational soul exceeds the capacity of all corporeal matter
                    in a measure impossible to other forms. This is demonstrated
                    by its intellectual activity, which it exercises without the
                    body. To the end that corporeal matter might be fittingly
                    adapted to the soul, there had to be added to the body some
                    disposition that would make it suitable matter for such a
                    form. And in the same way that this form itself receives
                    existence from God alone through creation, that disposition,
                    transcending as it does corporeal nature, was conferred on
                    the human body by God alone, for the purpose of preserving
                    the body itself in a state of incorruption, so that it might
                    match the soul’s perpetual existence. This disposition
                    remained in man’s body as long as man’s soul cleaved to God.

                When substances corrupt, the survival of the species, but not
                the restoration of the individual, is effected by the action of
                nature. The cloud from which rain is produced and the cloud
                which is again formed by evaporation from the fallen rain water,
                are not numerically the same. Accordingly, since the human body
                substantially dissolves in death, it cannot be restored to
                numerical identity by the action of nature. But the concept of
                resurrection requires such identity, as we have just shown.
                Consequently the resurrection of man will not be brought about
                by the action of nature, as some philosophers [Empedocles] have
                held in their theory that, when all bodies return to the
                position formerly occupied after untold cycles of years, then
                also men will return to life in the same numerical identity. No,
                the restoration of all who rise will be effected solely by
                divine power.

                    solum per generationem accipiuntur, eo quod non sit
                    possibile idem numero pluries generari. Si autem aliquid
                    huiusmodi restituatur alicui, puta oculus erutus, aut manus
                    abscissa, hoc erit virtute divina, quae supra naturae

                    Moreover, it is clear that senses once destroyed, and
                    anything possessed as a result of generation, cannot be
                    restored by the activity of nature, for the simple reason
                    that the same numerical being cannot be generated several
                    times. If any such perfection is restored to anyone, for
                    example, an eye that has been torn out or a hand that has
                    been cut off, it will be through divine power which operates
                    beyond the order of nature, as we said above. Therefore,
                    since all the senses and all the members of man corrupt in
                    death, a dead man cannot be brought back to life except by

                        how the same numerical body will be revived. Since all
                        things, even the very least, are included under divine
                        providence, as we showed above, the matter composing
                        this human body of ours, whatever form it may take after
                        man’s death, evidently does not elude the power or the
                        knowledge of God. Such matter remains numerically the
                        same, in the sense that it exists under quantitative
                        dimensions, by reason of which it can be said to be this
                        particular matter, and is the principle of
                        individuation. If then, this matter remains the same,
                        and if the human body is again fashioned from it by
                        divine power, and if also the rational soul which
                        remains the same in its incorruptibility is united to
                        the same body, the result is that identically the same

                            humanity is the form of the body also, in the sense
                            that it confers species on the whole.”“” If this is

                            same, since the rational soul remains numerically
                            the same.

                                Humanity, however, is that which is signified by
                                the definition of man, as the essence of
                                anything whatever is that which is signified by
                                its definition. But the definition of man
                                signifies not form alone but also matter, since
                                matter must be comprised in the definition of
                                material things. Hence we shall do better to
                                say, with others, that both soul and body are
                                included in the notion of humanity, although
                                otherwise than in the definition of man. The
                                notion of humanity embraces only the essential
                                principles of man, prescinding from all other
                                factors. For, since humanity is understood to be
                                that whereby man is man, whatever cannot truly
                                be said to constitute man as man, is evidently
                                cut off from the notion of humanity. But when we
                                speak of man, who has humanity, the fact that he
                                has humanity does not exclude the possession of
                                other attributes, for instance, whiteness, and
                                the like. The term “man” signifies man’s
                                essential principles, but not to the exclusion
                                of other factors, even though these other
                                factors are not actually, but only potentially,
                                contained in the notion of man. Hence “man”
                                signifies as a whole, per <i>modum totius</i>,
                                whereas “humanity” signifies as a part, per
                                <i>modum partis</i>, and is not predicated of
                                man. In Socrates, then, or in Plato, this
                                determinate matter and this particular form are
                                included. just as the notion of man implies
                                composition of matter and form, so if Socrates
                                were to be defined, the notion of him would
                                imply that he is composed of this flesh and
                                these bones and this soul. Consequently, since
                                humanity is not some third form in addition to
                                soul and body, but is composed of both, we see
                                clearly that, if the same body is restored and
                                if the same soul remains, the humanity will be
                                numerically the same.

                                    The numerical identity in question is not
                                    frustrated on the ground that the corporeity
                                    recovered is not numerically the same, for
                                    the reason that it corrupts when the body
                                    corrupts. If by corporeity is meant the
                                    substantial form by which a thing is
                                    classified in the genus of corporeal
                                    substance, such corporeity is nothing else
                                    than the soul, seeing that there is but one
                                    substantial form for each thing. In virtue
                                    of this particular soul, this animal is not
                                    only animal, but is animated body, and body,
                                    and also this thing existing in the genus of
                                    substance. Otherwise the soul would come to
                                    a body already existing in act, and so would
                                    be an accidental form. The subject of a
                                    substantial form is something existing only
                                    in potency, not in act. When it receives the
                                    substantial form it is not said to be
                                    generated merely in this or that respect, as
                                    is the case with accidental forms, but is
                                    said to be generated simply, as simply
                                    receiving existence. And therefore the
                                    corporeity that is received remains
                                    numerically the same, since the same
                                    rational soul continues to exist.

                                        relation, and therefore an accident, its
                                        numerical diversity does not prevent the
                                        numerical identity of the subject; nor,
                                        for that matter, does numerical
                                        diversity among the powers of the
                                        sensitive and vegetative soul, if they
                                        are supposed to have corrupted. For the
                                        natural powers existing in the human
                                        composite are in the genus of accident;
                                        and what we call “sensible” is derived,
                                        not from the senses according as sense
                                        is the specific difference constituting
                                        animal, but from the very substance of
                                        the sensitive soul, which in man is
                                        essentially identical with the rational
                                        soul.

                Although men will rise as the same individuals, they will not
                have the same kind of life as before. Now their life is
                corruptible; then it will be incorruptible. If nature aims at.
                perpetual existence in the generation of man, much more so does
                God in the restoration of man. Nature’s tendency toward
                never-ending existence comes from an impulse implanted by God.
                The perpetual existence of the species is not in question in the
                restoration of risen man, for this could be procured by repeated
                generation. Therefore what is intended is the perpetual
                existence of the individual. Accordingly risen men will live
                forever.

                    circa eundem hominem reiterabuntur, quod videtur esse vanum.
                    Convenientius est igitur ut stetur in primo, scilicet ut in

                    Besides, if men once risen were to die, the souls separated
                    from their bodies would not remain forever deprived of the
                    body, for this would be against the nature of the soul, as
                    we said above. Therefore they would have to rise again; and
                    the same thing would happen if they were to die again after
                    the second resurrection. Thus death and life would revolve
                    around each man in cycles of infinite succession; which
                    seems futile. Surely a halt is better called at the initial
                    stage, so that men might rise to immortal life at the first
                    resurrection.

                        diversity either in species or in number. The idea of
                        mortality contains nothing that could make it a specific
                        difference of man, since it signifies no more than a
                        passion. It is used to serve as a specific difference of
                        man in the sense that the nature of man is designated by
                        calling him mortal, to bring out the fact that he is
                        composed of contrary elements, just as his proper form
                        is designated by the predicate “rational”; material
                        things cannot be defined without including matter.
                        However, mortality is not overcome by taking away man’s
                        proper matter. For the soul will not resume a celestial
                        or ethereal body, as was mentioned above; it will resume
                        a human body made up of contrary elements.
                        Incorruptibility will come as an effect of divine power,
                        whereby the soul will gain dominion over the body to the
                        point that the body cannot corrupt. For a thing
                        continues in being as long as form has dominion over
                        matter.

                        Again, since semen is the superfluous part of
                        nourishment, cessation of the use of food necessarily
                        entails cessation of the exercise of the reproductive
                        functions. On the other hand, we cannot maintain with
                        propriety that the use of food, drink, and the
                        reproductive powers will remain solely for the sake of
                        pleasure. Nothing inordinate will occur in that final
                        state, because then all things will receive their
                        perfect consummation, each in its own way. But
                        de-ordination is opposed to perfection. Also, since the
                        restoration of man through resurrection will be effected
                        directly by God, no de-ordination will be able to find
                        its way into that state; whatever is from God is well
                        ordered. But desire for the use of food and the exercise
                        of the reproductive powers for pleasure alone, would be
                        inordinate; indeed, even during our present life people
                        regard such conduct as vicious. Among the risen,
                        consequently, the use of food, drink, and the

                Although risen men will not occupy themselves with activities of
                this sort, they will not lack the organs requisite for such
                functions. Without the organs in question the risen body would
                not be complete. But it is fitting that nature should be
                completely restored at the renovation of risen man, for such
                renovation will be accomplished directly by God, whose works are
                perfect. Therefore all the members of the body will have their
                place in the risen, for the preservation of nature in its
                entirety rather than for the exercise of their normal functions.

                    other than the divine, which does not admit of deficiency.

                These remarks about the integrity of risen men should be
                understood as referring to whatever pertains to the true state
                of human nature. What is not required for the reality of human
                nature, will not be resumed by risen man. Thus, if all the
                accretion of matter from the food that has been changed into
                flesh and blood were to be resumed, the size of risen man would
                exceed all bounds. The proper condition of any nature is
                regulated by its species and form. Accordingly all the parts
                that are consonant with the human species and form will be
                integrally present in risen man: not only organic parts, but
                other parts of like nature, such as flesh and sinews, which
                enter into the composition of the various organs. Of course, not
                all the matter that was ever contained in those parts during
                man’s natural life will again be taken up, but only so much as
                will be enough to constitute the species of the parts in
                integrity.

                    not be the same individual, or that he will not be complete.
                    During the course of the present life, man evidently remains
                    numerically the same from birth to death. Nevertheless the
                    material composition of his parts does not remain the same,
                    but undergoes gradual flux and reflux, in somewhat the way
                    that the same fire is kept up although some logs are
                    consumed and others are fed to the blaze. Man is whole when
                    his species and the quantity due to his species are
                    preserved intact.

                For the same reason that God, in restoring the risen body, does
                not reclaim all the material elements once possessed by man’s
                body, He will supply whatever is wanting to the proper amount of
                matter. Nature itself has such power. In infancy we do not as
                yet possess our full quantity; but by assimilating food and
                drink we receive enough matter from outside sources to round out
                our perfect quantity; nor on this account does a man cease to be
                the same individual he was before. Surely, then, divine power
                can do the same thing much more easily, so that those who do not
                have sufficient quantity may be supplied from outside matter
                with whatever was lacking to them in this life as regards
                integrity of natural members or suitable size. Consequently,
                although some may have lacked certain of their members during
                this life, or may not have attained to perfect size, the amount
                of quantity possessed at the moment of death makes no
                difference; at the resurrection they will receive, through God’s
                power, the due complement of members and quantity.

                unde natus est filius, sit sumptum ex carnibus alterius, et ita
                impossibile videtur puerum ex tali semine genitum resurgere, si

                This enables us to answer the objections that some raise against
                the resurrection. For instance, they say that a cannibal may
                have eaten human flesh, and later, thus nourished, may beget a
                son, who eats the same kind of food. If what is eaten is changed
                into the substance of the eater’s flesh, it seems impossible for
                both to rise in their full integrity, for the flesh of one has
                been changed into the flesh of the other. The difficulty
                apparently grows if semen is the product of surplus food, as the
                philosophers teach [Aristotle, <i>De generatione animalium</i>,
                I, 18, 726 a 26; for the semen whereby the son is begotten would
                then be derived from the flesh of another person. And so it
                seems impossible for a boy begotten from such seed to rise, if
                the men whose flesh the father and the son himself devoured rise
                intact.

                    But this state of affairs is not incompatible with a general

                    elements ever present in any man need be resumed when he
                    rises; only so much matter is required as suffices to keep
                    up the amount of quantity he ought to have. We also pointed
                    out that if anyone is lacking in the matter required for
                    perfect quantity, divine power will supply what is needed.

                        We should note, moreover, that the material elements
                        existing in man’s body are found to pertain to true
                        human nature in various degrees. First and foremost,
                        what is received from one’s parents, is brought to
                        perfection within the reality of the human species, as
                        its purest element ‘ by the parents’ formative
                        causality. Secondly, what is contributed by food, is
                        necessary for the proper quantity of the body’s members
                        and lastly, since the introduction of a foreign
                        substance always weakens a thing’s energy, growth must
                        eventually cease and the body must become old and decay,
                        just as wine eventually becomes watery if water is mixed
                        in with it.

                            reproduction and hair for covering and adornment.

                                adjusted in accord with divine providence. If
                                the same matter existed in different men, it

                                higher function. If it existed in two men in
                                exactly the same way, it will rise in him who
                                had it first; in the other, the lack will be
                                made up by divine power. And so we can see that
                                the flesh of a man that was devoured by another,
                                will rise not in the cannibal, but in him to
                                whom it belonged originally. But as regards the
                                nutritive fluid present in it, it will rise in
                                the son begotten of semen formed from that
                                flesh. The rest of it will rise in the first man
                                in this series, and God will supply what is
                                wanting to each of the three.

                That we may give expression to our faith in the resurrection, we
                are instructed to say in the Apostles’ Creed: “I believe... in
                the resurrection of the body.” The word “body” was inserted not
                without reason: even in the age of the Apostles there were some
                who denied the resurrection of the body, and admitted no more
                than a spiritual resurrection, whereby a man rises from the
                death of sin. Therefore the Apostle, in 2 Timothy 2:18, has
                occasion to refer to certain individuals: “Who have erred from
                the truth, saying that the resurrection is past already, and
                have subverted the faith of some.” To abolish this error, so
                that belief in the future resurrection may be professed, the
                Creed of the Fathers proclaims: “I look for the resurrection of
                the dead.”

                operationem cui principaliter intendit, et in hoc dicitur vita
                eius consistere: sicut qui voluptatibus principaliter vacant,
                dicuntur vitam voluptuosam agere; qui vero contemplationi,
                contemplativam; qui vero civitatibus gubernandis, civilem.
                Ostensum est autem quod resurgentibus neque ciborum neque
                venereorum aderit usus, ad quem omnia corporalia exercitia
                ordinari videntur. Subtractis autem corporalibus exercitiis
                remanent spirituales operationes, in quibus ultimum hominis

                Deus autem aeternus est: unde oportet quod intellectus

                voluptuosam vitam agere dicuntur, ita qui divina potiuntur
                visione, aeternam obtinent vitam, secundum illud Ioan. XVII, 3:
                haec est vita aeterna, ut cognoscant te Deum verum, et quem
                misisti Iesum Christum.

                We go on to consider the nature of the activity exercised by
                risen men. Each living being must have some activity that mainly
                engrosses its attention, and its life is said to consist in this
                occupation. Thus those who cultivate pleasure more than anything
                else, are said to lead a voluptuous life; those who give their
                time to contemplation, are said to lead a contemplative life;
                and those who devote their energies to civil government, are
                said to lead a political life. We have shown that risen men will
                have no occasion to use food or the reproductive functions,
                although all bodily activity seems to tend in the direction of
                such use. But, even if the exercise of bodily functions ceases,
                there remain spiritual activities, in which man’s ultimate end
                consists, as we have said; and the risen are in a position to
                achieve this end once they are freed from their former condition
                of corruption and changeableness. Of course, man’s last end
                consists, not in spiritual acts of any sort whatever, but in the
                vision of God according to His essence, as was stated above. And
                God is eternal; hence the intellect must be in contact with
                eternity. Accordingly, just as those who give their time to
                pleasure are said to lead a voluptuous life, so those who enjoy
                the vision of God possess eternal life, as is indicated in John
                17:3: “This is eternal life: that they may know you, the only
                true God, and Jesus Christ whom you sent.”

                The created intellect will see God in His essence, and not in
                any mere likeness. In the latter kind of vision, the object
                understood may be at a distance from the present intellect; for
                example, a stone is present to the eye by its likeness, but is
                absent in substance. But, as was shown above, God’s very essence
                is in some mysterious way united to the created intellect, so
                that God may be seen just as He is. Thus, when we arrive at our
                last end, what was formerly believed about God will be seen, and
                what was hoped for as absent will be closely embraced as
                present. This is called comprehension, according to the
                expression used by the Apostle in Philippians 3:12: “I press on,
                that I may grasp it.” This is not to be understood in the sense
                that comprehension implies all-inclusive knowledge, but in the
                sense that it denotes the presence and a certain clasping of
                what is said to be comprehended.

                igitur intellectus Deum videns, in eius visione non delectari.

                We should further understand that delight is engendered by the
                apprehension of a suitable good. Thus sight rejoices in
                beautiful colors, and taste in sweet savors. But this delight of
                the senses can be prevented if the organ is indisposed; the same
                light that is charming to healthy eyes is annoying to sore eyes.
                However, since the intellect does not understand by employing a
                bodily organ, as we showed above, no sorrow mars the delight
                that consists in the contemplation of truth. Of course, sadness
                can indirectly attend the mind’s contemplation, when the object
                of truth is apprehended as harmful. Thus knowledge of truth may
                cause pleasure in ‘the intellect, while at the same time the
                object known may engender sorrow in the will, not precisely
                because the object is known, but because its action is
                pernicious. God, however, by the very fact that He exists, is
                truth. Therefore the intellect that sees God cannot but rejoice
                in the vision of Him.

                    Besides, God is goodness itself, and goodness is the cause
                    of love. Hence God’s goodness must necessarily be loved by
                    all who apprehend it. Although an object that is good may
                    fail to call forth love, or may even be hated, the reason is
                    not that it is apprehended as good, but that it is
                    apprehended as harmful. Consequently in the vision of God,
                    who is goodness and truth itself, there must be love or
                    joyous fruition, no less than comprehension. This accords
                    with Isaiah 66:14: “You shall see and your heart shall
                    rejoice.”

                This enables us to understand that the soul which sees God—and
                the same is true of any other spiritual creature—has its will
                firmly fixed in Him, so that it can never turn to what is
                opposed to Him. For, since the object of the will is the good,
                the will cannot incline to anything whatever unless it exhibits
                some aspect of good. Any particular good may be wanting in some
                perfection, which the knower is then free to seek in another
                quarter. Therefore the will of him who beholds some particular
                good need not rest content with its possession, but may search
                farther afield beyond its orbit. But God, who is universal good
                and very goodness itself, is not lacking in any good that may be
                sought elsewhere, as was shown above. And so those who enjoy the
                vision of God’s essence cannot turn their will from Him, but
                must rather desire all things in subordination to Him.

                    Something similar is observed in the process of
                    understanding. Our mind, when in doubt, can turn this way
                    and that, until it reaches a first principle; then the
                    intellect must come to a halt. Since the end has the same
                    function in the field of desire that a principle has in the
                    matter of understanding, the will can veer in opposite
                    directions until it comes to the knowledge or fruition of
                    the last end, in which it must rest. The nature of perfect
                    happiness would be contradicted if man, after achieving it,
                    could turn to what is opposed to it. For then fear of losing
                    happiness would not be wholly excluded, and so desire would
                    not be completely satisfied. Hence the Apocalypse 3:12 says
                    of the blessed person, that “he shall go out no more.”

                The body is for the soul, as matter is for form and a tool for
                the craftsman. At the resurrection, therefore, when the life we
                have been speaking of is attained, God will join to the soul a
                body such as befits the beatitude of the soul; for whatever
                exists for the sake of an end, must be duly disposed in accord
                with the demands of the end. A soul that has arrived at the peak
                of intellectual activity cannot appropriately have a body that
                would in any way prove an impediment or a burden to it. But the
                human body, by reason of its corruptibility, does obstruct and
                slow down the soul, so that the soul can neither devote itself
                to uninterrupted contemplation nor reach the heights of
                contemplation.

                    This is why men are able to grasp divine truths more readily

                    revelations are made to men when asleep, or when they are
                    lost in mental ecstasy, as we read in Numbers 12:6: “If
                    there be among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to
                    him in a vision, or I will speak to him in a dream.”
                    Therefore the bodies of risen saints will not be corruptible

                    contrary, they will be incorruptible and will be wholly

                This doctrine gives us an insight into the condition of the
                bodies of the blessed. The soul is both the form and the motive
                force of the body. In its function as form, the soul is the
                principle of the body, not only as regards the body’s
                substantial being, but also as regards its proper accidents,
                which arise in the subject from the union of form with matter.
                The more dominant the form is, the less can any outside cause
                interfere with the impression made by the form on matter. We see
                this verified in the case of fire, whose form, generally
                accounted the noblest of all elementary forms, confers on fire
                the power of not being easily diverted from its natural
                disposition by the influence emanating from any cause.

                    Since the blessed soul, owing to its union with the first
                    principle of all things, will be raised to the pinnacle of
                    nobility and power, it will communicate substantial
                    existence in the most perfect degree to the body that has
                    been joined to it by divine action. And thus, holding the
                    body completely under its sway, the soul will render the
                    body subtle and spiritual. The soul will also bestow on the
                    body a most,noble quality, namely, the radiant beauty of
                    clarity. Further, because of the influence emanating from
                    the soul, the body’s stability will not be subject to
                    alteration by any cause; which means that the body will be
                    impassible. Lastly, since the body will be wholly submissive
                    to the soul, as a tool is to him who plies it, it will be
                    endowed with agility. Hence the properties of the bodies
                    belonging to the blessed will be these four: subtlety,
                    clarity, impassibility, and agility.

                        This is the sense of the Apostle’s words in 1
                        Corinthians 15:42 ff.: In death the body “is sown in
                        corruption, it shall rise in incorruption;” this refers
                        to impassibility. “It is sown in dishonor, it shall rise
                        in glory;” this refers to clarity. “It is sown in
                        weakness, it shall rise in power,” and hence will have
                        agility. “It is sown a natural body, it shall rise a
                        spiritual body;” in other words, it will be endowed with
                        subtlety.

                It is manifest that all things existing for some definite end
                are disposed in an order required by the end. Therefore, if that
                to which other things are related as means can vary from perfect
                to imperfect, the means subordinated to it must be subject to
                parallel variation, so as to serve the end in either state. Food
                and clothing, for instance, are prepared otherwise for a child
                than for a grown man. We have already called attention to the
                fact that material creation is subordinated to rational nature
                as to its end. Consequently, when man is admitted to his final
                perfection after the resurrection, material creation must take
                on a new condition. This is why we are told that the world is to
                undergo renovation when man rises, as is taught in the
                Apocalypse 21:1: “I saw a new heaven and a new earth,” and in
                Isaiah 65:17: “For behold, I create new heavens and a new

                However, we should remember that the different kinds of material
                creatures are subordinated to man in different ways. Plants and
                animals serve man by aiding him in his weakness, in the sense
                that they supply him with food and clothing and transportation
                and like conveniences, whereby human feebleness is strengthened.
                But in the final state that comes after the resurrection all
                such defects will be eliminated from man. Men will no longer
                need food to eat, since they will be incorruptible, as we have
                pointed out. Nor will men need garments to cover their
                nakedness, because they will be clothed with the radiance of
                glory. Nor will they require animals to carry them, as they will
                be endowed with agility. Nor will they need medicines to keep
                them in health, since they will be impassible. In that state of
                final consummation, therefore, as we should expect, there will
                be no material creatures of this kind, namely, plants and
                animals and other like mixed bodies.

                    as regards the composition of his body. The human body is
                    made up of these elements. And so the elements have an
                    essential ordination to the human body. Hence, when man is

                        As for the heavenly bodies, their substance is not
                        utilized for the support of man’s corruptible life, and
                        does not enter into the substance of the human frame.
                        However, they serve man in the sense that by their
                        beauty and enormous size they show forth the excellence
                        of their Creator. For this reason man is often exhorted
                        in Sacred Scripture to contemplate the heavenly bodies,
                        so as to be moved by them to sentiments of reverence
                        toward God. This is exemplified in Isaiah 40:26: “Lift
                        up your eyes on high, and see who hath created these
                        things.” And although, in the state of consummated
                        perfection, man is not brought to the knowledge of God
                        by a consideration of sensible creatures, since he sees
                        God as He is in Himself, still it is pleasing and
                        enjoyable for one who knows the cause to observe how the
                        likeness of the cause shines forth in the effect. Thus a
                        consideration of the divine goodness as mirrored in
                        bodies, and particularly in the heavenly bodies, which
                        appear to have a pre-eminence over other bodies, gives
                        joy to the saints. Moreover, the heavenly bodies have
                        some sort of essential relationship with the human body
                        under the aspect of efficient causality, just as the
                        elements have under the aspect of material causality:
                        man generates man, and the sun, too, has some part in
                        this operation. This, then, is another reason why the
                        heavenly bodies should remain in existence.

                            The doctrine here advocated follows, not only from
                            the relationship which various bodies have with man,
                            but also from an examination of the natures of the
                            material creatures we have been discussing. No
                            object wanting in an intrinsic principle of
                            incorruptibility ought to remain in the state that
                            is characterized by incorruption. The heavenly
                            bodies are incorruptible in whole and in part. The
                            elements are incorruptible as wholes, but not as
                            parts. Man is incorruptible in part, namely, in his
                            rational soul, but not as a whole because the
                            composite is dissolved by death. Animals and plants
                            and all mixed bodies are incorruptible neither in
                            whole nor in part. In the final state of
                            incorruption, therefore, men and the elements and
                            the heavenly bodies will fittingly remain, but not
                            other animals or plants or mixed bodies.

                                We can argue reasonably to the same conclusion
                                from the nature of the universe. Since man is a
                                part of the material universe, the material
                                universe should remain when man is brought to
                                his final consummation; a part would seem to
                                lack its proper perfection if it were to exist
                                without the whole. On the other hand, the
                                material universe cannot remain in existence
                                without its essential parts. But the essential
                                parts of the universe are the heavenly bodies
                                and the elements, for the entire world machine
                                is made up of them. Other bodies do not,
                                apparently, pertain to the integrity of the
                                material universe, but contribute rather to its
                                adornment and beauty. They befit its changeable
                                state in the sense that, with a heavenly body
                                acting as efficient cause, and with the elements
                                as material causes, animals and plants and
                                minerals are brought into being. But in the
                                state of final consummation another kind of
                                adornment will be given to the elements, in
                                keeping with their condition of incorruption. In
                                that state, accordingly, there will remain men,
                                elements, and heavenly bodies, but not animals
                                or plants or minerals.

                Since the heavenly bodies are in constant motion, so far as we
                can judge, it may seem that if their substance remains, they
                will keep on moving also in the state of consummation. And,
                indeed, if motion were possessed by heavenly bodies for the same
                reason as that for which it is possessed by elements, such an
                assertion would be logical. Motion is found in heavy or light
                elements to promote the perfection they are to attain: by their
                natural motion they tend to the place that suits them, where
                they are in a better condition. Hence in the ultimate state of
                consummation each element and each part thereof will be in its
                own proper place.

                    unitati repugnat, non potest esse finis ultimus naturae.

                    But this cannot be maintained of the motion of heavenly
                    bodies, for a heavenly body does not come to rest in any
                    place it may occupy; as it travels naturally to any
                    particular place, it no less naturally departs thence.
                    Therefore heavenly bodies suffer no loss if they are
                    deprived of motion, because motion is riot found in them for
                    their own perfection. Also, it would be ridiculous to
                    contend that a heavenly body is moved in circles by its
                    nature as an active principle, in the way that a light body
                    is impelled upward by its nature. For, as is evident, nature
                    tends invariably in the direction of unity; and therefore
                    that which by its very concept opposes unity cannot be the
                    ultimate goal of nature. But motion is opposed to unity, in
                    the sense that what moves varies in its mode of being by the
                    very fact that it is in motion. Therefore nature does not
                    produce motion just for the sake of motion, but in causing
                    motion has in view the terminus to be reached by motion.

                        For instance, a body that is naturally light seeks an
                        elevated place in its ascent; and so of other bodies.
                        Consequently, since the circular motion of a heavenly
                        body does not tend to a definite position, we cannot say
                        that the active principle of a heavenly body’s circular
                        motion is nature, in the sense that nature is the
                        principle of the motion of heavy and light bodies.
                        Accordingly there is no reason why heavenly bodies
                        should not come to rest, without any change in their
                        nature, even though fire, if its nature is to remain
                        constant, cannot cease from its restlessness as long as
                        it exists outside its proper sphere. Nevertheless we say
                        that the motion of a heavenly body is natural; but it is
                        natural not by reason of an active principle of motion
                        in it, but by reason of the mobile body itself that has
                        an aptitude for such motion. We conclude, therefore,
                        that motion is communicated to a heavenly body by some
                        intellect.

                            However, since an intellect does not impart movement
                            except in view of some end, we must inquire what is
                            the end of the motion of heavenly bodies. The motion
                            itself cannot be said to be this end. For motion is
                            the way leading to perfection, and so does not
                            verify the concept of end, but rather pertains to
                            that which is tending toward an end. Likewise we
                            cannot maintain that a succession of locations is
                            the term of the movement of a heavenly body, as
                            though a heavenly body moved for the purpose of
                            actually occupying every position for which it has a
                            potency; this would entail endless wandering, and
                            what is endless contradicts the notion of end.

                                We ought to think of the end of the heaven’s
                                motion somewhat as follows. Any body set in
                                motion by an intellect is evidently an
                                instrument of the latter. But the end of an
                                instrument’s motion is a form conceived by the
                                principal agent, a form that is reduced to act
                                by the motion of the instrument. The form
                                conceived by the divine intellect, to be
                                realized by the motion of the heavens, is the
                                perfection of things. as achieved by way of
                                generation and corruption. But the ultimate end
                                of generation and corruption is the noblest of
                                all forms, the human soul; and the soul’s
                                ultimate end is eternal life, as we said above.
                                Accordingly the ultimate end of the movement of
                                the heavens is the multiplication of men, who
                                are to be brought into being for eternal life.

                    There is such a definite way of arriving at happiness,
                    namely, the practice of virtue. Nothing will reach its end
                    unless it performs well the operations proper to it. A plant
                    will not bear fruit if the procedure natural to it is not
                    followed. A runner will not win a trophy or a soldier a
                    citation, unless each of them carries out his proper
                    functions. To say that a man discharges his proper office is
                    equivalent to saying that he acts virtuously; for the virtue
                    of any being is that which makes its possessor good and also
                    makes his work good, as is stated in the second book of the
                    <i>Ethics</i> [II, 6, 1106 a 15]. Accordingly, since the
                    ultimate end of man is eternal life, of which we spoke
                    previously, 182 not all attain it, but only those who act as

                        Besides, as we said above, not natural things alone, but
                        also human affairs, are contained under divine
                        providence, and this not only in general but in
                        particular. But He who has care of individual men has
                        disposal of the rewards to be assigned for virtue and of
                        the punishments to be inflicted for sin. For punishment
                        has a medicinal value with regard to sin and restores
                        right order when violated by sin, as we stated above;
                        and the reward of virtue is happiness, to be granted to
                        man by God’s goodness. Therefore God will not grant
                        happiness to those who act against virtue, but will
                        assign as punishment the opposite of happiness, namely,
                        extreme wretchedness.

                In this matter we should note that contrary causes beget

                contrary to action that proceeds from virtue. Accordingly
                wretchedness, in which evil action issues, is the opposite of
                happiness, which virtuous action merits. Furthermore, contraries
                pertain to the same genus. Therefore, since final happiness,
                which is reached by virtuous action, is a good that belongs not
                to this life but to the next life, as is clear from an earlier
                discussion, final wretchedness, also, to which vice leads, must
                be an evil belonging to the next world.

                    Besides, all goods and ills of this life are found to serve

                Since the wretchedness to which vice leads is opposed to the
                happiness to which virtue leads, whatever pertains to
                wretchedness must be understood as being the opposite of all we
                have said about happiness. We pointed out above that man’s
                ultimate happiness, as regards his intellect, consists in the
                unobstructed vision of God. And as regards man’s affective life,
                happiness consists in the immovable repose of his will in the
                first Good. Therefore man’s extreme unhappiness will consist in
                the fact that his intellect is completely shut off from the
                divine light, and that his affections are stubbornly turned
                against God’s goodness. And this is the chief suffering of the
                damned. It is known as the punishment of loss.

                    However, as should be clear from what we said on a previous
                    occasion, evil cannot wholly exclude good, since every evil
                    has its basis in some good. Consequently, although suffering
                    is opposed to happiness, which will be free from all evil,
                    it must be rooted in a good of nature. The good of an
                    intellectual nature consists in the contemplation of truth
                    by the intellect, and in the inclination to good on the part
                    of the will. But all truth and all goodness are derived from
                    the first and supreme good, which is God. Therefore the
                    intellect of a man situated in the extreme misery of hell
                    must have some knowledge of God and some love of God, but
                    only so far as He is the principle of natural perfections.
                    This is natural love. But the soul in hell cannot know and
                    love God as He is in Himself, nor so far as He is the
                    principle of virtue or of grace and the other goods through
                    which intellectual nature is brought to perfection by Him;
                    for this is the perfection of virtue and glory.

                        Nec tamen homines in tali miseria constituti, libero

                        Nevertheless men buried in the misery of hell are not
                        deprived of free choice, even though their will is
                        immovably attached to evil. In the same way the blessed
                        retain the power of free choice, although their will is
                        fixed on the Good. Freedom of choice, properly speaking,
                        has to do with election. But election is concerned with
                        the means leading to an end. The last end is naturally
                        desired by every being. Hence all men, by the very fact
                        that they are intellectual, naturally desire happiness
                        as their last end, and they do so with such immovable
                        fixity of purpose that no one can wish to be unhappy.
                        But this is not incompatible with free will, which
                        extends only to means leading to the end. The fact that
                        one man places his happiness in this particular good
                        while another places it in that good, is not
                        characteristic of either of these men so far as he is a
                        man, since in such estimates and desires men exhibit
                        great differences. This variety is explained by each
                        man’s condition. By this I mean each man’s acquired
                        passions and habits; and so if a man’s condition were to
                        undergo change, some other good would appeal to him as
                        most desirable.

                            passion, whether of anger or lust, dies down, they
                            no longer have the same estimate of that good as
                            they had before.

                                Habits are more permanent, and so men persevere
                                more obstinately in seeking goods to which habit
                                impels them. Yet, so long as habit is capable of
                                change, man’s desire and his judgment as to what
                                constitutes the last end are subject to change.
                                This possibility is open to men only during the
                                present life, in which their state is
                                changeable. After this life the soul is not
                                subject to alteration. No change can affect it
                                except indirectly, in consequence of some change
                                undergone by the body.

                                    However, when the body is resumed, the soul
                                    will not be governed by changes occurring in
                                    the body.”“ Rather, the contrary will take
                                    place. During our present life the soul is
                                    infused into a body that has been generated
                                    of seed, and therefore, as we should expect,
                                    is affected by changes experienced in the
                                    body. But in the next world the body will be
                                    united to a pre-existing soul, and so will
                                    be completely governed by the latter’s
                                    conditions. Accordingly the soul will remain
                                    perpetually in whatever last end it is found
                                    to have set for itself at the time of death,
                                    desiring that state as the most suitable,
                                    whether it is good or evil. This is the
                                    meaning of Ecclesiastes 11:3: “If the tree
                                    fall to the south or to the north, in what
                                    place soever it shall fall, there shall it
                                    be.” After this life, therefore, those who
                                    are found good at the instant of death will
                                    have their wills forever fixed in good. But
                                    those who are found evil at that moment will
                                    be forever obstinate in evil.

                This enables us to perceive that mortal sins are not forgiven in

                committed by turning away from our last end, in which man is
                irrevocably settled after death, as we have just said. Venial
                sins, however, do not regard our last end, but rather the road
                leading to that end.

                        But we should understand that those who are condemned to
                        final misery cannot have after death what they craved as
                        the best. Libertines in hell will have no opportunity to
                        gratify their passions; the wrathful and the envious
                        will have no victims to offend or obstruct; and so of
                        all the vices in turn. But the condemned will be aware
                        that men who have lived a virtuous life in conformity
                        with the precepts of virtue obtain what they desired as
                        best. Therefore the wicked regret the sins they have
                        committed, not because sin displeases them, for even in
                        hell they would rather commit those same sins, if they
                        had the chance, than possess God; but because they
                        cannot have what they have chosen, and can have only
                        what they have detested. Hence their will must remain
                        forever obstinate in evil, and at the same time they
                        will grieve most agonizingly for the sins they have
                        committed and the glory they have lost. This anguish is
                        called remorse of conscience, and in Scripture is
                        referred to metaphorically as a worm, as we read in
                        Isaiah 66:24: “Their worm shall not die.”

                As we said above, in speaking of the saints, the beatitude of
                the soul will in some manner flow over to the body. In the same
                way the suffering of lost souls will flow over to their bodies.
                Yet we must observe that suffering does not exclude the good of
                nature from the body, any more than it does from the soul.
                Therefore the bodies of the damned will be complete in their
                kind, although they will not have those qualities that go with
                the glory of the blessed. That is, they will not be subtle and
                impassible; instead, they will remain in their grossness and
                capacity for suffering, and, indeed, these defects will be
                heightened in them. Nor will they be agile, but will be so
                sluggish as scarcely to be maneuverable by the soul. Lastly,
                they will not be radiant but will be ugly in their swarthiness,
                so that the blackness of the soul may be mirrored in the body,
                as is intimated in Isaiah 13:8: “Their countenances shall be as
                faces burnt.”

                Although the bodies of the damned will be capable of suffering,
                they will not be subject to corruption. This is a fact we have
                to admit, even though it may seem to disagree with present
                experience, according to which heightened suffering tends to
                deteriorate substance. In spite of this, there are two reasons
                why suffering that lasts forever will not corrupt the bodies
                undergoing it.

                    aliquod alterari poterit alteratione naturae, sed solum

                    delectantur sensus; non tamen erit corruptivum, quia
                    spiritualis receptio formarum naturam corporis non

                    First, when the movement of the heavens ceases, as we said
                    above, all transformation of nature must come to a stop.
                    Nothing will be capable of alteration in its nature; only
                    the soul will be able to admit some alteration. In speaking
                    of an alteration of nature, I mean, for instance, a change
                    from hot to cold in a thing, or any other such variation in
                    the line of natural qualities. And by alteration of the
                    soul, I mean the modification that takes place when a thing
                    receives a quality, not according to the quality’s natural
                    mode of being, but according to its own spiritual mode of
                    being; for example, the pupil of the eye receives the form
                    of a color, not that it may be colored itself, but that it
                    may perceive color. In this way the bodies of the damned
                    will suffer from fire or from some other material agent, not
                    that they may be transformed into the likeness or quality of
                    fire, but that they may experience the effects
                    characteristic of its qualities. And this experience will be
                    painful, because the effects produced by the action of fire
                    are opposed to the harmony in which the pleasure of sense
                    consists. Yet the action of hell-fire will not cause
                    corruption, because spiritual reception of forms does not
                    modify bodily nature, except, it may be, indirectly.

                        The second reason is drawn from a consideration of the

                        forced, by divine power, to share. The condemned
                        person’s soul, so far as it is the form and nature of
                        such a body, will confer never-ending existence on the
                        latter. But because of its imperfection, the soul will
                        not be able to bestow on the body immunity from
                        suffering. Consequently the bodies of the damned will
                        suffer forever, but will not undergo dissolution.

                This discussion makes it clear that both happiness and
                wretchedness are experienced chiefly in the soul. They affect
                the body secondarily and by a certain derivation. Hence the
                happiness or misery of the soul will not depend on the
                well-being or suffering of the body; rather, the reverse is
                true. Souls remain in existence after death and prior to the
                resumption of the body, some adorned with the merit of
                beatitude, others disfigured by deserved wretchedness. Therefore
                we can see that even before the resurrection the souls of some
                men enjoy the happiness of heaven, as the Apostle indicates in 2
                Corinthians 5:1: “For we know, if our earthly house of this
                habitation is dissolved, that we have a building of God, a house
                not made with hands, eternal in heaven.” A little below, in
                verse 8, he adds: “But we are confident and have a good will to
                be absent rather from the body and to be present with the Lord.”
                But the souls of some will live in torment, as is intimated in
                Luke 16:22: “The rich man also died, and he was buried in hell.”

                    The reason for this difference is as follows. When the souls
                    of the saints were united to their bodies here in this
                    world, they observed right order, not subjecting themselves
                    to material things but serving God alone. And so their whole
                    happiness consists in the enjoyment of Him, not in any
                    material goods. But the souls of the wicked, in violation of
                    the order of nature, set their affections on material
                    things, scorning divine and spiritual goods. In consequence,
                    they are punished not only by being deprived of spiritual
                    goods, but by being subjected to the tyranny of material
                    things. Accordingly, if Sacred Scripture is found to promise
                    a reward of material goods to the souls of the saints, such
                    passages are to be interpreted in a mystical sense; for
                    spiritual things are often described in Scripture in terms
                    of their likeness to material things. But texts that portend
                    the corporal punishments of the souls of the damned,
                    specifying that they will be tormented by the fires of hell,
                    are to be understood literally.

                The assertion that a soul separated from its body can be
                tortured by corporeal fire should not seem nonsensical when we
                reflect that it is not contrary to the nature of a spiritual
                substance to be confined to a body. This happens in the ordinary
                course of nature, as we see in the union of the soul with the
                body. The same effect is sometimes produced by the arts of black
                magic, by which a spirit is imprisoned in images or amulets or
                other such objects. The power of God can undoubtedly bring it
                about that spiritual substances, which are raised above the
                material world by their nature, may nevertheless be tied down to
                certain bodies, such as hell-fire; not in the sense that they
                animate the body in question, but that they are in some way
                fettered to it. And this very fact, brought home to the
                consciousness of a spiritual substance, namely, that it is thus
                subjected to the dominion of a lowly creature, is grievous to
                it.

                    Inasmuch as this awareness is distressing to the spiritual
                    substance, the contention that the soul “burns by the very
                    fact that it perceives itself to be in fire” [
                    <i>Dialogi</i>, IV, 29], is substantiated. Thus understood,
                    the fire is plainly spiritual, for what directly causes the
                    distress is the fire apprehended as imprisoning. But
                    inasmuch as the fire in which the spirit is incarcerated is
                    corporeal fire, the further statement made by Gregory is
                    borne out, namely, that “the soul is in agony not only
                    because its perceives, but also because it experiences, the
                    fire.”

                        possit, convenienter dicitur a quibusdam, quod ignis
                        ille agit in animam ut instrumentum divinae iustitiae

                        est apprehensio ignis alligantis in poenam, manifeste

                        Furthermore, since this fire has the power of
                        imprisoning the spiritual substance, not of its own
                        nature, but by the might of God, the view is fittingly
                        expressed by some that the fire acts on the soul as an
                        instrument of God’s vindictive justice. This does not
                        mean that the fire acts on the spiritual substance as it
                        acts on bodies, by heating, parching, and consuming; its
                        action is restrictive, as we said. And since that which
                        directly afflicts the spiritual substance is the
                        awareness that the fire incarcerates it for its
                        punishment, we can reasonably suppose that the suffering
                        does not cease even if, by God’s dispensation, the
                        spiritual substance should happen for a time to be
                        released from the fire. In the same way a criminal who
                        has been sentenced to perpetual irons feels no
                        dimunition of his unremitting pain even though the
                        chains should be struck off for an hour.

                Although some souls may be admitted to eternal beatitude as soon
                as they are released from their bodies, others may be held back
                from this happiness for a time. For it sometimes happens that
                during their lives people have not done full penance for the
                sins they have committed, but for which they have been sorry in
                the end. Since the order of divine justice demands that
                punishment be undergone for sins, we must hold that souls pay
                after this life the penalty they have not paid while on earth.
                This does not mean that they are banished to the ultimate misery
                of the damned, since by their repentance they have been brought
                back to the state of charity, whereby they cleave to God as
                their last end, so that they have merited eternal life. Hence we
                conclude that there are certain purgatorial punishments after
                this life, by which the debt of penalty not previously paid is
                discharged.

                It also happens that some men depart this life free from mortal
                sin but nevertheless stained with venial sin. The commission of
                such sins does not, indeed, turn them from their last end; but
                by committing them they have erred with regard to the means
                leading to the end, out of undue attachment to those means. In
                the case of some perfect men sins of this kind are expiated by
                the fervor of their love. But in others these sins must be

                imperfection. Therefore we must acknowledge the existence of

                hoc per accidens contingit, quia vita hominis non est perpetua,
                sed intentio iudicis ad hoc esse videtur ut eum, sicut potest,
                perpetuo puniat. Unde etiam non est iniustum, si pro momentaneo

                The suffering of eternal punishment is in no way opposed to
                divine justice. Even in the laws men make, punishment need not
                correspond to the offense in point of time. For the crime of
                adultery or murder, either of which may be committed in a brief
                span of time, human law may prescribe lifelong exile or even
                death, by both of which the criminal is banned forever from the
                society of the state. Exile, it is true, does not last forever,
                but this is purely accidental, owing to the fact that man’s life
                is not everlasting; but the intention of the judge, we may
                assume, is to sentence the criminal to perpetual punishment, so
                far as he can. In the same way it is not unjust for God to
                inflict eternal punishment for a sin committed in a moment of
                time.

                    Similiter etiam considerandum est, quod peccatori poena
                    aeterna infertur, quem de peccato non poenitet, et sic in
                    ipso usque ad mortem perdurat. Et quia in suo aeterno
                    peccat, rationabiliter a Deo in aeternum punitur. Habet
                    etiam et quodlibet peccatum contra Deum commissum quandam
                    infinitatem ex parte Dei, contra quem committitur.
                    Manifestum est enim quod quanto maior persona est contra
                    quam peccatur, tanto peccatum est gravius, sicut qui dat
                    alapam militi, gravius reputatur quam si daret rustico, et
                    adhuc multo gravius si principi vel regi. Et sic cum Deus
                    sit infinite magnus, offensa contra ipsum commissa est
                    quodammodo infinita, unde et aliqualiter poena infinita ei
                    debetur. Non autem potest esse poena infinita intensive,
                    quia nihil creatum sic infinitum esse potest. Unde
                    relinquitur quod peccato mortali debetur poena infinita
                    duratione.

                    We should also take into consideration the fact that eternal
                    punishment is inflicted on a sinner who does not repent of
                    his sin, and so he continues in his sin up to his death. And
                    since he is in sin for eternity, he is reasonably punished
                    by God for all eternity. Furthermore, any sin committed
                    against God has a certain infinity when regarded from the
                    side of God, against whom it is committed. For, clearly, the
                    greater the person who is offended, the more grievous is the
                    offense. He who strikes a soldier is held more gravely
                    accountable than if he struck a peasant; and his offense is
                    much more serious if he strikes a prince or a king.
                    Accordingly, since God is infinitely great, an offense
                    committed against Him is in a certain respect infinite; and
                    so a punishment that is in a certain respect infinite is
                    duly attached to it. Such a punishment cannot be infinite in
                    intensity, for nothing created can be infinite in this way.
                    Consequently a punishment that is infinite in duration is
                    rightly inflicted for mortal sin.

                        a peccato corrigi non potest, sed voluntas eius
                        obstinate firmata est in peccato, sicut supra de

                        cleansing. But if a sinner is incorrigible, so that his
                        will is obstinately fixed in sin, as we said above is
                        the case with the damned, his punishment ought never to

                ex sola libertate arbitrii. Et ideo Angeli ex prima electione
                immutabilitatem consequuntur, animae vero non nisi cum fuerint a
                corporibus exutae.

                In his intellectual nature man resembles the angels, who are
                capable of sin, as also man is. We spoke of this above. Hence
                all that has been set forth about the punishment or glory of
                souls should be understood also of the glory of good angels and
                the punishment of bad angels. Men and angels exhibit only one
                point of difference in this regard: the wills of human souls
                receive confirmation in good or obstinacy in evil when they are
                separated from their bodies, as was said above; whereas angels
                were immediately made blessed or eternally wretched as soon as,
                with full deliberation of will, they fixed upon God or some
                created good as their end. The variability found in human souls
                can be accounted for, not only by the liberty of their wills,
                but also by the modifications their bodies undergo; but in the
                angels such variability comes from the freedom of will alone.
                And so angels achieve immutability at the very first choice they
                make; but souls are not rendered immutable until they leave
                their bodies.

                    To express the reward of the good, we say in the Creed: “I

                    much more because it is the fruition of eternity. Since in

                    final state of the world, the Creed of the Fathers 1" sums

                          subject to his Soul. Further, among the faculties of
                          the soul, the lower powers were subject to reason

                          the soul’s dominion over the body. Therefore neither
                          death nor illness had any place in man. And from the
                          subjection of the lower powers to reason there
                          resulted in man complete peace of mind, for the human
                          reason was troubled by no inordinate passions.
                          Finally, owing to the submission of man’s will to God,
                          man referred all things to God as to his last end, and
                          in this his justice and innocence consisted.

                              Of these three subordinations, the last was the
                              cause of the other two. Surely man’s freedom from
                              dissolution or from any suffering that would be a
                              threat to his life, did not come from the nature
                              of his body, as we see if we regard its component
                              parts; for the body was made up of contrary
                              elements. Similarly, the fact that man’s sense
                              faculties were subservient to reason without any
                              rebelliousness did not come from the nature of the
                              soul, since the sense powers naturally tend toward
                              objects that cause pleasure in the senses, even
                              when, as often happens, delights of this sort are
                              at odds with right reason.

                                  This harmony came from a higher power, the
                                  power of God. It was God who, in the first
                                  instance, united to the body the rational soul
                                  that so immeasurably surpasses the body and
                                  the bodily faculties, such as the sense
                                  powers. Likewise it was God who gave to the
                                  rational soul the power to control the body
                                  itself in a manner that exceeded the natural
                                  condition of the body, and also to govern the
                                  sense faculties so that they would function in
                                  a way befitting a rational soul. In order,
                                  therefore, that reason might firmly hold the
                                  lower faculties’ under its sway, reason itself
                                  had to be firmly kept under the dominion of
                                  God, from whom it received this power so
                                  greatly surpassing the condition of nature.
                                  Accordingly man was so constituted that,
                                  unless his reason was subservient to God, his
                                  body could not be made subject to the beck of
                                  the, soul, nor his sense powers be brought
                                  under the rule of reason. Hence in that state
                                  life was in a certain way immortal and
                                  impassible; that is, man could neither die nor
                                  suffer, so long as he did not sin.
                                  Nevertheless he retained the power to sin,
                                  since his will was not yet confirmed in good
                                  by the attainment of the last end; in the
                                  event that this happened, man could suffer and
                                  die.

                                      sicut supra dictum est. Differebat etiam
                                      quoad aliud, quia post resurrectionem
                                      homines nec cibis nec venereis utentur,
                                      primus autem homo sic conditus fuit ut
                                      necesse haberet vitam cibis sustentare, et
                                      ei incumberet generationi operam dare, ut
                                      genus humanum multiplicaretur ex uno. Unde
                                      duo praecepta accepit in sui conditione.
                                      Ad primum pertinet quod ei dictum est: de
                                      omni ligno quod est in Paradiso comede; ad
                                      secundum quod ei dictum est: crescite et
                                      multiplicamini, et replete terram.

                                      It is precisely in this respect that the
                                      impassibility and immortality possessed by
                                      the first man differ from the
                                      impassibility and immortality to be
                                      enjoyed after the resurrection by the
                                      saints, who will never be subject to
                                      suffering and death, since their wills
                                      will be wholly fixed upon God, as we said
                                      above. There is another difference: after
                                      the resurrection men will have no use for
                                      food or the reproductive functions; but
                                      the first man was so constituted that he
                                      had to sustain his life with food, and he
                                      had a mandate to perform the work of
                                      generation; for the human race was to be
                                      multiplied from this one parent. Hence he
                                      received two commands, in keeping with his
                                      condition. The first is that mentioned in
                                      Genesis 2:16: “Of every tree of Paradise
                                      may eat.” The other is reported in Genesis
                                      1:28: “Increase and multiply and fill the
                                      earth.”

                          This wonderfully ordered state of man is called
                          original justice. By it man himself was subject to God
                          on high, and all lower creatures were subordinate to
                          man, as is indicated in Genesis 1:26: “Let him have
                          dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of
                          the air.” And among the component parts of man, the
                          lower were subservient to the higher without any
                          conflict. This state was granted to man, not as to a
                          private individual, but as to the first principle of
                          human nature, so that through him it was to be handed
                          down to his descendants together with human nature.

                          ex omnibus aliis lignis Paradisi vesceretur, prohibens
                          sub mortis comminatione ne de ligno scientiae boni et

                          This state enjoyed by man depended on the submission
                          of the human will to God. That man might be accustomed
                          from the very beginning to follow God’s will, God laid
                          certain precepts on him. Man was permitted to eat of
                          all the trees in Paradise, with one exception: he was
                          forbidden under pain of death to eat of the tree of
                          knowledge of good and evil. Eating of the fruit of
                          this tree was prohibited, not because it was evil in
                          itself, but that at least in this slight matter man
                          might have some precept to observe for the sole reason
                          that it was so commanded by God. Hence eating of the
                          fruit of this tree was evil because it was forbidden.
                          The tree was called the tree of knowledge of good and
                          evil, not because it had the power to cause knowledge,
                          but because of the sequel: by eating of it man learned
                          by experience the difference between the good of
                          obedience and the evil of disobedience.

                          The devil, who had already fallen into sin, saw that
                          man was so equipped that he could arrive at
                          everlasting happiness, from which the devil himself
                          had been cast out. Yet, as he knew, man could still
                          sin. So he sought to lead man astray from the straight
                          path of justice, by attacking him on his weaker side;
                          that is, he tempted the woman, in whom the gift of
                          light or wisdom shone with a lesser brilliance. The
                          more easily to induce her to break the command, he
                          lyingly drove from her mind the fear of death, and
                          promised her what man naturally desires, namely, the
                          overcoming of ignorance. “Your eyes shall be opened,”
                          he said (Gen. 3:5); and in adding: “You shall be as
                          gods,” he held out to her the excellence of greatness.
                          He further promised perfect knowledge, with the words:
                          “knowing good and evil.” On the part of his intellect
                          man naturally shuns ignorance and desires knowledge;
                          and on the part of his will, which is naturally free,
                          he desires high station and perfection, so that he may
                          be subject to no one, or at any rate to as few as
                          possible.

                              Upon analysis, her sin is found to have many
                              aspects. First, there was a sin of pride, whereby
                              she inordinately desired her own excellence. Her
                              second sin was one of curiosity, whereby she
                              coveted knowledge beyond the limits fixed for her.
                              The third sin was that of gluttony, whereby the
                              sweetness of the fruit enticed her to eat. A
                              fourth sin was infidelity, growing out of a false
                              estimate of God, so that she believed the words of
                              the devil who gave the lie to God. Fifthly, there
                              was a sin of disobedience, consisting in a
                              transgression of God’s command.

                          loquitur. Nam quia appetitus sensitivus, sicut et
                          ceterae sensitivae vires, per instrumentum corporeum
                          operatur, ratio autem absque aliquo organo corporali,
                          convenienter quod ad appetitum sensitivum pertinet,
                          carni imputatur; quod vero ad rationem, spiritui,
                          secundum quod spirituales substantiae dici solent quae
                          sunt a corporibus separatae.

                          The harmonious integrity of the original state
                          depended entirely on the submission of man’s will to
                          God. Consequently, as soon as the human will threw off
                          the yoke of subjection to God, the perfect subjection
                          of the lower powers to reason and of the body to the
                          soul likewise disintegrated. As a result, man
                          experienced in his lower, sensitive appetite the
                          inordinate stirrings of concupiscence, anger, and all
                          the other passions. These movements no longer followed
                          the order set by reason but rather resisted reason,
                          frequently darkening the mind and, so to speak,
                          throwing it into confusion. This is that rebellion of
                          the flesh against the spirit which Scripture mentions.
                          For, since the sensitive appetite, like all the other
                          sense powers, operates through a bodily instrument,
                          whereas reason functions without any bodily organ,
                          what pertains to the sensitive appetite is rightly
                          ascribed to the flesh, and what pertains to reason is
                          attributed to the spirit. This is why substances that
                          are without bodies are commonly called spiritual
                          substances.

                          A further consequence was that the defect which
                          consists in corruption was experienced in the body,
                          and so man incurred the necessity of dying; his soul
                          was no longer able to sustain the body forever by
                          conferring life on it. Thus man became subject to
                          suffering and death, not only in the sense that he was
                          capable of suffering and dying as before, but in the
                          sense that he was now under the necessity of suffering
                          and dying.

                          love to sensible objects. Immersed in these, he
                          wandered far from God and fell into repeated sins.

                          The blessing of original justice was conferred by God
                          on the human race in the person of its first parent,

                          justice and burdened with the defects that attend its

                              of their first father. For the punishment in
                              question is no more than the withdrawing of goods
                              that were supernaturally granted by God to the
                              first man for transmission, through him, to
                              others. These others had no right to such goods,
                              except so far as the gifts were to be passed on to
                              them through their first parent. In the same way a
                              king may reward a soldier with the grant of an
                              estate, which is to be handed on by him to his
                              heirs. If the soldier then commits a crime against
                              the king, and so is adjudged to forfeit the
                              estate, it cannot afterwards pass to his heirs. In
                              this case the sons are justly dispossessed in
                              consequence of their father’s crime.

                          But there remains a more pressing question: whether
                          the privation of original justice can have the nature
                          of sin in those who descend from the first parent. The
                          notion of sin seems to require, as we said above, that
                          the evil known as culpable should be in the power of
                          him to whom it is imputed as fault. No one is blamed
                          for that which is beyond his power to do or not to do.
                          But it is not in the power of the person begotten, to
                          be born with original justice or without it. Hence we
                          might be inclined to judge that such a privation
                          cannot have the character of sin.

                              distinguatur inter personam et naturam. Sicut enim
                              in una persona multa sunt membra, ita in una
                              humana natura multae sunt personae, ut
                              participatione speciei multi homines intelligantur
                              quasi unus homo, ut Porphyrius dicit. Est autem
                              hoc advertendum in peccato unius hominis, quod
                              diversis membris diversa peccata exercentur, nec
                              requiritur ad rationem culpae quod singula peccata

                              principale, scilicet intellectivae partis. Non
                              enim potest manus non percutere aut pes non
                              ambulare voluntate iubente.

                              This question is easily solved if we but
                              distinguish between person and nature. As there
                              are many members in one person, so there are many
                              persons in one human nature. Thus, by sharing in
                              the same species, many men may be thought of as
                              one man, as Porphyry remarks. In this connection
                              we should note that in the sin of one man
                              different sins are committed by different members.
                              Nor does the notion of sin require that the
                              various sins be voluntary by the wills of the
                              members whereby they are committed, for it is
                              enough that they be voluntary by the will of that
                              which is most excellent in man, that is, his
                              intellectual part. For the hand cannot but strike
                              and the foot cannot help walking, when the will so
                              commands.

                                  In this way, then, the privation of original
                                  justice is a sin of nature, in the sense that
                                  it has its origin in the inordinate will of
                                  the first principle in human nature, namely,
                                  of the first parent. Thus it is voluntary with
                                  respect to nature, that is, by the will of the
                                  first principle of nature. And so it is
                                  transmitted to all who receive human nature
                                  from him, for they are all, as it were, his
                                  members.

                                      This is why it is called original sin, for
                                      it is transferred from the first parent to
                                      his descendants by their origin from him.
                                      Other sins, that is, actual sins, pertain

                          It does not follow, however, that all other sins,
                          either of the first parent or of other parents, are
                          handed down to posterity. For only the first sin of
                          the first parent extirpated in its entirety the gift
                          that had been supernaturally granted to human nature
                          in the person of the first father. This is the reason
                          why sin is said to have corrupted or infected nature.
                          Subsequent sins do not encounter anything of this sort
                          that they can uproot from the whole of human nature.
                          Such sins do, indeed, take away from man, or at least
                          tarnish, some particular good, namely, a personal
                          good; but they do not corrupt nature except so far as
                          nature pertains to this or that person. Since man
                          begets his like not in person but only in nature, the
                          sin that defiles the person is not handed down from a
                          parent to his descendants. Only the first sin that
                          defiled nature as such, is thus transmitted.

                          entirety. Adam’s repentance or any other merit of his
                          was clearly the act of an individual person. But no
                          act of any individual can affect the entire nature of
                          the species. Causes that can affect a whole species
                          are equivocal causes, not univocal. The sun is a cause
                          of generation in the whole human species, but a man is
                          only the cause of the generation of a particular man.
                          Hence the individual merit of Adam, or of any other
                          mere man, could not suffice to re-establish the whole
                          of nature. True, all nature was defiled by a single
                          act of the first man; but this effect followed only
                          indirectly, in the sense that, once the state of
                          innocence had been devastated in him, it could not be
                          conveyed through him to others.

                              Even though Adam were to recover grace through
                              penance, he could not return to his pristine
                              innocence, in view of which God had granted the
                              gift of original justice. Moreover, the state of
                              original justice was manifestly a very special
                              gift of grace. Grace, however, is not acquired by
                              merits, but is given gratis by God. Therefore the
                              original justice which the first man had from the
                              beginning was not the result of his merit, but was
                              a gift of God. Much less, after his sin, could
                              Adam merit it by his repentance, or by the
                              performance of any other work.

                          frustraretur, quod reputat inconveniens Psalmista, cum
                          dicit, Psal. LXXXVIII, v. 48: nunquid enim vane
                          constituisti omnes filios hominum? Sic igitur
                          oportebat humanam naturam reparari.

                          Nevertheless in the plan of divine providence it was
                          decreed that human nature, which had been ravaged in
                          the manner described, should be restored. It could not
                          be admitted to perfect beatitude unless it were freed
                          of its defilement. Beatitude, being a perfect good,
                          tolerates no defect, especially the defect of sin; for
                          sin is, in its own way, opposed to virtue, which is
                          the path leading to beatitude, as was established
                          above. And so, since man was made for beatitude,
                          seeing that beatitude is his ultimate end, one might
                          conclude that God’s work in creating so noble a being
                          was doomed to frustration. But this the Psalmist holds
                          to be inadmissible, for he says in Psalm 88:48: “Hast
                          You made all the children of men in vain?” Accordingly
                          it was fitting that human nature should be restored.

                              Furthermore, divine goodness exceeds the
                              creature’s capacity for good. As long as man leads
                              a mortal life in this world, we know that his
                              condition is such that he is neither immovably
                              confirmed in good nor immovably obstinate in evil.
                              Hence the very condition of human nature implies
                              that it is capable of being cleansed from the
                              contamination of sin. Surely the divine goodness
                              would hardly allow this capacity to remain forever
                              unrealized; but this would have been so had God
                              not provided a remedy devised for man’s
                              restoration.

                          We indicated above that the reparation of human nature
                          could not be effected either by Adam or by any other
                          purely human being. For no individual man ever
                          occupied a position of pre-eminence over the whole of
                          nature; nor can any mere man be the cause of grace.
                          The same reasoning shows that not even an angel could
                          be the author of man’s restoration. An angel cannot be
                          the cause of grace, just as he cannot be man’s
                          recompense with regard to the ultimate perfection of
                          beatitude, to which man was to be recalled. In this
                          matter of beatitude angels and men are on a footing of
                          equality. Nothing remains, therefore, but that such
                          restoration could be effected by God alone.

                              act of His will and power, the order of divine
                              justice would not have been observed. justice
                              demands satisfaction for sin. But God cannot
                              render satisfaction, just as He cannot merit. Such
                              a service pertains to one who is subject to
                              another. Thus God was not in a position to satisfy
                              for the sin of the whole of human nature; and a
                              mere man was unable to do so, as we have just
                              shown. Hence divine Wisdom judged it fitting that
                              God should become man, so that thus one and the
                              same person would be able both to restore man and
                              to offer satisfaction. This is the reason for the
                              divine Incarnation assigned by the Apostle in 1
                              Timothy 1:15: “Christ Jesus came into this world
                              to save sinners.”

                          Sunt tamen et aliae rationes incarnationis divinae.
                          Quia enim homo a spiritualibus recesserat, et totum se
                          rebus corporalibus dederat, ex quibus in Deum per se
                          ipsum redire non poterat, divina sapientia, quae
                          hominem fecerat, per naturam corpoream assumptam
                          hominem in corporalibus iacentem visitavit, ut per sui
                          corporis mysteria eum ad spiritualia revocaret.

                          There are also other reasons for the divine
                          Incarnation. Man had withdrawn from spiritual things
                          and had delivered himself up wholly to material
                          things, from which he was unable by his own efforts to
                          make his way back to God. Therefore divine Wisdom, who
                          had made man, took to Himself a bodily nature and
                          visited man immersed in things of the body, so that by
                          the mysteries of His bodily life He might recall man
                          to spiritual life.

                              Furthermore, the human race had need that God
                              should become man to show forth the dignity of
                              human nature, so that man might not be subjugated
                              either by devils or by things of the body.

                                      understanding, to the uncreated Spirit. It

                                      taking a human nature to Himself.

                          et patientiam mortis, gloriam divinitatis promeruit,
                          ut sic Deus diceretur non per naturam, sed per
                          adoptionis gratiam. Sic igitur non esset facta unio
                          Dei et hominis, sed homo esset per gratiam deificatus,
                          quod non singulare est Christo, sed commune omnibus
                          sanctis, quamvis in hac gratia aliqui excellentiores
                          aliis habeantur.

                        <td>
                          This mystery of the divine Incarnation, Photinus set
                          aside, so far as he could. Following Ebion, Cerinthus
                          and Paul of Samosata, he asserted that our Lord Jesus
                          Christ was no more than a man and that He did not
                          exist before the Virgin Mary, but earned the glory of
                          divinity by the merit of a blessed life and by
                          patiently enduring death; and thus He was called God,
                          not on account of His nature, but by the grace of
                          adoption. In this event no union of God with man would
                          have been effected; only a man would be deified by
                          grace. Elevation of this sort is not peculiar to
                          Christ, but is common to all the saints, although some
                          may be considered more highly endowed with such grace
                          than others.

                              erat verbum; et postea subdit: verbum caro factum
                              est. Verbum ergo quod erat in principio apud Deum,
                              carnem assumpsit, non autem homo, qui ante fuerat,
                              per gratiam adoptionis deificatus.

                              Scripture. In John 1:1 we read: “In the beginning
                              was the Word.” Shortly after the Evangelist adds:
                              “And the Word was made flesh.” Hence the Word that
                              in the beginning was with God assumed flesh. But
                              Scripture does not say that a man who lacked
                              previous existence was deified by the grace of
                              adoption.

                                  Item dominus dicit Ioan. VI, 38: descendi de

                                  apostolus dicat, Ephes. IV, 9: quod autem

                                  primum in inferiores partes terrae? Ex quo
                                  manifeste datur intelligi, quod in Christo non
                                  haberet locum ascensio, nisi descensio

                                  Likewise, in John 6:38 the Lord says: “I came
                                  down from heaven, not to do My own will, but
                                  the will of Him that sent Me.” According to
                                  the error of Photinus, Christ could not come
                                  down from heaven, but could only go up to
                                  heaven. Against him is the Apostle, who says
                                  in Ephesians 4:9: “That He ascended, what is
                                  it but because He also descended first into
                                  the lower parts of the earth?” This enables us
                                  to understand clearly that the Ascension would
                                  have no place in Christ unless His descent
                                  from heaven had preceded.

                          divinam, in qua patri extitit coaeternus; partim vero

                          sed per solam inhabitationem in ipso, et sic homo

                          inhabitationem in ipso, quae est per gratiam.

                          Nestorius wished to avoid this contradiction. In part
                          he disagreed with the error of Photinus; for Nestorius
                          held that Christ was the Son of God not only by the
                          grace of adoption, but by the divine nature in which
                          He existed coeternal with the Father. In part,
                          however, he sided with Photinus, because he taught
                          that the Son of God was united to man by mere
                          habitation in him, but not in such a way that there
                          was only one person who was both God and man. And so
                          that man who, according to Photinus, is called God
                          through grace alone, is called the son of God by
                          Nestorius, not because he is truly God, but because
                          the Son of God dwells in him through the inhabitation
                          effected by grace.

                              apostolus exinanitionem nominat, dicens, Philip.
                              II, 6, de filio Dei: qui cum in forma Dei esset,

                              et apostolo de spiritu sancto, I Cor. III, 16:

                              This error is likewise opposed to the authority of
                              Sacred Scripture. For the union of God with man is
                              called by the Apostle an “emptying”; in
                              Philippians 2:6 he says of the Son of God: “Who,
                              being in the form of God, thought is not robbery
                              to be equal with God, but emptied Himself, taking
                              the form of a servant.” But there is no emptying
                              of God when He dwells in a rational creature by
                              grace. Otherwise the Father and the Holy Spirit
                              would be emptied out also, since they too dwell in
                              the rational creature by grace. Thus in John 14:23
                              our Lord says of Himself and the Father: “We will
                              come to him and will make our abode with him.” And
                              in 1 Corinthians 3:16 the Apostle says of the Holy
                              Spirit: “The Spirit of God dwells in you.”

                                  words signifying divinity unless He were
                                  personally God. He would have been guilty of
                                  supreme presumption in saying, as He does in
                                  John 10:30: “I and the Father are one,” and
                                  also in 8:58: “Before Abraham was made, I am.”
                                  For the pronoun “I” indicates the person of
                                  the speaker; but He who uttered these words
                                  was a man. Hence the person of God and this
                                  man are one and the same.

                          In their eagerness to proclaim the unity of God and
                          man in Christ, some heretics went to the opposite
                          extreme and taught that not only was there one person,
                          but also a single nature, in God and man. This error
                          took its rise from Arius. To defend his position that
                          those scriptural passages where Christ is represented
                          as being inferior to the Father, must refer to the Son
                          of God Himself, regarded in His assuming nature, Arius
                          taught that in Christ there is no other soul than the
                          Word of God who, he maintained, took the place of the
                          soul in Christ’s body. Thus when Christ says, in John
                          14:28, “The Father is greater than I,” or when He is
                          introduced as praying or as being sad, such matters
                          are to be referred to the very nature of the Son of
                          God. If this were so, the union of God’s Son with man
                          would be effected not only in the person, but also in
                          the nature. For, as we know, the unity of human nature
                          arises from the union of soul and body.

                              to the theory that the Word of God took the place
                              of the soul in Christ, the absurdity of this error
                              can be shown by reverting to a point previously
                              set forth. For, as we demonstrated above, the soul
                              is united to the body as the latter’s form. But
                              God cannot be the form of a body, as we also
                              demonstrated above. Arius could not counter by
                              maintaining that this is to be understood of God
                              the Father on high, since the same can be proved
                              even of the angels, namely, that they cannot, of
                              their very nature, be united to a body in the
                              manner of a form, seeing that by nature they are
                              separated from bodies. Much less, then, can the
                              Son of God, by whom the angels were made, as even
                              Arius admits, be the form of a body.

                                  Besides, even if the Son of God were a
                                  creature, as Arius falsely teaches, He
                                  nevertheless excels all created spirits in
                                  beatitude, according to the heresiarch
                                  himself. But the beatitude of the angels is so
                                  great that they can suffer no sadness. Their
                                  happiness would not be true and complete if
                                  anything were wanting to their desires, since
                                  the very notion of beatitude requires that it
                                  be the ultimate and perfect good wholly
                                  satisfying all desire. Much less can the Son
                                  of God be subject to sadness or fear in His
                                  divine nature. Yet we read that He was sad:
                                  “He began to fear and to be heavy,” “and to be
                                  sad” (Mark 14:33; Matt. 26:37). And He Himself
                                  gave witness of His sorrow, saying, “My soul
                                  is sorrowful even unto death” (Mark 14:34).
                                  Sadness, assuredly, pertains not to the body,
                                  but to some substance capable of apprehension.
                                  Therefore, besides the Word and the body,
                                  there must have been in Christ another
                                  substance that could suffer sadness; and this
                                  we call the soul.

                                      and if our greater need was to be cleansed

                                      that He assumed not a body without a soul,
                                      but a body together with its soul, since
                                      the soul was the more important part for
                                      Him to assume.

                          These considerations also refute the error of
                          Apollinaris, who at first followed Arius in refusing
                          to admit any soul in Christ other than the Word of
                          God. However, he did not follow Arius in teaching that
                          the Son of God was a creature; for many things are
                          narrated of Christ which cannot be ascribed to the
                          body, and which are inadmissible in the Creator, such
                          as sadness, fear, and the like. He was, then, at
                          length driven to acknowledge the existence in Christ
                          of some soul which gave sense life to the body and
                          could be the subject of such passions. Yet this soul
                          was without reason and intellect, and the Word Himself
                          took the place of intellect and reason in the man
                          Christ.

                              Hoc autem multipliciter falsum esse ostenditur.
                              Primo quidem, quia hoc est contra naturae rationem
                              ut anima non rationalis sit forma hominis, cum
                              tamen formam corporis habeat. Nihil autem
                              monstruosum et innaturale in Christi incarnatione
                              fuisse putandum est. Secundo, quia fuisset contra
                              incarnationis finem, qui est reparatio humanae
                              naturae, quae quidem principalius indiget reparari
                              quantum ad intellectivam partem, quae particeps
                              peccati esse potest. Unde praecipue conveniens
                              fuit ut intellectivam hominis partem assumeret.
                              Dicitur etiam Christus admiratus fuisse, admirari
                              autem non est nisi animae rationalis, Deo vero
                              omnino convenire non potest. Sicut igitur
                              tristitia cogit in Christo ponere animam
                              sensitivam, sic admiratio cogit ponere in Christo
                              partem animae intellectivam.

                            <td>
                              This theory is shown to be false on many grounds.
                              In the first place, the very concept of nature is
                              incompatible with the opinion that a non-rational
                              soul is the form of man, whose body nevertheless
                              must have some form. But nothing monstrous or
                              unnatural can be thought of in connection with
                              Christ’s incarnation. Secondly, this hypothesis
                              would be inconsistent with the purpose of the
                              Incarnation, namely, the reparation of human
                              nature. Above all, human nature needs to be
                              restored in the intellectual sphere, for that
                              which can have part in sin is precisely the
                              rational soul. Hence it chiefly befitted God’s Son
                              to assume man’s intellectual nature. Besides,
                              Christ is said to have marveled. But surprise
                              cannot be experienced without a rational soul, and
                              of course is wholly inadmissible in God.
                              Therefore, as the sorrow Christ experienced forces
                              us to admit that He had a sensitive soul, so the
                              wonderment He expressed compels us to acknowledge
                              the existence of a rational soul in Him.

                          To some extent, Eutyches embraced the error of these
                          heresiarchs. He taught that there was one nature
                          common to both God and man after the Incarnation.
                          However, he did not hold that Christ was lacking in
                          soul or in intellect or in anything pertaining to the
                          integrity of nature.

                              Divina enim natura in se perfecta et
                              incommutabilis est. Natura enim quae in se

                              naturam convenire, nisi vel ipsa convertatur in
                              alteram, sicut cibus in cibatum, vel alterum
                              convertatur in ipsum, sicut in ignem ligna; vel
                              utrumque transmutetur in tertium, sicut elementa
                              in corpus mixtum. Haec autem omnia removet divina
                              immutabilitas. Non enim immutabile est neque quod
                              in alterum convertitur, neque in quod alterum
                              converti potest. Cum ergo natura divina in se sit
                              perfecta, nullo modo potest esse quod simul cum
                              aliqua natura in unam naturam conveniat.

                              The erroneousness of this theory is plainly
                              apparent. The divine nature is perfect in itself,
                              and is incapable of change. But a nature that is
                              perfect in itself cannot combine with another
                              nature to form a single nature unless it is
                              changed into that other nature (as food is changed
                              into the eater), or unless the other nature is
                              changed into it (as wood is changed into fire), or
                              unless both natures are transformed into a third
                              nature (as elements are when they combine to form
                              a mixed body). The divine immutability excludes
                              all these alternatives. For neither that which is
                              changed into another thing, nor that into which
                              another thing can be changed, is immutable. Since,
                              therefore, the divine nature is perfect in itself,
                              it can in no way combine with some other nature to
                              form a single nature.

                                  quae ponitur esse Christi, supra haec omnia

                                  Moreover, as we see if we reflect on the order
                                  of things, the addition of a greater
                                  perfection causes variation in the species of
                                  a nature. Thus a thing that not only exists
                                  but lives, for example, a plant, differs in
                                  species from a thing that merely exists. And
                                  that which exists and lives and feels, for
                                  instance, an animal, differs in species from
                                  the plant, which merely exists and lives.
                                  Likewise a being that exists, lives, feels,
                                  and understands, namely, a man, differs in
                                  species from the brute animal, which merely
                                  exists, lives, and feels. Accordingly, if the
                                  single nature which the Eutychean theory
                                  ascribes to Christ has the perfection of
                                  divinity in addition to all these other
                                  perfections, that nature necessarily differs
                                  in species from human nature, in the way that
                                  human nature differs specifically from the
                                  nature of a brute animal. On this supposition,
                                  consequently, Christ would not be a man of the
                                  same species as other men, a conclusion shown
                                  to be false by Christ’s descent from men
                                  according to the flesh. This is brought out by
                                  Matthew in his Gospel, which begins with the
                                  words: “The book of the generation of Jesus
                                  Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,”
                                  and so on.

                          Photinus emptied the mystery of the Incarnation of all
                          meaning by denying Christ’s divine nature. The
                          Manichaean did the same by denying Christ’s human
                          nature. He held that the whole of material creation
                          was the work of the devil and that the Son of the good
                          God could not becomingly take to Himself a creature of
                          the devil. Therefore he taught that Christ did not
                          have real flesh but only phantom flesh. Consequently
                          he asserted that everything narrated in the Gospel as
                          pertaining to the human nature of Christ, was done in
                          appearance only and not in very truth.

                              Scripture, which relates that Christ was born of
                              the Virgin, that He was circumcised, that He was
                              hungry, that He ate, and that He had other
                              experiences common to the nature of human flesh.
                              Hence in recording such things of Christ, what is
                              written in the Gospels would be false.

                                  Besides, Christ says of Himself: “For this was
                                  I born, and for this came I into the world,
                                  that I should give testimony to the truth”
                                  (John 18:37). If He had displayed in Himself
                                  what really did not exist, He would have been
                                  a witness not of truth but rather of error;
                                  especially since He foretold that He would
                                  suffer that which He could not suffer without
                                  a body, namely, that He would be betrayed into
                                  the hands of men, that He would be spat upon,
                                  scourged, and crucified. Accordingly, to say
                                  that Christ did not have true flesh and that
                                  He suffered such indignities not in truth but
                                  only in appearance, is to accuse Him of lying.

                                      tollendam, dixit: palpate, et videte, quia
                                      spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, sicut
                                      me videtis habere; et in alio loco, cum
                                      supra mare ambularet, existimantibus eum
                                      discipulis esse phantasma, et ob hoc eis
                                      in timore constitutis, dominus dixit: ego
                                      sum, nolite timere. Si igitur haec opinio
                                      vera est, necesse est dicere Christum
                                      fuisse fallacem. Christus autem veritas
                                      est, ut ipse de se dicit. Haec opinio
                                      igitur est falsa.

                                      Furthermore, to banish true conviction
                                      from men’s minds is the act of a liar.
                                      Christ did expel a certain notion from the
                                      minds of His disciples. After His
                                      resurrection He appeared to the disciples,
                                      who thought that He was a spirit or a
                                      specter. To banish suspicion of this kind
                                      from their hearts, He said to them:
                                      “Handle and see: for a spirit hath not
                                      flesh and bones, as you see Me to have”
                                      (Luke 24:39). On another occasion, when He
                                      was walking on the sea, to the
                                      consternation of His disciples who thought
                                      He was an apparition, our Lord said: “It
                                      is I, fear ye not” (Matt. 14:27). If the
                                      opinion entertained by the disciples about
                                      a spectral body is true, we have to
                                      concede that Christ was deceitful. But
                                      Christ is the Truth, as He testified of
                                      Himself. Therefore the Manichaean theory
                                      is false.

                          Valentinus admitted that Christ had a real body.
                          However, he insisted that our Lord did not take flesh
                          from the Blessed Virgin, but rather brought down with
                          Him a body formed of celestial matter. This body
                          passed through the Virgin without receiving anything
                          from her, much as water passes through a canal.

                              Hoc etiam veritati Scripturae contradicit. Dicit
                              enim apostolus, Rom. I, 3: qui factus est ei ex
                              semine David secundum carnem, et ad Gal. IV, 4,
                              dicit: misit Deus filium suum unigenitum factum ex
                              muliere. Matthaeus autem I, 16, dicit: et Iacob
                              genuit Ioseph virum Mariae, de qua natus est
                              Iesus, qui vocatur Christus, et postmodum eam eius
                              matrem nominat subdens: cum esset desponsata mater
                              eius Maria Ioseph. Haec autem vera non essent, si
                              Christus de virgine carnem non assumpsisset.
                              Falsum est igitur quod corpus caeleste attulerit.

                              This hypothesis, too, contradicts the truth of
                              Scripture. In Romans 1:3 the Apostle says that
                              God’s Son “was made to Him of the seed of David,
                              according to the flesh.” And in Galatians 4:4 St.
                              Paul writes: “God sent His Son, made of a woman.”
                              Matthew likewise relates: “And Jacob begot Joseph,
                              the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who
                              is called Christ” (Matt. 1:16). A little later
                              Matthew refers to her as Christ’s mother: “When
                              His mother Mary was espoused to Joseph,” etc. None
                              of this would be true if Christ had not received
                              His flesh from the Virgin. Accordingly the
                              doctrine that Christ brought with Him a celestial
                              body is false.

                                  True, in 1 Corinthians 15:47 the Apostle
                                  states that “the second man” [Christ, as
                                  contrasted with Adam, the first man] was “from
                                  heaven, heavenly.” But this is to be
                                  understood in the sense that He came down from
                                  heaven in His divinity, not according to the
                                  substance of His body.

                                      Son of God, bringing His body from heaven,
                                      should have entered the Virgin’s womb, if
                                      He were to receive nothing from her. Such
                                      a procedure would seem to be a kind of
                                      deceit if, coming forth from His mother’s
                                      womb, He were to intimate that He had
                                      received from her a body which in fact He
                                      had not received. Since, therefore, all
                                      falsehood is foreign to Christ, we must
                                      acknowledge without reservation that He
                                      came forth from the Virgin’s womb in such
                                      a way that He really took His flesh from
                                      her.

                          to the true teaching of Catholic faith, Christ had a
                          real body of the same nature as ours, a true rational
                          soul, and, together with these, perfect deity. These

                              persona. Sequeretur ergo in Christo duas esse
                              personas, scilicet personam assumentem, et
                              personam assumptam: in homine enim induto non sunt
                              duae personae, quia indumentum rationem personae
                              non habet. Si autem vestis esset persona,
                              sequeretur in homine vestito duas esse personas.
                              Ad hoc igitur excludendum, posuerunt quidam animam
                              Christi unitam nunquam fuisse corpori, sed quod
                              persona filii Dei animam et corpus separatim

                              In undertaking to explain this truth, some
                              theologians have taken the wrong path. Persuaded
                              that every perfection accruing to a being
                              subsequent to its complete existence is joined to
                              it accidentally, as a garment is joined to a man,
                              certain theologians taught that humanity was
                              joined to divinity in the person of the Son by an
                              accidental union, in such a way that the assumed
                              nature would be related to the person of God’s Son
                              as clothing is related to a man. To bolster up
                              this view, they brought forward what the Apostle
                              says of Christ in Philippians 2:7, that He was “in
                              habit found as a man.” Likewise, they reflected
                              that from the union of soul and body an individual
                              possessed of rational nature is formed, and that
                              such an individual is called a person. If,
                              therefore, the soul was united to the body in
                              Christ, they were unable to see how they could
                              escape the conclusion that a person would be
                              constituted by such a union. In this event there
                              would be two persons in Christ, the person who
                              assumes and the person who is assumed. On the
                              other hand, there are not two persons in a man who
                              is clothed, because clothing does not possess what
                              is required for the notion of a person. If,
                              however, the clothes were a person, there would be
                              two persons in a clothed man. To avoid this
                              conclusion, therefore, some proposed that Christ’s
                              soul was never united to His body, but that the
                              person of God’s Son assumed soul and body
                              separately.

                                  nititur, incidit in maius. Sequitur enim ex
                                  necessitate, quod Christus non fuerit verus
                                  homo. Veritas enim humanae naturae requirit
                                  animae et corporis unionem, nam homo est qui
                                  ex utroque componitur. Sequeretur etiam quod
                                  Christi non fuerit vera caro, nec aliquod
                                  membrum eius habuit veritatem. Remota enim
                                  anima non est oculus, aut manus, aut caro et
                                  os, nisi aequivoce, sicut pictus aut lapideus.
                                  Sequeretur etiam quod Christus vere mortuus
                                  non fuerit. Mors enim est privatio vitae.
                                  Manifestum est enim quod divinitatis vita per
                                  mortem privari non potuit, corpus autem vivum
                                  esse non potuit, si ei anima coniuncta non
                                  fuit. Sequeretur etiam ulterius quod Christi
                                  corpus sentire non potuit, non enim sentit
                                  corpus nisi per animam sibi coniunctam.

                                  This view, while trying to escape one
                                  absurdity, falls into a greater, for it
                                  entails the necessary consequence that Christ
                                  would not be true man. Surely true human
                                  nature requires the union of soul and body; a
                                  man is a being made up of both. A further
                                  consequence is that Christ would not be true
                                  flesh, and that none of His members would be a
                                  true member. For if the soul is taken away,
                                  there is no eye or hand or flesh and bone,
                                  except in an equivocal sense, as when these
                                  parts of the body are depicted in paint or
                                  fashioned in stone. Further, it would follow
                                  that Christ did not really die. Death is the
                                  privation of life. Obviously the divinity
                                  could not be deprived of life by death, and
                                  the body could not be alive if a soul were not
                                  united to it. A final consequence would be
                                  that Christ’s body could not experience
                                  sensation; for the body has no sensation
                                  except through the soul united to it.

                                      fuisse unitum secundum inhabitationem
                                      gratiae, ita quod verbum Dei fuerit in

                                      autem refert dicere, quantum ad propositum
                                      pertinet, quod verbum est in homine sicut
                                      in templo, et quod natura humana verbo
                                      adveniat ut vestimentum vestito: nisi quod
                                      in tantum haec opinio est deterior, quia
                                      Christum verum hominem confiteri non

                                      immerito condemnata. Adhuc autem homo
                                      vestitus non potest esse persona vestis

                                      quod sit in specie indumenti. Si igitur
                                      filius Dei humanam naturam ut vestimentum
                                      assumpsit, nullo modo dici poterit persona
                                      humanae naturae, nec etiam dici poterit
                                      quod filius Dei sit eiusdem speciei cum
                                      aliis hominibus, de quo tamen apostolus
                                      dicit quod est in similitudinem hominum
                                      factus. Unde patet hanc opinionem esse

                                      This theory falls back into the heresy of
                                      Nestorius, which it set out to overthrow.
                                      The error of Nestorius consisted in
                                      holding that the Word of God was united to
                                      Christ the man by the indwelling of grace,
                                      so that the Word of God would reside in
                                      that man as in His temple. It makes no
                                      difference, with regard to the doctrine
                                      proposed, whether we say that the Word is
                                      in the man as in a temple, or whether we
                                      say that human nature is joined to the
                                      Word as a garment to the person wearing
                                      it, except that the second opinion is the
                                      worse, inasmuch as it cannot admit that
                                      Christ was true man. Accordingly this view
                                      is condemned, and deservedly so. Moreover,
                                      the man who is clothed cannot be the
                                      person of the clothes or garment, nor can
                                      he in any way be said to be in the species
                                      of clothing. If, therefore, the Son of God
                                      took human nature to Himself, He cannot in
                                      any sense be called the person of the
                                      human nature, nor can He be said to
                                      pertain to the same species as the rest of
                                      men. Yet the Apostle says of Him that He
                                      was “made in the likeness of men” (Phil.
                                      2:7). Clearly, therefore, this theory is
                                      to be utterly rejected.

                          Other theologians, wishing to avoid these absurdities,
                          proposed that in Christ the soul was indeed united to

                          man who, they maintained, was assumed by the Son of
                          God in unity of person. By reason of this assumption
                          they said that the man in question was the Son of God
                          and that the Son of God was that man. Further, since
                          this assumption had unity of person as its terminus,
                          they admitted that in Christ there was one person of
                          God and man. But since this man who, they maintain, is
                          composed of soul and body, is a certain suppositum or
                          hypostasis of human nature, they place two supposita
                          and two hypostases in Christ: one of human nature,
                          created and temporal; the other of divine nature,
                          uncreated and eternal.

                              As far as words go, this view appears to recede
                              from the error of Nestorius. But if we examine it
                              a little more closely, we find that it slips into
                              the heresy identified with Nestorius. For a
                              person, clearly, is nothing else than an
                              individual substance possessed of rational nature.
                              But human nature is rational. Therefore by the
                              very fact that a hypostasis or suppositum of human
                              nature, temporal and created, is admitted in
                              Christ, a person that is temporal and created is
                              also admitted in Him. This is precisely what the
                              name of suppositum. or hypostasis signifies,
                              namely, an individual substance. Accordingly, if
                              these people understand what they are saying, they
                              must place two persons in Christ when they place
                              two supposita or two hypostases in Him.

                                  Item. Quaecumque supposito differunt, ita se
                                  habent, quod ea quae sunt propria unius,
                                  alteri convenire non possunt. Si ergo non est
                                  idem suppositum filius Dei et filius hominis,
                                  sequitur quod ea quae sunt filii hominis, non
                                  possunt attribui filio Dei, nec e converso.
                                  Non ergo poterit dici Deus crucifixus, aut
                                  natus ex virgine: quod est Nestorianae
                                  impietatis.

                                  Another consideration is the following. Things
                                  that differ as supposita exist in such a way
                                  that what is proper to one cannot belong to
                                  another. Therefore, if the Son of God is not
                                  the same suppositum as the son of man, it
                                  follows that what belongs to the son of man
                                  cannot be attributed to the Son of God, and
                                  vice versa. Hence we could not say that God
                                  was crucified or born of the Virgin: which is
                                  characteristic of the Nestorian infamy.

                                      If anyone should undertake to protest, in
                                      reply to this, that what pertains to the
                                      man in question is ascribed to the Son of
                                      God, and conversely, because of the unity
                                      of person, even though the supposita may
                                      be different, his answer simply cannot
                                      stand. Evidently the eternal suppositum of
                                      the Son of God is nothing else than His
                                      very person. Hence whatever is said of the
                                      Son of God by reason of His person, would
                                      also be said of Him by reason of His
                                      suppositum. But what pertains to the man
                                      is not said of Him by reason of His
                                      suppositum, for the Son of God is
                                      represented as differing from the son of
                                      man in suppositum. Therefore what is
                                      proper to the son of man, such as his
                                      birth from the Virgin, his death, and the
                                      like, cannot be said of the Son of God by
                                      reason of the person.

                                          only by adoption. Consequently the man

                              diversum. Potest igitur dici quod manus Socratis

                              To see that this is so, we have but to reflect
                              that the names “person,” “hypostasis,” and
                              “suppositum” signify a whole of a certain kind. We
                              cannot say that a hand or flesh or any of the
                              other parts is a person or a hypostasis or a
                              suppositum; but this whole, which is this man, is
                              such. But names that are common to individuals in
                              the line of substance and accident, such as
                              “individual” and “singular,” can be applied both
                              to a whole and to its parts. Parts have something
                              in common with accidents, in the sense that they
                              do not exist by themselves, but inhere in other
                              things, although in a different way. We can say
                              that the hand of Socrates or Plato is a certain
                              kind of individual or singular thing, even though
                              it is not a hypostasis or a suppositum or a
                              person.

                                  quandoque quidem facit aliquod integrum, quae

                                  constituit aliquod integrum, sicut in lapide
                                  commixtio quatuor elementorum facit aliquod
                                  integrum: unde illud quod est ex elementis
                                  constitutum, in lapide potest dici suppositum
                                  vel hypostasis, quod est hic lapis, non autem
                                  persona, quia non est hypostasis naturae
                                  rationalis. Compositio autem elementorum in
                                  animali non constituit aliquod integrum, sed
                                  constituit partem, scilicet corpus: quia
                                  necesse est aliquid aliud advenire ad
                                  completionem animalis, scilicet animam; unde
                                  compositio elementorum in animali non
                                  constituit suppositum vel hypostasim, sed hoc
                                  animal totum est hypostasis vel suppositum.
                                  Nec tamen propter hoc minus est efficax in
                                  animali elementorum compositio quam in lapide,

                                  nobiliorem.

                                  Furthermore, we should note that sometimes a
                                  union of various ingredients, considered just
                                  in itself, constitutes an integral whole,
                                  although in another being it does not
                                  constitute an integral whole, because the
                                  addition of some other component is needed.
                                  Thus in a stone the combination of the four
                                  elements constitutes an integral whole; and so
                                  the object composed of the elements can, in
                                  the stone, be called a suppositum or
                                  hypostasis, which is this stone. It cannot, of
                                  course, be called a person, because it is not
                                  a hypostasis endowed with rational nature. But
                                  the combination of elements in an animal
                                  constitutes, not an integral whole, but only a
                                  part, namely, the body. Something else must be
                                  added to make up the complete animal, and this
                                  is the soul. Hence the combination of elements
                                  in an animal does not constitute a suppositum
                                  or hypostasis; rather, this whole animal is
                                  the hypostasis or suppositum. Nevertheless the
                                  combination~ of the elements is not, on this
                                  account, any less effectual in an animal than
                                  in a stone, but is rather more so, because it
                                  is ordained to the formation of a nobler
                                  being.

                                      duobus constituitur una natura, quae
                                      dicitur humana natura. Divinitas autem non
                                      advenit animae et corpori per modum

                                      est contra rationem divinae perfectionis.
                                      Unde ex divinitate et anima et corpore non
                                      constituitur una natura, sed ipsa natura
                                      divina in seipsa integra et pura existens

                                      In all men save one the union of soul and
                                      body constitutes a hypostasis and
                                      suppositum, because in their case the
                                      hypostasis or suppositum is nothing else
                                      but these two components. But in our Lord
                                      Jesus Christ, besides soul and body, a
                                      third substance enters in, namely, the
                                      Godhead. In Him, therefore, the composite
                                      of body and soul is not a separate
                                      suppositum or hypostasis, nor is it a
                                      person. The suppositum, hypostasis, or
                                      person is that which is made up of three
                                      substances, namely, the body, the soul,
                                      and the divinity. In Christ, accordingly,
                                      just as there is but one person, so there
                                      is but one suppositum and one hypostasis.
                                      But the way His soul is joined to His body
                                      differs from the way His divinity is
                                      united to both. His soul comes to the body
                                      as its self-existing form, so that one
                                      nature, which is called human nature, is
                                      composed of these two. But the Godhead
                                      does not come to the soul and body as a
                                      form or as a part; this is against the
                                      very concept of divine perfection.
                                      Therefore the divinity and the soul and
                                      the body do not constitute one nature; but
                                      the divine nature, complete in itself and
                                      existing in its purity, took to itself, in
                                      a way that is incomprehensible and
                                      indescribable, the human nature composed
                                      of soul and body. This called for an
                                      exercise of God’s infinite power. For we
                                      know from experience that, in proportion
                                      to an agent’s power, the more effectively
                                      he avails himself of the instrument he
                                      uses to carry out an undertaking.
                                      Therefore, as the divine power, because of
                                      its infinity, is infinite and
                                      incomprehensible, the way Christ united
                                      human nature to Himself, as a sort of
                                      organ to effect man’s salvation, is beyond
                                      human expression and surpasses every other
                                      union of God with creatures.

                                          divinae, sed esset quoddam constitutum
                                          ex tribus, sicut et in homine persona,
                                          hypostasis et suppositum est quod ex

                                          integrum, quod sibi assumpsit per

                                          et hypostasis et suppositum.

                                          We pointed out above that person,
                                          hypostasis, and suppositum signify an
                                          integral whole. Hence if the divine
                                          nature in Christ had the function of a
                                          part, like the soul in the composition
                                          of a man, and were not something
                                          whole, then the one person of Christ
                                          would not be accounted for by the
                                          divine nature alone, but would be a
                                          certain composite of three elements,
                                          just as in man the person, hypostasis,
                                          and suppositum is a composite of soul
                                          and body. However, since the divine
                                          nature is an integral whole that took
                                          human nature to itself by a
                                          mysterious, ineffable union, the
                                          person is accounted for by the divine
                                          nature, as also is the hypostasis and
                                          suppositum. Yet the soul and body are
                                          drawn to the personality of the divine
                                          person, so that He is the person of
                                          the Son of God and is likewise the
                                          person and the hypostasis and
                                          suppositum of the Son of man.

                                              be found in creatures. Thus
                                              subject and accident are not
                                              united in such a way that some
                                              third thing is formed from them.
                                              In a union of this kind, the

                                              hypostasis, and suppositum. But
                                              the accident is drawn to the
                                              personality of the subject, so
                                              that the person of the man and of
                                              the color of whiteness is one and
                                              the same, and the hypostasis or
                                              suppositum is likewise the same.
                                              In a somewhat similar fashion the
                                              person, hypostasis, and suppositum
                                              of the Son of God is the person,
                                              hypostasis, and suppositum of the
                                              human nature in Christ. Influenced
                                              by comparisons of this sort, some
                                              theologians went so far as to say
                                              that the human nature in Christ
                                              deteriorates into an accident and
                                              is accidentally united to the Son
                                              of God; they were unable to
                                              discriminate between literal truth
                                              and analogy.

                                                  Hence when we say, “this man,”

                                                  the eternal suppositum.
                                                  Nevertheless the name “man” is
                                                  not for that reason predicated
                                                  equivocally of Christ and of
                                                  other men. Equivocation does
                                                  not follow diversity of
                                                  supposition, but follows
                                                  diversity of signification.

                                                  signifies the same thing,
                                                  namely, human nature. But it
                                                  does not have the same
                                                  supposition; for in the one

                                                  for a created suppositum.

                                                      suppositum which pertains
                                                      to both natures. This is
                                                      true both when the name we
                                                      use signifies the divine
                                                      nature or person, and when
                                                      it signifies the human
                                                      nature. We can say, for
                                                      example, that the Son of
                                                      God is eternal, and that
                                                      the Son of God was born of
                                                      the Virgin. Likewise we
                                                      can say that this man is
                                                      God, that He created the
                                                      stars, and that He was
                                                      born, died, and was
                                                      buried.

                          Since there are in Christ one person and two natures,
                          we have to examine the relationship between them to
                          determine what is to be spoken of as one, and what is
                          to be spoken of as multiple in Him.

                              multiplicantur, necesse est quod in Christo plura
                              esse confiteamur. Inter quae primo considerandum
                              est, quod cum per generationem sive per
                              nativitatem natura recipiatur, necesse est quod
                              sicut in Christo sunt duae naturae, ita etiam duas
                              esse generationes sive nativitates: una aeterna,
                              secundum quam accepit naturam divinam a patre;
                              alia temporalis, secundum quam accepit humanam
                              naturam a matre. Similiter etiam quaecumque Deo et
                              homini convenienter attribuuntur ad naturam
                              pertinentia, necesse est plura dicere in Christo.
                              Attribuitur autem Deo intellectus et voluntas et
                              horum perfectiones, puta scientia seu sapientia,
                              et caritas, sive iustitia, quae homini etiam
                              attribuuntur ad humanam naturam pertinentia. Nam
                              voluntas et intellectus sunt partes animae, horum
                              autem perfectiones sunt sapientia et iustitia et
                              huiusmodi. Necesse est ergo in Christo ponere duos
                              intellectus, humanum scilicet et divinum, et
                              similiter duas voluntates, duplicem etiam
                              scientiam sive caritatem, creatam scilicet et
                              increatam.

                              Whatever is multiplied in accord with the
                              diversity of Christ’s natures, must be
                              acknowledged to be plural in Him. -In this
                              connection we must consider, first of all, that
                              nature is received by generation or birth.
                              Consequently, as there are two natures in Christ,
                              there must also be two generations or births: one
                              that is eternal, whereby He received divine nature
                              from His Father, and one that occurred in time,
                              whereby He received human nature from His mother.
                              Likewise, whatever is rightly attributed to God
                              and man as pertaining to nature, must be
                              predicated of Christ in the plural. To God are
                              ascribed intellect and will and their perfections,
                              such as knowledge or wisdom, and charity, and
                              justice. These are also attributed to man as
                              pertaining to human nature; for’ will and
                              intellect are faculties of the soul, and their
                              perfections are wisdom, justice, and the like.
                              Therefore we must acknowledge two intellects in
                              Christ, one human and one divine, and likewise two
                              wills, as well as a double knowledge and charity,
                              namely, the created and the uncreated.

                                  Ea vero quae ad suppositum sive hypostasim
                                  pertinent, unum tantum in Christo confiteri
                                  oportet: unde si esse accipiatur secundum quod
                                  unum esse est unius suppositi, videtur
                                  dicendum quod in Christo sit tantum unum esse.
                                  Manifestum est enim quod partes divisae
                                  singulae proprium esse habent, secundum autem
                                  quod in toto considerantur, non habent suum
                                  esse, sed omnes sunt per esse totius. Si ergo
                                  consideremus ipsum Christum ut quoddam
                                  integrum suppositum duarum naturarum, eius
                                  erit unum tantum esse, sicut et unum
                                  suppositum.

                                  But whatever belongs to the suppositum or
                                  hypostasis, must be declared to be one in
                                  Christ. Hence if existence is taken in the
                                  sense that one suppositum has one existence,
                                  we are forced, it appears, to assert that
                                  there is but one existence in Christ. Of
                                  course, as is evident, when a whole is
                                  divided, each separate part has its own proper
                                  existence; but according as parts are
                                  considered in a whole, they do not have their
                                  own existence, for they all exist with the
                                  existence of the whole. Therefore, if we look
                                  upon Christ as an integral suppositum having
                                  two natures, His existence will be but one,
                                  just as the suppositum, too, is one.

                                      Quia vero operationes suppositorum sunt,
                                      visum est aliquibus quod sicut in Christo
                                      non est nisi unum suppositum, ita non
                                      esset nisi una operatio. Sed non recte
                                      consideraverunt: nam in quolibet individuo
                                      reperiuntur multae operationes, si sunt
                                      plura operationum principia, sicut in
                                      homine alia est operatio intelligendi,
                                      alia sentiendi, propter differentiam
                                      sensus et intellectus: sicut in igne alia
                                      est operatio calefactionis, alia
                                      ascensionis, propter differentiam caloris
                                      et levitatis. Natura autem comparatur ad
                                      operationem ut eius principium. Non ergo
                                      est una operatio in Christo propter unum
                                      suppositum, sed duae propter duas naturas,
                                      sicut e converso in sancta Trinitate est
                                      una operatio trium personarum propter unam
                                      naturam.

                                      Since actions belong to supposita, some
                                      have thought that, as there is but one
                                      suppositum in Christ, so there is only one
                                      kind of action in Him. But they did not
                                      rightly weigh the matter. For many actions
                                      are discerned in any individual, if there
                                      are many principles of activity in him.
                                      Thus in man the action of understanding
                                      differs from the action of sense
                                      perception, because of the difference
                                      between sense and intellect. Likewise in
                                      fire the action of heating differs from
                                      the action of soaring upward, because of
                                      the difference between heat and lightness.
                                      Nature is related to action as its
                                      principle. Therefore it is not true that
                                      Christ has only one kind of activity
                                      because of the one suppositum. Rather,
                                      there are two kinds of action in Him,
                                      because of the two natures, just as,
                                      conversely, there is in the Holy Trinity
                                      but one activity of the three persons
                                      because of the one nature.

                                          Nevertheless the activity of Christ’s
                                          humanity has some part in the activity
                                          proper to His divine power. For of all
                                          the factors that come together in a
                                          suppositum, that which is the most
                                          eminent is served by the rest in an
                                          instrumental capacity, just as all the
                                          lesser faculties of man are
                                          instruments of his intellect. Thus in
                                          Christ the human nature is held to be,
                                          as it were, the organ of His divine
                                          nature. But it is clear that an
                                          instrument acts in virtue of the
                                          principal agent. This is why, in the
                                          action of an instrument, we are able
                                          to discern not only the power of the
                                          instrument, but also that of the
                                          principal agent. A chest is made by
                                          the action of an axe, but only so far
                                          as the axe is directed by the
                                          carpenter. In like manner the activity
                                          of the human nature in Christ received
                                          a certain efficacy from the divine
                                          nature, over and above its human
                                          power. When Christ touched a leper,
                                          the action belonged to His human
                                          nature; but the fact that the touch
                                          cured the man of his leprosy, is owing
                                          to the power of the divine nature. In
                                          this way all the human actions and
                                          sufferings of Christ were efficacious
                                          for our salvation in virtue of His
                                          divinity. For this reason Dionysius
                                          calls the human activity of Christ
                                          “theandric,” that is, divine-human,
                                          because actions of this sort proceeded
                                          from His human nature in such a way
                                          that the power of the divinity was
                                          operative in them.

                                              A doubt is raised by some
                                              theologians concerning sonship,
                                              whether there is only one
                                              filiation in Christ because of the
                                              oneness of the suppositum, or two
                                              filiations because of the duality
                                              of His nativity. It may seem that
                                              there are two filiations; for when
                                              a cause is multiplied the effect
                                              is multiplied, and the cause of
                                              sonship is nativity. Since,
                                              therefore, there are two
                                              nativities of Christ, the
                                              consequence may seem to follow
                                              that there are also two
                                              filiations.

                                                  the human filiation does not
                                                  constitute a person, but comes
                                                  to a person already
                                                  constituted as such. In the
                                                  same way there is no reason
                                                  why one man should not be
                                                  related to his father and
                                                  mother by a single filiation;
                                                  he is born of both parents by
                                                  the same nativity. Wherever
                                                  the cause of a relation is the
                                                  same, the relation is in
                                                  reality but one, even though
                                                  it may have many respects.
                                                  There is nothing to prevent a
                                                  thing from having a reference
                                                  to another thing, even though
                                                  no relation is really in it.
                                                  Thus the knowable is referred
                                                  to knowledge, although no
                                                  relation exists in it. So,
                                                  too, there is no reason why a
                                                  single real relation should
                                                  not have a number of respects.
                                                  just as a relation depends on
                                                  its cause for its existence as
                                                  a certain thing, so it also
                                                  depends on its cause for the
                                                  fact that it is one or
                                                  multiple. Therefore, since
                                                  Christ does not proceed from
                                                  His Father and His mother by
                                                  the same nativity, there may
                                                  seem to be in Him two real
                                                  filiations because of the two
                                                  nativities.

                                                      why several real
                                                      filiations cannot be
                                                      attributed to Christ. Not
                                                      everything that is
                                                      generated by another can
                                                      be called a son; only a
                                                      complete suppositum can be
                                                      called a son. Not a man’s
                                                      hand or foot, but the
                                                      whole individual, Peter or
                                                      John, is called son. Hence
                                                      the proper subject of
                                                      filiation is the
                                                      suppositum itself. But we
                                                      have shown that the only
                                                      suppositum in Christ is
                                                      the uncreated suppositum,
                                                      which cannot receive any
                                                      real relation beginning in
                                                      time; as we intimated
                                                      above, every relation of
                                                      God to creatures is purely
                                                      mental. Consequently the
                                                      filiation whereby the
                                                      eternal suppositum of the
                                                      Son is related to His
                                                      virgin mother cannot be a
                                                      real relation, but must be
                                                      a purely mental relation.

                          Quia vero, sicut iam dictum est, humanitas Christi se
                          habet ad divinitatem eius quasi quoddam organum eius,
                          organorum autem dispositio et qualitas pensatur
                          praecipue quidem ex fine, et etiam ex decentia
                          instrumento utentis, secundum hos modos consequens est
                          ut consideremus qualitatem humanae naturae a verbo Dei
                          assumptae. Finis autem assumptionis humanae naturae a
                          verbo Dei, est salus et reparatio humanae naturae.
                          Talem igitur oportuit esse Christum secundum humanam
                          naturam ut convenienter esse possit auctor humanae
                          salutis. Salus autem humana consistit in fruitione
                          divina, per quam homo beatus efficitur: et ideo
                          oportuit Christum secundum humanam naturam fuisse
                          perfecte Deo fruentem. Principium enim in unoquoque
                          genere oportet esse perfectum. Fruitio autem divina
                          secundum duo existit, secundum voluntatem, et secundum
                          intellectum: secundum voluntatem quidem Deo perfecte
                          per amorem inhaerentem; secundum intellectum autem
                          perfecte Deum cognoscentem.
                        </td>
                        <td>
                          As was mentioned in the preceding chapter, the
                          humanity of Christ is related to His divinity as a
                          sort of organ belonging to it. The disposition and
                          quality of organs are gauged chiefly by the purpose,
                          though also by the dignity, of the person using them.
                          Consequently we are to esteem the quality of the human
                          nature assumed by the Word of God in accord with these
                          norms. The purpose the Word of God had in assuming
                          human nature was the salvation and reparation of human
                          nature. Therefore Christ had to be of such excellence
                          in His human nature that He could fittingly be the
                          author of man’s salvation. But the salvation of man
                          consists in the enjoyment of God, whereby man is
                          beatified; and so Christ must have had in His human
                          nature a perfect enjoyment of God. For the principle
                          in any genus must be perfect. But fruition of God has
                          a twofold aspect: it requires the satisfaction of the
                          will and of the intellect. The will must adhere
                          unreservedly to God by love, the intellect must know
                          God perfectly.

                              iustificatur, secundum illud Rom. III, 24:
                              iustificati gratis per gratiam eius. Ex hoc enim

                              Oportuit igitur verbum Dei incarnatum perfectum in
                              gratia et in sapientia veritatis existere; unde
                              Ioan. I, 14, dicitur: verbum caro factum est, et
                              habitavit in nobis: et vidimus gloriam eius,
                              gloriam quasi unigeniti a patre, plenum gratiae et
                              veritatis.

                              Perfect attachment of the will to God is brought
                              about by love and by grace, whereby man is
                              justified, according to Romans 3:24: “Being
                              justified freely by His grace.” For man is made
                              just by union with God through love. Perfect
                              knowledge of God is effected by the light of
                              wisdom, which is the knowledge of divine truth.
                              Therefore the incarnate Word of God had to be
                              perfect in grace and in the wisdom of truth. Hence
                              we read in John 1:14: “The Word was made flesh,
                              and dwelt among us; and we saw His glory, the
                              glory as it were of the only begotten of the
                              Father, full of grace and truth.”

                          First we shall deal with the question of the fullness
                          of grace in Christ. In this matter we should observe
                          that the term, grace, may be understood in two senses.
                          According to one usage, it means to be pleasing
                          (<i>gratum</i>): we say that someone is in the good
                          graces of another because he is pleasing to him. In
                          another sense, it means that something is given
                          gratis: a person is said to grant a grace to another
                          when he confers gratis a benefit on that other.
                          <tr valign="top" style="text-align: justify">

                              Nec istae duae acceptiones gratiae penitus
                              separatae sunt. Ex eo enim aliquid alteri gratis
                              datur, quia is cui datur, gratus est danti vel
                              simpliciter vel secundum quid. Simpliciter quidem
                              quando ad hoc recipiens gratus est danti, ut eum
                              sibi coniungat secundum aliquem modum. Hos enim
                              quos gratos habemus, nobis pro posse attrahimus
                              secundum quantitatem et modum quo nobis grati
                              existunt. Secundum quid autem, quando ad hoc
                              recipiens gratus est danti, ut aliquid ab eo
                              recipiat, non autem ad hoc ut assumatur ab ipso.
                              Unde patet quod omnis qui habet gratiam, aliquid
                              habet gratis datum; non autem omnis qui habet
                              aliquid gratis datum, gratus danti existit. Et
                              ideo duplex gratia distingui solet: una scilicet
                              quae solum gratis est data, alia quae etiam gratum
                              facit. Gratis autem dari dicitur quod nequaquam
                              est debitum.

                              These two meanings of grace are not wholly
                              unconnected. A thing is given gratis to another
                              because he to whom it is given is pleasing
                              (<i>gratus</i>) to the giver, either simply or in
                              some respect. The recipient is simply pleasing to
                              the giver, when he is pleasing to such an extent
                              that the giver associates him with himself in some
                              way. For those whom we hold dear (<i
                                >quos gratos habemus</i
                              >) we attract to ourselves as far as we can,
                              according to the quantity and degree in which they
                              are dear to us. But the recipient is pleasing to
                              the giver only in some respect when he is pleasing
                              to the extent that he receives something from him,
                              although not to the extent that he is taken into
                              association by the donor. Clearly, therefore,
                              everyone who has favor (<i>qui habet gratiam</i>)
                              with another, has something given to him gratis;
                              but not everyone who has something given to him
                              gratis is pleasing (<i>gratus</i>) to the donor.
                              Hence we ordinarily distinguish between two kinds
                              of grace: one, namely, which is only given gratis,
                              and the other which, in addition, makes pleasing
                              (<i>gratum facit</i>). A thing is said to be given
                              gratis if it is in no way due.

                                  Dupliciter autem aliquid debitum existit: uno

                                  secundum operationem. Secundum naturam quidem
                                  debitum est rei quod ordo naturalis illius rei
                                  exposcit, sicut debitum est homini quod habeat
                                  rationem et manus et pedes. Secundum

                                  et ea quae pro meritis divinitus dantur,
                                  interdum gratiae nomen vel rationem non
                                  amittant: tum quia principium merendi fuit a
                                  gratia, tum etiam quia superabundantius dantur
                                  quam merita humana requirant, sicut dicitur
                                  Rom. VI, 23: gratia Dei vita aeterna.

                                  A thing may be due in two ways, either
                                  according to nature or according to operation.
                                  According to nature, whatever the natural
                                  order of a thing requires, is due to it; thus
                                  the possession of reason and hands and feet is
                                  due to man. According to operation, a thing is
                                  due in the way that a recompense is due to a
                                  worker. Therefore those gifts are given gratis
                                  by God to men, which exceed the order of
                                  nature and are not acquired by merits;
                                  although even gifts that are conferred by God
                                  because of merits sometimes retain the name
                                  and character of grace, because the principle
                                  of meriting comes from grace, and also because
                                  rewards are given over and above what human
                                  merits require, as we learn from Romans 6:23:
                                  “The grace of God, life everlasting.”

                                      quod hominem faciant Deo gratum.

                                      Among such gifts, some exceed the capacity
                                      of human nature and are not given for
                                      merits. However, the fact that a man has
                                      these gifts does not prove that he is
                                      thereby rendered pleasing to God. Examples
                                      are the gifts of prophecy, of working
                                      miracles, of knowledge, of teaching, or
                                      any other such gifts divinely conferred.
                                      By these and like gifts man is not united
                                      to God, except, perhaps, by a certain
                                      similarity, so far as he shares to some
                                      extent in His goodness; but everything is
                                      assimilated to God in this way. Yet some
                                      gifts do render man pleasing to God, and
                                      join man to Him. Such gifts are called
                                      graces, not only because they are given
                                      gratis, but also because they make man
                                      pleasing to God.

                                          The union of man with God is twofold.
                                          One way is by affection, and this is
                                          brought about by charity, which in a
                                          certain sense makes man one with God
                                          in affection, as is said in 1
                                          Corinthians 6:17: “He who is joined to
                                          the Lord is one spirit.” Through this
                                          virtue God dwells in man, according to
                                          John 14:23: “If anyone love Me, he
                                          will keep My word, and My Father will
                                          love him, and We will come to him and
                                          will make Our abode with him.” It also
                                          causes man to be in God, according to
                                          I John 4: 16: “He who abides in
                                          charity abides in God, and God in
                                          him.” By receiving this gratuitous
                                          gift, therefore, man is made pleasing
                                          to God, and he is brought so far that
                                          by the love of charity he becomes one
                                          spirit with God: he is in God and God
                                          is in him. Hence the Apostle teaches,
                                          in 1 Corinthians 13:1-3, that without
                                          charity the other gifts do not profit
                                          men: they cannot make men pleasing to
                                          God unless charity is present.

                                              bond of love, as We also are one”
                                              (John 17:22).

                                                  There is another conjunction
                                                  of man with God that is
                                                  brought about, not only by
                                                  affection or inhabitation, but
                                                  also by the unity of
                                                  hypostasis or person, so that
                                                  one and the same hypostasis or
                                                  person is both God and man.
                                                  And this conjunction of man
                                                  with God is proper to Jesus
                                                  Christ. We have already spoken
                                                  at length of this union. In
                                                  truth, this is a singular
                                                  grace of the man Christ, that
                                                  He is united to God in unity
                                                  of person. Clearly the grace
                                                  was given gratis, for it
                                                  exceeds the capacity of
                                                  nature, and besides, there
                                                  were no merits to precede this
                                                  gift. But it also makes Him
                                                  supremely pleasing to God, so
                                                  that the Father says of Him in

                                                      The difference between
                                                      these two graces seems to
                                                      be as follows. The grace
                                                      whereby man is united to
                                                      God by affection exists in

                                                      habitual. For that union
                                                      is accomplished through an
                                                      act of love, and perfect
                                                      acts issue from habit;
                                                      consequently some habitual
                                                      grace is infused into the
                                                      soul to produce that
                                                      eminently perfect habit
                                                      whereby the soul is united
                                                      to God by love. On the
                                                      other hand, personal or
                                                      hypostatic being is
                                                      constituted, not by any
                                                      habit, but by the natures
                                                      to which the hypostases or
                                                      persons pertain. Therefore
                                                      the union of human nature
                                                      with God in unity of

                                                      grace, but by the
                                                      conjunction of the natures
                                                      themselves in one person.

                          Est autem proprium Christi quod eius gratia sit
                          infinita, quia secundum testimonium Ioannis Baptistae,
                          non ad mensuram dat Deus spiritum homini Christo, ut
                          dicitur Ioan. III; aliis autem datur spiritus ad
                          mensuram, secundum illud ad Ephes. IV, 7: unicuique
                          nostrum data est gratia secundum mensuram donationis
                          Christi. Et quidem si hoc referatur ad gratiam
                          unionis, nullam dubitationem habet quod dicitur. Nam
                          aliis quidem sanctis datum est deos aut filios Dei
                          esse per participationem ex influentia alicuius doni,
                          quod quia creatum est, necesse est ipsum, sicut et
                          ceteras creaturas, esse finitum. Sed Christo secundum
                          humanam naturam datum est ut sit Dei filius non per
                          participationem, sed per naturam. Naturalis autem
                          divinitas est infinita. Ex ipsa igitur unione accepit
                          donum infinitum: unde gratia unionis absque omni
                          dubitatione est infinita.

                          The possession of infinite grace is restricted to
                          Christ. According to the testimony of John the
                          Baptist, “God doth not give the Spirit by measure” to
                          the man Christ (John 3:34). But to others the Spirit
                          is given in measure, as we read in Ephesians 4:7: “To
                          everyone of us is given grace ‘according to the
                          measure of the giving of Christ.” If this refers to
                          the grace of union, no doubt can arise about what is
                          here stated. To other saints is given the grace of
                          being gods or sons of God by participation, through
                          the infusion of some gift. Such a gift, being created,
                          must itself be finite, just as all other creatures
                          are. To Christ, on the contrary, is given, in His
                          human nature, the grace to be the Son of God not by
                          participation, but by nature. But natural divinity is
                          infinite. Through that union, therefore, He received
                          an infinite gift. Hence beyond all doubt the grace of
                          union is infinite.

                              Sed de gratia habituali dubium esse potest, an sit
                              infinita. Cum enim huiusmodi gratia sit etiam
                              donum creatum, confiteri oportet quod habeat
                              essentiam finitam. Potest tamen dici infinita
                              triplici ratione.

                              Concerning habitual grace, however, a doubt can be
                              raised as to whether it is infinite. Since such
                              grace is a created gift, we have to acknowledge
                              that it has a finite essence. Yet it can be said
                              to be infinite for three reasons.

                                  secundum speciem, sicut si ternario addatur
                                  unitas, iam erit alia species numeri. Quando
                                  igitur alicui non tantum datur de bonitate
                                  divina quanta est capacitas naturalis speciei
                                  suae, videtur ei secundum aliquam mensuram
                                  donatum. Cum vero tota naturalis capacitas
                                  impletur, non videtur ei secundum mensuram
                                  donatum, quia etsi sit mensura ex parte
                                  recipientis, non tamen est mensura ex parte
                                  dantis, qui totum est paratus dare: sicut si

                                  mensura invenit aquam praeparatam, quamvis

                                  determinatam quantitatem. Sic igitur gratia
                                  Christi habitualis finita quidem est secundum

                                  First, on the part of the recipient. The
                                  capacity of any created nature is evidently
                                  finite. Even though it is able to receive an
                                  infinite good by way of knowledge and
                                  fruition, it does not receive that good
                                  infinitely. Each creature has a definite
                                  measure of capacity in keeping with its
                                  species and nature. This does not prevent the
                                  divine power from being able to make another
                                  creature with a greater capacity; but such a
                                  creature would no longer be of the same nature
                                  with regard to species. Thus if one is added
                                  to three, a different species of number will
                                  result. Consequently, when the divine goodness
                                  that is bestowed on anyone does not completely
                                  exhaust the natural capacity of his nature, we
                                  judge that what is given to him has been
                                  apportioned according to some measure. But
                                  when the whole of his natural capacity is
                                  filled up, We conclude that what he receives
                                  is not parceled out to him according to
                                  measure. For although there is a measure on
                                  the part of the recipient, there is no measure
                                  on the part of the giver, who is ready to give
                                  all; if a person, for instance, takes a
                                  pitcher down to the river, he finds water at
                                  hand without measure, although he himself
                                  receives with measure because of the limited
                                  size of the vessel. In this way Christ’s
                                  habitual grace is finite in its essence, but
                                  may be said to be given infinitely and not
                                  according to measure, because as much is given
                                  as created nature is able to receive.

                                      esset limitata ad genus vel speciem, sed
                                      tamen plenitudinem illius speciei
                                      possideret: unde secundum rationem
                                      speciei, absque termino vel mensura esset,

                                      Secondly, grace may be said to be infinite
                                      on the part of the gift itself that is
                                      received. Surely we realize that there is
                                      nothing to prevent a thing that is finite
                                      in its essence, from being infinite by
                                      reason of some, form. Infinite according
                                      to essence is that which possesses the
                                      whole fullness of being; this, of course,
                                      is proper to God alone, who is being
                                      itself. But if we suppose that there is
                                      some particular form not existing in a
                                      subject, such as whiteness or heat, it
                                      would not, indeed, have an infinite
                                      essence, for its essence would be confined
                                      to a genus or species; but it would
                                      possess the entire fullness of that
                                      species. With respect to the species in
                                      question, it would be without limit or
                                      measure, because it would have whatever
                                      could pertain to that species. But if
                                      whiteness or heat is received into some
                                      subject, the latter does not always
                                      possess everything that necessarily and
                                      invariably pertains to the nature of that
                                      form, but does so only when the form is
                                      possessed as perfectly as it can be
                                      possessed, that is, when the manner of
                                      possessing is equal to the thing’s
                                      capacity for being possessed. In this way,
                                      then, Christ’s habitual grace was finite
                                      in its essence; but it is said to have
                                      been without limit and measure because
                                      Christ received all that could pertain to
                                      the nature of grace. Other men do not
                                      receive the whole: one man receives grace
                                      in this measure, another in that. “There
                                      are diversities of graces,” as we learn
                                      from 1 Corinthians 12:4.

                                          In the third place, grace may be
                                          called infinite on the part of its
                                          cause. For in a cause is contained, in
                                          some way, its effect. Therefore, if a
                                          cause with infinite power to influence
                                          is at hand, it is able to influence
                                          without measure and, in a certain
                                          sense, infinitely; for example, if a
                                          person had a fountain capable of
                                          pouring forth water infinitely, he
                                          could be said to possess water without
                                          measure and, in a sense, infinitely.
                                          In this way Christ’s soul has grace
                                          that is infinite and without measure,
                                          owing to the fact that it possesses,
                                          as united to itself, the Word who is
                                          the inexhaustible and infinite

                                              From the fact that the singular
                                              grace of Christ’s soul is infinite
                                              in the ways described, we readily
                                              infer that the grace which is His
                                              as head of the Church is likewise
                                              infinite. For the very reason that
                                              He possesses it, He pours it
                                              forth. And since He has received
                                              the gifts of the Spirit without
                                              measure, He has the power of
                                              pouring forth without measure all
                                              that pertains to the grace of the
                                              head, so that His grace is
                                              sufficient for the salvation, not
                                              of some men only, but of the whole
                                              world, according to 1 John 2:2:
                                              “And He is the propitiation for
                                              our sins; and not for ours only,
                                              but also for those of the whole
                                              world”; and, we may add, of many
                                              worlds, if such existed.

                          Oportet autem consequenter dicere de plenitudine
                          sapientiae Christi. Ubi primo considerandum occurrit,
                          quod, cum in Christo sint duae naturae, divina
                          scilicet et humana, quidquid ad utramque naturam
                          pertinet, necesse est quod geminetur in Christo, ut
                          supra dictum est. Sapientia autem et divinae naturae
                          convenit et humanae. Dicitur enim de Deo Iob IX, 4:
                          sapiens corde est, et fortis robore. Sed etiam homines
                          interdum Scriptura sapientes appellat seu secundum
                          sapientiam mundanam, secundum illud Ier. IX, 23: non
                          glorietur sapiens in sapientia sua; sive secundum
                          sapientiam divinam, secundum illud Matth. XXIII, 34:
                          ecce ego mitto ad vos prophetas et sapientes et
                          Scribas. Ergo oportet confiteri duas esse in Christo
                          sapientias secundum duas naturas, sapientiam scilicet
                          increatam, quae ei competit secundum quod est Deus, et
                          sapientiam creatam, quae ei competit secundum quod est
                          homo.

                          We treat next of the fullness of wisdom in Christ. In
                          this matter, the first point that comes up for
                          consideration is the truth that, since Christ has two
                          natures, the divine and the human, whatever pertains
                          to both natures must be twofold in Christ, as was
                          stated above. But wisdom appertains to both the divine
                          nature and the human nature. The assertion of Job 9:4:
                          “He is wise in heart and mighty in strength,” is
                          spoken of God. At times Scripture also calls men wise,
                          whether with reference to worldly wisdom, as in
                          Jeremiah 9:23: “Let not the wise man glory in his
                          wisdom,” or with reference to divine wisdom, as in
                          Matthew 23:34: “Behold, I send to you prophets and
                          wise men and scribes.” Hence we must acknowledge a
                          twofold wisdom in Christ, conformably with His two
                          natures: uncreated wisdom, which pertains to Him as
                          God, and created wisdom, which pertains to Him as man.

                              Et secundum quidem quod Deus est et verbum Dei,
                              est genita sapientia patris, secundum illud I ad
                              Cor. I, 24: Christum Dei virtutem et Dei
                              sapientiam. Nihil enim est aliud verbum interius
                              uniuscuiusque intelligentis nisi conceptio
                              sapientiae eius. Et quia verbum Dei supra diximus
                              esse perfectum et unitum, necesse est quod Dei
                              verbum sit perfecta conceptio sapientiae Dei
                              patris, ut scilicet quidquid in sapientia Dei
                              patris continetur per modum ingeniti, totum in
                              verbo contineatur per modum geniti et concepti. Et
                              inde est quod dicitur, quod in ipso, scilicet
                              Christo, sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae et
                              scientiae absconditi.

                              Inasmuch as Christ is God and the Word of God, He
                              is the begotten Wisdom of the Father, as is
                              indicated in 1 Corinthians 1:24: “Christ the power
                              of God and the wisdom of God.” For the interior
                              word of any intellectual being is nothing else
                              than the conception of wisdom. And since, as we
                              said above, the Word of God is perfect and is one
                              with God, He must be the perfect conception of the
                              wisdom of God the Father. Consequently, whatever
                              is contained in the wisdom of God the Father as
                              unbegotten, is contained wholly in the Word as
                              begotten and conceived. And so we are told, in
                              Colossians 2:3, that in Him, namely, in Christ,
                              “are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and
                              knowledge.”

                                  Hominis autem Christi est duplex cognitio. Una
                                  quidem deiformis, secundum quod Deum per

                                  et ipse Deus intelligendo seipsum, intelligit

                                  beatus est, et omnis creatura rationalis
                                  perfecte Deo fruens. Quia igitur Christum
                                  dicimus esse humanae salutis auctorem, necesse
                                  est dicere, quod talis cognitio sic animae
                                  Christi conveniat ut decet auctorem.
                                  Principium autem et immobile esse oportet, et
                                  virtute praestantissimum. Conveniens igitur
                                  fuit ut illa Dei visio in qua beatitudo
                                  hominum et salus aeterna consistit,

                                  principio habent, inquantum mobilia sunt, sed
                                  eam per successionem temporis assequuntur;
                                  immobilia vero, inquantum huiusmodi, semper
                                  obtinent suas perfectiones ex quo esse
                                  incipiunt.

                                  Indeed, even as man, Christ has a twofold
                                  knowledge. The one is godlike, whereby He sees
                                  God in His essence, and other things in God,
                                  just as God Himself, by knowing Himself, knows
                                  all other things. Through this vision God
                                  Himself is happy, as is every rational
                                  creature admitted to the perfect fruition of
                                  God. Therefore, since we hold that Christ is
                                  the author of man’s salvation, we must also
                                  hold that such knowledge as befits the author
                                  of salvation pertains to the soul of Christ.
                                  But a principle must be immovable and must
                                  also be pre-eminent in power. Hence that
                                  vision of God in which men’s beatitude and
                                  eternal salvation consist, ought to be found
                                  to be more excellent in Christ than in others,
                                  and, indeed, ought to be found in Him as in an
                                  immovable principle. The difference between
                                  what is movable and what is immovable comes to
                                  this: movable things, so far as they are
                                  movable, do not possess their proper
                                  perfection from the beginning, but acquire it
                                  in the course of time; but immovable things,
                                  as such, always possess their perfections from
                                  the first moment of their existence.
                                  Accordingly Christ, the author of man’s
                                  salvation, should rightly have possessed the
                                  full vision of God from the very beginning of
                                  His incarnation; propriety would not allow Him
                                  to have attained to it in the course of time,
                                  as other saints do.

                                      It was also appropriate that that soul
                                      which was united to God more closely than
                                      all others, should be beatified by the
                                      vision of God beyond the rest of
                                      creatures. Gradation is possible in this
                                      vision, according as some see God, the
                                      cause of all things, more clearly than
                                      others. The more comprehensively a cause
                                      is known, the more numerous are the
                                      effects that can be discerned in it. For a
                                      more perfect knowledge of a cause entails
                                      a fuller knowledge of its power, and there
                                      can be no knowledge of this power without
                                      a knowledge of its effects, since the
                                      magnitude of a power is ordinarily gauged
                                      from its effects. This is why, among those
                                      who behold the essence of God, some
                                      perceive more effects in God Himself or
                                      more exemplars of the divine works than do
                                      others who see less clearly. It is because
                                      of this fact that lower angels are
                                      instructed by higher angels, as we have
                                      previously observed.

                                          angels. Hence the Apostle says, in

                                          naked and open to His eyes.”

                                              of the divinity. For, as we said
                                              above, a thing is comprehended by
                                              knowledge when it is known to the
                                              full extent that it is knowable.
                                              Any object is knowable to the
                                              degree that it is a being and is
                                              true; but the divine being is
                                              infinite, as likewise is its
                                              truth. Therefore God is infinitely
                                              knowable. But no creature can know
                                              infinitely, even if what it knows
                                              is infinite. Hence no creature can
                                              comprehend God by seeing Him. But
                                              Christ’s soul is a creature, and
                                              whatever in Christ pertains
                                              exclusively to His human nature is
                                              created. Otherwise the nature of
                                              Christ’s humanity would not differ
                                              from the nature of His divinity,
                                              which alone is uncreated. However,
                                              the hypostasis or person of the
                                              Word of God, which is one in two
                                              natures, is uncreated. For this
                                              reason we do not call Christ a
                                              creature, speaking absolutely,
                                              because the hypostasis is connoted
                                              by the name of Christ. But we do
                                              say that the soul of Christ or the
                                              body of Christ is a creature.
                                              Therefore Christ’s soul does not
                                              comprehend God, but Christ
                                              comprehends God by His uncreated
                                              wisdom. Our Lord had this
                                              uncreated wisdom in mind when,
                                              speaking of His knowledge of
                                              comprehension, He said in Matthew
                                              11:27: “No one knows the Son but
                                              the Father; neither doth anyone
                                              know the Father but the Son.”

                                                  In this connection we may note
                                                  that comprehension of a
                                                  thing’s essence and
                                                  comprehension of its power are
                                                  of the same nature; a thing is
                                                  able to act so far as it is a
                                                  being in act. Therefore, if
                                                  Christ’s soul is incapable of
                                                  comprehending the essence of
                                                  the divinity, as we have shown
                                                  is the case, it cannot
                                                  comprehend the divine power.
                                                  But it would comprehend the
                                                  divine power if it knew all
                                                  that God is able to accomplish
                                                  and the ways in which He can
                                                  produce His effects. But this
                                                  is impossible. Therefore
                                                  Christ’s soul does not know
                                                  all that God can do, nor all
                                                  the modes of activity open to
                                                  Him.

                          Conveniens igitur fuit ut Dei filius corpus assumeret

                          The foregoing exposition clearly indicates the way the
                          formation of Christ’s body ought to have taken place.
                          God could, indeed, have fashioned Christ’s body from
                          the dust of the earth or from any other matter, in the
                          way He fashioned the body of our first parent. But
                          this would not have been in keeping with the
                          restoration of man, which is the reason why the Son of
                          God assumed flesh, as we have pointed out. The nature
                          of the human race, which was derived from the first
                          parent and which was to be healed, would not have been
                          so well restored to its pristine honor if the victor
                          over the devil and the conqueror of death, under which
                          the human race was held captive because of the sin of
                          the first father, had taken His body from some other
                          source. The works of God are perfect, and what He
                          means to restore He brings to perfection. He even adds
                          more than had been taken away: through Christ the
                          grace of God has abounded more than the offense of
                          Adam, as the Apostle teaches in Romans 5:15, 20. Hence
                          it was fitting that the Son of God should assume a
                          body from the nature propagated by Adam.

                              Moreover, the mystery of the Incarnation becomes
                              profitable to men by faith. Unless men believed
                              that He who appeared in the guise of a man was the
                              Son of God, they would not follow Him as the
                              author of salvation. This was the case with the
                              Jews, who drew upon themselves damnation rather
                              than salvation from the mystery of the
                              Incarnation, because of their unbelief. In order,

                              readily be believed, the Son of God disposed all
                              things in such a way as to show that He was a true
                              man. This would not have seemed to be so if He had
                              taken His bodily nature from some other source
                              than from human nature. Fittingly, therefore, He
                              assumed a body stemming from the first parent.

                                  Furthermore, the Son of God, made man, brought
                                  salvation to the human race, not only by
                                  conferring the remedy of grace, but also by
                                  giving an example that cannot be ignored.
                                  Doubts may be raised about the teaching and
                                  the life of any other man because of a defect
                                  in his human knowledge and his mastery of
                                  truth. But what the Son of God teaches is
                                  believed without hesitation to be true and
                                  what He does is accepted without misgiving as
                                  good. In Him we ought to have an example of
                                  the glory we hope for and of the virtue
                                  whereby we may merit it. In both instances the
                                  example would have been less telling if He had
                                  taken His bodily nature from another source
                                  than that from which the rest of men receive
                                  theirs. Otherwise, if we tried to persuade a
                                  man that he should endure sufferings as Christ
                                  endured them, and that he should hope to rise
                                  as Christ rose, he could allege as an excuse
                                  the different condition of his body.
                                  Therefore, to give greater effectiveness to
                                  His example, Christ ought to have assumed His
                                  bodily nature from no other source than from
                                  the nature that comes down from the first
                                  parent.

                          Nevertheless the body of Christ could not becomingly
                          have been fashioned in human nature in the same way as
                          the bodies of other men are formed. Since He assumed
                          this nature for the purpose of cleansing it from sin,
                          He ought to have assumed it in such a way that He
                          would incur no contagion of sin. Men incur original
                          sin by the fact that they are begotten through the
                          active human power residing in the male seed; which
                          implies pre-existence, according to seminal principle,
                          in Adam the sinner. just as the first man would have
                          transmitted original justice to his posterity along
                          with the transmission of nature, so he actually
                          transmitted original sin by transmitting nature; and
                          this is brought about by the active power of the male
                          seed. Hence the body of Christ ought to have been
                          formed without male seed.

                              operates naturally, and so man, who is begotten of
                              male seed, is brought to perfection, not at once,
                              but by definite processes. For all natural things
                              advance to fixed ends through fixed intermediary
                              stages. But Christ’s body ought to have been
                              perfect and informed by a rational soul at its
                              very assumption; for a body is capable of being
                              assumed by the Word of God so far as it is united
                              to a rational soul, even though it was not at
                              first perfect with regard to its full measure of
                              quantity. Accordingly the body of Christ ought not
                              to have been formed through the power of the male
                              seed.

                          Since the formation of the human body is naturally
                          effected by the male seed, any other way of fashioning
                          the body of Christ was above nature. God alone is the
                          author of nature, and He works supernaturally in
                          natural things, as was remarked above. Hence we
                          conclude that God alone miraculously formed that body
                          from matter supplied by human nature. However,
                          although every action of God in creation is common to
                          the three divine persons, the formation of Christ’s
                          body is, by a certain appropriation, attributed to the
                          Holy Spirit. For the Holy Spirit is the love of the
                          Father and the Son, who love each other and us in Him.
                          Since God decreed that His Son should become incarnate
                          because of “His exceeding charity with which He loved
                          us,” as the Apostle says in Ephesians 2:4, the
                          formation of Christ’s flesh is fittingly ascribed to
                          the Holy Spirit.

                              into the unity of a divine person was a
                              communication of superabundant grace, as is clear
                              from what was said above. Accordingly, to
                              emphasize the greatness of this grace, the
                              formation of Christ’s body is attributed to the
                              Holy Spirit.

                                  Another reason for the appropriateness of this
                                  teaching is the relationship between the human
                                  word and spirit. The human word, as existing
                                  in the heart, bears a resemblance to the
                                  eternal Word as existing in the Father. And as
                                  the human word takes voice that it may become
                                  sensibly perceptible to men, so the Word of
                                  God took flesh that it might appear visibly to
                                  men. But the human voice is formed by man’s
                                  breath or spirit. In the same way the flesh of
                                  the Word of God ought to have been formed by
                                  the Spirit of the Word.

                          To exclude the error of Ebion and Cerinthus, who
                          taught that Christ’s body was formed from male seed,
                          the Apostles’ Creed states: “Who was conceived by the
                          Holy Spirit.” In place of this, the Creed of the
                          Nicene Fathers has: “He was made flesh by the Holy
                          Spirit,” so that we may believe that He assumed true
                          flesh and not a phantastic body, as the Manichaeans
                          claimed. And the Creed of the Fathers adds: “For us
                          men,” to exclude the error of Origen, who alleged that
                          by the power of Christ’s passion even the devils were
                          to be set free. In the same Creed the phrase, “for our
                          salvation,” is appended, to show that the mystery of
                          Christ’s incarnation suffices for men’s salvation,
                          against the heresy of the Nazarenes, who thought that
                          faith was not enough for human salvation apart from
                          the works of the Law. The words, “He came down from
                          heaven” were added to exclude the error of Photinus,
                          who asserted that Christ was no more than a man and
                          that He took His origin from Mary. In this heresy the
                          false teaching that Christ had an earthly beginning
                          and later ascended to heaven by the merit of a good
                          life, replaces the truth that He had a heavenly origin
                          and descended to earth by assuming flesh. Lastly, the
                          words, “And He was made man,” were added to exclude
                          the error of Nestorius, according to whose contention
                          the Son of God, of whom the Creed speaks, would be
                          said rather to dwell in man than to be man.

                          in humana generatione ministrat femina, conveniens
                          fuit ut Christus de femina carnem assumeret, secundum
                          illud apostoli ad Galat. IV, 4: misit Deus filium suum
                          factum ex muliere. Femina autem indiget viri
                          commixtione, ad hoc quod materia quam ipsa ministrat,
                          formetur in corpus humanum. Formatio autem corporis
                          Christi fieri non debuit per virtutem virilis seminis,
                          ut supra iam dictum est. Unde absque commixtione
                          virilis seminis illa femina concepit ex qua filius Dei
                          carnem assumpsit. Tanto autem aliquis magis
                          spiritualibus donis repletur, quanto magis a
                          carnalibus separatur. Nam per spiritualia homo sursum
                          trahitur, per carnalia vero deorsum. Cum autem
                          formatio corporis Christi fieri debuerit per spiritum
                          sanctum, oportuit illam feminam de qua Christus corpus
                          assumpsit maxime spiritualibus donis repleri, ut per
                          spiritum sanctum non solum anima fecundaretur
                          virtutibus, sed etiam venter prole divina. Unde
                          oportuit non solum mentem eius esse immunem a peccato,

                          concupiscentiae elongari. Unde non solum ad
                          concipiendum Christum virilem commixtionem non est
                          experta, sed nec ante nec postea.

                          Since, as we have shown, the Son of God was to take
                          flesh from matter supplied by human nature, and since
                          in human generation the woman provides matter, Christ
                          appropriately took flesh from a woman. This is taught
                          by the Apostle in Galatians 4:4: “God sent His Son,
                          made of a woman.” A woman needs the cooperation of a
                          man in order that the matter she supplies may be
                          fashioned into a human body. But the formation of
                          Christ’s body ought not to have been effected through
                          the power of the male seed, as we said above. Hence
                          that woman from whom the Son of God assumed flesh
                          conceived without the admixture of male seed. Now the
                          more anyone is detached from the things of the flesh,
                          the more such a person is filled with spiritual gifts.
                          For man is raised up by spiritual goods, whereas he is
                          dragged down by carnal attractions. Accordingly, since
                          the formation of Christ’s body was to be accomplished
                          by the Holy Spirit, it behooved that woman from whom
                          Christ took His body to be filled to repletion with
                          spiritual gifts, so that not only her soul would be
                          endowed with virtues by the Holy Spirit, but also her
                          womb would be made fruitful with divine offspring.
                          Therefore her soul had to be free from sin, and her
                          body had to be far removed from every taint of carnal
                          concupiscence. And so she had no association with a
                          man at the conception of Christ; nor did she ever have
                          such experience, either before or after.

                              This was also due to Him who was born of her. The
                              Son of God assumed flesh and came into the world
                              for the purpose of raising us to the state of
                              resurrection, in which men “shall neither marry
                              nor be married, but shall be as the angels of God
                              in heaven” (Matt. 22:30). This is why He
                              inculcated the doctrine of continence and of
                              virginal integrity, that an image of the glory
                              that is to come might, in some degree, shine forth
                              in the lives of the faithful. Consequently He did
                              well to extol purity of life at His very birth, by
                              being born of a virgin; and so the Apostles’ Creed
                              says that He was “born of the Virgin Mary.” In the
                              Creed of the Fathers He is said to have been made
                              flesh of the Virgin Mary. This excludes the error
                              of Valentinus and others, who taught that the body
                              of Christ was either phantastic or was of another
                              nature and was not taken and formed from the body
                              of the Virgin.

                          Error autem Nestorii ex hoc excluditur, qui beatam
                          Mariam matrem Dei confiteri nolebat. In utroque autem

                          nascitur, mater illius dicitur ex eo quod materiam
                          ministrat humano conceptui. Unde beata virgo Maria,

                          mater filii Dei dicenda est. Non enim refert ad
                          rationem matris, quacumque virtute materia ministrata

                          seminis. Si quis autem dicere velit, beatam virginem
                          Dei matrem non debere dici, quia non est ex ea
                          assumpta divinitas, sed caro sola, sicut dicebat
                          Nestorius, manifeste vocem suam ignorat. Non enim ex

                          animam, quam id quod est secundum corpus. Anima autem
                          nullius hominis a matre sumitur, sed vel a Deo

                          The error of Nestorius, who refused to acknowledge
                          that Blessed Mary is the Mother of God, is likewise
                          excluded. Both Creeds assert that the Son of God was
                          born or was made flesh of the Virgin Mary. The woman
                          of whom any person is born is called his mother, for
                          the reason that she supplies the matter for human
                          conception. Hence the Blessed Virgin Mary, who
                          provided the matter for the conception of the Son of
                          God, should be called the true mother of the Son of
                          God. As far as the essence of motherhood is concerned,
                          the energy whereby the matter furnished by a woman is
                          formed, does not enter into the question. She who
                          supplied matter to be formed by the Holy Spirit is no
                          less a mother than a woman who supplies matter that is
                          to be formed by the energy latent in male seed. If
                          anyone insists on maintaining that the Blessed Virgin
                          ought not to be called the Mother of God because flesh
                          alone and not divinity was derived from her, as
                          Nestorius contended, he clearly is not aware of what
                          he is saying. A woman is not called a mother for the
                          reason that everything that is in her child is derived
                          from her. Man is made up of body and soul; and a man
                          is what he is in virtue of his soul rather than in
                          virtue of his body. But no man’s soul is derived from
                          his mother. The soul is either created by God
                          directly, as the true doctrine has it, or, if it were
                          produced by transplanting, as some have fancied, it
                          would be derived from the father rather than from the
                          mother. For in the generation of other animals,
                          according to the teaching of philosophers, the male
                          gives the soul, the female gives the body.

                              Consequently, just as any woman is a mother from
                              the fact that her child’s body is derived from
                              her, so the Blessed Virgin Mary ought to be called
                              the Mother of God if the body of God is derived
                              from her. But we have to hold that it is the body
                              of God, if it is taken up into the unity of the
                              person of God’s Son, who is true God. Therefore
                              all who admit that human nature was assumed by the
                              Son of God into the unity of His person, must

                              of God. But Nestorius, who denied that the person
                              of God and of the man Jesus Christ was one, was
                              forced by logical necessity to deny that the
                              Virgin Mary was the Mother of God.

                              invenitur totum quod pertinet ad matris rationem.
                              Materiam enim ministravit Christi conceptui
                              spiritu sancto formandam, ut requirit matris
                              ratio. Sed ex parte spiritus sancti non invenitur

                              connaturalem producat. Unde si fuerit aliquod

                              magis ab ipso procedens; secundum autem naturam
                              humanam non est Christo connaturalis: est enim
                              alia natura humana et divina in Christo, ut supra
                              dictum est. Neque in naturam humanam est versum
                              aliquid de natura divina, ut supra dictum est.
                              Relinquitur ergo quod spiritus sanctus pater
                              hominis Christi dici non possit.

                            <td>
                              The first reason for this is that everything
                              pertaining to the idea of mother is verified in
                              the Blessed Virgin Mary. She furnished the matter
                              to be formed by the Holy Spirit for the conception
                              of Christ, as the idea of motherhood requires. But
                              not all the elements required for the idea of
                              fatherhood are found on the part of the Holy
                              Spirit. The idea of fatherhood requires that the
                              father produce from his nature a son who is of
                              like nature with himself. Therefore if some agent
                              would make a thing that is not derived from its
                              own substance, and would not produce such a thing
                              unto the likeness of its own nature, that agent
                              could not be called the thing’s father. We do not
                              say that a man is the father of things he makes by
                              plying an art, unless perhaps in a metaphorical
                              sense. The Holy Spirit is, indeed, connatural with
                              Christ as regards the divine nature; in this
                              respect, however, He is not the father of Christ,
                              but rather proceeds from Him. With respect to the
                              human nature, the Holy Spirit is not connatural
                              with Christ. For the human nature in Christ is
                              other than the divine nature, as we said above.
                              Nor is anything of the divine nature changed into
                              human nature, as we also said above. Consequently
                              the Holy Spirit cannot be called the father of the
                              man Christ.

                                  seminis dispositive operatur ad formam. Id
                                  autem quod principalius est in Christo, est
                                  persona verbi, quae nullo modo est a spiritu
                                  sancto. Relinquitur ergo quod spiritus sanctus
                                  pater Christi dici non possit.

                                  Moreover, that which is of greater moment in
                                  any son comes from his father, and what is
                                  secondary comes from his mother. Thus in other
                                  animals the soul is from the father, and the
                                  body from the mother. In man, of course, the
                                  rational soul does not come from the father,
                                  but is created by God; yet the power of the
                                  paternal seed operates dispositively toward
                                  the form. But that which is the greater in
                                  Christ, is the person of the Word, who is in
                                  no way derived from the Holy Spirit. We
                                  conclude, therefore, that the Holy Spirit
                                  cannot be called the father of Christ.

                          Christum, cum dicatur I Ioan. I, 8: si dixerimus

                          veritas in nobis non est. Sed de beata virgine matre

                          As appears from the foregoing exposition, the Blessed
                          Virgin Mary became the mother of God’s Son by
                          conceiving of the Holy Spirit. Therefore it was
                          fitting that she should be adorned with the highest
                          degree of purity, that she might be made conformable
                          to such a Son. And so we are to believe that she was
                          free from every stain of actual sin—not only of mortal
                          sin but of venial sin. Such freedom from sin can
                          pertain to none of the saints after Christ, as we know
                          from 1 John 1:8: “If we say that we have no sin we
                          deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.” But
                          what is said in the Canticle of Canticles 4:7, “You
                          are all fair, my love, and there is no spot in you,”
                          can well be understood of the Blessed Virgin, Mother
                          of God.

                              Oportuit siquidem quod cum peccato originali

                              sibi soli servabatur ut virgo conciperet filium

                              hominum redemptor, quod derogat dignitati Christi.
                              Est ergo tenendum, quod cum peccato originali
                              concepta fuit, sed ab eo quodam speciali modo
                              purgata fuit.

                              Mary was not only free from actual sin, but she
                              was also, by a special privilege, cleansed from
                              original sin. She had, indeed, to be conceived
                              with original sin, inasmuch as her conception
                              resulted from the commingling of both sexes. For
                              the privilege of conceiving without impairment of
                              virginity was reserved exclusively to her who as a
                              virgin conceived the Son of God. But the
                              commingling of the sexes which, after the sin of
                              our first parent, cannot take place without lust,
                              transmits original sin to the offspring. Likewise,
                              if Mary had been conceived without original sin,
                              she would not have had to be redeemed by Christ,
                              and so Christ would not be the universal redeemer
                              of men, which detracts from His dignity.
                              Accordingly we must hold that she was conceived
                              with original sin, but was cleansed from it in
                              some special way.

                                  Some men are cleansed from original sin after
                                  their birth from the womb, as is the case with
                                  those who are sanctified in baptism. Others
                                  are reported to have been sanctified in the
                                  wombs of their mothers, in virtue of an
                                  extraordinary privilege of grace. Thus we are
                                  told with regard to Jeremiah: “Before I formed
                                  you in the womb of you mother I knew you; and
                                  before you came forth out of the womb I
                                  sanctified you” (Jer. 1:5). And in Luke 1:15
                                  the angel says of John the Baptist: “He shall
                                  be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his
                                  mother’s womb.” We cannot suppose that the
                                  favor granted to the precursor of Christ and
                                  to the prophet was denied to Christ’s own
                                  mother. Therefore we believe that she was
                                  sanctified in her mother’s womb, that is,
                                  before she was born.

                                      creatura rationalis. Similiter etiam
                                      gratia sanctificationis per prius in anima
                                      radicatur, nec ad corpus potest pervenire

                                      animae credendum est eam sanctificatam
                                      fuisse. Eius autem sanctificatio amplior

                                      venialiter.

                                      Yet such sanctification did not precede
                                      the infusion of her soul. In that case she
                                      would never have been subject to original
                                      sin, and so would have had no need of
                                      redemption. For only a rational creature
                                      can be the subject of sin. Furthermore,
                                      the grace of sanctification is rooted
                                      primarily in the soul, and cannot extend
                                      to the body except through the soul. Hence
                                      we must believe that Mary was sanctified
                                      after the infusion of her soul.

                                          But her sanctification was more ample
                                          than that of others who were
                                          sanctified in the wombs of their
                                          mothers. Others thus sanctified in the
                                          womb were, it is true, cleansed from
                                          original sin; but the grace of being
                                          unable to sin later on, even venially,
                                          was not granted to them. The Blessed
                                          Virgin Mary, however, was sanctified
                                          with such a wealth of grace that
                                          thenceforth she was preserved free
                                          from all sin, and not only from mortal
                                          sin, but also from venial sin.
                                          Moreover venial sin sometimes creeps
                                          up on us unawares, owing to the fact
                                          that an inordinate motion of
                                          concupiscence or of some other passion
                                          arises prior to the advertence of the
                                          mind, yet in such a way that the first
                                          motions are called sins. Hence we
                                          conclude that the Blessed Virgin Mary
                                          never committed a venial sin, for she
                                          did not experience such inordinate
                                          motions of passion. Inordinate motions
                                          of this kind arise because the
                                          sensitive appetite, which is the
                                          subject of these passions, is not so
                                          obedient to reason as not sometimes to
                                          move toward an object outside the
                                          order of reason, or even,
                                          occasionally, against reason; and this
                                          is what engenders the sinful impulse.
                                          In the Blessed Virgin, accordingly,
                                          the sensitive appetite was rendered so
                                          subject to reason by the power of the
                                          grace which sanctified it, that it was
                                          never aroused against reason, but was
                                          always in conformity with the order of
                                          reason. Nevertheless she could
                                          experience some spontaneous movements
                                          not ordered by reason.

                                              In our Lord Jesus Christ there was
                                              something more. In Him the lower
                                              appetite was so perfectly subject
                                              to reason that it did not move in

                                              its own accord. So far as we can
                                              judge, a characteristic pertaining
                                              to the integrity of the original
                                              state was the complete subjection
                                              of the lower powers to reason.
                                              This subjection was destroyed by
                                              the sin of our first parent, not
                                              only in himself, but in all the

                                              from him. In all of these the
                                              rebellion or disobedience of the
                                              lower powers to reason, which is

                                                  Blessed Virgin was sanctified
                                                  concupiscence remained in her
                                                  according to its substance,
                                                  but that it was shackled.

                          error est Helvidii, qui etiamsi asserat Christum ex
                          virgine conceptum et natum, dixit tamen eam postmodum

                          If Mary was thus strengthened against every movement
                          of sin by her first sanctification, much more did
                          grace grow in her and much more was concupiscence
                          weakened or even completely uprooted in her, when the
                          Holy Spirit came upon her, according to the angel’s
                          word, to form of her the body of Christ. After she had
                          been made the shrine of the Holy Spirit and the
                          tabernacle of the Son of God, we may not believe that
                          there was ever any inclination to sin in her, or that
                          she ever experienced any pleasurable feeling of carnal
                          concupiscence. And so we must view with revulsion the
                          error of Helvidius who, while admitting that Christ
                          was conceived and born of the Virgin, asserted that
                          she later bore other sons to Joseph.

                              inimicos tuos scabellum pedum tuorum. Dubium enim

                              cognoverit. Unde hoc Evangelista removere curavit,
                              quasi indubitabile relinquens quia post partum non
                              fuit cognita.

                              Certainly this error finds no support in Matthew’s
                              statement that Joseph “knew her not” namely, Mary,
                              “till she brought forth her first-born Son” (Matt.
                              1:25); as though he knew her after she gave birth
                              to Christ. The word “till” in this text does not
                              signify definite time but indicates indeterminate
                              time. Sacred Scripture frequently asserts with
                              emphasis that something was done or not done up to
                              a certain time, as long as the issue could remain
                              in doubt. Thus we read in Psalm 109:1: “Sit at my
                              right hand until I make your enemies your
                              footstool.” There could be some doubt whether
                              Christ would sit at the right hand of God as long
                              as His enemies did not seem to be subject to Him;
                              but once we know that they are, no room for doubt
                              could remain. Similarly there could be some doubt
                              as to whether Joseph knew Mary before the birth of
                              God’s Son. The Evangelist took pains to remove
                              this doubt, thus giving us to understand beyond
                              all question that she was not known after giving
                              birth.

                                  first-born give any support to the error, as
                                  though she bore other sons after Him. For in
                                  scriptural usage the son before whom no other
                                  is born is called the first-born, even though
                                  no other should follow him. This is clear from
                                  the case of the first-born sons who according
                                  to the Law were consecrated to the Lord and
                                  offered to the priests.

                                      Again, the error of Helvidius receives no
                                      support from the Gospel narrative that
                                      certain individuals are called the
                                      brethren of Christ, as though His mother
                                      had other sons. Scripture is accustomed to
                                      apply the name brethren to all who belong
                                      to the same relationship. For example,
                                      Abraham called Lot his brother, although
                                      Lot was his nephew. In the same way Mary’s
                                      nephews and other relatives are called
                                      Christ’s brethren, as also are the
                                      relatives of Joseph, who was reputed to be
                                      the father of Christ.

                                          birth, is clear from what has been
                                          said. More than that: her virginity
                                          was not violated even in the act of
                                          giving birth. Christ’s body, which
                                          appeared to the disciples when the
                                          doors were closed, could by the same
                                          power come forth from the closed womb
                                          of His mother. It was not seemly that
                                          He, who was born for the purpose of
                                          restoring what was corrupt to its
                                          pristine integrity, should destroy
                                          integrity in being born.

                          In assuming human nature for the salvation of man, the
                          Son of God appropriately showed in the nature He
                          assumed, by the perfection of its grace and wisdom,
                          what was to be the goal of human salvation. No less
                          appropriately was the human nature assumed by the Word
                          of God characterized by certain conditions befitting
                          the most suitable way of redeeming the human race. The
                          most suitable way was that man, who had perished
                          through his iniquity, should be restored by satisfying
                          justice. But the order of justice requires that the
                          one who has become liable to some punishment by
                          sinning, should be freed by paying the penalty. Since,
                          however, what we do or suffer through our friends, we
                          ourselves are considered in some fashion to do or to
                          suffer, inasmuch as love is a mutual force that in a
                          way makes two lovers one, the order of justice is not
                          violated if a person is set free by the satisfaction
                          his friend offers for him.

                              By the sin of the first parent ruin had come upon
                              the entire human race. No punishment undergone by
                              any man could suffice to liberate the whole human
                              race. No worthy satisfaction was available; no
                              satisfaction offered by any mere man was great
                              enough in value to free all men. Similarly,
                              justice would not be fully met if even an angel,
                              out of love for the human race, were to offer
                              satisfaction for it. An angel does not possess
                              infinite dignity, and hence any satisfaction he
                              offered would not be capable of sufficing for
                              indefinitely many people and their sins. God alone
                              is of infinite dignity, and so He alone, in the
                              flesh assumed by Him, could adequately satisfy for
                              man, as has already been noted. Therefore it
                              behooved Him to assume a human nature so
                              constituted that in it He could suffer for man
                              what man himself deserved to suffer on account of
                              his sin, and thus offer satisfaction on man’s
                              behalf.

                                  Provenit enim peccatum hominis ex hoc quod a

                                  However, not every punishment incurred for sin
                                  is suitable for making satisfaction. Man’s sin
                                  comes from the fact that in turning to
                                  transient goods he turns away from God. And
                                  man is punished for sin on both counts. He is
                                  deprived of grace and the other gifts by which
                                  union with God is effected, and besides this
                                  he deserves to suffer chastisement and loss
                                  with respect to the object for whose sake he
                                  turned away from God. Therefore the order of
                                  satisfaction requires that the sinner should
                                  be led back to God by punishments that are to
                                  be endured in transient goods.

                                      the fact that his soul is in a state of
                                      disorder, even though such afflictions are
                                      punishment for sin; man can satisfy only
                                      by enduring some pain in himself and by
                                      undergoing loss in external goods.

                                          man from God, such as privation of
                                          grace, ignorance, and the like,
                                          although they are punishment for sin.
                                          Defects of this kind would but render
                                          Him less apt for offering
                                          satisfaction. Indeed, to be the author
                                          of man’s salvation, He had to possess
                                          fullness of grace and wisdom, as we
                                          pointed out above. Yet, since man by
                                          sinning was placed under the necessity
                                          of dying and of being subjected to
                                          suffering in body and soul, Christ
                                          wished to assume the same kind of
                                          defects, so that by undergoing death
                                          for men He might redeem the human
                                          race.

                                              Defects of this kind, we should
                                              note, are common to Christ and to
                                              us. Nevertheless they are found in
                                              Christ otherwise than in us. For,
                                              as we have remarked, such defects
                                              are the punishment of the first
                                              sin. Since we contract original
                                              sin through our vitiated origin,
                                              we are in consequence said to have
                                              contracted these defects. But
                                              Christ did not contract any stain
                                              in virtue of His origin. He
                                              accepted the defects in question
                                              of His own free will. Hence we
                                              should not say that He contracted
                                              these defects, but rather that He
                                              assumed them; for that is
                                              contracted (<i>contrahitur</i>)
                                              which is necessarily drawn along
                                              with (<i>cum trahitur</i>) some
                                              other thing. Christ could have
                                              assumed human nature without such
                                              defects, just as He actually did
                                              assume it without the defilement
                                              of sin; and indeed the order of
                                              reason would seem to demand that
                                              He who was free from sin should
                                              also be free from punishment. Thus
                                              it is clear that defects of this
                                              sort were not in Him by any
                                              necessity either of vitiated
                                              origin or of justice. Therefore in
                                              Him they were not contracted but
                                              were voluntarily assumed.

                                                  Apostle says in Romans 8:3:
                                                  “God, sending His own Son in
                                                  the likeness of sinful flesh.”

                                                  passibility or suffering is
                                                  called sin by the Apostle,
                                                  when he adds that God “hath
                                                  condemned sin in the flesh,”
                                                  and observes in Romans 6:10:
                                                  “In that He died to sin, He
                                                  died once.” For the same
                                                  reason the Apostle uses an

                                                  saying that Christ was “made a
                                                  curse for us.” This is also
                                                  why Christ is said to have
                                                  assumed one of our
                                                  obligations, that of
                                                  punishment, in order to
                                                  relieve us of our double
                                                  burden, namely, sin and

                                                      bodies are of two kinds.
                                                      Some are common to all
                                                      men, such as hunger,
                                                      thirst, weariness after
                                                      labor, pain, death, and
                                                      the like. Others, however,
                                                      are not common to all, but
                                                      are peculiar to certain
                                                      individuals, such as
                                                      blindness, leprosy, fever,
                                                      mutilation of the members,
                                                      and similar ills. The
                                                      difference between these
                                                      defects is this: common
                                                      defects are passed on to
                                                      us from another, namely,
                                                      our first parent, who
                                                      incurred them through sin,
                                                      but personal defects are
                                                      produced in individual men
                                                      by particular causes. But
                                                      Christ had no cause of
                                                      defect in Himself, either
                                                      in His soul, which was
                                                      full of grace and wisdom
                                                      and was united to the Word

                                                      which was excellently
                                                      organized and disposed,
                                                      having been fashioned by
                                                      the omnipotent power of
                                                      the Holy Spirit. On the
                                                      contrary, He took upon
                                                      Himself certain defects by
                                                      the free decision of His
                                                      own will, with a view to
                                                      procuring our salvation.

                                                          human nature, He

                                                          open to slander. If

                          Manifestum igitur est secundum praedicta, quod
                          Christus aliquos defectus nostros suscepit non ex
                          necessitate, sed propter aliquem finem, scilicet
                          propter salutem nostram. Omnis autem potentia et
                          habitus sive habilitas ordinatur ad actum sicut ad
                          finem: unde passibilitas ad satisfaciendum vel
                          merendum non sufficit sine passione in actu. Non enim
                          aliquis dicitur bonus vel malus ex eo quod potest
                          talia agere, sed ex eo quod agit, nec laus et
                          vituperium debentur potentiae, sed actui. Unde et
                          Christus non solum passibilitatem nostram suscepit ut
                          nos salvaret, sed etiam ut pro peccatis nostris
                          satisfaceret, voluit pati. Passus est autem pro nobis
                          ea quae ut nos pateremur ex peccato primi parentis
                          meruimus, quorum praecipuum est mors, ad quam omnes
                          aliae passiones humanae ordinantur sicut ad ultimum.
                          Stipendia enim peccati mors est, ut apostolus dicit ad
                          Rom. VI, 23.

                          Evidently, therefore, as we see from this discussion,
                          Christ took some of our defects on Himself, not out of
                          necessity, but for a definite purpose, namely, for our
                          salvation. But every potency and every habit or
                          capacity are ordained toward act as their end. Hence
                          capacity to suffer is not enough for satisfaction or
                          merit apart from actual suffering. A person is called
                          good or evil, not because he is able to perform good
                          or evil actions, but because he performs them; praise
                          and blame are duly rendered not for power to act but
                          for acting. To save us, consequently, Christ was not
                          content merely to make our passibility His portion,
                          but He willed actually to suffer that He might satisfy
                          for our sins. He endured for us those sufferings which
                          we deserved to suffer in consequence of the sin of our
                          first parent. Of these the chief is death, to which
                          all other human sufferings are ordered as to their
                          final term. “For the wages of sin is death,” as the
                          Apostle says in Romans 6:23.

                              illud I Petri III, 18: Christus semel pro peccatis
                              nostris mortuus est, iustus pro iniustis, ut nos
                              offerret Deo, mortificatos quidem carne,

                              Accordingly Christ willed to submit to death for
                              our sins so that, in taking on Himself without any
                              fault of His own the punishment charged against
                              us, He might free us from the death to which we
                              had been sentenced, in the way that anyone would
                              be freed from a debt of penalty if another person
                              undertook to pay the penalty for him. Another
                              reason why He wished to die was that His death
                              might be for us not only a remedy of satisfaction
                              but also a sacrament of salvation, so that we,
                              transferred to a spiritual life, might die to our
                              carnal life, in the likeness of His death. This is
                              in accord with 1 Peter 3:18: “Christ also died
                              once for our sins, the just for the unjust, that
                              He might offer us to God, being put to death in
                              deed in the flesh, but enlivened in the spirit.”

                                  be an example of perfect virtue for us. He
                                  gave an example of charity, for “greater love
                                  than this no man hath, that a man lay down his
                                  life for his friends” (John 15:13). The more
                                  numerous and grievous are the sufferings a
                                  person does not refuse to bear for his friend,
                                  the more strikingly his love is shown forth.
                                  But of all human ills the most grievous is
                                  death, by which human life is snuffed out.
                                  Hence no greater proof of love is possible
                                  than that a man should expose himself to death
                                  for a friend.

                                      By His death Christ also gave an example
                                      of fortitude, which does not abandon
                                      justice in the face of adversity; refusal
                                      to give up the practice of virtue even
                                      under fear of death seems to pertain most
                                      emphatically to fortitude. Thus the
                                      Apostle says in Hebrews 2:14 ff., with
                                      reference to Christ’s passion: “That
                                      through death He might destroy him who had
                                      the empire of death, that is to say, the
                                      devil, and might deliver them who through
                                      the fear of death were all their lifetime
                                      subject to servitude.” In not refusing to
                                      die for truth, Christ overcame the fear of
                                      dying, which is the reason men for the
                                      most part are subject to the slavery of
                                      sin.

                                          Further, He gave an example of
                                          patience, a virtue that prevents
                                          sorrow from overwhelming man in time

                                          the more splendidly does the virtue of
                                          patience shine forth in them.

                          remedium satisfactionis: convenienter enim homo
                          punitur per ea in quibus peccavit. Per quae enim

                          sapientiae XI, 17. Peccatum autem hominis primum fuit
                          per hoc quod pomum arboris ligni scientiae boni et

                          The same reasons reveal why Christ willed to suffer
                          the death of the cross. In the first place, such a
                          death was suitable as a salutary means of
                          satisfaction. Man is fittingly punished in the things
                          wherein he has sinned, as is said in Wisdom 1:17: “The
                          things by which a man sins, by the same also he is
                          tormented. But the first sin of man was the fact that
                          he ate the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and
                          evil, contrary to God’s command. In his stead Christ
                          permitted Himself to be fastened to a tree, so that He
                          might pay for what He did not carry off, as the
                          Psalmist says of Him in Psalm 58:5.

                              Convenit etiam quantum ad sacramentum. Voluit enim
                              Christus ostendere sua morte, ut sic moreremur
                              vita carnali quod spiritus noster in superna
                              elevaretur, unde et ipse dicit Ioan. XII, 32: ego
                              si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia traham ad
                              meipsum.

                              Death on the cross was also appropriate as a
                              sacrament. Christ wished to make clear by His
                              death that we ought so to die in our carnal life
                              that our spirit might be raised to higher things.
                              Hence He Himself says, in John 12:32: “I, if I be
                              lifted up from the earth, will draw all things to
                              Myself.”

                                  virtutis etiam aliquis vituperabilem mortem
                                  non refugiat pati. Unde apostolus ad

                                  This kind of death was likewise fitting as an
                                  example of perfect virtue. Sometimes men
                                  shrink no less from a disgraceful kind of
                                  death than from the painfulness of death.
                                  Accordingly, the perfection of virtue seems to
                                  require that a person ‘should not refuse to
                                  suffer even a disgraceful death for the good
                                  of virtue. Therefore, to commend the perfect
                                  obedience of Christ, the Apostle, after saying
                                  of Him that He was “obedient unto death,”
                                  added: “even to the death of the cross” (Phil.
                                  2:8). This sort of death was looked on as the
                                  most ignominious of all, in the words of
                                  Wisdom 2:20: “Let us condemn him to a most
                                  shameful death.”

                          the divinity of the Word, are joined together in one

                          united to form one nature. Accordingly at the death of
                          Christ the union between body and soul was dissolved.
                          Otherwise the body would not have been truly dead,
                          since death of the body is nothing else than the
                          separation of the soul from it.

                              But neither soul nor body was separated from the
                              Word of God, as far as union with the person is
                              concerned. Human nature results from the union of
                              soul and body; hence Christ could not be said to
                              be a man during the three days of His death, when
                              His soul remained separated from His body by
                              death. However, as was shown above, on account of
                              the union of the human nature with the Word of God
                              in one person, whatever is said of the man Christ
                              can rightly be predicated also of the Son of God.
                              Consequently, since the personal union of the Son
                              of God both with the soul and with the body of
                              Christ remained in death, whatever is said of
                              either of them could be predicated of the Son of
                              God. Hence the Creed asserts that the Son of God
                              was buried, for the reason that the body united to
                              Him lay in the tomb, and likewise that He
                              descended into hell, because His soul descended.

                                  We should also recall that the masculine
                                  gender designates a person, and that the
                                  neuter gender designates nature. Thus in
                                  speaking of the Trinity we say that the Son is
                                  another person (<i>alius</i>) than the Father,
                                  but not that He is another thing
                                  (<i>aliud</i>). Accordingly, during the three
                                  days of His death the whole (<i>totus</i>)
                                  Christ was in the sepulcher and in hell and in
                                  heaven, because of His person which remained
                                  united to His flesh reposing in the tomb and
                                  to His soul which was emptying hell, and which
                                  continued to subsist in the divine nature
                                  reigning in heaven. But we cannot say that the
                                  whole (<i>totum</i>) of Christ was in the
                                  sepulcher or in hell, because only a part of
                                  the human nature and not the whole of it was
                                  in the sepulcher or in hell.

                          Christ’s death was like our death as regards the
                          essence of death, which consists in the separation of
                          the soul from the body. But in another respect the
                          death of Christ was different from ours. We die for
                          the reason that we are subject to death by a necessary
                          law of nature, or in consequence of some violence done
                          to us. But Christ did not die because of any
                          necessity. He gave up His life by His power and His
                          own will, as He Himself attested: “I have power to lay
                          it [My life] down, and I have power to take it up
                          again” (John 10:18).

                              oportet hoc ex virtute alicuius agentis provenire.
                              Quidquid autem in Christo secundum humanam naturam
                              erat naturale, totum eius voluntati subiacebat

                              joining of the soul to the body is physical. Hence

                              subject to our will, but must be brought about by
                              the power of some agent. But whatever was physical
                              in Christ as regards His human nature, was
                              completely subject to His will, because of the
                              power of His divinity, to which all nature is
                              subject. Therefore Christ had it in His power that
                              so long as He willed, His soul would remain united
                              to His body, and that the instant He willed, the
                              soul would depart from the body. The centurion
                              standing near the cross of Christ felt the
                              presence of this divine power when he saw Him
                              expire with a loud cry. By this Christ clearly
                              showed that He was not dying like other men, from
                              the breaking down of nature. For men cannot send
                              forth their last breath with a loud cry; in the
                              moment of death they can scarcely move their
                              tongue in a quavering whisper. Hence the fact that
                              Christ died uttering a loud cry gave evidence of
                              the divine power in Him. It was for this reason
                              that the centurion said: “Indeed, this was the Son
                              of God” (Matt. 27:54).

                                  Yet we may not aver that the Jews did not kill
                                  Christ, or that Christ took His own life. For
                                  the one who brings the cause of death to bear
                                  on a person is said to kill him. But death
                                  does not ensue unless the cause of death
                                  prevails over nature, which conserves life.
                                  Christ had it in His power either to submit
                                  His nature to the destructive cause or to
                                  resist that influence, just as He willed. Thus
                                  Christ died voluntarily, and yet the Jews
                                  killed Him.

                          Non solum autem Christus mortem pati voluit, sed et
                          alia quae ex peccato primi parentis in posteros
                          proveniunt, ut dum poenam peccati integraliter
                          susciperet, nos perfecte a peccato satisfaciendo
                          liberaret. Horum autem quaedam praecedunt mortem,
                          quaedam mortem subsequuntur. Praecedunt quidem mortem
                          corporis passiones tam naturales, ut fames, sitis,
                          lassitudo et huiusmodi, quam etiam violentae, ut
                          vulneratio, flagellatio et similia: quae omnia
                          Christus pati voluit tanquam provenientia ex peccato.
                          Si enim homo non peccasset, nec famis aut sitis aut
                          lassitudinis vel frigoris afflictionem sensisset, nec
                          ab exterioribus pertulisset violentam passionem. Has
                          tamen passiones alia ratione Christus pertulit quam
                          alii homines patiantur. In aliis enim hominibus non
                          est aliquid quod iis passionibus repugnare possit. In
                          Christo autem erat unde iis passionibus resisteretur,
                          non solum virtus divina increata, sed etiam animae
                          beatitudo, cuius tanta vis est, ut Augustinus dicit,
                          ut eius beatitudo suo modo redundet in corpus: unde
                          post resurrectionem ex hoc ipso quod anima glorificata
                          erit per visionem Dei, et apertam et plenam
                          fruitionem, corpus gloriosae animae unitum gloriosum
                          reddetur, impassibile et immortale. Cum igitur anima
                          Christi perfecta visione Dei frueretur, quantum est ex
                          virtute huius visionis, consequens erat ut corpus
                          impassibile et immortale redderetur per redundantiam
                          gloriae ab anima in corpus; sed dispensative factum
                          est ut anima Dei visione fruente simul corpus
                          pateretur, nulla redundantia gloriae ab anima in
                          corpus facta. Suberat enim, ut dictum est, quod erat
                          naturale Christo secundum humanam naturam, eius
                          voluntati: unde poterat naturalem redundantiam a
                          superioribus partibus ad inferiores pro suo libito
                          impedire, ut sineret unamquamque partem pati aut agere
                          quod sibi proprium esset absque alterius partis
                          impedimento, quod in aliis hominibus esse non potest.

                          Christ wished to suffer not only death, but also the
                          other ills that flow from the sin of the first parent
                          to his posterity, so that, bearing in its entirety the
                          penalty of sin, He might perfectly free us from sin by
                          offering satisfaction. Of these ills, some precede
                          death, others follow death. Prior to the death of the
                          body come natural sufferings, such as hunger, thirst,
                          and weariness, and also sufferings inflicted by
                          violence, such as wounding, scourging, and the like.
                          Christ wished to endure all these sufferings, since
                          they stem from sin. If man had not sinned, he would
                          not have experienced the affliction of hunger or of
                          thirst or of fatigue or of cold, and he would not have
                          had to undergo the suffering caused by external
                          violence. Christ bore these sufferings for a different
                          reason from that on account of which other men endure
                          them. In other men there is nothing that can resist
                          these sufferings. But Christ had at His disposal means
                          to withstand evils of this sort: not only the
                          uncreated power of His divinity, but also the
                          beatitude of His soul, which is so powerful that, as
                          Augustine says [ <i>Epist. CXVIII, ad Dioscorum</i>,
                          3], its happiness in its own way flows over into the
                          body. Thus after the resurrection, by the very fact
                          that the soul will be glorified by the vision of God
                          in unrestricted and full fruition, the body united to
                          the glorified soul will be rendered glorious,
                          impassible, and immortal. Therefore, since the soul of
                          Christ enjoyed the vision of God in the highest degree
                          of perfection, His body should in consequence, so far
                          as the power of this vision is concerned, have been
                          rendered impassible and immortal by an overflowing of
                          glory from the soul to the body. But divine wisdom so
                          disposed matters that Christ’s body would suffer at
                          the very time His soul was enjoying the vision of God,
                          with no overflow of glory from the soul to the body.
                          For, as we have said, all that was physical in
                          Christ’s human nature was subject to His Will. Hence
                          at His good pleasure He could prevent natural
                          redundance from His higher to His lower parts, and so
                          could allow any part to suffer or do whatever would be
                          proper to it without interference from any other part.
                          This, of course, is impossible in other men.

                              in nullo mitigabatur per superius gaudium

                              This also accounts for the fact that during His
                              passion Christ suffered most excruciating pain of
                              body. For His bodily pain was in no way lessened
                              by the higher joy of His rational soul, just as,
                              conversely, pain of body did not obstruct the joy
                              of His rational soul.

                                  Hinc etiam apparet quod solus Christus viator

                                  fruebatur (quod ad comprehensorem pertinet) ut
                                  tamen corpus passionibus subiectum remaneret,
                                  quod pertinet ad viatorem. Et quia proprium
                                  est viatoris ut per bona quae ex caritate
                                  agit, mereatur vel sibi vel aliis, inde est
                                  quod Christus quamvis comprehensor esset,
                                  meruit tamen per ea quae fecit et passus est,
                                  et sibi et nobis.

                                  This reveals, too, that Christ alone was both
                                  a <i>viator</i> and a <i>comprehensor</i>. He
                                  enjoyed the vision of God, which characterizes
                                  the <i>comprehensor</i>, but in such a way
                                  that His body remained subject to sufferings,
                                  which characterizes the wayfarer. And since a
                                  wayfarer has power to merit, either for
                                  himself or for others, by the good works he
                                  performs from the motive of charity, Christ
                                  too, although He was a <i>comprehensor</i>,
                                  merited both for Himself and for others by His
                                  works and sufferings.

                                      For Himself Christ merited, not indeed
                                      glory of soul, which He had from the first
                                      instant of His conception, but glory of
                                      body, which He won by suffering. For us,
                                      too, each of His sufferings and actions
                                      was profitable unto salvation, not only by
                                      way of example, but also by way of merit;
                                      owing to the abundance of His charity and
                                      grace, He could merit grace for us, so
                                      that thus the members might receive of the
                                      fullness of the head.

                                          eius habet infinitam existimationem,

                                          Any suffering of His, however slight,
                                          was enough to redeem the human race,
                                          if the dignity of the sufferer is
                                          considered. For the more exalted the
                                          person on whom suffering is inflicted,
                                          the greater is the injury judged to
                                          be; for instance, a greater outrage is
                                          committed if one strikes a prince than
                                          if one strikes a common man of the
                                          people. Consequently, since Christ is
                                          a person of infinite dignity, any
                                          suffering of His has an infinite
                                          value, and so suffices for the
                                          atonement of infinitely many sins. Yet
                                          the redemption of the human race was
                                          accomplished, not by this or that
                                          slight suffering, but by Christ’s
                                          death, which, for reasons listed
                                          above, He chose to endure to redeem
                                          the human race from its sins. For in

                          Since the soul is the form of the body, any suffering
                          undergone by the body must in some way affect the
                          soul. Therefore in that state in which the body of
                          Christ was passible, His soul was passible also.

                              We may note that the suffering of the soul is of
                              two kinds. One kind of suffering arises from the
                              body, the other from the object that causes
                              suffering, and this can be observed in any one of
                              the faculties. For the soul is related to the body
                              in the same way that a part of the soul is related
                              to a part of the body. Thus suffering may be
                              caused in the faculty of sight by some object, as
                              when vision is dimmed by an excessively bright
                              light; suffering can also arise from the organ
                              itself, as when vision is dulled because of an
                              injured pupil.

                                  Si igitur consideretur passio animae Christi

                                  Accordingly, if the suffering of Christ’s soul
                                  is regarded as arising from the body, the
                                  whole soul suffered when the body suffered.
                                  For the soul in its essence is the form of the
                                  body, and the faculties, too, are all rooted
                                  in the essence of the soul. Consequently, if
                                  the body suffers every power of the soul
                                  suffers in some way. But if the suffering of
                                  the soul is considered as arising from an
                                  object, not every power of Christ’s soul
                                  suffered, understanding suffering in the
                                  proper sense as connoting harm. For nothing
                                  that arose from the object of any of these
                                  powers could be harmful, since, as we saw
                                  above, the soul of Christ enjoyed the perfect
                                  vision of God. Thus the higher reason of
                                  Christ’s soul, which is immersed in the
                                  contemplation and meditation of eternal
                                  things, embraced nothing adverse or repugnant
                                  that could cause it to suffer any harm.

                                      But the sense faculties, whose objects are
                                      material things, could receive some injury
                                      from the suffering of the body; and so
                                      Christ experienced pain of sense when His
                                      body suffered. Furthermore, just as
                                      laceration of the body is felt by the
                                      senses to be injurious, so the inner
                                      imagination apprehends it as harmful;
                                      hence interior distress follows even when
                                      pain is not felt in the body. We assert
                                      that suffering of such distress was
                                      experienced by the soul of Christ. More
                                      than this: not the imagination alone, but
                                      also the lower reason apprehends objects
                                      harmful to the body; and so, as a result
                                      of such apprehension by the lower reason,
                                      which is concerned with temporal affairs,
                                      the suffering of sorrow could have place
                                      in Christ, so far as the lower reason
                                      apprehended death and other maltreatment
                                      of the body as injurious and as contrary
                                      to natural appetite.

                                                  imagination, and lower reason,
                                                  Christ was rejoicing in His
                                                  higher reason, so far as He
                                                  referred them to the order of

                                                  considered as nature, shrank
                                                  from death, meaning that death
                                                  is naturally abhorrent, but
                                                  that if it is considered as
                                                  reason, it was willing to
                                                  suffer death.

                                                      in Christ than in us. In

                                                      anticipate the judgment of
                                                      reason, and sometimes pass
                                                      the bounds of reason. In
                                                      Christ they never
                                                      anticipated the judgment
                                                      of reason, and never
                                                      exceeded the moderation
                                                      imposed by reason; His
                                                      lower appetite, which was
                                                      subject to passion, was
                                                      moved just so far as
                                                      reason decreed that it
                                                      should be moved. Therefore
                                                      Christ’s soul could desire
                                                      something in its higher
                                                      part that it shrank from
                                                      in its lower part, and yet
                                                      there was no conflict of
                                                      appetites in Him or
                                                      rebellion of the flesh
                                                      against the spirit, such
                                                      as occurs in us owing to
                                                      the fact that the lower
                                                      appetite exceeds the
                                                      judgment and measure of
                                                      reason. In Christ this
                                                      appetite was moved in
                                                      accord with the judgment
                                                      of reason, to the extent
                                                      that He permitted each of
                                                      His lower powers to be
                                                      moved by its own impulse,
                                                      in keeping with propriety.

                          Since prayer manifests desire, the nature of the
                          prayer Christ offered when His passion was upon Him
                          may be gathered from the different desires He
                          expressed. In Matthew 26:39 He begs: “My Father, if it
                          be possible, let this chalice pass from Me.
                          Nevertheless, not as I will, but as You wilt.” In
                          saying, “Let this chalice pass from Me,” He indicates
                          the movement of His lower appetite and natural desire,
                          whereby all naturally shrink from death and desire
                          life. And in saying, “Nevertheless not as I will, but
                          as You wilt,” He gives,expression to the movement of
                          His higher reason, which looks on all things as
                          comprised under the ordinations of divine wisdom. The
                          same is the bearing of the added words, “If this
                          chalice may not pass away” (Matt. 26:42), whereby He
                          showed that only those events can occur which take
                          place according to the order of the divine will.

                              oratio exaudita non fuerit. Nam secundum apostolum

                              rationem, ut dictum est.

                              Although the chalice of the passion did not pass
                              from Him, but He had to drink it, we may not say
                              that His prayer went unheard. For, as the Apostle
                              assures us in Hebrews 5:7, in all things Christ
                              “was heard for His reverence.” Since prayer, as we
                              have remarked, is expressive of desire, we pray
                              unconditionally for what we wish unconditionally;
                              and so the very desires of the just have the force
                              of prayer with God, according to Psalm 9:17: “The
                              Lord hath heard the desire of the poor.” But we
                              wish unconditionally only what we desire with our
                              higher reason, which alone has the power of
                              assenting to an undertaking. Christ prayed
                              absolutely that the Father’s will might be done,
                              for this was what He wished absolutely. But He did
                              not thus pray that the chalice might pass from
                              Him, because He wished this, not absolutely, but
                              according to His lower reason, as we have stated.

                          In consequence of sin, other defects, both on the part
                          of the body and on the part of the soul, overtake man
                          after death. With regard to defects on the part of the
                          body, the body returns to the earth from which it was
                          taken. This defect on the part of the body has two
                          phases in the case of ourselves: it is laid away and
                          it corrupts. It is laid away, inasmuch as the dead
                          body is placed beneath the earth in burial; and it
                          corrupts, inasmuch as the body is resolved into the
                          elements of which it was composed.

                              Horum autem defectuum primum quidem Christus pati
                              voluit, ut scilicet corpus eius sub terra
                              poneretur. Alium autem defectum passus non fuit,
                              ut scilicet corpus eius in terram resolveretur:
                              unde de ipso Psal. XV, 10, dicit: non dabis
                              sanctum tuum videre corruptionem, idest corporis
                              putrefactionem. Huius autem ratio est, quia corpus
                              Christi materiam sumpsit de natura humana, sed
                              formatio eius non fuit virtute humana, sed virtute
                              spiritus sancti. Et ideo propter substantiam
                              materiae subterraneum locum, qui corporibus

                              Christ wished to be subject to the first of these
                              defects, namely, the placing of His body beneath
                              the earth. But He did not submit to the other
                              defect, the dissolving of His body into dust. Thus
                              Psalm 15:10 says of Him: “Nor will you let your
                              holy one to see corruption,” that is, decay of the
                              body. The reason for this is plain: although
                              Christ’s body received matter from human nature,
                              its formation was accomplished not by any human
                              power but by the power of the Holy Spirit.
                              Accordingly, the substance of His matter being
                              what it was, He wished to be subject to the place
                              beneath the earth usually given over to dead
                              bodies; for that place which is in keeping with
                              the matter of the predominant element in bodies is
                              rightly assigned to them. But He did not wish the
                              body that had been formed by the Holy Spirit to
                              undergo dissolution, since in this respect He was
                              different from other men.

                          On the part of the soul, death among men is followed,
                          in consequence of sin, by descent into hell, not only
                          as a place, but as a state of punishment. However,
                          just as Christ’s body was buried beneath the earth
                          regarded as a place but not with respect to the common
                          defect of dissolution, so His soul went down to hell
                          as a place, not to undergo punishment there, but
                          rather to release from punishment others who were
                          detained there because of the sin of the first parent
                          for which He had already made full satisfaction by
                          suffering death. Hence nothing remained to be suffered
                          after death, and so without undergoing any punishment
                          He descended locally into hell that He might manifest
                          Himself as the Savior of the living and the dead. For
                          this reason He alone among the dead is said to have
                          been free, since His soul was not subject to
                          punishment in hell and His body was not subject to
                          corruption in the grave.

                          what suffering had to be undergone for us to free us
                          from sin. Secondly, we see in His exaltation what is

                              atonement for sin He offered. Others, it is true,
                              raised up either by Christ or by the prophets, had
                              returned to life before Him; yet they had to die a
                              second time. But “Christ rising again from the
                              dead, dies now no more” (Rom. 6:9). As He was the
                              first to escape the necessity of dying, He is
                              called “the first begotten of the dead” (Apoc.
                              1:5) and “the first fruits of those who sleep” (1
                              Cor. 15:20). Having thrown off the yoke of death,
                              He was the first to rise from the sleep of death.

                                  Christ’s resurrection was not to be long
                                  delayed, nor, on the other hand, was it to
                                  take place immediately after death. If He had
                                  returned to life immediately after death, the
                                  fact of His death would not have been well
                                  established; and if the resurrection had been
                                  long delayed, the sign of vanquished death
                                  would not have appeared in Him, and men would
                                  not have been given the hope that they would
                                  be rescued from death by Him. Therefore He put
                                  off the resurrection until the third day, for
                                  this interval was judged sufficient to
                                  establish the truth of His death, and was not
                                  too long to wither away the hope of
                                  liberation. If it had been delayed for a
                                  longer time, the hope of the faithful might
                                  have begun to suffer doubt. Indeed, on the
                                  third day, as though hope were already running
                                  out, some were saying: “We hoped that it was
                                  He that should have redeemed Israel” (Luke
                                  24:21).

                                      three full days. He is said to have been
                                      in the heart of the earth for three days
                                      and three nights, according to that figure

                                      for the whole. For, since one natural day
                                      is made up of a day and a night, Christ is
                                      said to have been dead during the whole of
                                      any part of a day or a night that is
                                      counted while He was lying in death.

                                          Scripture, night is figured in with
                                          the following day, because the Hebrews
                                          reckon time by the course of the moon,
                                          which begins to shine in the evening.
                                          Christ was in the sepulcher during the
                                          latter part of the sixth day, and if
                                          this is counted along with the
                                          preceding night, it will be more or
                                          less one natural day. He reposed in
                                          the tomb during the night following
                                          the sixth day, together with the whole
                                          of the Sabbath day, and so we have two
                                          days. He lay dead also during the next
                                          night, which preceded the Lord’s Day,
                                          on which He rose, and this occurred
                                          either at midnight, according to
                                          Gregory [ <i>In Evangelia</i>, II,
                                          hom. 21], or at dawn, as others think
                                          [Augustine, <i>De Trinitate</i>, IV,
                                          6]. Therefore, if either the whole
                                          night, or a part of it together with
                                          the Lord’s Day following, is taken
                                          into our calculation, we shall have
                                          the third natural day.

                                              These two statements do not

                          Christ recovered for the human race not merely what
                          Adam had lost through sin, but all that Adam could
                          have attained through merit. For Christ’s power to
                          merit was far greater than that of man prior to sin.
                          By sin Adam incurred the necessity of dying, because
                          he lost the power which would have enabled him to
                          avoid death if he had not sinned. Christ not only did
                          away with the necessity of dying, but even gained the
                          power of not being able to die. Therefore His body
                          after the resurrection was rendered impassible and
                          immortal. Thus Christ’s body was not like that of the
                          first man, which had the power not to die, but was
                          absolutely unable to die. And this is what we await in
                          the future life for ourselves.

                              Another consideration: Christ’s soul before His
                              death was capable of suffering in company with the
                              suffering of His body. Consequently, when His body
                              became incapable of suffering, His soul also
                              became incapable of suffering.

                                  Furthermore, the mystery of man’s redemption
                                  was now accomplished. To enable Christ to
                                  achieve that end, the glory of fruition had,
                                  in God’s dispensation, been restricted to the
                                  higher regions of His soul, so that no
                                  overflowing to the lower parts and to the body
                                  itself would occur, but each faculty would be
                                  allowed to do or suffer what was proper to it.
                                  But now the body and the lower powers were
                                  wholly glorified by an overflow of glory from
                                  the higher regions of the soul. Accordingly
                                  Christ, who before the passion had been a
                                  <i>comprehensor</i> because of the fruition
                                  enjoyed by His soul and a wayfarer because of
                                  the passibility of His body, was now, after
                                  the resurrection, no longer a wayfarer, but
                                  exclusively a <i>comprehensor</i>.

                          As we stated above, Christ anticipated the general
                          resurrection in order that His resurrection might
                          bolster up our hope of our own resurrection. To foster
                          our hope of resurrection, Christ’s resurrection and
                          the qualities of His risen nature had to be made known
                          by suitable proofs. He manifested His resurrection,
                          not to all alike, in the way that He manifested His
                          human nature and His passion, but only “to witnesses
                          preordained by God” (Acts 10:41), namely, the
                          disciples whom He had selected to bring about man’s
                          salvation. For the state of resurrection, as was
                          mentioned above, belongs to the glory of the
                          <i>comprehensor</i>, and knowledge of this is not due
                          to all, but only to such as make themselves worthy. To
                          the witnesses He had chosen Christ revealed both the
                          fact of His resurrection and the glory of His risen
                          nature.

                              Quantum ad naturam quidem, quia se verum corpus
                              humanum habere demonstravit, dum ipsum palpandum
                              et videndum discipulis praebuit, quibus dixit Luc.
                              ult., 39: palpate et videte, quia spiritus carnem
                              et ossa non habet, sicut me videtis habere.
                              Manifestavit etiam exercendo actus qui naturae
                              humanae conveniunt, cum discipulis suis manducans
                              et bibens, et cum eis multoties loquens et
                              ambulans, qui sunt actus hominis viventis, quamvis
                              illa comestio necessitatis non fuerit: non enim
                              incorruptibilia resurgentium corpora ulterius cibo
                              indigebunt, cum in eis nulla fiat deperditio, quam
                              oportet per cibum restaurari. Unde et cibus a
                              Christo assumptus non cessit in corporis eius
                              nutrimentum, sed fuit resolutum in praeiacentem
                              materiam. Verumtamen ex hoc ipso quod comedit et
                              bibit, se verum hominem demonstravit.

                              He made known the fact of His resurrection by
                              showing that He, the very one who had died, rose
                              again both in His nature and in His suppositum. As
                              regards nature, He showed that He had a true human
                              body when He offered Himself to be touched and
                              seen by the disciples, to whom He said: “Handle
                              and see; for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as
                              you see Me to have” (Luke 24:39). He gave further
                              evidence of the same by performing actions that
                              belong to human nature, eating and drinking with
                              His disciples, and often conversing with them and
                              walking about. These are the actions of a living
                              man. Of course such eating was not dictated by
                              necessity. The incorruptible bodies of the risen
                              will have no further need of food, for there
                              occurs in them no deterioration that has to be
                              repaired by nourishment. Hence the food consumed
                              by Christ did not become nourishment for His body
                              but was dissolved into pre-existing matter. Yet He
                              proved that He was a true man by the very fact
                              that He ate and drank.

                                  As regards His suppositum, Christ showed that
                                  He was the same person who had died, by
                                  displaying to His disciples the marks of His
                                  death on His body, namely, the scars of His
                                  wounds. In John 20:27 He says to Thomas: “Put
                                  your finger here and see My hands; and bring
                                  your hand here and put it into My side.” And
                                  in Luke 24:39 He says: “See My hands and feet,
                                  that it is I Myself.” It was by divine
                                  dispensation that He kept the scars of His
                                  wounds in His body, so that the truth of the
                                  resurrection might be demonstrated by them;
                                  for complete integrity is the proper condition
                                  of the incorruptible risen body, although we
                                  may say that in the case of the martyrs some
                                  indications of the wounds they bore will
                                  appear with a certain splendor, in testimony
                                  of their virtue. Christ further showed that He
                                  was the same suppositum by His manner of
                                  speech and by other familiar actions whereby
                                  men are recognized. Thus the disciples knew
                                  Him “in the breaking of bread” (Luke 24:35).
                                  Also, He openly showed Himself to them in
                                  Galilee, where He was accustomed to converse
                                  with them.

                                      Christ manifested the glory of His risen
                                      nature when He came among them, “the doors
                                      being shut” (John 20:26), and when “He
                                      vanished out of their sight” (Luke 24:31).
                                      For the glory of risen man gives him the
                                      power to be seen in glorious vision when
                                      he wishes, or not to be seen when he so
                                      wishes. The reason why Christ demonstrated
                                      the truth of His resurrection and the
                                      glory of His risen body by so many proofs,
                                      was the difficulty that faith in the
                                      resurrection presents. If He had displayed
                                      the extraordinary condition of His
                                      glorified body in its full splendor, He
                                      would have engendered prejudice against
                                      faith in the resurrection: the very
                                      immensity of its glory would have excluded
                                      belief that it was the same nature.
                                      Further, He manifested the truth not only
                                      by visible signs, but also by proofs
                                      appealing to the intellect, as when “He
                                      opened their understanding that they might
                                      understand the Scriptures” (Luke 24:45),
                                      and showed that according to the writings
                                      of the prophets He was to rise again.

                              vita naturae; alia a Deo, quae dicitur vita
                              iustitiae, vel vita gratiae: et haec est per
                              fidem, per quam Deus inhabitat in nobis, secundum
                              illud Habacuc II, 4: iustus autem meus in fide sua

                              Similarly, opposed to this twofold death, we are
                              to understand that there is a twofold life. One is
                              a life of the body, imparted by the soul, and this
                              is called the life of nature. The other comes from
                              God, and is called the life of justice or the life
                              of grace. This life is given to us through faith,
                              by which God dwells in us, according to Habakkuk
                              2:4: “The just shall live in his faith.”

                                  et secundum hoc duplex est resurrectio: una
                                  corporalis, qua anima iterato coniungitur
                                  corpori; alia spiritualis, qua iterum
                                  coniungitur Deo. Et haec quidem secunda
                                  resurrectio locum in Christo non habuit, quia
                                  nunquam eius anima fuit per peccatum separata
                                  a Deo. Per resurrectionem igitur suam
                                  corporalem utriusque resurrectionis, scilicet
                                  corporalis et spiritualis, nobis est causa.

                                  Accordingly, resurrection is also twofold: one
                                  is a bodily resurrection, in which the soul is
                                  united to the body for the second time; the
                                  other is a spiritual resurrection, in which
                                  the soul is again united to God. This second
                                  resurrection had no place in Christ, because
                                  His soul was never separated from God by sin.
                                  By His bodily resurrection, therefore, Christ
                                  is the cause of both the bodily and the
                                  spiritual resurrection in us.

                                      Considerandum tamen est, quod, ut dicit
                                      Augustinus super Ioannem, verbum Dei
                                      resuscitat animas, sed verbum caro factum
                                      resuscitat corpora. Animam enim vivificare
                                      solius Dei est. Quia tamen caro est

                                      However, as Augustine says in his
                                      commentary on St. John [
                                      <i>In Joannis Evangelium</i>, XIX, 15], we
                                      are to understand that the Word of God
                                      raises up souls, but that the Word as
                                      incarnate raises up bodies. To give life
                                      to the soul belongs to God alone. Yet,
                                      since the flesh is the instrument of His
                                      divinity, and since an instrument operates
                                      in virtue of the principal cause, our
                                      double resurrection, bodily and spiritual,
                                      is referred to Christ’s bodily
                                      resurrection as cause. For everything done
                                      in Christ’s flesh was salutary for us by
                                      reason of the divinity united to that
                                      flesh. Hence the Apostle, indicating the
                                      resurrection of Christ as the cause of our
                                      spiritual resurrection, says, in Romans
                                      4:25, that Christ “was delivered up for
                                      our sins and rose again for our
                                      justification.” And in 1 Corinthians 15:12
                                      he shows that Christ’s resurrection is the
                                      cause of our bodily resurrection: “Now if
                                      Christ be preached, that He rose again
                                      from the dead, how do some among you say
                                      that there is no resurrection of the
                                      dead?”

                                          Most aptly does the Apostle attribute
                                          remission of sins to Christ’s death
                                          and our justification to His
                                          resurrection, thus tracing out
                                          conformity and likeness of effect to
                                          cause. As sin is discarded when it is
                                          remitted, so Christ by dying laid
                                          aside His passible life, in which the
                                          likeness of sin was discernible. But
                                          when a person is justified, he
                                          receives new life; in like manner
                                          Christ, by rising, obtained newness of
                                          glory. Therefore Christ’s death is the
                                          cause of the remission of our sin: the
                                          efficient cause instrumentally, the
                                          exemplary cause sacramentally, and the
                                          meritorious cause. In like manner
                                          Christ’s resurrection was the cause of
                                          our resurrection: the efficient cause
                                          instrumentally and the exemplary cause
                                          sacramentally. But it was not a
                                          meritorious cause, for Christ was no
                                          longer a wayfarer, and so was not in a
                                          position to merit; and also because
                                          the glory of the resurrection was the
                                          reward of His passion, as the Apostle
                                          declares in Philippians 2:9 ff.

                                              can be called the first-born of
                                              those who rise from the dead. This
                                              is true not only in the order of
                                              time, inasmuch as Christ was the
                                              first to rise, as was said above,
                                              85 but also in the order of
                                              causality, because His
                                              resurrection is the cause of the
                                              resurrection of other men, and in
                                              the order of dignity, because He
                                              rose more gloriously than all
                                              others.

                          the reward of His humiliation. Therefore a twofold

                              exaltatio ascensionis: unde apostolus dicit Ephes.
                              IV, 10: qui descendit, ipse est et qui ascendit
                              super omnes caelos.

                              Christ had humbled Himself, first, by suffering
                              death in the passible flesh He had assumed;
                              secondly, He had undergone humiliation with
                              reference to place, when His body was laid in the
                              sepulcher and His soul descended into hell. The
                              exaltation of the resurrection, in which He
                              returned from death to immortal life, corresponds
                              to the first humiliation. And the exaltation of
                              the ascension corresponds to the second
                              humiliation. Hence the Apostle says, in Ephesians
                              4:10: “He who descended is the same also that
                              ascended above all the heavens.”

                                  Sicut autem de filio Dei dicitur quod est
                                  natus, passus et sepultus, et quia resurrexit,
                                  non tamen secundum naturam divinam, sed
                                  secundum humanam: ita et de Dei filio dicitur
                                  quod ascendit in caelum, non quidem secundum
                                  divinam naturam, sed secundum humanam. Nam
                                  secundum divinam naturam nunquam a caelo
                                  discessit, semper ubique existens. Unde ipse
                                  dicit, Ioan. III, 13: nemo ascendit in caelum,
                                  nisi qui descendit de caelo, filius hominis
                                  qui est in caelo. Per quod datur intelligi,
                                  quod sic de caelo descendisse dicitur naturam
                                  assumendo terrenam, quod tamen in caelo semper
                                  permansit. Ex quo etiam considerandum est,
                                  quod solus Christus propria virtute caelos
                                  ascendit. Locus enim ille debebatur ei qui de
                                  caelo descenderat ratione suae originis. Alii
                                  vero per se ipsos ascendere non possunt, sed
                                  per Christi virtutem, eius membra effecti.

                                  However, as it is narrated of the Son of God
                                  that He was born, suffered and was buried, and
                                  rose again, not in His divine nature but in
                                  His human nature, so also, we are told, He
                                  ascended into heaven, not in His divine nature
                                  but in His human nature. In His divine nature
                                  He had never left heaven, as He is always
                                  present everywhere. He indicates this Himself
                                  when He says: “No man has ascended into heaven
                                  but He who descended from heaven, the Son of
                                  man who is in heaven” (John 3:13). By this we
                                  are given to understand that He came down from
                                  heaven by assuming an earthly nature, yet in
                                  such a way that He continued to remain in
                                  heaven. The same consideration leads us to
                                  conclude that Christ alone has gone up to
                                  heaven by His own power. By reason of His
                                  origin, that abode belonged by right to Him
                                  who had come down from heaven. Other men
                                  cannot ascend of themselves, but are taken up
                                  by the power of Christ, whose members they
                                  have been made.

                                      additur alterum quod convenit ei secundum

                                      est dextera, vel sessio corporalis, sed
                                      quia dextera est potior pars animalis,
                                      datur per hoc intelligi quod filius
                                      considet patri non in aliquo minoratus ab

                                      As ascent into heaven befits the Son of
                                      God according to His human nature, so
                                      something else is added that becomes Him
                                      according to His divine nature, namely,
                                      that He should sit at the right hand of
                                      His Father. In this connection we are not
                                      to think of a literal right hand or a
                                      bodily sitting. Since the right side of an
                                      animal is the stronger, this expression
                                      gives us to understand that the Son is
                                      seated with the Father as being in no way

                                      nature, but on a par with Him in all
                                      things. Yet this same prerogative may be
                                      ascribed to the Son of God in His human
                                      nature, thus enabling us to perceive that
                                      in His divine nature the Son is in the
                                      Father Himself according to unity of
                                      essence, and that together with the Father
                                      He possesses a single kingly throne, that
                                      is, an identical power. Since other
                                      persons ordinarily sit near kings, namely,
                                      ministers to whom kings assign a share in
                                      governing power, and since the one whom
                                      the king places at his right hand is
                                      judged to be the most powerful man in the
                                      kingdom, the Son of God is rightly said to
                                      sit at the Father’s right hand even
                                      according to His human nature, as being
                                      exalted in rank above every creature of
                                      the heavenly kingdom.

                          scilicet passio, mors et resurrectio, et etiam
                          ascensio, sunt in Christo completa secundum humanam
                          naturam. Consequenter igitur oportet dici, quod
                          secundum ea quae in humana natura Christus vel passus
                          est vel fecit, nos a malis tam spiritualibus quam
                          corporalibus liberando, ad spiritualia et aeterna bona
                          promovit.

                          We clearly gather from all this, that by the passion
                          and death of Christ and by the glory of His
                          resurrection and ascension, we are freed from sin and
                          death, and have received justice and the glory of
                          immortality, the former in actual fact, the latter in
                          hope. All these events we have mentioned (the passion,
                          the death, the resurrection, and also the ascension)
                          were accomplished in Christ according to His human
                          nature. Therefore we must conclude that Christ has
                          rescued us from spiritual and bodily evils, and has
                          put us in the way of spiritual and eternal goods, by
                          what He suffered or did in His human nature.

                              Est autem consequens ut qui aliquibus aliqua bona
                              acquirit, eadem ipsis dispenset. Dispensatio autem
                              bonorum in multos requirit iudicium, ut
                              unusquisque secundum suum gradum accipiat.
                              Convenienter igitur Christus secundum humanam
                              naturam, secundum quam mysteria humanae salutis
                              implevit, iudex constituitur a Deo super homines,
                              quos salvavit: unde dicitur Ioan. V, 27:
                              potestatem dedit ei iudicium facere, scilicet
                              pater filio, quia filius hominis est. Quamvis et
                              hoc habeat aliam rationem. Est enim conveniens ut
                              iudicem videant iudicandi: Deum autem, apud quem
                              iudicis auctoritas residet, in sua natura videre
                              est praemium, quod per iudicium redditur. Oportuit
                              igitur quod Deus iudex, non in natura propria, sed
                              in natura assumpta, ab hominibus videretur qui
                              iudicandi sunt, tam bonis quam malis. Multi enim
                              si Deum in natura divinitatis viderent, iam
                              praemium reportarent, quo se reddiderunt indignos.

                              He who acquires goods for people also, in
                              consequence, distributes the same to them. But the
                              distribution of goods among many requires
                              judgment, so that each may receive what
                              corresponds to his degree. Therefore Christ, in
                              the human nature in which He has accomplished the
                              mysteries of man’s salvation, is fittingly
                              appointed by God to be judge over the men He has
                              saved. We are told that this is so, in John 5:27:
                              “He [the Father] hath given Him [the Son] power to
                              do judgment, because He is the Son of man.” There
                              is also another reason. Those who are to be judged
                              ought to see the judge. But the sight of God, in
                              whom the judicial authority resides, in His own
                              proper nature, is the reward that is meted out in
                              the judgment. Hence the men to be judged, the good
                              as well as the wicked, ought to see God as judge,
                              not in His proper nature, but in His assumed
                              nature. If the wicked saw God in His divine
                              nature, they would be receiving the very reward of
                              which they had made themselves unworthy.

                                  recompense by way of exaltation, corresponding
                                  to the humiliation of Christ, who was willing
                                  to be humiliated to the point of being
                                  unjustly judged by a human judge. To give
                                  expression to our belief in this humiliation,
                                  we say explicitly in the Creed, that He
                                  suffered under Pontius Pilate. Therefore this
                                  exalted reward of being appointed by God to
                                  judge all men, the living and the dead, in His
                                  human nature, was due to Christ, according to
                                  Job 36:17: “Your cause hath been judged as
                                  that of the wicked. Cause and judgment You
                                  shall recover.”

                                      promittit: regem in decore videbunt;
                                      impiis autem erit ad confusionem et
                                      luctum, quia iudicantis gloria et
                                      potestas, damnationem timentibus,
                                      tristitiam et metum inducit: unde dicitur
                                      Isa. XXVI, 11: videant et confundantur
                                      zelantes populi, et ignis hostes tuos
                                      devoret.

                                      Moreover, since this judicial power
                                      pertains to Christ’s exaltation, as does
                                      the glory of His resurrection, Christ will
                                      appear at the judgment, not in humility,
                                      which belonged to the time of merit, but
                                      in the glorious form that is indicative of
                                      His reward. We are assured in the Gospel
                                      that “they shall see the Son of man coming
                                      in a cloud with great power and majesty”
                                      (Luke 21:27). And the sight of His glory
                                      will be a joy to the elect who have loved
                                      Him; to these is made the promise, in
                                      Isaiah 33:17, that they “shall see the
                                      King in His beauty.” But to the wicked
                                      this sight will mean confusion and
                                      lamentation, for the glory and power of
                                      the judge will bring grief and dread to
                                      those who fear damnation. We read of this
                                      in Isaiah 26: 11: “Let the envious see and
                                      be confounded, and let fire devour your
                                      enemies.”

                                          splendor, so that at the sight of them

                                          have been saved through the sufferings

                          Since the Father “has given all judgment to the Son,”
                          as is said in John 5:22, and since human life even at
                          present is regulated by the just judgment of God—for
                          it is He who judges all flesh, as Abraham declared in
                          Genesis 18:25—we cannot doubt that this judgment, by
                          which men are governed in the world, pertains likewise
                          to the judicial power of Christ. To Him are directed
                          the words of the Father reported in Psalm 109:1: “Sit
                          at my right hand, until I make your enemies your
                          footstool.” He sits at the right hand of God according
                          to His human nature, inasmuch as He receives His
                          judicial power from the Father. And this power He
                          exercises even now before all His enemies are clearly
                          seen to lie prostrate at His feet. He Himself bore
                          witness to this fact shortly after His resurrection,
                          in Matthew 28:18: “All power is given to Me in heaven
                          and on earth.”

                              There is another judgment of God whereby, at the
                              moment of death, everyone receives, as regards his
                              soul, the recompense he has deserved. The just who
                              have been dissolved in death remain with Christ,
                              as Paul desired for himself; but sinners who have
                              died are buried in hell. We may not suppose that
                              this division takes place without God’s judgment,
                              or that this judgment does not pertain to the
                              judicial power of Christ, especially as He Himself
                              tells His disciples in John 14:3: “If I shall go
                              and prepare a place for you, I will come again and
                              will take you to Myself, that where I am, you also
                              may be.” To be taken in this way means nothing
                              else than to be dissolved in death, so that we may
                              be with Christ; for “while we are in the body we
                              are absent from the Lord,” as is said in 2
                              Corinthians 5:6.

                                  Sed quia retributio hominis non solum

                                  resurrexit in gloria, et caelos ascendit, ita
                                  etiam ipse sua virtute faciat resurgere

                                  However, since man’s recompense is not
                                  confined to goods of the soul, but embraces
                                  goods of the body which is again to be resumed
                                  by the soul at the resurrection, and since
                                  every recompense requires judgment, there has
                                  to be another judgment by which men are
                                  rewarded for what they have done in the body
                                  as well as for what they have done in the
                                  soul. This judgment, too, belongs rightfully
                                  to Christ, in order that, as He rose and
                                  ascended into heaven in glory after dying for
                                  us, He may also by His own power cause the
                                  bodies of our lowliness to rise again in the
                                  likeness of His glorified body, and may
                                  transport them up to heaven where He has
                                  preceded us by His ascension, thus opening the
                                  way before us, as had been foretold by Micah.
                                  This resurrection of all men will take place
                                  simultaneously at the end of the world, as we
                                  have already indicated. Therefore this
                                  judgment will be a general and final judgment,
                                  and we believe that Christ will come a second
                                  time, in glory, to preside at it.

                                      dicit ad Rom. XI, 33: quam
                                      incomprehensibilia sunt iudicia eius, in

                                      dispensatur, tempus quidem iudicii
                                      manifestum est hominibus, sed
                                      retributionum ratio latet, praesertim quia
                                      bonis plerumque mala in hoc mundo
                                      eveniunt, et malis bona. In aliis autem

                                      ratio in evidenti erit, sed tempus manet
                                      occultum, quia et mortis suae tempus homo
                                      ignorat, secundum illud Eccle. IX, 12:
                                      nescit homo finem suum, et finem huius
                                      saeculi nemo scire potest. Non enim

                                      creatura praesciri potest, sed a solo Deo
                                      secundum illud Matth. XXIV, 36: de die

                                      caelorum, nisi pater solus.

                                      In Psalm 35:7 we read: “Your judgments are
                                      a great deep”; and in Romans 11:33 the
                                      Apostle exclaims: “How incomprehensible
                                      are His judgments!” Each of the judgments
                                      mentioned contains something profound and
                                      incomprehensible to human knowledge. In
                                      the first of God’s judgments, by which the
                                      present life of mankind is regulated, the
                                      time of the judgment is, indeed, manifest
                                      to men, but the reason for the recompenses
                                      is concealed, especially as evils for the
                                      most part are the lot of the good in this
                                      world, while good things come to the
                                      wicked. In the other two judgments of God
                                      the reason for the requitals will be
                                      clearly known, but the time remains
                                      hidden, because man does not know the hour
                                      of his death, as is noted in Ecclesiastes
                                      9:12: “Man does not know his own end”; and
                                      no one can know the end of this world. For
                                      we do not foreknow future events, except
                                      those whose causes we understand. But the
                                      cause of the end of the world is the will
                                      of God, which is unknown to us. Therefore
                                      the end of the world can be foreseen by no
                                      creature, but only by God, according to
                                      Matthew 24:36: “Of that day and hour no
                                      one knows, not even the angels of heaven,
                                      but the Father alone.”

                                          filius, sumpserunt aliqui errandi
                                          materiam, dicentes filium patre

                                          diceretur, quod filius haec ignorat
                                          secundum humanam naturam assumptam,
                                          non autem secundum divinam, secundum
                                          quam unam sapientiam habet cum patre,
                                          vel, ut expressius dicatur, est ipsa
                                          sapientia in corde concepta. Sed hoc
                                          inconveniens videretur ut filius etiam
                                          secundum naturam assumptam, divinum
                                          ignoret iudicium, cum eius anima,
                                          Evangelista testante, plena sit Dei
                                          gratia et veritate, ut supra dictum
                                          est. Nec etiam videtur habere
                                          rationem, ut cum Christus potestatem
                                          iudicandi acceperit, quia filius
                                          hominis est, tempus sui iudicii
                                          secundum humanam naturam ignoret. Non
                                          enim omne iudicium pater ei dedisset,
                                          si determinandi temporis sui adventus
                                          esset ei subtractum iudicium.

                                          In this connection, some have found an
                                          occasion for going astray in the added
                                          words, “nor the Son,” which are read
                                          in Mark 13:32. They contend that the
                                          Son is inferior to the Father, on the
                                          score that He is ignorant of matters
                                          which the Father knows. The difficulty
                                          could be avoided by replying that the
                                          Son is ignorant of this event in His
                                          assumed human nature, but not in. His
                                          divine nature, in which He has one and
                                          the same wisdom as the Father or, to
                                          speak with greater propriety, He is
                                          wisdom itself intellectually
                                          conceived. But the Son could hardly be
                                          unaware of the divine judgment even in
                                          His assumed nature, since His soul, as
                                          the Evangelist attests, is full of
                                          God’s grace and truth, as was pointed
                                          out above. Nor does it seem reasonable
                                          that Christ, who has received the
                                          power to judge “because He is the Son
                                          of man” (John 5:27), should be
                                          ignorant in His human nature of the
                                          time appointed for Him to judge. The
                                          Father would not really have given all
                                          judgment to Him, if the judgment of
                                          determining the time of His coming
                                          were withheld from Him.

                                              Accordingly this text is to be
                                              interpreted in the light of the
                                              usual style of speech found in the
                                              Scriptures, in which God is said
                                              to know a thing when He imparts
                                              knowledge of that thing, as when
                                              He said to Abraham, in Genesis
                                              22:12: “Now I know that you fear
                                              God.” The meaning is not that He
                                              who knows all things from eternity
                                              began to know at that moment, but
                                              that He made known Abraham’s
                                              devotedness by that declaration.
                                              In a similar way the Son is said
                                              to be ignorant of the day of
                                              judgment, because He did not
                                              impart that knowledge to the
                                              disciples, but replied to them,
                                              Acts 1:7: “It is not for you to
                                              know the times or moments which
                                              the Father hath put in His own
                                              power.” But the Father is not
                                              ignorant in this way, since in any
                                              case He gave knowledge of the
                                              matter to the Son through the
                                              eternal generation. Some authors
                                              extricate themselves from the
                                              difficulty in fewer words, saying
                                              that Mark’s expression is to be
                                              understood of an adopted son.

                                                  judgment to remain hidden,
                                                  that men might watch with care
                                                  so as not to be found
                                                  unprepared at the hour of
                                                  judgment. For the same reason
                                                  He also wished the hour of
                                                  each one’s death to be
                                                  unknown. For each man will

                          According to the doctrine thus set forth, Christ
                          clearly has judicial power over the living and the
                          dead. He exercises judgment both over those who are
                          living in the world at present and over those who pass
                          from this world by death. At the Last judgment,
                          however, He will judge the living and the dead
                          together. In this expression the living may be taken
                          to mean the just who live by grace, and the dead may
                          be taken to mean sinners who have fallen from grace.
                          Or else by the living may be meant those who will be
                          found still alive at the Lord’s coming, and by the
                          dead those who have died in previous ages.

                              Hoc autem non est hic intelligendum, quod aliqui

                              corporis mortem, sicut aliqui posuerunt. Manifeste
                              enim apostolus dicit I Cor. XV, 51: omnes quidem
                              resurgemus, et alia littera habet: omnes quidem
                              dormiemus, idest moriemur, sive ut in aliquibus
                              libris habetur, non omnes quidem dormiemus, ut
                              Hieronymus dicit in epistola ad Minerium de
                              resurrectione carnis, quod praedictae sententiae
                              firmitatem non tollit. Nam paulo ante praemiserat
                              apostolus: sicut in Adam omnes moriuntur, ita et
                              omnes in Christo vivificabuntur, et sic illud quod
                              dicitur, non omnes dormiemus, non potest referri
                              ad mortem corporis, quae in omnes transivit per
                              peccatum primi parentis, ut dicitur Rom. V; sed
                              exponendum est de dormitione peccati, de qua
                              dicitur Ephes. V, 14: surge qui dormis, et exurge
                              a mortuis, et illuminabit te Christus.

                              We are not to understand by this that certain of
                              the living will be judged without ever having
                              undergone death of the body, as some have argued.
                              For the Apostle says clearly, in 1 Corinthinans
                              15:51: “We shall all indeed rise again.” Another
                              reading has: “We shall indeed sleep,” that is, we
                              shall die; or, according to some books, “We shall
                              not indeed all sleep,” as Jerome notes in his
                              letter to Minervius on the resurrection of the
                              body. But this variant does not destroy the force
                              of the doctrine under discussion. For a little
                              previously the Apostle had written: “As in Adam
                              all die, so also in Christ all shall be made
                              alive” (1 Cor. 15:22). Hence the text which reads:
                              “We shall not all sleep,” cannot refer to death of
                              the body, which has come down to all through the
                              sin of our first parent, as is stated in Romans
                              5:12, but must be interpreted as referring to the
                              sleep of sin, concerning which we are exhorted in
                              Ephesians 5:14: “Rise, you who sleep, and arise
                              from the dead: and Christ shall enlighten you.”

                                  to meet Christ, into the air” (1 Thessalonians
                                  4: 16), they will die and immediately rise
                                  again, as Augustine teaches.

                                      cognizance of the three phases which,
                                      apparently, constitute a judicial process.
                                      First, someone is haled into court;
                                      secondly, his cause is examined; and
                                      thirdly, he receives sentence.

                                          in 2 Corinthians 5:10, “We must all be
                                          manifested before the judgment seat of
                                          Christ.” Not even those who have died

                                          or not, are exempt from this universal

                                              case, not all, either of the good
                                              or of the wicked, will be judged.
                                              A judicial investigation is not
                                              necessary unless good and evil

                                              of good, discussion is out of
                                              place. Among the good there are
                                              some who have wholeheartedly
                                              despised temporal possessions, and
                                              have dedicated themselves to God
                                              alone and to the things that are
                                              of God. Accordingly, since sin is
                                              committed by cleaving to
                                              changeable goods in contempt of
                                              the changeless Good, such souls
                                              exhibit no mingling of good and
                                              evil. This is not to imply that
                                              they live without sin, for in
                                              their person is asserted what we
                                              read in 1 John 1: 8: “If we say
                                              that we have no sin, we deceive
                                              ourselves.” Although certain
                                              lesser sins are found in them,
                                              these are, so to speak, consumed
                                              by the fire of charity, and so
                                              seem to be nothing. At the
                                              judgment” therefore, such souls
                                              will not be judged by an
                                              investigation of their deeds.

                                                  them, have a notable amount of
                                                  evil mixed up with the good of
                                                  faith and charity, so that the
                                                  element predominating in them
                                                  cannot easily be perceived.

                                                      Similarly, with reference
                                                      to the wicked, we should
                                                      recall that the principle
                                                      of approach to God is
                                                      faith, according to
                                                      Hebrews 11:6: “He that
                                                      cometh to God must
                                                      believe.” Therefore in him
                                                      who lacks faith there is
                                                      found nothing of good
                                                      which, mixed with evil,
                                                      might render his damnation
                                                      doubtful. And so such a
                                                      one will be condemned
                                                      without any inquiry into
                                                      merits. Again, he who has
                                                      faith but has no charity
                                                      and, consequently, no good
                                                      works, possesses, indeed,
                                                      some point of contact with
                                                      God. Hence an examination
                                                      of his case is necessary,
                                                      so that the element
                                                      predominating in him,
                                                      whether good or evil, may
                                                      clearly emerge. Such a
                                                      person will be condemned
                                                      only after an
                                                      investigation of his case.
                                                      In the same way an earthly
                                                      king condemns a criminal
                                                      citizen after hearing him,
                                                      but punishes an enemy
                                                      without any hearing.

                          We are not to suppose that judicial examination will
                          be required in order that the judge may receive
                          information, as is the case in human courts; for “all
                          things ate naked and open to His eyes,” as we are told
                          in Hebrews 4:13. The examination is necessary for the
                          purpose of making known to each person, concerning
                          himself and others, the reasons why each is worthy of
                          punishment or of glory, so that the good may joyfully
                          acknowledge God’s justice in all things and the wicked
                          may be roused to anger against themselves.

                              Nec est aestimandum quod huiusmodi discussio
                              meritorum verbotenus fiat. Immensum enim tempus
                              requireretur ad enarrandum singulorum excogitata,
                              dicta et facta bona vel mala: unde Lactantius
                              deceptus fuit, ut poneret diem iudicii mille annis
                              duraturum, quamvis nec hoc tempus sufficere
                              videatur, cum ad unius hominis iudicium modo
                              praedicto complendum plures dies requirerentur.
                              Fiet ergo virtute divina ut statim unicuique

                              Nor should we imagine that this examination is to
                              be conducted by oral discussion. Endless time
                              would be required to recount the thoughts, words,
                              and deeds, good or evil, of each person. Therefore
                              Lactantius was deceived when be suggested that the
                              day of judgment would last a thousand years. Even
                              this time would scarcely be enough, as several
                              days would be required to complete the judicial
                              process for a single man in the manner proposed.
                              Accordingly the divine power will bring it about
                              that in an instant everyone will be apprised of
                              all the good or evil he has ever done, for which
                              he is to be rewarded or punished. And all this
                              will be made known to each person, not only about
                              himself, but also about the rest. Hence, wherever
                              the good is so much in excess that the evil seems
                              to be of no consequence or vice versa, there will
                              seem, to human estimation, to be no conflict
                              between the good and the evil. This is what we
                              meant when we said that such persons will be
                              rewarded or punished without examination.

                                  Although all men will appear before Christ at
                                  that judgment, the good will not only be set
                                  apart from the wicked by reason of meritorious
                                  cause, but will be separated from them in
                                  locality. The wicked, who have withdrawn from
                                  Christ in their love of earthly things, will
                                  remain on earth; but the good, who have clung
                                  to Christ, will be raised up into the air when
                                  they go to meet Christ, that they may be made
                                  like Christ, not only by being conformed to
                                  the splendor of His glory, but by being
                                  associated with Him in the place He occupies.
                                  This is indicated in Matthew 24:28:
                                  “Wheresoever the body shall be, there shall
                                  the eagles also (by which the saints are
                                  signified) be gathered together.” According to
                                  Jerome [ <i>In Evangelium Matthaei</i>, IV],
                                  instead of “body” the Hebrew has the
                                  significant word “joatham,” which means
                                  corpse, to commemorate Christ’s passion,
                                  whereby Christ merited the power to judge, and
                                  men who have been conformed to His passion are
                                  admitted into the company of His glory, as we
                                  are told by the Apostle in 2 Timothy 2:12: “If
                                  we suffer, we shall also reign with Him.”

                                      secundum illud Matth. XXIV, 30: et tunc

                                      This is the ground for our belief that
                                      Christ will come down to judge somewhere
                                      near the place of His passion, as is
                                      intimated in Joel 3:2: “I will gather
                                      together all nations and will bring them
                                      down into the valley of Josaphat; and I
                                      will plead with them there.” This valley
                                      lies at the foot of Mount Olivet, from
                                      which Christ ascended into heaven. For the
                                      same reason, when Christ comes for the
                                      judgment, the sign of the cross and other
                                      signs of the Passion will be displayed, as
                                      is said in Matthew 24:30: “And then shall
                                      appear the sign of the Son of man in
                                      heaven,” so that the wicked, looking upon
                                      Him whom they have pierced, will be
                                      distressed and tormented, and those who
                                      have been redeemed will exult in the glory
                                      of their Redeemer. And as Christ is said
                                      to sit at God’s right hand according to
                                      His human nature, inasmuch as He has been
                                      lifted up to share in the most excellent
                                      goods of the Father, so at the judgment
                                      the just are said to stand at Christ’s
                                      right, as being entitled to the most
                                      honorable place near Him.

                          Christ will not be the only one to judge on that day;
                          others will be associated with Him. Of these, some
                          will judge only in the sense of serving as a basis for

                          good, or the wicked will judge the more wicked,
                          according to Matthew 12:41: “The men of Nineveh shall
                          rise in judgment with this generation and shall
                          condemn it.” And some will judge by giving their
                          approval to ‘the sentence; in this way all the just
                          shall judge, according to Wisdom 3:7 ff: “The just...
                          shall judge nations.” But some will judge with a
                          certain judicial power delegated to them by Christ,
                          having “two-edged swords in their hands,” as is
                          indicated in Psalm 149:6.

                              This last kind of judicial power the Lord promised
                              to the apostles, in Matthew 19:28, when He said:
                              “You who have followed Me, in the regeneration,
                              when the Son of man shall sit on the seat of His
                              majesty you also shall sit on twelve seats,
                              judging the twelve tribes of Israel.” We are not
                              to conclude from this that only the Jews who
                              belong to the twelve tribes of Israel will be
                              judged by the apostles, for by the twelve tribes
                              of Israel are understood all the faithful who have
                              been admitted to the faith of the patriarchs. As
                              for infidels, they will not be judged, but have
                              already been judged.

                                  neque Iudas iudicabit; nec Paulus, qui plus

                                  Similarly, the twelve apostles who walked with

                                  only ones who will judge. Judas assuredly will
                                  not judge, and Paul, on the other hand, who
                                  labored more than the rest, will not lack
                                  judicial power, especially as he himself says,
                                  1 Corinthians 6:3: “Know you not that we shall
                                  judge angels?” This dignity pertains properly
                                  to those who have left all to follow Christ,
                                  for such was the promise made to Peter in
                                  answer to his question in Matthew 19:27:
                                  “Behold, we have left all things and have
                                  followed Thee; what therefore shall we have?”
                                  The same thought occurs in Job 36:6: “He gives
                                  judgment to the poor.”

                                      said, the investigation will deal with the
                                      actions of men who have used earthly
                                      things well or ill. Correctness of
                                      judgment requires that the mind of the
                                      judge should be unswayed by those matters
                                      about which he has to judge; and so the
                                      fact that some have their minds completely
                                      detached from earthly things gives them a
                                      title to judicial authority.

                          Having reviewed the doctrines pertaining to the truth
                          of the Christian faith, we should advert to the fact
                          that all the teachings thus set forth are reduced to
                          certain articles: twelve in number, as some think, or
                          fourteen, according to others.

                              occurrit rationi incomprehensibile, ibi oportet
                              esse novum articulum. Est igitur unus articulus
                              pertinens ad divinitatis unitatem: quamvis enim
                              Deum esse unum ratione probetur, tamen eum sic

                              Faith has to do with truths that surpass the
                              comprehension of reason. Hence, whenever a new
                              truth incomprehensible to reason is proposed, a
                              new article is required. One article pertains to
                              the divine unity. For, even though we prove by
                              reason that God is one, the fact that He governs
                              all things directly or that He wishes to be
                              worshiped in some particular way, is a matter
                              relating to faith. Three articles, are reserved
                              for the three divine persons. Three other articles
                              are formulated about the effects produced by God:
                              creation, which pertains to nature; justification,
                              which pertains to grace; and reward, which
                              pertains to glory. Thus seven articles altogether
                              are devoted to the divinity.

                                  Concerning the humanity of Christ, seven more
                                  are proposed. The first is on the incarnation
                                  and conception of Christ. The second deals
                                  with the nativity, which involves a special
                                  difficulty because of our Lord’s coming forth
                                  from the closed womb of the Virgin. The third
                                  article is on the death, passion, and burial;
                                  the fourth on the descent into hell; the fifth
                                  on the resurrection; the sixth on the
                                  ascension; and the seventh treats of Christ’s
                                  coming for the judgment. And so there are
                                  fourteen articles in all.

                                      articulo remunerationis: et sic duo
                                      articuli sunt de Deo, unus de unitate, et
                                      alius de Trinitate; quatuor de effectibus,
                                      unus de creatione, alius de

                                      Similiter circa fidem humanitatis Christi,

                                      Other authorities, reasonably enough,
                                      include faith in the three persons under
                                      one article, on the ground that we cannot
                                      believe in the Father without believing in
                                      the Son and also in the Holy Spirit, the
                                      bond of love uniting the first two
                                      persons. However, they distinguish the
                                      article on the resurrection from the
                                      article on eternal reward. Accordingly,
                                      there are two articles about God, one on
                                      the unity, the other on the Trinity. Four
                                      articles deal with God’s effects: one with
                                      creation, the second with justification,
                                      the third with the general resurrection,
                                      and the fourth with reward. Similarly, as
                                      regards belief in the humanity of Christ,
                                      these authors comprise the conception and
                                      the nativity under one article, and they
                                      also include the passion and death under
                                      one article. According to this way of
                                      reckoning, therefore, we have twelve
                                      articles in all.

                              The Prince of the Apostles has left us an
                              admonition urging us to render an account not only
                              of our faith, but also of the hope that is in us
                              [1 Pet 3:15]. In the first part of the present
                              work we have briefly set forth the teaching of
                              Christian faith. We now turn to the task of
                              undertaking, in compendious fashion, an exposition
                              of the truths pertaining to hope.

                                  We should recall that in one kind of
                                  knowledge, man’s desire can come to rest. We
                                  naturally desire to know truth, and when we do
                                  know it, our craving in this direction is
                                  satisfied. But in the knowledge of faith man’s
                                  desire never comes to rest. For faith is
                                  imperfect knowledge: the truths we accept on
                                  faith are not seen. This is why the Apostle
                                  calls faith “the evidence of things that
                                  appear not” (Heb. 11:1).

                                      Accordingly, even when we have faith,
                                      there still remains in the soul an impulse
                                      toward something else, namely, the perfect
                                      vision of the truth assented to on faith,
                                      and the attainment of whatever can lead to
                                      such truth. As we pointed out above, among
                                      the various teachings of faith there is
                                      one according to which we believe that God
                                      exercises providence over human affairs.
                                      In consequence of this belief, stirrings
                                      of hope arise in the soul of the believer
                                      that by God’s help he may gain possession
                                      of the goods he naturally desires, once he
                                      learns of them through faith. Therefore,
                                      as we mentioned at the very beginning,
                                      next after faith, the virtue of hope is
                                      necessary for the perfection of Christian
                                      living.

                          in the order of divine providence, each being has
                          assigned to it a way of reaching its end in keeping
                          with its nature. To men, too, is appointed a suitable
                          way, that befits the conditions of human nature, of
                          obtaining what they hope for from God. Human nature
                          inclines us to have recourse to petition for the
                          purpose of obtaining from another, especially from a
                          person of higher rank, what we hope to receive from
                          him. And so prayer is recommended to men, that by it
                          they may obtain from God what they hope to secure from
                          Him.

                              ad hominem primum quidem, ut desiderium orantis et
                              necessitas exprimatur, secundo ut deprecati animus

                              quae ad Deum funditur, locum non habent. Non enim
                              in orando intendimus necessitates nostras aut
                              desideria Deo manifestare, qui omnium est
                              cognitor, unde et Psal. XXXVII, 10 dicit ei:
                              domine, ante te omne desiderium meum, et in
                              Evangelio dicitur Matth. VI, 32: scit pater vester
                              quia his omnibus indigetis. Nec etiam divina
                              voluntas verbis humanis flectitur ad volendum quod
                              prius noluerat, quia, ut dicitur Num. XXIII, 19:
                              non est Deus quasi homo ut mentiatur, nec ut
                              filius hominis, ut mutetur. Nec poenitudine
                              flectitur, ut dicitur I Reg. XV, 29. Sed oratio ad
                              obtinendum a Deo est homini necessaria propter
                              seipsum qui orat, ut scilicet ipsemet suos
                              defectus consideret, et animum suum flectat ad
                              ferventer et pie desiderandum quod orando sperat
                              obtinere: per hoc enim ad recipiendum idoneus
                              redditur. Est autem et alia differentia
                              consideranda orationis quae ad Deum et hominem
                              fit. Nam ad orationem quae fit ad hominem,
                              praeexigitur familiaritas, per quam sibi
                              deprecandi aditus pateat; sed ipsa oratio quae ad
                              Deum emittitur, familiares nos Deo facit, dum mens
                              nostra elevatur ad ipsum, et quodam spirituali
                              affectu Deo colloquitur, in spiritu et veritate
                              ipsum adorans, et sic familiaris effectus orando
                              aditum sibi parat ut iterum fiducialius oret. Unde
                              dicitur in Psal. XVI, 6: ego clamavi, scilicet
                              fiducialiter orando, quoniam exaudisti me Deus,
                              quasi per primam orationem in familiaritatem
                              receptus, secundo fiducialius clamet:

                              But the reason why prayer is necessary for
                              obtaining something from a man is not the same as
                              the reason for its necessity when there is
                              question of obtaining a favor from God. Prayer is
                              addressed to man, first, to lay bare - the desire
                              and the need of the petitioner, and secondly, to
                              incline the mind of him to whom the prayer is
                              addressed to grant the petition. These purposes
                              have no place in the prayer that is sent up to
                              God. When we pray we do not intend to manifest our
                              needs or desires to God, for He knows all things.
                              The Psalmist says to God: “Lord, all my desire is
                              before You” (Psalm 37:10); and in the Gospel we
                              are told: “Your Father knows that you have need of
                              all these things” (Matt. 6:32). Again, the will of
                              God is not influenced by human words to will what
                              He had previously not willed. For, as we read in
                              Numbers 23:19, “God is not a man, that He should
                              lie, nor as the son of man, that He should be
                              changed”; nor is God moved to repentance, as we
                              are assured in 1 Samuel 15:29. Prayer, then, for
                              obtaining something from God is necessary for man
                              on account of the very one who prays, that he may
                              reflect on his shortcomings and may turn his mind
                              to desiring fervently and piously what he hopes to
                              gain by his petition. In this way he is rendered
                              fit to receive the favor. Yet a further difference
                              between the prayer offered to God and that
                              addressed to man is to be marked. Prayer addressed
                              to a man presupposes a certain intimacy that may
                              afford the petitioner an opportunity to present
                              his request. But when we pray to God, the very
                              prayer we send forth makes us intimate with Him,
                              inasmuch as our soul is raised up to God and
                              converses with Him in spiritual affection, and
                              adores Him in spirit and truth. The familiar
                              affection thus experienced in prayer begets an
                              inducement in the petitioner to pray again with
                              yet greater confidence. And so we read in Psalm
                              16:6: “I have cried to You,” that is, in trusting
                              prayer, “for You, O God, have heard me”; as
                              though, after being admitted to intimacy in the
                              first prayer, the Psalmist cries out with all the
                              greater confidence in the second.

                                  For this reason, in prayer to God,
                                  perseverance or repetition of our supplication
                                  is not unseemly, but is regarded as acceptable
                                  to God. Indeed, “we ought always to pray and
                                  not to faint,” as we learn from Luke 18: 1.
                                  Our Lord, too, invites us to pray, for He
                                  said: “Ask, and it shall be given you...
                                  knock, and it shall be opened to you” (Matt.
                                  7:7). But in prayer addressed to man,
                                  persistence in begging becomes irritating.

                          Since, in addition to faith, hope is also necessary
                          for our salvation, our Savior, who inaugurated and
                          perfected our faith by instituting the heavenly
                          sacraments, thought it well to carry us on to a living
                          hope by giving us a form of prayer that mightily
                          raises up our hope to God. Thus we are taught by God
                          Himself what we ought to request from Him. He would
                          not urge us to pray unless He were determined to hear
                          us; no one asks another for a favor unless he has hope
                          in him, and he asks only what he hopes for. Therefore,
                          in teaching us to ask God for benefits, Christ exhorts
                          us to hope in God, and He shows us what we ought to
                          hope for from Him by making known to us what to
                          request.

                          The reason why we must hope in God is chiefly the fact
                          that we belong to Him, as effect belongs to cause. God
                          does nothing in vain, but always acts for a definite
                          purpose. Every active cause has the power of producing
                          its effect in such a way that the effect will not be
                          wanting in whatever can advance it toward its end.
                          This is why, in effects produced by natural causes,
                          nature is not found to be deficient in anything that
                          is necessary, but confers on every effect whatever
                          goes into its composition and is required to carry
                          through the action whereby it may reach its end. Of
                          course, some impediment may arise from a defect in the
                          cause, which then may be unable to furnish all this.

                              A cause that operates intellectually not only
                              confers on the effect, in the act of producing it,
                              all that is required for the result intended, but
                              also, when the product is finished, controls its
                              use, which is the end of the object. Thus a smith,
                              in addition to forging a knife, has the
                              disposition of its cutting efficiency. Man is made
                              by God somewhat as an article is made by an
                              artificer. Something of this sort is said in
                              Isaiah 64:8: “And now, Lord, You art our Father
                              and we are clay, and You art our Maker.”
                              Accordingly, just as an earthen vessel, if it were
                              endowed with sense, might hope to be put to good
                              use by the potter, so man ought to cherish the
                              hope of being rightly provided for by God. Thus we
                              are told in Jeremiah 18:6: “As clay is in the hand
                              of the potter, so are you in My hand, O house of
                              Israel.”

                                  Deo confidit, sperantem non confundit, ut
                                  dicitur Rom. V, 5.

                                  The confidence which man has in God ought to
                                  be most certain. As we just intimated, a cause
                                  does not refrain from rightly controlling its
                                  product unless it labors under some defect.
                                  But no defect or ignorance can occur in God,
                                  because “all things are naked and open to His
                                  eyes,” as is said in Hebrews 4:13. Nor does He
                                  lack power, for “the hand of the Lord is not
                                  shortened that it cannot save,” as we read in
                                  Isaiah 59:1. Nor is He wanting in good will,
                                  for “the Lord is good to those who hope in
                                  Him, to the soul that seeks Him,” as we are
                                  reminded in Lamentations 3:25. Therefore the
                                  hope with which a person trusts in God does
                                  not confound him that hopes, as is said in
                                  Romans 5:5.

                                      habere de Deo, non solum ut conserventur
                                      in esse secundum conditionem suae naturae,
                                      quod competit ceteris creaturis, sed etiam

                                      Psal. XXXV, v. 7, dicitur: homines et

                                      We should also bear in mind that, while
                                      Providence watches solicitously over all
                                      creatures, God exercises special care over
                                      rational beings. For the latter are
                                      exalted to the dignity of God’s image, and
                                      can rise to the knowledge and love of Him,
                                      and have dominion over their actions,
                                      since they are able to discriminate
                                      between good and evil. Hence they should
                                      have confidence in God, not only that they
                                      may be preserved in existence in keeping
                                      with the condition of their nature—for
                                      this pertains also to other creatures—but
                                      that, by avoiding evil and doing good,
                                      they may merit some reward from Him. We
                                      are taught a salutary lesson in Psalm
                                      35:7: “Men and beasts You will preserve,”
                                      that is God bestows on men and irrational
                                      creatures alike whatever pertains to the
                                      sustaining of life. And then the Psalmist
                                      adds, in the next verse: “But the children
                                      of men shall put their trust under the
                                      cover of your wings,” indicating that they
                                      will be protected by God with special
                                      care.

                                          We should observe, further, that when
                                          any perfection is conferred, an
                                          ability to do or acquire something is
                                          also added. For example, when the air
                                          is illuminated by the sun, it has the
                                          capacity to serve as a medium for
                                          sight, and when water is heated by
                                          fire it can be used to cook, and it
                                          could hope for this if it had a mind.
                                          To man is given, over and above the
                                          nature of his soul, the perfection of
                                          grace, by which he is made a partaker
                                          in the divine nature, as we are taught
                                          in 2 Peter 1:4. As a result of this,
                                          we are said to be regenerated and to
                                          become sons of God, according to John
                                          1:12: “He gave them power to be made
                                          the sons of God.” Thus raised to be
                                          sons, men may reasonably hope for an
                                          inheritance, as we learn from Romans
                                          8:17: “If sons, heirs also.” In
                                          keeping with this spiritual
                                          regeneration, man should have a yet
                                          higher hope in God, namely, the hope
                                          of receiving an eternal inheritance,
                                          according to 1 Peter 1:3 f.: “God...
                                          has regenerated us into a lively hope,
                                          by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
                                          from the dead, into an inheritance
                                          incorruptible and undefiled and that
                                          cannot fade, reserved in heaven for
                                          you.”

                                              Through this “spirit of adoption”
                                              that we receive, we cry: “Abba,
                                              (Father),” as is said in Romans
                                              8:15. Hence our Lord began His
                                              prayer by calling upon the Father,
                                              saying, “Father,” to teach us that
                                              our prayer must be based on this
                                              hope. By uttering the name,
                                              “Father,” man’s affection is
                                              prepared to pray with a pure
                                              disposition, and also to obtain
                                              what he hopes for. Moreover, sons
                                              ought to be imitators of their
                                              parents. Therefore he who
                                              professes that God is his Father
                                              ought to try to be an imitator of
                                              God, by avoiding things that make
                                              him unlike God and by earnestly
                                              praying for those perfections that
                                              make him like to God. Hence we are
                                              commanded in Jeremiah 3:19: “You
                                              shall call Me Father and shall not
                                              cease to walk after Me.” If, then,
                                              as Gregory of Nyssa reminds us [
                                              <i>De oratione dominica</i>, II],

                          secundum illud Ephes. V, 1: estote imitatores Dei,

                          autem dilectio non privata est, sed communis ad omnes:
                          diligit enim omnia quae sunt, ut dicitur Sap. XI, 25;
                          et specialiter homines, secundum illud Deut. XXXIII,
                          3: dilexit populos. Et ideo, ut Cyprianus dicit,
                          publica est nobis et communis oratio; et quando
                          oramus, non pro uno tantum, sed pro populo toto
                          oramus, quia totus populus unum sumus. Pro se igitur

                          altero autem caritas fraternitatis hortatur. Et ideo
                          non dicimus, pater meus, sed pater noster.

                          He who looks on himself as a son of God, ought, among
                          other things, to imitate our Lord especially in His
                          love, as we are urged to do in Ephesians 5:1 ff.: “Be
                          therefore followers of God as most dear children, and
                          walk in love.” God’s love is not restricted to any
                          individual, but embraces all in common; for God loves
                          “all things that are,” as is said in Wisdom 11:25.
                          Most of all He loves men, according to Deuteronomy
                          33:3: “He loved the people.” Consequently, in
                          Cyprian’s words, “our prayer is public and is offered
                          for all; and when we pray, we do not pray for one
                          person alone, but for the whole people, because we are
                          all together one people” [
                          <i>Liber de oratione dominica</i>, VIII]. Or, as
                          Chrysostom says, “Necessity forces us to pray for
                          ourselves, but fraternal charity impels us to pray for
                          others” [Pseudo-Chrysostom,
                          <i>In Evangelium Matthaei</i>, hom. XIV]. This is why
                          we say, “Our Father,” and not simply “My Father.”

                              unde dicitur II Cor. I, 10-11: eripiet nos
                              adiuvantibus et vobis in oratione pro nobis; unde
                              et Iac. V, 16, dicitur: orate pro invicem ut
                              salvemini. Ut enim dicit Ambrosius, multi minimi,
                              dum congregantur et unanimes fiunt, fiunt magni,
                              et multorum preces impossibile est ut non
                              impetrent, secundum illud Matth. XVIII, 19: si duo

                              porrigimus, sed quasi ex unanimi consensu dicimus,
                              pater noster.

                              At the same time we should remember that, although
                              our hope rests chiefly on God’s help, we can aid
                              one another to obtain more easily what we ask for.
                              St. Paul says, in 2 Corinthians 1:10 ff.: God will
                              “deliver us, you helping withal in prayer for us.”
                              And in James 5:16 we are exhorted: “Pray one for
                              another, that you may be saved.” For, as Ambrose
                              reminds us, “many insignificant people, when they
                              are gathered together and are of one mind, become
                              powerful, and the prayers of many cannot but be
                              heard” [Ambrosiaster,
                              <i>In epistolam ad Romanos</i>, XV]. This agrees
                              with Matthew 18: 19: “If two of you shall consent
                              upon earth concerning anything whatsoever they
                              shall ask, it shall be done to them by My Father
                              who is in heaven.” Therefore we do not pour forth
                              our prayers as individuals, but with unanimous
                              accord we cry out, “Our Father.”

                                  1: iustificati ex fide pacem habeamus ad Deum
                                  per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, per quem

                                  misit Deus filium suum (...), ut adoptionem
                                  filiorum reciperemus. Tali igitur tenore Deum

                                  unigeniti non derogetur, unde Augustinus
                                  dicit: noli tibi aliquid specialiter
                                  vindicare. Solius Christi specialiter est

                                  Let us also reflect that our hope reaches up
                                  to God through Christ, according to Romans 5:1
                                  ff.: “Being justified therefore by faith, let
                                  us have peace with God, through our Lord Jesus
                                  Christ, by whom also we have access through
                                  faith into this grace wherein we stand, and
                                  glory in the hope of the glory of the sons of
                                  God.” Through Him who is the only-begotten Son
                                  of God by nature, we are made adopted sons:
                                  “God sent His Son... that we might receive the
                                  adoption of sons,” as is said in Galatians 4:4
                                  ff. Hence, in acknowledging that God is our
                                  Father, we should do so in such a way that the
                                  prerogative of the Only-begotten is not
                                  disparaged. In this connection Augustine
                                  admonishes us: “Do not make any exclusive
                                  claims for yourself. In a special sense, God
                                  is the Father of Christ alone, and is the
                                  Father of all the rest of us in common. For
                                  the Father begot Him alone, but created us”
                                  [really Ambrose, <i>De sacramentis</i>, V.
                                  19]. This, then, is why we say: “Our Father.”

                          When hope is abandoned, the reason is usually to be
                          found in the powerlessness of him from whom help was
                          expected. The confidence characteristic of hope is not
                          wholly grounded on the mere willingness to help
                          professed by him on whom our hope rests: power to help
                          must also be present. We sufficiently express our
                          conviction that the divine will is ready to help us
                          when we proclaim that God is our Father. But to
                          exclude all doubt as to the perfection of His power,
                          we add: “who art in heaven.” The Father is not said to
                          be in heaven as though He were contained by heaven; on
                          the contrary, He encompasses heaven in His power, as
                          is said in Sirach 24:8: “1 alone have compassed the
                          circuit of heaven.” Indeed, God’s power is raised
                          above the whole immensity of heaven, according to
                          Psalm 8:2: “Your magnificence is elevated above the
                          heavens.” And so, to strengthen the confidence of our
                          hope, we hail the power of God which sustains and
                          transcends the heavens.

                              excluditur. Sunt enim aliqui qui res humanas
                              fatali necessitati siderum subdunt, contra illud
                              quod dicitur Ier. X, 2: a signis caeli nolite

                              liberari a malis. Ut igitur nec hoc orantium

                              speramus, impediri non potest.

                              This same phrase removes a certain obstacle that
                              may stand in the way of our prayer. Some people
                              act as though human affairs were subjected to a
                              deterministic fatalism imposed by the stars,
                              contrary to what is commanded in Jeremiah 10:2:
                              “Be not afraid of the signs of heaven, which the
                              heathens fear.” If this error had its way, it
                              would rob us of the fruit of prayer. For if our
                              lives were subjected to a necessity decreed by the
                              stars, nothing in our course could be changed. In
                              vain we should plead in our prayer for the
                              granting of some good or for deliverance from
                              evil. To prevent this error from undermining
                              confidence in prayer, we say: “who art in heaven,”
                              thus acknowledging that God moves and regulates
                              the heavens. Accordingly the assistance we hope to
                              obtain from God cannot be obstructed by the power
                              of heavenly bodies.

                                  Deum, oportet ut ea petat homo quae dignum est

                                  sapientia suggerit, non caelestis. Et ideo
                                  Chrysostomus dicit: cum dicimus, qui es in
                                  caelis, non Deum ibi concludimus, sed a terra
                                  abducitur orantis animus, et excelsis
                                  regionibus affigitur.

                                  In order that prayer may be efficacious at the
                                  court of God, man must ask for those benefits
                                  which he may worthily expect from God. Of old
                                  some petitioners were rebuked: “You ask and
                                  receive not, because you ask amiss” (James
                                  4:3). Anything suggested by earthly wisdom
                                  rather than by heavenly wisdom, is asked for
                                  in the wrong spirit. And so Chrysostom assures
                                  us that the words, “who art in heaven,” do not
                                  imply that God is confined to that locality,
                                  but rather indicate that the mind of him who
                                  prays is raised up from the earth and comes to
                                  rest in that celestial region [
                                  <i>In Matthaeum</i>, hom. XIX, 4].

                                      from praying. This is the notion that
                                      human life is far removed from divine
                                      providence. The thought is given
                                      expression, in the person of the wicked,
                                      in Job 22:14: “The clouds are His cover;
                                      He does not consider our things, and He
                                      walks about the poles of heaven”; also in
                                      Ezekiel 8: 12: “The Lord does not see us,
                                      the Lord has forsaken the earth.”

                                          contrary in his sermon to the
                                          Athenians, when he said that God is
                                          “not far from every one of us; for in
                                          Him we live and move and are” (Acts
                                          17:27 f.). That is, our being is
                                          preserved, our life is governed and
                                          our activity is directed by Him. This
                                          is confirmed by Wisdom 14:3: “Your
                                          providence, Father, governs all things
                                          from the beginning. Not even the most
                                          insignificant of living things are
                                          withdrawn from God’s providence, as we
                                          are told in Matthew 10:29 f.: “Are not
                                          two sparrows sold for a farthing? And
                                          not one of them shall fall on the
                                          ground without your Father. But the
                                          very hairs of your head are all
                                          numbered.” Men are placed under the
                                          divine care in a yet more excellent
                                          way, so that in comparison with them
                                          the Apostle could ask: “Does God take
                                          care of oxen?” (1 Cor. 9:9). The
                                          meaning is not that God has no concern
                                          at all for such animals, but that He
                                          does not take care of them in the same
                                          way He does of men, whom He punishes
                                          or rewards in accordance with their
                                          good or evil actions, and whom He
                                          foreordains to eternal life. This is
                                          why, in the words quoted from Matthew,
                                          our Lord says: “The very hairs of your
                                          head are all numbered,” thus
                                          indicating that everything belonging
                                          to man is to be recovered at the
                                          resurrection.

                                              be banished from our lives. For,
                                              as our Lord adds, in the same
                                              context: “Fear not, therefore;
                                              better are you than many sparrows”
                                              (Matt. 10:31). This clarifies the
                                              passage we called attention to
                                              above: “The children of men shall
                                              put their trust under the cover of
                                              your wings” (Ps. 35:8).

                                                  “Draw near to God, and He will
                                                  draw near to you.”
                                                  Confirmation of this is found
                                                  in Psalm 144: 18: “The Lord is
                                                  near to all who call upon Him:
                                                  to all who call upon Him in
                                                  truth.” Indeed, He not only
                                                  draws near to them: He even

                                                  as is intimated in Jeremiah
                                                  14:9: “You, O Lord, are among

                                                      the just and sinners seems
                                                      to be as great as the

                                                      we pray, because it is in

                                                      rises. The hope of the

                                                      indicated in Isaiah 51:16:
                                                      “That You might plant the

                                                      earth.” He who has made
                                                      them heavens will not

                                                      from them.

                          Deo sperare debemus. Ubi considerandum est, quod spes
                          desiderium praesupponit: unde ad hoc quod aliquid sit
                          sperandum, primo requiritur quod sit desideratum. Quae
                          enim non desiderantur, sperari non dicuntur, sed
                          timeri vel etiam despici. Secundo oportet quod id quod
                          speratur, possibile esse aestimetur ad consequendum,
                          et hoc spes supra desiderium addit: potest enim homo
                          desiderare etiam ea quae non aestimat se posse
                          adipisci, sed horum spes esse non potest. Tertio
                          requiritur quod id quod sperandum est, sit aliquid
                          arduum, nam ea quae parva sunt, magis despicimus quam
                          speremus, vel si ea desideramus, quasi in promptu ea
                          habentes, non videmur ea sperare quasi futura, sed
                          habere quasi praesentia.

                          Having treated of the truths that lead men to hope in
                          God, we must go on to inquire what are the blessings
                          we ought to hope to receive from Him. In this
                          connection we should observe that hope presupposes
                          desire. Before a thing can be hoped for, it must first
                          be desired. Things that are not desired are not said
                          to be objects of hope; rather they are feared or even
                          despised. Secondly, we must judge that what is hoped
                          for is possible to obtain; hope includes this factor
                          over and above desire. True, a man can desire things
                          he does not believe he is able to attain; but he
                          cannot cherish hope with regard to such objects.
                          Thirdly, hope necessarily implies the idea that the
                          good hoped for is hard to get: trifles are the object
                          of contempt rather than of hope. Or, if we desire
                          certain things and have them, as it were, to hand, we
                          are not deemed to hope for them as future goods, but
                          to possess them as present to us.

                              Ulterius autem considerandum est, quod arduorum
                              quae quis se sperat adepturum, quaedam aliquis se
                              sperat adipisci per alium, quaedam vero per se
                              ipsum. Inter quae hoc differre videtur, quod ad ea
                              obtinenda quae per se homo consequi sperat,
                              conatum propriae virtutis adhibet: ad ea vero
                              obtinenda quae se ab alio consequi sperat,
                              interponit petitionem: et si quidem ab homine
                              illud se adipisci sperat, vocatur simplex petitio;
                              si autem sperat illud obtinere a Deo, vocatur
                              oratio, quae, ut Damascenus dicit, est petitio
                              decentium a Deo.

                              We should further note that among the difficult
                              things a person hopes to obtain, there are some he
                              hopes to get through the good offices of another,
                              and some that he hopes to acquire through his own
                              efforts. The difference between these two classes
                              of goods seems to come to this: to obtain the
                              things he hopes to acquire by himself, a man
                              employs the resources of his own power; to obtain
                              what he hopes to receive from another, he has
                              recourse to petition. If he hopes to receive such
                              a benefit from a man, his request is called simple
                              petition; if he hopes to obtain a favor from God,
                              it is called prayer, which, as Damascene says, “is
                              a petition addressed to God for suitable goods” [
                              <i>De fide orthodoxa</i>, III, 24].

                                  de alio homine, sed solum spes quam habet de
                                  Deo, unde dicitur Ierem. XVII, 5: maledictus

                                  However, the hope a man places in his own
                                  powers or in another man does not pertain to
                                  the virtue of hope; that virtue is limited to
                                  the hope he has in God. Hence we are told in
                                  Jeremiah 17:5: “Cursed be the man who trusts
                                  in man, and makes flesh his arm”; and a little
                                  farther on: “Blessed be the man who trusts in
                                  the Lord, and the Lord shall be his
                                  confidence.” This shows us that the goods our
                                  Lord teaches us to ask for in His prayer are
                                  to be regarded as possible, yet not easy to
                                  get; access to them is afforded by God’s help
                                  and not by human power.

                          In this connection we must heed the order of desire,
                          as regulated by charity, so that a corresponding order
                          of goods to be hoped and asked for from God may be
                          established. The order of charity requires us to love
                          God above all things. And so charity moves our first
                          desire in the direction of the things that are of God.
                          But desire has to do with future good, and nothing in
                          the future can accrue to God, considered as He is in
                          Himself, since He is eternally the same. Therefore our
                          desire cannot bear on things that belong to God, as
                          they are considered in themselves: we may not
                          entertain the idea that God can acquire some goods He
                          does not already possess. Rather, our love regards
                          these goods in such a way that we love them as
                          existing. However, we can desire, with respect to God,
                          that He who exists forever great in Himself, may be
                          magnified in the thoughts and reverence of all men.

                              LXXXVIII, 48, dicitur: numquid enim vane

                              This is not to be dismissed as impossible. For,
                              since man was made for the very purpose of knowing
                              God’s greatness, he would seem to have been
                              created in vain if he were unable to attain to the
                              perception of this attribute, contrary to what is
                              said in Psalm 88:48: “Did You made all the
                              children of men in vain?” If this were the case,
                              the desire of nature, whereby all men naturally
                              desire to know something of the divine
                              perfections, would be fruitless. Indeed, no man is
                              completely deprived of knowledge of God, as we are
                              taught in Job 36:25: “All men see Him.” Yet such
                              knowledge of God is hard to obtain; indeed, it is
                              beyond all human power, according to Job 36:26:
                              “Behold, God is great, exceeding our knowledge.”

                                  grace of divine revelation, as we are told in
                                  Matthew 11:27: “No one knows the Son but the
                                  Father; nor does any one know the Father but
                                  the Son, and he to whom it pleases the Son to
                                  reveal Him.” Hence Augustine says, in his
                                  commentary on John, that no one knows God
                                  unless He who knows manifests Himself” [

                                              As a result of the imperfection of
                                              this knowledge, it happened that
                                              men, wandering from the truth,
                                              erred in various ways concerning
                                              the knowledge of God, to such an
                                              extent that, as the Apostle says
                                              in Romans 1:21 ff., some “became
                                              vain in their thoughts, and their
                                              foolish heart was darkened; for,
                                              professing themselves to be wise,
                                              they became fools, and they
                                              changed the glory of the
                                              incorruptible God into the
                                              likeness of the image of a
                                              corruptible man and of birds and
                                              of four-footed beasts and of
                                              creeping things.” To recall men
                                              from this error, God gave them a
                                              clearer knowledge of Himself in
                                              the Old Law, through which men
                                              were brought back to the worship
                                              of the one God. Thus the truth is
                                              announced in Deuteronomy 6:4:
                                              “Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God
                                              is one Lord.” But this information
                                              about God was wrapped up in the
                                              obscurities of figurative
                                              language, and was confined within
                                              the limits of one nation, the
                                              Jewish people, as is indicated in
                                              Psalm 75:2: “In Judea God is
                                              known; His name is great in
                                              Israel.”

                                                  name. Our Lord Himself began
                                                  this work among His disciples,
                                                  as He tells us in John 17:6:
                                                  “I have manifested Your name
                                                  to the men whom You gave Me
                                                  out of the world.” But His
                                                  intention in imparting
                                                  knowledge of the Deity was not
                                                  limited to the disciples; He
                                                  wished this knowledge to be
                                                  promulgated through them to
                                                  the whole world. This is why
                                                  He adds the prayer: “That the
                                                  world may believe that You
                                                  sent Me” (John 17:21). He
                                                  carries on His task without
                                                  intermission through the
                                                  apostles and their successors;
                                                  by their ministry men are
                                                  brought to the knowledge of

                                                  1:11: “From the rising of the

                          regnum Dei convenienter desideretur. Secundo vero quod
                          ad id adipiscendum homo possit pervenire. Tertio vero

                          sed solo auxilio divinae gratiae. Et sic quarto
                          considerandum est, quomodo regnum Dei advenire

                          After desiring and praying for the glory of God, man
                          is led to desire and ask that he may be given a share
                          in divine glory. And so the second petition is worded:
                          “Your kingdom come.” In discussing this petition, we
                          shall follow the same procedure as we observed in
                          treating of the preceding petition. We shall consider,
                          first, that we do right to desire the kingdom of God;
                          secondly, that man can attain to the possession of
                          this kingdom; thirdly, that he can attain to it not by
                          his own powers, but only with the help of divine
                          grace. And then, in the fourth place, we must inquire
                          into the sense in which we pray that the kingdom of
                          God may come.

                              Est igitur circa primum considerandum quod
                              unicuique rei naturaliter appetibile est proprium
                              bonum, unde et bonum convenienter definiunt esse
                              quod omnia appetunt. Proprium autem bonum
                              uniuscuiusque rei est id quo res illa perficitur:
                              dicimus enim unamquamque rem bonam, ex eo quod
                              propriam perfectionem attingit. Intantum vero
                              bonitate caret, inquantum propria perfectione
                              caret, unde consequens est ut unaquaeque res suam
                              perfectionem appetat, unde et homo naturaliter
                              appetit perfici. Et cum multi sint gradus
                              perfectionis humanae, illud praecipue et
                              principaliter in eius appetitum naturaliter cadit,
                              quod ad ultimam eius perfectionem spectat. Hoc
                              autem bonum hoc indicio cognoscitur, quod naturale
                              desiderium hominis in eo quiescit. Cum enim
                              naturale desiderium hominis non tendat nisi in
                              bonum proprium, quod in aliqua perfectione
                              consistit, consequens est quod quamdiu aliquid
                              desiderandum restat, nondum pervenit homo ad
                              ultimam perfectionem suam.

                              As to the first point, we should note that to
                              every being its own good is naturally desirable.
                              Hence good is conveniently defined as that which
                              all desire. The proper good of any being is that
                              whereby it is brought to perfection. We say that a
                              thing is good inasmuch as it reaches its proper
                              perfection. On the other hand, a thing lacks
                              goodness so far as it is lacking in its proper
                              perfection. Consequently each thing seeks its own
                              perfection, and so man, too, naturally desires to
                              be perfected. And, since there are many degrees of
                              human perfection, that good chiefly and primarily
                              comes under man’s desire which looks to his
                              ultimate perfection. This good is recognized by
                              the sure sign that man’s natural desire comes to
                              rest in it. For, since man’s natural desire always
                              inclines toward his own good which consists in
                              some perfection, the consequence is that as long
                              as something remains to be desired, man has not
                              yet reached his final perfection.

                                  Something can thus remain to be desired in two
                                  ways. First, when the thing desired is sought
                                  for the sake of something else; when it is
                                  obtained, desire cannot cease, but must be
                                  borne along toward that other object.
                                  Secondly, when a thing does not suffice to
                                  provide what man desires; for instance, a
                                  meager portion of food is not enough to
                                  sustain nature, and so does not satisfy
                                  natural appetite.

                                      and mainly desires must be of such a
                                      nature that it is not sought for the sake
                                      of something else and that it satisfies
                                      man. This good is commonly called
                                      happiness, inasmuch as it is man’s
                                      foremost good: we say that certain people
                                      are happy because we believe that
                                      everything goes well with them. It is also
                                      known as beatitude, a word that stresses
                                      its excellence. It can also be called
                                      peace, so far as it brings quiet; for
                                      cessation of appetite appears to imply
                                      interior peace. This is indicated in the
                                      words of Psalm 147:14: “Who has placed
                                      peace in your borders.”

                                          We see clearly that man’s happiness or
                                          beatitude cannot consist in material
                                          goods. The first reason for this is
                                          that such goods are not sought for
                                          their own. sake, but are naturally
                                          desired because of something else.
                                          They are suitable for man by reason of
                                          his body. But man’s body is
                                          subordinated to his soul as to its
                                          end. For the body is the instrument of
                                          the soul that moves it, and every
                                          instrument exists for the good of the
                                          art that employs it. Furthermore, the
                                          body is related to the soul as matter
                                          is related to form. But form is the
                                          end of matter, just as act is the end
                                          of potency. Consequently man’s final
                                          happiness does not consist in riches
                                          or in honors or in health and beauty
                                          or in any goods of this kind.

                                              The second reason why happiness is
                                              not to be found in material goods
                                              is that such goods cannot satisfy
                                              man. This is clear on many scores.
                                              In the first place, man has a
                                              twofold appetitive power, one
                                              intellectual, the other sensitive.
                                              Consequently he has a twofold
                                              desire. But the desire of the
                                              intellectual appetite veers
                                              chiefly toward intelligible goods,
                                              which exceed the competency of
                                              material goods. Secondly, material
                                              goods, as being the lowest in the
                                              order of nature, do not contain
                                              all goodness but possess only a
                                              portion of goodness, so that one
                                              object has this particular aspect
                                              of goodness, for example, the
                                              power to give pleasure, while
                                              another object has a different
                                              advantage, for instance, the power
                                              to cause bodily well-being, and so
                                              on of the rest. In none of them
                                              can the human appetite, which
                                              naturally tends toward universal
                                              good, find complete satisfaction.
                                              Nor can full satisfaction be found
                                              even in a large number of such
                                              goods, no matter how much they may
                                              be multiplied, for they fall short
                                              of the infinity of universal good.
                                              Thus we are assured in
                                              Ecclesiastes 5:9 that “a covetous
                                              man shall not be satisfied with
                                              money.” Thirdly, since man by his
                                              intellect apprehends the universal
                                              good that is not circumscribed by
                                              space or time, the human appetite,
                                              consistently with the apprehension
                                              of the intellect, desires a good
                                              that is not circumscribed by time.
                                              Hence man naturally desires
                                              perpetual stability. But this
                                              cannot be found in material
                                              things, which are subject to
                                              corruption and to many kinds of
                                              change. Therefore the human
                                              appetite cannot find the
                                              sufficiency it needs in material
                                              goods. Accordingly man’s ultimate
                                              happiness cannot consist in such
                                              goods.

                                                      Likewise, such happiness
                                                      is not found in that
                                                      activity of the human
                                                      intellect whereby the soul
                                                      reflects on itself. There
                                                      are two reasons for this.
                                                      In the first place the
                                                      soul, considered in its
                                                      own nature, is not
                                                      beatified. Otherwise it
                                                      would not have to labor
                                                      for the attainment of
                                                      beatitude. Therefore it
                                                      does not acquire beatitude
                                                      from the mere
                                                      contemplation of itself.
                                                      In the second place,
                                                      happiness is the ultimate
                                                      perfection of man, as was
                                                      stated above. Since the
                                                      perfection of the soul
                                                      consists in its proper
                                                      activity, its ultimate
                                                      perfection is to be looked
                                                      for on the plane of its
                                                      best activity, and this is
                                                      determined by its best
                                                      object, for activities are
                                                      specified according to
                                                      their objects. But the
                                                      soul is not the best
                                                      object to which its
                                                      activity can tend. For it
                                                      is aware that something
                                                      exists that is better than
                                                      itself. Hence man’s
                                                      ultimate beatitude cannot
                                                      consist in the activity
                                                      whereby he makes himself
                                                      or any of the other higher
                                                      substances the object of
                                                      his intellection, as long
                                                      as there is something
                                                      better to which the action
                                                      of the human soul can
                                                      turn. Man’s activity may
                                                      extend to any good
                                                      whatever, for the
                                                      universal good is what man
                                                      desires, since he
                                                      apprehends universal good
                                                      with his intellect.
                                                      Therefore, whatever may be
                                                      the degree to which
                                                      goodness extends, the
                                                      action of the human
                                                      intellect, and hence also
                                                      of the will, reaches out
                                                      toward it in some way. But
                                                      good is found supremely in
                                                      God, who is good by His
                                                      very essence, and is the
                                                      source of every good.
                                                      Consequently man’s
                                                      ultimate perfection and
                                                      final good consist in
                                                      union with God, according
                                                      to Psalm 72:28: “It is
                                                      good for me to adhere to
                                                      my God.”

                          Oportet autem ulterius ostendere, quod homo ad illud
                          regnum pervenire possit: alioquin frustra speraret et
                          pateretur. Primo autem apparet hoc esse possibile ex
                          promissione divina, dicit enim dominus, Luc. XII, 32:
                          nolite timere pusillus grex, quia complacuit patri
                          vestro dare vobis regnum. Est autem divinum
                          beneplacitum efficax ad implendum omne quod disponit,
                          secundum illud Isai. XLVI, 10: consilium meum stabit,
                          et omnis voluntas mea fiet. Voluntati enim eius quis
                          resistit? Ut dicitur ad Roman. IX, 19. Secundo
                          ostenditur hoc esse possibile ex evidenti exemplo.

                          We must go on to show that man can reach that kingdom.
                          Otherwise it would be hoped for and prayed for in
                          vain. In the first place, the divine promise makes
                          this possibility clear. Our Lord says, in Luke 12:32:
                          “Fear not, little flock, for it hath pleased your
                          Father to give you a kingdom.” God’s good pleasure is
                          efficacious in carrying out all that He plans,
                          according to Isaiah 46: 10: “My counsel shall stand,
                          and all My will shall be done.” For, as we read in
                          Romans 9: 19: “Who can resist His will?” Secondly, an
                          evident example shows that attainment of the kingdom
                          is possible.

                                The <i>Compendium theologiae</i> breaks off at
                                this point. Death prevented St. Thomas from
                                finishing the book. His opusculum,
                                <i>Expositio orationis dominicae</i>, though
                                probably a <i>reportatio</i>, gives us an idea
                                of the plan he very likely would have followed
                                in completing Part II of the Compendium. Part
                                III, on the virtue of charity, was to have
                                developed the theme indicated in the opening
                                chapter of the present work, that we should
                                carry out God’s will through love.
