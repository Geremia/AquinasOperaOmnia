            Iudaeis; hic prosequitur de his quae specialiter passus est a

            praedixerat, Matth. XX, 18 s., et Lc. XVIII, v. 32:
            <i

              crucifigendum</i

            2371 Above, the Evangelist gave us an account of what Christ
            suffered from the Jews; here he describes what in particular he
            endured from the Gentiles. He suffered three things, as he had
            predicted: "They will deliver him to the Gentiles, to be mocked and
            scourged and crucified" (Matt 20:19). First, he deals with the
            scourging of Christ; secondly, with his mockery (v 2); and thirdly,
            with his crucifixion (v 4).

            Dicit ergo <i>tunc ergo</i>, idest post clamorem omnium,
            <i>apprehendit Pilatus Iesum et flagellavit</i>, non quidem propriis
            manibus, sed per milites: et hoc ideo ut Iudaei satiati eius
            iniuriis, mitigarentur et usque ad eius mortem saevire desisterent.
            Naturale est enim ut ira quiescat, si videat eum contra quem
            irascitur, humiliatum et punitum, ut dicit philosophus in rhetorica.
            Quod quidem verum est in ira quae quaerit nocumentum proximi cum
            mensura, sed non in odio, quod totaliter quaerit exitium eius qui
            habetur odio. Eccli. XII, 16:
            <i>inimicus si invenerit tempus, non satiabitur sanguine</i>. Isti
            autem ex odio movebantur ad Christum, et ideo flagellatio non
            sufficiebat. Ps. LXXII, 14: <i>fui flagellatus tota die</i>; Is. l,
            6: <i>dedi corpus meum percutientibus</i>.

            2372 He says, <b>Then</b>, after all their shouting,
            <b>Pilate took Jesus and scourged him,</b> not with his own hands,
            but using his soldiers. He did this hoping that the Jews would be
            satisfied with these wounds and be softened so as no longer to
            demand his death. For it is natural for our anger to subside if we
            see the one we are angry at humiliated and punished, as the
            Philosopher says in his <i>Rhetoric.</i>

            This is true of that anger which seeks to inflict a limited amount
            of harm; but it is not the case of that hatred which seeks the
            entire destruction of the one hated: "An enemy... if he finds an
            opportunity his thirst for blood will be insatiable" (Sir 12:16).
            Now the Jews hated Christ, and so his scourging did not satisfy
            them: "All the day long I have been scourged" [Ps 73:14]; "I gave my
            back to the smiters" (Is 50:6).

            Sed numquid haec intentio Pilatum excusat a flagellatione? Non
            quidem, quia in omnibus quae sunt per se mala, nullum eorum potest

            innocentem, et praecipue Dei filium, est maxime per se malum; et

            2373 Does this intention excuse Pilate for the scourging? It does
            not; because of all those things which are evil in themselves
            <i>(per se),</i> none can be made totally good by a good intention.
            Now to harm an innocent person, and especially the Son of God, is in
            the highest degree an evil in itself. Consequently, it cannot be
            excused by any intention.

            2375 They mock him with a crown, because it is customary for kings
            to wear a crown, a crown of gold: "A crown of gold upon his head"
            [Sir 45:12]. The Psalm (21:3) mentions this: "Thou dost set a crown
            of fine gold upon his head."

            "In that day the Lord of hosts will be a crown of glory, and a
            diadem of beauty, to the remnant of his people" (Is 28:5). It was
            appropriately made of thorns, because by them he removes the thorns
            of sin, which pain us through remorse of conscience: "Break up your
            fallow ground, and sow not among thorns" (Jer 4:3). These thorns
            also take away the thorns of punishment which burden us: "Thorns and
            thistles it shall bring forth to you" (Gen 3:18).

            Supra prosecutus est Evangelista de his quae Christus passus est a
            Iudaeis; hic prosequitur de his quae specialiter passus est a
            gentilibus: a quibus quidem tria passus est, secundum quod ipse
            praedixerat, Matth. XX, 18 s., et Lc. XVIII, v. 32:
            <i

              crucifigendum</i
            >
            et cetera. Primo ergo Evangelista agit de Christi flagellatione;
            secundo de eius illusione, ibi
            <i
              >et milites plectentes coronam de spinis, imposuerunt capiti
              eius</i
            >; tertio de eius crucifixione, ibi <i>exivit iterum Pilatus</i> et
            cetera. Hic agit Evangelista de Christi crucifixione, et primo ponit
            ipsam crucifixionem; secundo addit de eius morte, ibi
            <i>postea sciens Iesus quia omnia consummata sunt</i> etc.; tertio
            de sepultura, ibi
            <i>post haec rogavit Pilatum Ioseph ab Arimathaea</i> et cetera.
            Circa crucifixionem primo ponit Pilati et Iudaeorum disceptationem;
            secundo Christi condemnationem, ibi
            <i>Pilatus autem cum hoc audisset, magis timuit</i>; tertio ponit
            sententiae executionem, ibi <i>susceperunt autem Iesum</i>.
            Disceptabat autem Pilatus cum Iudaeis, volens liberare Christum. Et
            ideo primo ponit quomodo nititur eum liberare ipsum Iudaeis
            ostendendo; secundo eius innocentiam allegando, ibi
            <i>dixit eis Pilatus: accipite eum vos</i> et cetera. Circa primum
            duo facit. Primo ponit demonstrationem; secundo demonstrationis
            effectum, ibi <i>cum ergo vidissent eum pontifices</i> et cetera.

            2379 Now the Evangelist treats of the crucifixion of Christ: first,
            the crucifixion itself; secondly, the death of Christ (v 28); and
            thirdly, his burial (v 38). As to the crucifixion, he first mentions
            the dispute Pilate had with the Jews; secondly, we have the
            sentencing of Christ (v 8); and thirdly, the sentence is carried out
            (v 17). Pilate, wanting to release Christ, began arguing with the
            Jews. First, the Evangelist shows how Pilate tried to release Christ
            by exhibiting him to the crowd; secondly, by declaring his
            innocence, <b>I find no crime in him.</b> As regards the first, the
            Evangelist shows Jesus being shown to the crowd; and secondly, the
            effect this had, <b>Crucify him.</b>

            <i>ut cognoscatis quia nullam invenio in eo causam</i>, scilicet
            mortis. Quare ergo turpiter tractasti, impie Pilate, sine causa?
            Scilicet ne Iudaei credant quod ob favorem eum dimittam. Qualis enim
            favor praestatur ei cui tot inferuntur flagella? Vel ideo ut haec
            eius ludibria inimici libentissime viderent, et ulterius sanguinem
            non sitirent; quasi dicat: si reus esset mortis, ita condemnarem eum
            sicut flagellavi. Fortassis tamen aliqua levia fecit contra legem,
            propter quae flagellationem tantum promeruit, non autem mortem.

            2380 Three things are mentioned concerning Christ's exhibition to
            the Jews. First there is the intention of Pilate, which was to free
            him. He says,
            <b>Pilate went out again,</b> from the praetorium,
            <b>and said to them,</b> to the Jews who were waiting there,
            <b>Behold, I am bringing him out to you,</b> for this purpose,
            <b>that you may know that I find no crime in him,</b>
            deserving of death. Why then, unrighteous Pilate, was there this
            shameful bargaining if there was no crime in him? Was it so the Jews
            would not believe that you would release him because you were
            partial to him? What kind of partiality is that when you give one so
            much thrashing? Or perhaps it was so that his enemies, gladly seeing
            his disgrace, would no longer thirst for blood. Pilate is saying in
            effect: If there were a reason for his death, I would condemn him
            just like I have scourged him. Perhaps he has committed some minor
            infraction of the law, which did deserve a scourging, but there was
            nothing deserving of death.

              vestimentum</i

            illuditur, ut saltem quiescant dum ad eos exit, non clarus imperio,
            sed plenus opprobrio. Ps. LXVIII, 8:
            <i

              meam</i

            2381 Secondly, we see Christ being presented before the crowd,
            <b
              >Jesus came out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple
              robe.</b
            >
            He was exhibited in the same robe he wore when he was mocked by the
            officers in the hope that the crowd would be appeased when they saw
            him, not respected for his authority, but entirely dishonored: "For
            it is for your sake that I have borne reproach, that shame has
            covered my face" (Ps 69:7). This teaches us that we should be ready
            to undergo any kind of disrespect for the name of Jesus Christ:
            "Fear not the reproach of men, and be not dismayed at their
            revilings" (Is 51:7).

            <i>ecce homo</i>, quasi despective loquendo, quod aliquis sic
            despectus vellet sibi usurpare regnum. Ecce de quali homine creditis

            words of Pilate,
            <b>Here is the man!</b> spoken in a sarcastic way, as if one so
            disgraced would dare to usurp a kingship. Look at the kind of person
            you are accusing of this! The words of the Psalm (22:6) apply to
            him: "I am a worm, and no man." And so, if you do hate your king,
            spare him now because you see him dishonored. "When disgrace
            increases, let your hatred decrease,"

            2383 Now we see the effect of this exhibition on the Jews. No matter
            how disgraced and wretched and beaten he appeared, their hatred did
            not lessen, but was still burning and growing.
            <b>When the chief priests and the officers saw him,</b>
            when Jesus was brought out,
            <b>they cried out, Crucify him, crucify him!</b>
            Their desire was so strong that they shouted this twice. And they
            will not be satisfied with any kind of death, but demand the most
            dishonorable kind, crucifixion: "Let us condemn him to a shameful
            death" (Wis 2:20). He said, <b>When they saw him,</b> because the
            sight of the one they hated only served to incite and inflame their
            hearts with more hatred: "The very sight of him is a burden to us"
            (Wis 2:15).

            claiming a kingdom, although they had thought he would be especially
            inclined by this to kill him. And since this crime was not enough to
            put Christ to death, the Jews thought that when Pilate said,
            <b>Take him yourselves and crucify him,</b>
            he was asking if they had another crime, a violation of the law, for
            which he could be condemned and for which they were condemning him.

            2387 The crime against the Jewish law that they charged Christ with
            was that
            <b>he has made himself the Son of God,</b>
            and for this he deserved death: "This was why the Jews sought all
            the more to kill him, because he not only broke the sabbath, but
            also called God his Father, making himself equal with God" (5:18);
            and again, "We stone you for no good work but for blasphemy; because
            you, being a man, make yourself God" (10:33). They always said that
            "he made himself the Son of God," assuming he was not. But this was
            not against the law, as Christ proved to them before (10:34), by
            citing the Psalm (82:6): "I say, You are gods." For if other people,
            who are adopted children, can call themselves children of God
            without blasphemy, how much more can Christ do this, who is the Son
            of God by nature. But they regarded him as a liar and blasphemer,
            each of which deserved death, because they did not understand his
            eternal generation [from the Father].

            excuses, since he had come to suffer. At the same time he is for us
            an example of patience, and fulfilled what is found in Isaiah
            (53:7): "like a sheep that before its shearers is dumb, so he opened
            not his mouth." It says, "like a sheep," to show that the silence of
            Jesus was not that of a man convicted of sin and aware of his evil,
            but the silence of a gentle person being sacrificed for the sins of
            others.

              Caesar's friend; every one who makes himself a king sets himself
              against Caesar." 13 When Pilate heard these words [he grew more
              fearful], he brought Jesus out and sat down on the judgment seat
              [tribunal] at a place called The Pavement [Lithostrotos], and in
              Hebrew, Gabbatha. 14 Now it was the day of Preparation of the
              Passover; it was about the sixth hour. He said to the Jews, "Here
              is your King!" 15 They cried out, "Away with him, away with him,
              crucify him!" Pilate said to them, "Shall I crucify your King?"
              The chief priests answered, "We have no king but Caesar." 16 Then
              he handed him over to them to be crucified. 17 So they took Jesus,
              and he went out, bearing his own cross, to the place called the
              place of a skull [Calvary], which is called in Hebrew Golgotha. 18
              There they crucified him, and with him two others, one on either

            affectaret. Ipse semper solus cum discipulis sedebat, pauper in
            cibo, habitu et habitatione. Sed, ut dicitur Prov. XXVIII, 1:

            2402 In regard to the first, the Evangelist indicates the motive of
            Pilate when he says,
            <b>When Pilate heard these words he grew more fearful</b>, for it
            was not as easy for him to ignore Caesar, the source of his power,
            as it was to disdain the laws of a foreign people. So he says,
            <b>he brought Jesus out.</b> But there was no reason for Pilate to
            fear, because Jesus was not setting himself against Caesar. Christ
            had no purple, no scepter, no diadem, no chariots, no soldiers to
            indicate that he was seizing a kingdom. Rather, Christ always sat
            alone with his disciples, plain in food, in clothing and in
            dwelling. Yet as we read in Proverbs (28:1), "The wicked flee when
            no one pursues." "They trembled in fear when there was no fear" [Ps
            53:5]; "Be not afraid of their words, nor be dismayed at their
            looks" (Ez 2:6).

            2403 Then he mentions the place saying,
            <b>and sat down on the tribunal.</b> A tribunal is the seat of a
            judge, like the throne is the seat of a king, and the professor's
            chair is the seat of a master: "A king who sits on the throne of
            judgment winnows all evil with his eyes" (Prv 20:8). It was called a
            tribunal because among the Romans it was the tribunes (named from
            the tribes they headed) who adjudicated in certain cases. This
            tribunal was
            <b>at a place called Lithostrotos,</b>

            "stone," and the place where Pilate sat in his judgment seat had

            Among the Jews the Sabbath was in some respects more solemn than any
            other feast, insofar as out of reverence for that day no food was
            prepared on the Sabbath; it was prepared on the preceding Friday.
            Thus this Friday was called the day of Preparation of the Passover.
            This practice had its origin when the Jews in the desert were
            forbidden to gather manna on the Sabbath, but were directed to
            gather a double supply the day before (Ex 16:24). In this matter
            they yielded to no feast. Accordingly, although the present Friday
            was a solemn feast for them, they still prepared the Sabbath food on
            that day.

            Sed ad hoc est duplex responsio, secundum Augustinum. Prima et
            melior est, quod Christus dupliciter fuit crucifixus. Primo linguis
            et vocibus Iudaeorum dicentium,
            <i>crucifige, crucifige eum</i>; secundo manibus militum, qui eum
            crucifixerunt. Unde Iudaei, quia crucifixionem volebant imponere
            gentilibus. Marcus, qui Evangelium scripsit gentibus, ipsam imposuit
            Iudaeis, dicens, quod tunc Christum crucifixerunt quando Iudaei
            clamaverunt <i>crucifige, crucifige eum</i>; quod fuit in hora
            tertia. Ioannes vero, qui sequitur ordinem temporis, dicit
            <i>erat quasi hora sexta</i>: nam quando Christus fuit in cruce, iam
            erat in fine horae quintae et in principio horae sextae, in qua
            factae sunt tenebrae per tres horas, scilicet usque ad horam nonam.
            Unde quia hora sexta nondum inchoata erat, ideo dicit
            <i>quasi hora sexta</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            According to Augustine, there are two explanations for this.
            <a href="John19.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>
            The first, and better, is that Christ was crucified two times: once
            by the tongues and words of the shouting Jews, "Crucify him, crucify
            him" (v 6), and the second time by the hands of the soldiers who
            nailed him to the cross. Now the Jews wanted to blame the
            crucifixion on the Gentiles. And so Mark, who wrote his gospel for
            the Gentiles, blamed it on the Jews, saying that Christ was
            crucified by the Jews when at the third hour they shouted, "Crucify
            him, crucify him." It is John who follows the real time and he says,
            <b>it was about the sixth hour.</b>
            For when Christ was on the cross it was at the end of the fifth hour
            and at the beginning of the sixth, when darkness came and lasted
            three hours, that is, until the ninth hour. He says,
            <b>about the sixth hour</b>
            because the sixth hour had not yet begun.

            Secunda responsio est, quia parasceve dicitur praeparatio Paschae;
            Pascha autem nostrum Christus est immolatus: unde praeparatio
            parasceve est praeparatio immolationis Christi: cuius erat hora
            sexta et non diei, quia principium huius praeparationis fuit hora
            noctis nona, quando Christo capto dicebant:
            <i>reus est mortis</i>. Unde si tribus reliquis horis noctis addamus
            tres horas diei, quando Christus crucifixus fuit, manifestum est
            quod sexta hora parasceve, idest praeparationis, crucifixus fuit,
            licet hora diei esset tertia, ut dicit Marcus. Et certe congruit
            quod in sexta hora crucifigeretur: quia per crucem reparavit hominem
            sexta die conditum, et sexta aetate.
          </td>
          <td>
            The second explanation is that the preparation of the Passover was
            mentioned, and our Passover, Christ, was about to be immolated. Thus
            the preparation of the Passover is the preparation for the
            immolation of Christ. This preparation began at the ninth hour of
            the night, when the Jews shouted, to the captured Christ, "He
            deserves death" (Mt 26:66). If to the three remaining hours of the
            night we add the three hours of the day, when Christ was crucified,
            we can see that he was crucified at the sixth hour of the
            preparation, although this was the third hour of the day, as Mark
            says. And it was appropriate that he was crucified at the sixth hour
            because by his cross he restored human nature which was created on
            the sixth day.

            Although this seems extremely bizarre to the irreligious and to
            unbelievers, it is a great mystery for believers and the devout:
            "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but
            to us who are being saved it is the power of God" (1 Cor 1:18).
            Christ bore his cross as a king does his scepter; his cross is the
            sign of his glory, which is his universal dominion over all things:
            "The Lord will reign from the wood" [Ps 95:9
            <i>sic</i>
            ]; "The government will be upon his shoulder, and his name will be
            called 'Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince
            of Peace.'" (Is 9:6). He carried his cross as a victor carries the
            trophy of his victory: "He disarmed the principalities and powers
            and made a public example of them, triumphing over them in himself"
            [Col 2:15]. Again, he carried his cross as a teacher his
            candelabrum, as a support for the light of his teaching, because for
            believers the message of the cross is the power of God: "No one
            after lighting a lamp puts it in a cellar or under a bushel but on a
            stand, that those who enter may see the light" (Lk 11:33).

            2415 The place where Christ suffered was also dishonorable, and for
            two reasons. First, it was outside the city,
            <b>he went out to the place called Calvary</b>, which is outside the
            walls of the city: "So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order
            to sanctify the people through his own blood" (Heb 13:12). This
            passion of Christ was outside the walls of the city to show that the
            effectiveness of his passion was not enclosed within the boundaries
            of the Jewish nation, and to indicate that those who want to obtain
            the fruit of his passion also have to go out from the world, at
            least with their affections. Thus the Apostle says in his next
            sentence, "Therefore let us go forth to him outside the camp" (Heb
            13:13).

            <b>to the place called Calvary.</b>
            "I am reckoned among those who go down to the Pit" (Ps 88:4).
            Chrysostom tells us that there are some who say that Adam died and
            was buried at this very place. This is why it was called Calvary,
            from the skull (<i>calvaria</i>) of the first man. And just as death
            reigned there, so there also Christ erected the trophy of his
            victory.

            Sed, ut Hieronymus dicit, favorabilis est huiusmodi interpretatio et
            mulcens aures populi, non tamen vera, quia Adam sepultus est in
            Hebron: Iosue XIV, 15:
            <i>Adam maximus inter Enacim situs est</i>. Et ideo dicendum, quod
            ex Ierusalem foras portam locus erat in quo truncabantur capita
            damnatorum: unde hic locus Calvariae nomen sumpsit propter

            However, as Jerome says, this is the popular interpretation and
            attractive to the people, but it is not true, because Adam was
            buried at Hebron: "Adam the greatest among the Anakim was buried
            there" [Jos 14:15].

            and it was there that the heads of the condemned were cut off. It
            was called Calvary because the skulls of the beheaded were strewn
            there.

            to his dishonor, for it implied that the cause of his death was
            similar to that of the criminals: "He was numbered with the

            <i

            statuet quidem oves a dextris, haedos autem a sinistris. Unde latro

            But if we contemplate this mystery, we see that it is related to the
            glory of Christ. It shows that by his suffering Christ merited the
            authority to judge: "Your cause has been judged as one of the
            wicked. You will recover cause and judgment" [Job 36:17]. And it is
            the function of a judge to be in the middle of the parties; so the
            Philosopher says that to go to a judge is to go to the middle.
            <a href="John19.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a>
            Christ was also placed in the middle, one on his right, another on
            his left, because in the judgment he will place the sheep on his
            right, and the goats on his left. It was the criminal on his right
            who believed and was saved; the one on his left, who reproached him,
            was condemned.

              19 Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross; it read,

              read this title, for the place where Jesus was crucified was near
              the city; and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek. 21
              The chief priests of the Jews then said to Pilate, "Do not write,
              'The King of the Jews,' but, 'This man said, I am King of the
              Jews.'" 22 Pilate answered, "What I have written I have written."
              23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus they took his garments
              and made four parts, one for each soldier; also his tunic. But the
              tunic was without seam, woven from top to bottom; 24 so they said
              to one another, "Let us not tear it, but cast lots for it to see
              whose it shall be." This was to fulfill the scripture, "They
              parted my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast
              lots." 25 So the soldiers did this. But standing by the cross of
              Jesus were his mother, and his mother's sister, Mary the wife of
              Clopas, and Mary Magdalene. 26 When Jesus saw his mother and the
              disciple whom he loved standing near, he said to his mother,
              "Woman, behold your son!" 27 Then he said to the disciple,

            consequentibus ipsam, et primo de his quae sequuntur crucifixionem

            Ponuntur autem tria pertinentia ad Pilatum, scilicet tituli
            inscriptio, tituli lectio, tituli conservatio.

            2418 The Evangelist just told of Christ's crucifixion; now he
            mentions things that accompanied and followed it: first, as they
            relate to Pilate; secondly as they relate to the soldiers; and
            finally, he tells about Christ's friends who were standing by (v
            25). Concerning Pilate, we see the title being written on the cross,
            its being read, and its retention.

            Quantum ad primum duo ponuntur. Primo inscriptio tituli, unde dicit
            <i>scripsit autem et titulum Pilatus, et posuit super crucem</i>. Et
            hoc satis convenienter: ut saltem per hoc vindicaret se de Iudaeis,
            ostendens ipsorum malitiam, dum in regem suum insurrexerunt. Sed
            tamen convenit mysterio; quia sicut in triumphis in trophaeo titulus
            ponebatur victoriam ostendens, per hoc quod homines memoriam sui
            celebrare volebant, Gen. XI, v. 4:
            <i
              >celebremus nomen nostrum antequam dividamur in universas
              terras</i
            >, ita titulum cruci inscribi disposuit, ut passio eius in memoria
            haberetur, Thren. III, 19:
            <i
              >recordare paupertatis meae et transgressionis meae, absinthii et

            2419 Two things are mentioned about the first of these. First, the
            writing of the title,
            <b>Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross</b>. This was
            understandable, for it was a way of getting back at the Jews by
            showing their malice in rising up against their own king. It was
            also appropriate for this mystery, for just as inscriptions are
            placed on trophies of victory so the people will remember and
            celebrate the victory ‑ "Let us make a name for ourselves, before we
            are scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth" [Gen 11:4] ‑
            so it was arranged that a title was put on the cross so that the
            sufferings of Christ would be remembered: "Remember my affliction
            and my bitterness, the wormwood and the gall!" (Lam 3:19).

            Secundo ponitur tenor tituli:
            <i>erat autem scriptum: Iesus Nazarenus rex Iudaeorum</i>. Quae
            quidem tria verba satis conveniunt ad crucis mysterium, nam hoc quod
            dicit <i>Iesus</i>, qui salvator interpretatur, convenit ad virtutem
            crucis, per quam nobis facta est salus; Matth. I, 21:
            <i
              >vocabis nomen eius Iesum, ipse enim salvum faciet populum suum a
              peccatis eorum</i
            >. Hoc vero quod dicit <i>Nazarenus</i>, quod interpretatur
            floridus, pertinet ad patientis innocentiam; Cant. c. II, 1:
            <i>ego flos campi, et lilium convallium</i> Is. XI, 1:
            <i>et flos de radice eius ascendet</i>. Hoc vero quod dicit
            <i>rex Iudaeorum</i>, pertinet ad potestatem, ad dominium quod ex
            passione promeruit. Phil. II, 9:
            <i>propter quod et Deus illum exaltavit</i>; Ier. XXIII, 5:
            <i>regnabit dominus, et sapiens erit</i>; Is. IX, 7:
            <i>super solium David et super regnum eius sedebit</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            2420 Secondly, he mentions the content of the title,
            <b>Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews,</b>
            words which are very fitting for this mystery of the cross. The word
            Jesus, which means Savior, corresponds to the power of the cross by
            which we have been saved: "You shall call his name Jesus, for he
            will save his people from their sins" (Mt 1:21). The word Nazareth,
            which means abounding in flowers, corresponds to the innocence of
            the one suffering: "I am a rose of Sharon, a lily of the valleys"
            (Song 2:1); "A flower will rise up out of his root" [Is 11:1]. The
            words <b>King of the Jews</b> accord with the power, the dominion,
            which Christ earned by his suffering: "Therefore God has highly
            exalted him" (Phil 2:9); "He shall reign as King and be wise" (Jer
            23:5); he will sit "upon the throne of David and over his kingdom"
            (Is 9:7).

            Sed cum ipse sit per crucem non solum rex Iudaeorum sed etiam

            XI, 17. Et sicut oleaster particeps fit pinguedinis olivae, non

          <td>
            2421 Through his cross Christ is not just the King of the Jews, but
            of all people ‑ for after we read, "I have set my king on Zion,"
            there follows, "Ask of me and I will make the nations your heritage"
            (Ps 6:8). Why then did the Evangelist write only
            <b>King of the Jews</b> ? I answer that the Gentiles were grafted on
            to the abundant olive tree (Rom 11:17). And just like a graft comes
            to share in the abundance of the olive tree, and it is not the olive
            tree that acquires the bitterness of the graft, so those Gentiles
            who were converted to the faith were made spiritually Jews, not by a
            circumcision of the flesh, but of the spirit. And so in saying the
            <b>King of the Jews,</b> non‑Jewish converts are also included.

            facultas, et haec est duplex. Una est ex loci propinquitate:

            quem multi confluebant: alia ex Scripturae multiplicitate, quia
            <i>erat scriptum Hebraice, Graece et Latine</i>: ut nullus
            ignoraret, et quia hae tres linguae prae ceteris eminebant. Hebraea
            quidem propter unius Dei cultum; Graeca propter sapientiam; Latina
            propter Romanorum potentiam. Unde hae tres gentes sibi dignitatem
            vindicant in cruce Christi, ut dicit Augustinus. In quo signatur

            religiosi, qui signantur per Hebraeam linguam; sapientes qui per

            quod Christus dominari debebat theologicae philosophiae, quae
            significatur per Hebraeam, quia Iudaeis est tradita divinarum rerum
            cognitio; per Graecam vero philosophiae naturali et philosophicae:
            nam Graeci erga naturalium speculationem insudaverunt; per Latinam

          <td>
            2422 Next we see that the title was read,
            <b>Many of the Jews read this title.</b> The fact that it was read
            signifies that more are saved by faith, by reading about the passion
            of Christ, than were saved by actually seeing it: "These are written
            that you may believe" (20:31). Secondly, the Evangelist mentions how
            easy this was to read: first, because Jesus was crucified near the
            city,
            <b>the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city,</b>
            where many people passed; and secondly, because it was written in a
            number of languages, and it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in
            Greek, so that no one would fail to know it, and because these three
            languages were the most widely known. Hebrew was known because it
            was used in the worship of the one true God; Greek was known because
            it was used in the writings of the wise; and Latin was known due to
            the power of Rome. As Augustine says, these three tongues assumed a
            certain dignity by being associated with the cross of Christ.
            <a href="John19.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a>
            Further, the Hebrew tongue signified that by the cross of Christ
            those who were devout and religious were to be converted and ruled;
            and so were the wise, indicated by the Greek language; and so were
            those enjoying power, signified by the Latin language. Or, the use
            of Hebrew signified that Christ was to rule over theological
            teaching, because the knowledge of divine matters was entrusted to
            the Jews. The Greek signified that Christ was to rule over the
            knowledge of nature, for the Greeks were engaged in speculation
            about nature. Latin signified that Christ will rule over practical
            philosophy, because moral speculation was especially flourishing
            among the Romans. And so, all thought is brought into captivity and
            obedience to Christ, as we see in 2 Corinthians (10:5).

            had their king crucified. But if the title had read,
            <b>This man said, I am King of the Jews</b>, it would have been a
            taunting sarcasm against Christ and have indicated his crime. And
            this was what the chief priests wanted to do, to take away the
            reputation of the one they crucified as they had already taken away
            his life: "I am the talk of those who sit in the gate" (Ps 69:12).

            2424 Secondly, we read that Pilate was insistent on keeping the
            title. He refused to change it because he wanted to disgrace them.
            He said,
            <b>What I have written I have written</b>. This did not happen by
            chance; it had been arranged by God and predicted long before.
            Certain Psalms have as a title, "Do not Destroy. For David, for an
            inscription of a title." Indeed, Psalm 59 especially concerns the
            passion, "Deliver me from my enemies, O my God." And so do the two
            preceding Psalms: "Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful to me, for
            in thee my soul takes refuge" (Ps 57) and Psalm 58. And so it was
            folly for the chief priests to complain, for just as they could not
            destroy what the Truth had said, so also they could not destroy what
            Pilate had written. Pilate said,
            <b>What I have written I have written</b>, because what the Lord
            said, He said, as Augustine remarks.

            that the Evangelist says this to suggest that it was common and
            ordinary; for in Palestine the poor wear clothing made from many
            pieces of cloth, one sewn over another: "For you know the grace of

            2429 As for the mystical interpretation, this passage can be
            referred to the mystical body of Christ. Then Christ's garments are
            divided into four parts because the Church is spread over the four
            parts of the world: "As I live, says the Lord, you shall put them
            all on as an ornament, you shall bind them on as a bride does" (Is
            49:18). The tunic without seam, which was not divided, indicates
            charity, because the other virtues are not united by themselves, but
            by another, because all of them are directed to the ultimate end,
            and it is charity alone which unites us to this end. While it is
            faith which makes known our ultimate end, and by hope we tend toward
            it, only charity unites us to it: "And above all these put on love,
            which binds everything together" (Col 3:14).

            The tunic is said to be woven from the top because charity is above,
            at the top, of all the other virtues: "I will show you a still more
            excellent way" (1 Cor 12:31); "To know the love of Christ which
            surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of
            God" (Eph 3:19). Or, it is woven from the top because our charity
            does not come from ourselves, but from the Holy Spirit: "God's love
            has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has
            been given to us" (Rom 5:5). The tunic woven from the top can also
            signify the real body of Christ, because the body of Christ was
            formed by a higher power, one from the top, by the Holy Spirit "That
            which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit" (Mt 1:20).

            There is one way of casting lots which is a form of divination; this

            cast to know how things should be allotted or divided up; and this
            is lawful in earthly matters but not in spiritual things. The
            purpose of this is to submit to God's plan and will those matters

            but the decision is wholly from the Lord" (Prv 16:33); and again,

            standing far off, while John says that they stood by the cross. One
            could say in answer that the women mentioned by Matthew and Mark
            were not the same as those mentioned by John. However, the
            difficulty with this answer is that Mary Magdalene is in the group
            mentioned by Matthew and Mark, and also in the group mentioned by
            John. So one should say that all were referring to the same women.
            But there is no contradiction. Near and far are relative; and
            nothing prevents something from being near in one sense and far in
            another. The women were said to be near because they were within the
            range of sight, and they could be described as afar because other
            people were between them and Jesus. Or, one could say that when the
            crucifixion was beginning, the women were standing near Christ and
            were able to speak to him; while later, when a number of people came
            forward to taunt him, the women withdrew and stood further away.
            Thus John is telling what happened at first, and the other
            Evangelists what happened after.

            disciple, whom he entrusted to his mother; then we see his concern
            for his mother, whom he gave into the keeping of his disciple.

            hate our parents and ourselves, he is commanding us to love them,
            their own individual nature and our own individual nature, and to
            hate moral evil and what turns our natures away from God. This means
            that we must aid our parents, love and reverence them as these human
            beings, but hate their moral vices and what in them turns us away
            from God.

              stood there; so they put a sponge full of the vinegar on hyssop
              and held it to his mouth. 30 When Jesus had received the vinegar,
              he said, "It is finished"; and he bowed his head and gave up his
              spirit. 31 Since it was the day of Preparation, in order to
              prevent the bodies from remaining on the cross on the sabbath (for
              that sabbath was a high day), the Jews asked Pilate that their
              legs might be broken, and that they might be taken away. 32 So the
              soldiers came and broke the legs of the first, and of the other
              who had been crucified with him; 33 but when they came to Jesus
              and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs. 34
              But one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and at once
              there came out blood and water. 35 He who saw it has borne witness
              ‑ his testimony is true, and he knows that he tells the truth ‑
              that you also may believe. 36 For these things took place that the

            assertion that there are two souls in man is listed among the errors
            compiled in the book
            <i>The Dogmas of the Church,</i>

              might be broken, and that they might be taken away.</b

            In Deuteronomy (21:22) we see that it is a precept of the law that
            the bodies of the dead who had been hanged for crimes were not to be
            left hanging until the morning, lest the land be defiled, and to
            blot out the disgrace of those who were hanged, for this kind of
            death was regarded as most disgraceful: "a hanged man is accursed by
            God" (Deut 21:23). Although the Jews did not now have the authority
            to inflict this punishment, they still tried to do what they could.

            Another reason why this happened was to show that by the passion of
            Christ we acquire a complete cleansing from our sins and stains. We
            are cleansed from our sins by his blood, which is the price of our
            redemption: "You know that your were ransomed from the futile ways
            inherited from your fathers, not with perishable things, such as
            silver or gold, but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of
            a lamb without blemish or spot" (1 Pet 1:18). And we are cleansed
            from our stains by the water, which is the bath of our rebirth: "I
            will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all
            your uncleannesses" (Ez 36:25); "On that day there shall be a
            fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of
            Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness" (Zech 13:1). And
            so it is these two things which are especially associated with two
            sacraments: water with the sacrament of baptism, and blood with the
            Eucharist.

            2461 This truth is not just guaranteed by the testimony of the
            apostle; there is also a prophecy of scripture. Thus he says,
            <b
              >these things took place that the scripture might be fulfilled.</b
            >
            Here again, as before, the phrase
            <b>that the scripture might be fulfilled</b>, indicates the sequence
            of events. The Evangelist cites two authorities from the Old
            Testament. One refers to his statement that
            <b>they did not break his legs</b>
            and is found in Exodus (12:46), "You shall not break a bone if it,"
            that is, the Passover lamb, which was a prefiguration of Christ,
            because as we read in 1 Corinthians (5:7), "Christ, our paschal
            lamb, has been sacrificed." It was commanded that the bones of the
            Passover lamb should not be broken in order to teach us that the
            courage of the true Lamb and unspotted Jesus Christ would in no way
            be crushed by his passion. The Jews were trying to use the passion
            to destroy the power of Christ's teaching, but his passion only made
            it stronger: "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are
            perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God" (1
            Cor 1:18). This is why Jesus said before: "When you have lifted up
            the Son of man, then you will know that I am he" (8:28).

            Our text of Zechariah reads: "They will look on me whom they have
            pierced" [Zech 12:10]. If we join the statement of the Prophet to
            what the Evangelist says, it is clear that the crucified Christ is
            God, for what the Prophet says he says as God, and the Evangelist
            applies this to Christ.

            Nicodemus, who brought the spices. This is the same Nicodemus who
            came to Jesus at night, but this was before the passion (3:2). The

            body of Christ would soon corrupt without them: "You will not give
            your holy one to corruption" [Ps 16:10].

            facit mentionem nisi de Ioseph: et hic unam portavit. Sed quia solus
            Ioannes mentionem facit de Nicodemo, ideo dicit <i>linteis</i>, quia
            Nicodemus aliam portavit. Vel dicendum, quod linteum dicimus omnem
            pannum de lino factum. Corpus autem Christi involutum fuit fasciis,
            sicut etiam de Lazaro legitur, quia sic erat Iudaeis mos sepelire.
            Erat etiam positum sudarium ad caput: et ideo omnia complectens

            2467 With the spices ready, they prepared the body of Jesus,
            <b>they took the body of Jesus.</b>
            There is a question here, for John says that they bound it in linen
            cloths, while Matthew (27:59) says that they wrapped it in a linen
            cloth. One can answer, according to Augustine, that Matthew speaks
            of one linen cloth because he only mentioned Joseph, and he brought
            this one cloth.
            <a href="John19.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
            John alone mentions Nicodemus, and so he says "linen cloths,"
            because Nicodemus brought the other cloth. Or, again, the body of
            Christ was also wrapped in winding bands, as we read in the case of
            Lazarus, because this is the way the Jews buried their dead. A small
            cloth was also placed over his head. John includes all these in his
            words "linen cloths." From the fact that they anointed the body of
            Jesus with spices, we are taught that in the performance of such
            humane duties, we should follow the customs of each country.

            Christ was arrested in a garden, underwent his agony in a garden,
            and was buried in a garden. This indicates to us that by the power
            of Christ's passion we are freed from the sin which Adam committed
            in the Garden of delights, and that through Christ the Church is
            made holy, the Church, which itself is like a garden enclosed.

            <b>And in the garden a new tomb where no one had ever been laid.</b>
            There are two reasons why Christ wanted to be buried in a new tomb.
            The first is literal, and was so that no one would think that some
            other body which had been buried there had risen, and not Christ, or
            think that all bodies were of equal power. The other reason was that
            it was appropriate that he who was born of a virgin should be buried
            in a new tomb, so that just as there was no one before or after him
            in the womb of Mary, so also in this tomb. This also indicates to us
            that by faith Christ is hidden in the newborn soul: "that Christ may
            dwell in your hearts through faith" (Eph 3:17).
