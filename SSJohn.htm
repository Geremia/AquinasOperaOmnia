        >St. Thomas’ commentary on the Gospel of St. John is unique among his
        many writings on Sacred Scripture. It is the work of a master
        theologian, delivered at the University of Paris, then the intellectual
        center in Christendom, when Thomas was at the height of his fame and
        apostolic zeal for souls. A fourteenth-century list of Thomas’ writings
        notes that this commentary is a <i>reportatio</i> by Reginald of Piperno
        and adds “better than which none can be found.”</a

      A <i>reportatio</i> is a verbal report of an actual lecture taken down by
      a scribe or student in the course of actual delivery. In this case the
      scribe was the faithful Friar Reginald of Piperno, who had been the
      “constant companion,” or socius, for the last fifteen years of Thomas’
      short but busy life. The Italian Province of Dominicans wisely provided
      Thomas with this kind of personal secretary and general factotum after he
      returned from Paris as a Master in Sacred Theology in 1260.

    <p>
      A <i>reportatio</i> is not exactly a dictation in our sense of the term;
      it is more like a student’s notebook in shorthand containing basically the
      gist of what is being said, but usually with varying numbers of verbal
      omissions and inaccuracies. But this commentary is more than a mere
      scribal report. It was in fact “corrected” by Thomas himself—if we are to
      believe Tolomeo of Lucca, one of Thomas’ early biographers and
      confreres—before the commentary went into circulation through copies made
      by hand, the customary mode of publication before the era of the printing
      press. More than that: according to Bernard Gui, another confrere and
      early biographer, Thomas himself wrote out in full the commentary on the
      first five chapters of John (and hence this section ought to be considered
      an authentic <i>expositio</i>, or authoritative version), while the rest
      of it survived in the hand of Reginald, corrected by Thomas.
    </p>
    <p>
      This commentary was very popular in the Middle Ages, and it ranks among
      the best of Thomas’ work as a master theologian and saintly man of faith.
      It was read not only by theologians searching for the truth, but also by
      preachers and pious men and women desiring solid food for meditation and
      fervent prayer. Scattered throughout the world there still exist
      thirty-three complete and thirteen incomplete manuscript copies of this
      work, attesting to its considerable popularity before the age of printing.
      Innumerable copies of this work have no doubt been lost or destroyed in
      the tumult of centuries following the Middle Ages.
    </p>
    <p>
      This detailed commentary is St. Thomas’ personal response to the Word of
      God Incarnate as described in the sublime words of John “the Divine.” For
      St. Thomas, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob spoke to his chosen
      people through the mouth of prophets in the long course of salvation
      history, “But when the appointed time came, God sent his Son, born of a
      woman, born a subject of the Law, to redeem the subjects of the Law and to
      enable us to be adopted as sons” (Gal 4:4-5). This Incarnate Son, Jesus
      Christ, is the total manifestation of the Father, the Eternal Word made
      flesh. There is nothing left unsaid in the Word; the Father’s love is
      complete in the love the Son bears for the Father and for us. Christ’s
      whole life, his passion, death, and resurrection, are the praise and glory
      of the Father “through the working of the Holy Spirit.” “You must believe
      me when I say that I am in the Father and the Father is in me” (Jn 14:11).
      “Whatever you ask for in my name I will do, so that the Father may be
      glorified in the Son” (Jn 14:13). Christ’s “food” was to do the will of
      his Father in all things, thus glorifying the Father in Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of St. Thomas’ basic theological principles is that everything Jesus
      Christ did and said was for our instruction and imitation. Thus the
      sanctity of our lives is the on-going praise and glory of the Father,
      through the Son, by the working of the Holy Spirit. The very being of the
      Father is the unqualified affirmation of love for the Son and
      <i>for</i> us, in the Son. “God is love” (1 Jn 4:8). This love elicits
      from us an unreserved affirmation of love for God and neighbor, by which
      God is glorified and resplendent in us. The whole of our happiness is this
      eternal “glory” in tasting and seeing that the Lord is good (see Ps 34:8).
      This commentary is St. Thomas’ tasting and seeing the goodness of Jesus,
      the Word Incarnate, embodied in the tender words of St. John, the “beloved
      disciple,” who leaned on the breast of the Savior at the Last Supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thomas brought to his writing of this commentary on John all the resources
      at his disposal—which were considerable—especially the riches of the whole
      Patristic teaching of the “Saints” (the <i>sancti Doctores</i>), the
      wealth of a living tradition in the Roman Church contained in its
      teaching, laws, liturgy, and the living Spirit, as well as fidelity to the
      infallible norms of the Holy See.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an address to students and professors of the “Angelicum” (now the
      Pontifical University of St. Thomas in Rome) given on January 14, 1958,
      Pope Pius XII extolled the virtues of its patron, the Angelic Doctor, who
      serves as a divinely inspired guide in both philosophy and theology.

      Pope Pius spoke especially of St. Thomas’ own studies as a norm for every
      student of the religious disciplines. Just as St. Thomas diligently
      explored and studied the Bible as the font and life-spring of all
      theological studies, so too should the modern student find in biblical
      studies the source of his theological development. As St. Thomas himself
      assures us, “[sacred doctrine] uses the authority of the canonical
      Scriptures properly and of necessity in its investigations... for our
      faith is founded on the Revelation made to the Apostles and Prophets, who
      wrote the canonical books, but not on revelation (if such there be) made
      to other teachers.”

        ><img
          src="footnoteicon.gif"
          alt="Footnote"

          document.write(

          );
          document.write("<\/span>");
        }
      </script>
      In this conviction Thomas developed all his own theology. That is to say,
      the “complement” to Thomas’ speculations and synthesis are to be found in
      his commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments, especially
      those on the Epistles of St. Paul.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the opinion of those most expert to judge, Thomas’ commentaries on
      Scripture “shine with such solidity, subtlety, and precision that they can
      be numbered among his greatest theological works,” and are to be esteemed
      as such. “Wherefore, if anyone should neglect them, he is scarcely to be
      said to clearly and fully enjoy a familiarity and knowledge of the holy
      Angelic Doctor.” The significant fact is not that Pius XII emphasized the
      importance of studying Thomas’ biblical commentaries to Dominicans, who
      had made their special prerogative the teaching of “speculative Thomistic
      theology” and the pursuit of contemplative prayer. The significant fact is
      that Pius XII expressed these sentiments shortly before his death and
      fifteen years after one of his most important encyclicals,
      <i>Divino afflante spiritu</i> (30 Sept. 1943), the basic charter of all
      Catholic biblical studies in our day, leading to the Dogmatic Constitution
      on Divine Revelation, <i>Dei verbum,</i> of the Second Vatican Council (18
      Nov. 1965). In other words, the enormous advances of modern biblical
      studies do not automatically nullify the importance of St. Thomas’
      commentaries on the Sacred Text.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Thomas’ commentaries on the Sacred Text are typically
      <i>medieval,</i> that is, they lack the unction, colloquialism, and
      engaging informality of Patristic commentaries (which were largely
      homilies), and the technical and sometimes journalistic resources of
      modern commentaries, explanations, and paraphrases. In other words, it is
      easier to read St. Augustine’s commentary on John than it is to read St.
      Thomas’ or that of any other medieval writer addressing students in the
      “schools” of Paris and elsewhere. The big difference is between Patristic
      and Monastic commentaries, which were largely homiletic, pastoral,
      personal, and mystical, on the one hand, and Scholastic commentaries aimed
      at teaching students in the university or <i>studium</i> the literal
      meaning of the text. The style of medieval Scholastic commentaries is
      rather formal, literal, student-orientated and bookish. This style often
      makes such commentaries difficult for a modem reader to follow, and to
      some extent hinders him from deriving the greatest benefit for his mind
      and heart. At first glance such a “commentary”—with its definitions,
      divisions, arguments footnotes and concern for the orthodox meaning of the
      sacred message—may seem like searching for a needle in a haystack. But in
      the case of Thomas’ commentaries the reader may be confident that his
      efforts at discovering that needle will prove to be both intellectually
      and spiritually rewarding; once discovered, it will be valued as “the
      pearl of great price” (Mt 13:46).
    </p>
    <p>
      In this introduction I hope to show the historical context of this
      particular commentary and to indicate some aids to a fruitful study of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      First of all, this work is a biblical commentary by a master in a medieval
      university. In the Middle Ages, the Bible and the Bible alone was the
      official basis for the teaching of theology by fully qualified masters in
      the major universities of Europe. In fact, one could say with some
      justification that the ultimate goal of all medieval education was an
      understanding of the Bible for those who pursued the full course in the
      Faculty of Theology. Such an understanding was the nature of sacred
      theology <i>(fides quaerens intellectum,</i> “faith seeking
      understanding”). It was the source of all preaching of the Word of God,
      and it was the inexhaustible font of living water for the spiritual life.
      In order to reach such a lofty goal, much preparation was required. First,
      tools had to be acquired as a means of such study. This was the role of a
      good liberal arts education and the acquisition of philosophy, “the
      handmaid of theology.” The study of the liberal arts and the acquisition
      of philosophy were functions of the Arts Faculty in the university or
      <i>studium.</i> Approximately eight years were devoted by medieval
      students to acquiring these tools—roughly equivalent to our four years of
      high school and four years of college. After the full course had been
      completed in “the humanities,” the young man, generally in his
      mid-twenties, would begin his study of the Sacred Text, having already
      heard many sermons in Church and having received much instruction at home.
      His study of the Sacred Text began with <i>listening</i> and
      <i>reading.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Middle Ages, a personal copy of the Bible was relatively rare,
      certainly outside university circles. Every copy of the Bible was written
      out by hand on parchment, a writing surface made from carefully treated
      skins of sheep. Such a copy was extremely expensive and hard to come by.
      Although every student of theology tried desperately to obtain a personal
      copy, most people had to rely on hearing the Word read to them and
      recollecting from memory the actual words of the Bible. For that reason
      the beginner in theology would <i>listen</i> to older students and the
      master (professor). One of the older students, the bachelor of theology,
      read aloud and paraphrased a particular book of the Bible. This bachelor
      was called a “Cursor Biblicus,” a “runner through” the actual words of the
      Bible, who did this to acquaint himself and his hearers with the inspired
      words.
    </p>
    <p>
      A splendid example of the work of such a “runner” is St. Thomas’
      commentary on Isaiah; it is the work of a <i>cursor</i> and not that of a
      master. Only a master could expound the text with authority and
      confidence; the bachelor merely skimmed through it as a runner would skim
      over the course in a race. A higher ranking bachelor devoted his energies
      mainly to explaining the official theological handbook, the
      <i>Sentences</i> of Peter Lombard (d. 1160). These <i>Sentences</i> were a
      systematic collection of Patristic teachings, arranged in four books
      following the order of the Apostles’ Creed. This bachelor was called the
      <i>bachalarius Sententiarum,</i> a “Bachelor of the
      <i>Sentences.</i> “After listening to others for about four years, the
      young student of theology would himself become a bachelor and perform
      certain duties under a particular master, his main professor of theology.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every university in the Middle Ages had a limited number of chairs, or
      professorships, for the masters to occupy. At the time of St. Thomas,
      there were twelve chairs of theology at the University of Paris, the
      Dominicans having two of them. Before occupying one of these chairs, the
      student had to have devoted many long years to study and actual
      discussions, or “disputations,” in the university, He had to be at least
      thirty-five years old before meriting the title of “Master of the Sacred
      Page” and the right to expound the Bible in an authoritative manner as a
      true theologian, professionally qualified.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Thomas was twice professor of theology at Paris—a fact most unusual in
      itself. There were very few such cases where a fully fledged master would
      return to his old chair, thus preventing a new master from occupying it.
      But the intellectual, social, and religious climate in Paris at that time
      demanded the return of Thomas to the center of all theological learning in
      Europe. The new mendicant Orders (mainly Dominicans and Franciscans) were
      again being attacked by secular (i.e., diocesan) masters of theology, and
      their right to teach, preach, and beg was challenged by some of the most
      powerful voices in Europe. The center of this controversy Was the
      University of Paris, where the very existence of Dominicans and
      Franciscans was under fire. At the climax of this renewed attack, the
      second in the history of the Dominican Order, St. Thomas was recalled to
      Paris by the Master General of the Dominican Order, Blessed John of
      Vercelli. Thomas arrived in Paris with his companion Reginald in the cold
      winter of 1269 after the academic term had begun. Immediately Thomas took
      upon himself the duties of a master in theology, namely, lecturing on a
      carefully chosen book of the Bible, presiding at academic “disputations”
      and resolving the question under discussion, and preaching to the
      university crowd. At the same time, he was composing the Second Part of
      his <i>Summa theologiae,</i> which he had begun in Rome two years earlier,
      and dictating a number of literal commentaries on various works of
      Aristotle for young masters in arts, that is, teachers in the Faculty of
      Arts, whose duty it was to expound the text of Aristotle. During the two
      and a half years Thomas spent at Paris the second time, he successfully
      defended the rights of mendicants to teach, preach, and flourish. During
      this same Parisian regency he lectured on the Gospel of St. John.
    </p>
    <p>
      These lectures on John would have been lost to posterity had not the
      faithful Reginald taken notes, which were later “corrected” by Thomas
      himself. The reason Thomas “corrected” Reginald’s transcription was that a
      wealthy secular (i.e., diocesan) student wanted a copy for himself. This
      student was Adenulf of Anagni, an Italian cleric, provost of Saint-Omer
      (since 1264), later master in theology (1282-85), and canon of Notre Dame
      Cathedral in Paris. Adenulf, a student of Thomas during the years 1269-72,
      offered a considerable amount of money to have a professional scribe make
      a copy of this remarkable commentary for himself. Without Adenulf’s
      enthusiasm and money, the “lectures” (<i>lecturae</i>) on John would have
      remained a simple report, or <i>reportatio.</i> If it had not been for
      Reginald, apparently, these lectures would have gone completely from
      history. But the fact is that we do have at hand the acute mind of Thomas
      Aquinas, a master theologian and saint, on the Gospel of St. John. This
      commentary reflects the mind of Thomas at its peak, but before he composed
      the Third Part of the <i>Summa</i> dealing with Christ, the Sacraments,
      and the Church. It is a scholastic analysis of St. John’s remarkable
      testimony of the Good News of Salvation, namely, that the Word became
      flesh, died for our salvation, and is now risen from the dead to come
      again as our merciful judge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier, at the request of his intimate friend Pope Urban IV, Thomas had
      compiled a continuous gloss on all four Gospels, which he had collated
      from the Latin and Greek Fathers of the Church. Frequently he even
      instigated new translations of Greek sources, as he himself confessed in
      the prologue. This continuous gloss, popularly called the
      <i>Catena Aurea,</i> or “Golden Chain,” was not finished when Urban died
      in 1264. But Thomas continued his labors on the gloss, which he completed
      in 1267 and dedicated to Cardinal Annibaldo d’Annibaldi, Thomas’ close
      friend and former pupil at Paris. The intense labor on the Gospel of John
      for the <i>Catena</i> molded the mind of Thomas in his personal
      understanding of the Sacred Text of John. St. John’s Gospel is very
      difficult to understand. Unlike the Synoptic writers, Matthew, Mark, and
      Luke, St. John’s Gospel is a carefully devised presentation of his
      personal understanding of the sacred doctrine taught by Jesus, on whose
      breast he reclined at the Last Supper. John was always known as “the
      disciple whom Jesus loved.” For St. Thomas, John, the Son of Zebedee, the
      author of this Gospel, was a virgin, whose appropriate symbol is the eagle
      soaring in the heights of contemplation. Thomas’ detailed study of the
      Latin and Greek Fathers, needed to complete his Gloss on John, prepared
      him to shed his own light on the text when the opportune moment arrived.
      That moment arrived when Thomas returned to Paris for the second time
      (1269-72) at the age of about forty-four, full of strength and vigor.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his is a typical medieval commentary because, unlike Patristic,
      monastic, and modern commentaries on John, it utilizes certain techniques
      familiar to all in the Middle Ages, but strange to us today. First of all,
      it is a theological commentary concerned with penetrating the literal
      sense of the words recorded, and seeing through the literal sense to the
      spiritual. The medieval university theologian was primarily concerned with
      the literal sense of scripture, that is, with the sacred message intended
      by the human and divine author. It is therefore primarily concerned with
      “the theological teaching” of the Bible. St. Thomas did not have at his
      disposal the infinitely varied techniques of modern biblical scholarship.
      He knew almost nothing about biblical and near-eastern languages,
      archeology, philology, comparative religion, and the historical method. If
      he had, he would most certainly have used them. In the Encyclical
      <i>Divino afflante Spiritu</i> (30 Sept. 1943), Pope Pius XII urged the
      importance of textual criticism, biblical and oriental languages,
      archeology, profane and sacred history, as well as form criticism and the
      demands of a sound historical method.

      The Bible is the Word of God in the words of men, and this manner of
      speaking in various ages to various people must be carefully studied with
      all the auxiliary sciences. But even after all this has been tended to,
      there is still “the theological doctrine” contained in the Sacred Books.
      The modem exegete should use every means available to discover and explain
      “the literal sense and especially the theological. “

      It is this “theological sense” <i>(sensus theologicus),</i> expounded by
      St. Thomas in his commentary, that is most fruitful for our meditation,
      prayer, and preaching the Word of God today.
    </p>

    <p>
      The literal sense, as St. Thomas teaches, is the objective, formal, and
      direct meaning intended by the words in the sacred and inspired text.

      The author of these words is both God and man, since the Bible is “the
      inspired Word of God.” Modem biblical techniques, of course, were unknown
      to Thomas. All he had was his personal copy of the Latin Vulgate (which
      was not a critical edition), the familiar teaching of all the Latin and
      Greek Fathers known to him, his own prayerful reflection on the text, and
      his native genius attentive to the Spirit of God and to the text. Among
      the human means Thomas had at his disposal were grammar, logic, and
      Aristotelian philosophy. The literal (or historical) sense was in
      principle the only basis of theological thought and discussion. The
      spiritual sense only enlarged, or extended, the basic literal sense. By
      “spiritual sense” we do not mean the pious, personal, private, and
      subjective sense a reader might derive from a prayerful reading of the
      text. Rather, the “spiritual sense” is the enlarged reality “intended” by
      person, place, or thing signified in the literal, as when the brazen
      serpent raised by Moses in the desert is taken to signify Christ’s
      crucifixion as the divine means of healing mankind, or when the paschal
      lamb is taken to signify Christ who was sacrificed for our sins. The
      “spiritual sense” is the enlarged sense “intended” by a given symbol in
      the plan of divine providence.
    </p>

    <p>
      Since only God as the author of all things can make one symbol
      significative of another reality, the Bible is the only book that can
      contain a “spiritual sense” as it was understood by medieval theologians.
      Consequently only the sacred author himself can inform us of the existence
      of such a sense. We could never know that one reality is to be taken as a
      symbol of another reality unless the Sacred Author so informs us in the
      literal sense. For example, the author of the Book of Numbers (21:19)
      explains how Moses was directed to make a brazen “serpent” and set it up
      as a sign; whoever was bitten by one of the fiery serpents and “looked at
      the sign” that Moses had set up was saved from death. But it is John (3:14
      15) who explains that “as Moses lifted up the serpent in the desert, so
      must the Son of man be lifted up that whoever believes in him may not
      perish, but may have life everlasting.” The significance of Old Testament
      texts is declared by the sacred writer when he explains Christ’s actions
      as being “in fulfillment of the Scriptures.” Similarly St. Paul frequently
      reveals the “spiritual sense” of the Law and Prophets by declaring the
      Christian fulfillment in Jesus.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were three kinds of spiritual sense recognized by medieval
      theologians: the allegorical, the moral, and the anagogical.

        }
      </script>
      When anything in the Old Testament was taken to signify something in the
      New Testament, this sense was called allegorical. Under this sense would
      be included all those figures, persons, and events as symbolic of Jesus
      and his life and death on earth. When anything in the life of Jesus is
      taken as a model for our life, we call this the moral sense. Under this
      sense would be included all those virtues presented to us for our
      imitation of Christ. When anything in the Scriptures is taken to signify
      something in the eternal kingdom hereafter, for example, “the new
      Jerusalem,” we call this the anagogical sense. Thus the “spiritual sense”
      of a passage was taken to be an objective meaning intended by the sacred
      author, the Holy Spirit. This, of course, presupposes that the authors of
      the New Testament were inspired by the Holy Spirit.
    </p>

    <p>
      Whatever personal message one may derive from reading the Bible
      prayerfully and thoughtfully is purely personal and beyond the science of
      theology as the study of God’s message to mankind. The personal message is
      most significant for the reader, but this personal significance must be
      carefully controlled by objective theological norms such as the Christian
      faith, sacred doctrine, the constant teaching of the Church, and a
      prayerful listening to the Holy Spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most difficult technique of medieval commentators for us to comprehend
      is the use of logic and the “scholastic method.” Aristotelian logic is the
      most significant technique contained in the scholastic method. The purpose
      of the scholastic method was to instill “scientific” knowledge through (1)
      definition, (2) division, and (3) demonstration, or demonstrative proof.
      These techniques (or <i>modi sciendi)</i> were taken for granted by every
      medieval theologian as the best means of learning the truth about
      anything. It was a method of teaching, the via <i>docendi,</i> which was
      an imitation of the “way of discovery” <i>(via inveniendi</i> or
      <i>inventionis).</i> The goal of all education is truth. The goal of
      theological education is an understanding of the doctrines of revelation,
      the <i>sacra doctrina</i>.

      It is faith seeking understanding (<i>fides quaerens intellectum</i>), as
      St. Anselm puts it, The scholastic method, in a sense, is artificial and
      humanly contrived by ineans of logic. In the Middle Ages the scholastic
      method was thought to be the best way of learning everything from A to Z.
      An example of this method of learning is embedded in Thomas’ commentary on
      John’s Gospel. It cannot be eliminated. Therefore it depends on us moderns
      to bend a little by trying to see through it, and not be put off by it.
      Always one will find definitions, divisions, and proofs in all medieval
      commentaries, whether they be on Aristotle, Boethius, or the Bible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Scholastics had a penchant for <i>order;</i> where none existed, one
      was imposed. Heeding the words of Aristotle that “it belongs to the wise
      man to order,” they thought the prerogative of a good teacher was to order
      all things well, setting out the message, or truth to be conveyed, in an
      orderly and fitting way.

      This is why the first thing one notices when reading a medieval commentary
      is the <i>division,</i> or the ordering of the whole into parts. The least
      one can perceive is a beginning, a middle, and an end. But more than not,
      one can usually perceive some orderly procedure in the middle.
    </p>

    <p>
      Modern biblical scholars usually see in, St. John’s Gospel a prologue
      (1:1-14), a middle (cc. 1-20), and an epilogue (c. 21). They then proceed
      to divide the middle into the Book of Signs (cc. 1-12) and the Book of
      Glory (cc. 13-20). St. Thomas also divides the Gospel into roughly these
      two parts, but he considers chapter 12 as belonging to the Book of Glory,
      because the chapter opens “six days before Passover” with the anointing of
      the feet of Jesus for his burial (12:1 -11), continues on to the triumphal
      entry into Jerusalem (12:12-19), builds to the coming of the Greeks
      (12:20-22), and the long discourse of Jesus in which he cries out,
      “Father, glorify your name” (12:28). In any case, it is particularly in
      this second part that Thomas had to use his ingenuity to resolve the
      discrepancies between John and the Synoptics. The Synoptics compress the
      public life of Jesus into one year with the one tragic journey of Jesus up
      to Jerusalem, where he is crucified and dies, to be raised up on the third
      day. John extends the public life of Jesus into three years with the final
      year ending in his passion, death, and resurrection. St. Thomas is very
      much concerned with the literal, or historical, sense of the narrative,
      especially as concerns the passion, death, and resurrection of the Lord.
      Throughout the whole exposition of the narrative, Thomas relied heavily on
      the interpretation of the Fathers of the Church, both Latin and Greek. He
      quotes the authority of St. Augustine 373 times, St. John Chrysostom 217
      times, and Origen 95 times. It is an exposition that relies heavily on the
      tradition of the Church and on his own prayerful theological reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the commentary on St. John’s Gospel, Thomas is concerned not only with
      the literal sense, which for him is of Prime importance and concern, but
      also with the spiritual sense, as explained above. More than the other
      Evangelists, John reveals the “fulfillment of the Scriptures,” that is,
      concern with the prophecies and symbols of the Old Law. Christ’s own
      prophetic words and actions are seen by John to be a foreshadowing of the
      passion, death, and resurrection of the Lord by which we are all saved.
      Above all, for St. Thomas, John is the Evangelist of the divinity of
      Jesus, “the Word made flesh.” He says, “While the other Evangelists treat
      principally of the mysteries of the humanity of Christ, John, especially
      and above all, makes known the divinity of Christ in his Gospel”
      (Prologue). Thomas, following the lead of St. Jerome, thought that John
      wrote his Gospel after the other three Gospels had been written, in order
      to refute new heresies that had arisen concerning the divinity of Christ.
      Following Jerome, Thomas singled out the Ebionites (whose founder Thomas
      erroneously thought to have been “Ebion”)—and Cerinthus, a Gnostic heretic
      who flourished around 100 A.D., as among those who denied the divinity of
      Christ. Even St. Irenaeus <i>(Adv. haer.</i>, III, 11) asserts that St.
      John wrote his Gospel to refute Cerinthus. Thus, St. Thomas observes in
      his Prologue, while John did not pass over the mysteries of Christ’s
      humanity, he especially conveys the divinity of Christ in his Gospel. In
      this commentary, therefore, Thomas repeatedly refutes the heresies of
      Apollinaris, Arius, the Arians, Ebionites, Eutyches, the Manichees,
      Nestorius, Pelagius, the Pelagians, and Sabellius - all of which plagued
      the Church in the first five centuries of its existence. For Thomas these
      heresies were not merely false doctrines irrelevant to the modem
      Christian, but vital guidelines to the purity of the Christian faith, the
      orthodox teaching of the living Church.
    </p>
    <p>
      Earlier in his career, Thomas had been asked by the archbishop of Palermo
      to write a short work that could be memorized, dealing with the articles
      of faith “from the Creed of the Fathers” (i.e., the Apostles’ Creed) and
      also the basic errors concerning them; the archbishop apparently asked
      also for the same presentation for all the sacraments of the Church.

        }

      Thomas complied with this request in a most remarkable treatise in two
      parts: <i>De articulis fidei</i> and <i>De ecclesiae sacramentis</i>.

        }
      </script>
      The wide popularity of this treatise is attested to by the 277 extant
      manuscripts of this work. The six articles pertaining to the divinity of
      Christ and the six pertaining to his humanity are set forth, and all the
      errors concerning the twelve articles of the Creed are briefly named and
      refuted. Although the sacraments of the Church are implicit in the fourth
      article of the Creed, they are discussed separately in the second part of
      the treatise, because the archbishop explicitly asked for a special
      discussion of the sacraments and the heresies concerning them. Thomas’
      knowledge of the various heresies in the history of the Church is most
      remarkable. All of these same heresies are again discussed in his
      commentary on John’s Gospel. That is why St. Thomas says in the Prologue,
      “[This Gospel] refutes all heresies.” The numerous heresies of the past
      ought to be of great concern to the modern Christian so that he may avoid
      all taint of them in his own, personal belief. A conscious affirmation of
      belief in the truth of revealed teaching that developed in the living
      Church guided by the Spirit of Christ can bring us into a deeper and more
      meaningful awareness of being united with the Eternal Truth. In this
      commentary, Thomas is concerned above all with bolstering the faith of the
      hearer or reader, or, as he put it, “to confirm the Catholic Truth.”
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify">
      In other words, there are four goals Thomas aimed to achieve in his
      commentary on St. John:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        determination of the literal, or historical, sense of the narrative;
      </li>
      <li>
        explanation of the spiritual sense as found in the Old Testament
        (allegorical sense), the goals of our own life in imitating Jesus (moral
        sense), and life of the “kingdom” here and hereafter (anagogical sense);
      </li>
      <li>
        refutation of all error through the testimony of the inspired Word of
        God;
      </li>
      <li>
        confirmation of the true Catholic Faith given to us by God through his
        Church, the Body of Christ.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      These are the same goals Thomas had set for himself in composing the
      <i>Catena Aurea,</i> particularly in the <i>Catena</i> on John’s Gospel,
      which was composed only four or five years earlier.

    <p>
      There are four outstanding features that will be noticed as one studies
      the commentary of Thomas on the Gospel of John. First, Thomas had an
      extraordinary knowledge of the whole Bible. It has been said, not without
      likelihood, that Thomas memorized the entire Bible during the year he was
      confined to his family castle at Roccasecca, 1244-45. This is not at all
      difficult to believe. His memory was far superior to any man-made
      concordance of the Bible. Thomas always saw the <i>unity</i> of divine
      revelation. It was the unity of <i>sacra doctrina</i> as a single
      “science.”
      <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote15',%20WPFootnote15%20)"
        ><img
          src="footnoteicon.gif"
          alt="Footnote"
          width="16"

      /></a>
      <script type="text/javascript" language="javascript">

          document.write(WPFootnote15);
          document.write(
            "<br><a href=\"javascript:WPHide('WPFootnote15')\">Close<\/a>"
          );
          document.write("<\/span>");
        }
      </script>
      The “orthodox” teaching of Christ, Son of the Living God, cannot be
      anything but <i>one.</i> Because of this unity, Thomas could use any one
      part of Sacred Scripture to explain and illumine any other part. Thus
      Thomas could use the teaching of St. Paul and the Psalms to explain the
      text of John. This use of one part of revelation to illumine another has
      been aptly called “the analogy of faith” (<i>secundum rationern fidei,</i>
      as St. Paul says in Romans 12:6).
      <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16',%20WPFootnote16%20)"

          );
          document.write("<\/span>");
        }
      </script>
    </p>

    <p>
      Second, Thomas had an unusual knowledge of the Latin and Greek Fathers of
      the Church. This knowledge, no doubt aided by his work on the
      <i>Catena Aurea, is</i> brought to bear on every difficult question or
      obscure passage in John, even when it is a question of chronology,
      geography, Jewish customs, or language. The medieval mind associated
      words, quotations and parallels with uncanny facility, always trying to
      find the best pertinent quotation from the proper authorities
      (<i>auctoritates</i>) <i>.</i> Great weight, sometimes of probative value,
      was always given to the recognized <i>auctoritates,</i> which, in theology
      were always the Bible and the <i>sancti,</i> meaning recognized or
      canonized Doctors of the Church, who were the <i>regula fidei</i> (“the
      rule of faith”), the “norms” of Christian belief. Thomas’ knowledge of
      these Doctors was prodigious. The contemporaries of Thomas relied heavily
      on all available works of the Latin Fathers, especially those of St.
      Augustine. But, as has been pointed out earlier, Thomas not only accepted
      the eminent authority of St. Augustine, but also had a wealth of Greek
      sources from which to draw, including the early Ecumenical Councils of the
      Church, whose <i>Acts</i> were largely neglected or forgotten in the Latin
      Middle Ages.

          );
          document.write("<\/span>");
        }
      </script>
    </p>

    <p>
      Third, Thomas was, after all, an outstanding theologian for any season.
      His theology was not only biblical and patristic, but also logical and
      philosophical. While he absorbed and refined the philosophy of Aristotle,
      newly translated from the Greek, he never put this philosophy ahead of his
      Catholic faith. Rather he used that philosophy
      <i>in obsequium fidei</i> (Phil 2:17), as a “handmaid of theology.” His
      comprehension of Aristotle and his use of the scholastic method are among
      the glories of the Middle Ages. In St. Thomas we find an exceptionally
      gifted mind carefully honed to human perfection by self-discipline, long
      study, and clear thinking. This was natural talent, ranked by many as a
      true genius, brought to the highest human perfection by the grace of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, Friar Thomas d’Aquino was a saint, one of the great saints in the
      Latin Church. A basic principle of Thomas’ theology is that “grace
      perfects nature”; that is, the grace of God never destroys or replaces
      nature, but builds upon it. For St. Thomas, there is in divine providence
      a certain kind of proportion between God’s gifts of nature and his gifts
      of grace. Even when we accept this principle with all the necessary
      qualifications needed, we can readily see that in the mind and heart of
      St. Thomas, God’s grace abundantly perfected an already great man. Not
      only did Thomas meditate prayerfully on the Sacred Scriptures, but lie
      drew from them substantial nourishment for his soul. This process of
      enrichment can be seen conspicuously in the commentary on John,
      particularly the section dealing with the “Last Discourse” of Jesus to his
      disciples at the Last Supper, collected in “the sayings of Jesus” in
      chapters 14 to 17. Here Thomas’ discussion of the Son’s procession from
      the Father while being consubstantially one with the Father, is precise,
      illuminating, and brilliant; the mission of the Holy Spirit from the
      Father <i>and</i> from the Son (<i>Filioque</i>) is clearly demonstrated
      against the Greek Orthodox who used this question as one of the many
      issues that separated them from Rome, initially in the ninth, and
      decisively in the eleventh century. But above all, the indwelling of the
      Holy Trinity in the hearts of the faithful is alive and vital; the
      extraordinary love Jesus had for his faithful disciples is movingly real
      and dynamic. In this commentary on John we have all the elements of a real
      masterpiece of its kind in medieval literature.
    </p>
    <p>
      St. Thomas was very much impressed by the force and absolute veracity of
      the Gospel proclaimed by John: “This disciple is the one who vouches for
      these things and has written them down, and we know that his testimony is
      true” (Jn 21:24). St. Thomas comments that the Evangelist makes this
      statement “in the person of the whole Church (<i
        >in persona totius Ecclesiae</i
      >) from whom this Gospel is received [by us].” The Evangelist himself
      knows the veracity of his narrative, and even St. Paul condemns those who
      would preach a gospel other than the one he had received (see Gal 1:9).
      The firmness and stability of our Christian faith is the authority of God
      speaking through Evangelists, Apostles and other authors of the canonical
      Books of Scripture. Their testimony leaves us without any doubt as to our
      faith, because “the Canonical Scriptures alone are the rule of faith.”

          );
          document.write("<\/span>");
        }
      </script>
      This <i>sola scriptura</i> of which St. Thomas speaks is far different
      from the <i>sola scriptura</i> (“only the Bible”) of the Reformers. This
      battle cry was made famous by Luther, who insisted that what is not
      contained in the Bible is not “of faith.” But Luther and Thomas (or any
      other medieval theologian) meant two different things by the word
      <i>Bible,</i> or <i>Sacred Scriptures.</i> For Luther and the Reformers
      the Bible was thought of as a finished, edited, and (by then) printed
      collection, while Thomas and the medieval theologians meant the Sacred
      Word <i>together with</i> the gloss of the Fathers, liturgy, and the
      living Church. The Reformers thought of “The Bible” completely devoid of a
      history and a historical context, devoid of transmission and development;
      in short, they thought of “The Bible” distinct from the Church. Thus in
      the face of this misunderstanding, the Council of Trent spoke as
      <i>though</i> there were two sources of our faith: “the written books and
      the unwritten traditions.”
      <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote19',%20WPFootnote19%20)"

        }
      </script>
      But even this manner of speaking was a concession to a false dichotomy
      that was historically conditioned. The Second Vatican Council, however,
      described these two sources” more traditionally as a single mirror (<i
        >veluti speculum sunt</i
      >) reflecting both sacred tradition and Sacred Scripture.

    <p>
      Historically speaking, the revelation given by God and received by the
      chosen people was prior to any scriptural document. Abraham, Isaac, and
      Jacob were given the message of salvation long before there was any
      question of a written Torah. Christ’s message of salvation was accepted by
      the Apostles, disciples, and early Christians for a quarter of a century
      before the first fraction of the New Testament was written—and this by St.
      Paul (1 Thessalonians, probably at the beginning of 52 A.D.). We must
      always remember that the Canon of the New Testament was not established as
      an inspired unit until 382 A.D., at the earliest. That is, the living
      Church existed long before the New Testament was “written,” and it existed
      for 350 years before the present books were collected into an exclusive
      and canonical unity. For this reason, St. Thomas could speak of the “whole
      Church from whom this Gospel is received.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, a word should be said in aid of a fruitful reading of St. Thomas’
      commentary on John. Although the pericope or section commented upon in
      every “Lecture” is printed in full at the head of the commentary, it would
      be best to procure a second copy of the whole text and read the particular
      chapter in full before proceeding to the comment. It is of utmost
      importance to follow the <i>divisions</i> of the text made by St. Thomas
      and always keep the context well in view. The lemmata, or phrases
      commented upon, are clearly set off from the comment by the printer.
      Unless the particular lemma is constantly related to the context as a
      whole, one can easily get lost in the forest of words, cross references,
      and quotations. Since <i>order</i> and <i>division</i> are such important
      elements in the scholastic method, these must be continuously related to
      the <i>whole,</i> whether it be a collection of chapters, an individual
      chapter, part of a chapter, a parable, narrative, pericope, or sentence.
      Those who wish to obtain the greatest understanding of the Sacred Text
      might well augment the study of St. Thomas’ “theological sense” of John
      with a modern commentary, such as the outstanding commentary by Father
      Raymond Brown in the Anchor Bible (2 vols.).
    </p>
    <p>
      For the fruitful reading of St. Thomas’ commentary on John, we should
      further note that throughout the long history of the Church, listeners and
      readers of tile Sacred Text have always been encouraged to prepare their
      minds and souls for a fruitful reception of the Word. The Word of God,
      like the seed in the parable (Lk 8:15), needs to be received in “good
      ground” in order to yield fruit a hundredfold. The reception of anything,
      according to the ancient philosophers, depends on the condition of the
      receiver. The Word of God is Spirit (Jn 6:63), and only the Holy Spirit
      cdn prepare the soul for fruitful reception of the Word. In the solemn
      proclamation of the Gospel in the Liturgy of the Word, the Church prays
      for the Deacon that the Lord be in his heart and on his lips in order to
      announce the Holy Gospel of Peace.

      Preparing one’s mind and heart by prayer and recollection is of greatest
      importance for the reception of God’s message for us. This message is
      directed primarily to us as God’s chosen people, the pilgrim Church on
      earth, and through the Church to us as individuals beloved by God and
      “purchased at a great price” (1 Cor 6:20). The message of salvation is
      addressed to us individually and collectively, and we both individually
      and collectively must attune our minds and hearts to the Spirit. “The
      Advocate, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will
      teach you everything and remind you of all I have said to you” (Jn 14:26).
      The Holy Spirit speaks to our hearts through the Scriptures, inspired and
      animated by him. The Scriptures as a spiritual resource cannot be
      dissociated from personal prayer and cultivation of our sacramental life
      in the Church. Being receptive is the important thing as we begin our
      study.
    </p>

    <p>
      Finally, the power of reading or hearing the Sacred Scriptures is so great
      that it actually forgives sins. Apart from “the Sacraments of the faith”
      (<i>sacramenta fidei</i>), it is one of the many ways by which our many
      sins are forgiven. The Fathers of the Church have always listed—along with
      almsgiving, contrition, and good works—the special efficacy of reading the
      Scriptures for the forgiveness of sins. The new liturgy of the Mass
      prompted by the Second Vatican Council still retains the ancient prayer:
      “May the words of the Gospel wipe away our sins.” The humble and contrite
      reading of any part of the Scriptures wipes away sin because the power of
      the Word is the power of God, who alone can forgive sins. Thus we should
      always approach the Scriptures with a “humble and contrite heart.” The
      Psalmist declares, “A contrite and humbled heart, O God, you will not
      despise” (Ps 50:19). God always answers a humble and contrite heart in
      order to glorify himself in us, just as the Father is always glorified in
      the Son. “Whatever you ask for in my name I will do, so that the Father
      may be glorified in the Son” Qn 14:13). This “glory” of the Father through
      the Son in the Holy Spirit is sometimes called the indwelling of the
      Trinity within our souls. It is the “conformity” of our whole being to the
      Father through the Word animated by the Spirit. In this conformity of our
      innermost being with the splendor of God lies the whole perfection of the
      Christian life. In this perfection consists the glory and splendor of God
      himself. This union of one’s deepest self and the innermost being of God
      is the answer to the prayer of Jesus to the Father: “That they may be one,
      as we also are one” (Jn 17:11).
    </p>
    <p>
      From this it follows that the study of St. Thomas’ commentary on St.
      John’s Gospel is richly rewarding in healing our wounds and leading us to
      greater union with the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, whose message of
      salvation is here proclaimed by “the disciple whom Jesus loved” (Jn 20:2).
      For our guide we can have none better than the Angelic Doctor, whom Jesus
      loved.

                      1 These are the words of a contemplative, and if we regard
                      them as spoken by John the Evangelist they apply quite
                      well to showing the nature of this Gospel. For as
                      Augustine says in his work,
                      <i>On the Agreement of the Evangelists:</i> “The other
                      Evangelists instruct us in their Gospels on the active
                      life; but John in his Gospel instructs us also on the
                      contemplative life.”

                              contemplationis consistit maxime in contemplatione
                              et cognitione Dei; Is. XL, 26: levate in excelso
                              oculos vestros, et videte quis fecit haec. Tunc
                              ergo homo oculos contemplationis in excelso
                              elevat, quando videt et contemplatur ipsum rerum
                              omnium creatorem. Quia ergo Ioannes transcendit
                              quicquid creatum est, scilicet ipsos montes, ipsos
                              caelos, ipsos Angelos, et pervenit ad ipsum

                              vidi dominum. Et quia, sicut ipse Ioannes dicit:
                              haec dixit Isaias quando vidit gloriam eius,
                              scilicet Christi, et locutus est de eo, ideo
                              dominus sedens super solium excelsum et elevatum,
                              Christus est.

                              2 As to the first, we must understand that the
                              Height and sublimity of contemplation consists
                              most of all in the contemplation and knowledge of
                              God. “Lift up your eyes on high, and see who has
                              created these things” (Is 40:26). A man lifts up
                              his eyes on high when he sees and contemplates the
                              Creator of all things. Now since John rose above
                              whatever had been created—mountains, heavens,
                              angels—and reached the Creator of all, as
                              Augustine says, it is clear that his contemplation
                              was most high. Thus, <b>I saw the Lord.</b> And
                              because, as John himself says below (12:41),
                              “Isaiah said this because he had seen his glory,”
                              that is, the glory of Christ, “and spoke of him,”
                              the Lord
                              <b>seated on a high and lofty throne</b> is
                              Christ.

                                  Now a fourfold height is indicated in this
                                  contemplation of John. A height of authority;
                                  hence he says, <b>I saw the Lord.</b> A height
                                  of eternity; when he says, seated. One of
                                  dignity, or nobility of nature; so he says,
                                  <b>on a high throne.</b> And a height of
                                  incomprehensible truth; when he says, lofty.
                                  It is in these four ways that the early
                                  philosophers arrived at the knowledge of God.

                                      unde in Ps. LXXXVIII, 10 dicitur: tu

                                      things in nature acting for an end, and
                                      attaining to ends which are both useful
                                      and certain. And since they lack
                                      intelligence, they are unable to direct
                                      themselves, but must be directed and moved
                                      by one directing them, and who possesses
                                      an intellect. Thus it is that the movement
                                      of the things of nature toward a certain
                                      end indicates the existence of something
                                      higher by which the things of nature are
                                      directed to an end and governed. And so,
                                      since the whole course of nature advances
                                      to an end in an orderly way and is
                                      directed, we have to posit something
                                      higher which directs and governs them as
                                      Lord; and this is God. This authority in
                                      governing is shown to be in the Word of
                                      God when he says, Lord. Thus the Psalm
                                      (88:10) says: “You rule the power of the
                                      sea, and you still the swelling of its
                                      waves,” as though saying: You are the Lord
                                      and govern all things. John shows that he
                                      knows this about the Word when he says
                                      below (1:11), “He came unto his own,”
                                      i.e., to the world, since the whole
                                      universe is his own.

                                          4 Others came to a knowledge of God
                                          from his eternity. They saw that
                                          whatever was in things was changeable,
                                          and that the more noble something is
                                          in the grades of being, so much the
                                          less it has of mutability. For
                                          example, the lower bodies are mutable
                                          both as to their substance and to
                                          place, while the heavenly bodies,
                                          which are more noble, are immutable in
                                          substance and change only with respect
                                          to place. We can clearly conclude from
                                          this that the first principle of all
                                          things, which is supreme and more
                                          noble, is changeless and eternal. The
                                          prophet suggests this eternity of the
                                          Word when he says,
                                          <b>seated,</b> i.e., presiding without
                                          any change and eternally. “Your
                                          throne, O God, is forever and ever”
                                          (Ps 44:7); “Jesus Christ is the same
                                          yesterday, today, and forever” (Heb
                                          13:8). John points to this eternity
                                          when he says below (1:1), “In the
                                          beginning was the Word.”

                                              5 Still others came to a knowledge
                                              of God from the dignity of God;
                                              and these were the Platonists.
                                              They noted that everything which
                                              is something by participation is
                                              reduced to what is the same thing
                                              by essence, as to the first and
                                              highest. Thus, all things which
                                              are fiery by participation are
                                              reduced to fire, which is such by
                                              its essence. And so since all
                                              things which exist participate in
                                              existence (<i>esse</i>) and are
                                              beings by participation, there
                                              must necessarily be at the summit
                                              of all things something which is
                                              existence (<i>esse</i>) by its
                                              essence, i.e., whose essence is
                                              its existence. And this is God,
                                              who is the most sufficient, the
                                              most eminent, and the most perfect
                                              cause of the whole of existence,
                                              from, whom all things that are
                                              participate existence
                                              (<i>esse</i>) <i>.</i> This
                                              dignity is shown in the words,
                                              <b>on a high throne,</b> which,
                                              according to Denis, refer to the
                                              divine nature. “The Lord is high
                                              above all nations” (Ps 112:4).
                                              John shows us this dignity when he

                                                  All the truth which our
                                                  intellect is able to grasp is
                                                  finite, since according to
                                                  Augustine, “everything that is
                                                  known is bounded by the
                                                  comprehension of the one
                                                  knowing”; and if it is
                                                  bounded, it is determined and
                                                  particularized. Therefore, the
                                                  first and supreme Truth, which
                                                  surpasses every intellect,
                                                  must necessarily be
                                                  incomprehensible and infinite;
                                                  and this is God. [Hence the
                                                  Psalm (8:2) says, “Your
                                                  greatness is above the
                                                  heavens,” i.e., above every
                                                  created intellect, angelic and
                                                  human. The Apostle says this
                                                  in the words, “He dwells in
                                                  unapproachable light” (1 Tim
                                                  6:16). This
                                                  incomprehensibility of Truth
                                                  is shown to us in the word,

                                                          its power, according

                  This is John, the Evangelist, one of the disciples of the
                  Lord, a virgin chosen by God, whom he called from the wedding
                  when he wanted to marry.

                      The Gospel gives a double testimony of his virginity: (1)
                      that God loved him more than the others, and (2) that the
                      Lord, hanging on the cross, commended his Mother to him,
                      so that a virgin might look after the Virgin.

                          beginning a work on the incorruptible Word, he alone
                          testified that the Word became flesh, and that
                          darkness did not grasp the light. Describing the
                          Lord's first sign, worked at the wedding, he showed
                          that he was the one to show his readers that, where
                          the Lord was invited, the wedding wine had to give
                          out: that the old would be changed and all the new
                          things that Christ instituted would appear.

                  Here Jerome wishes to express two things: the author of the
                  Gospel, and the fact that he was competent to write it. So it
                  is divided into two parts: First he describes John's life,
                  then his death (at "hic est Ioannes"). As for the first, he
                  does two things: First he describes the author of the work,
                  with regard to the gifts he receive in life, secondly, from
                  these he shows his suitability for writing the Gospel (at
                  "denique manifestans in Evangelio"). On the first point, he
                  does two things: First he shows what proclaims the author's
                  greatness, then he proves this (at "cui virginitatis in hoc
                  duplex testimonium datur in Evangelio").

                      grace of God I am what I am." Secondly, from his office,

                      all your sons are instructed by the Lord." Fourthly, from

                      not choose me." Sixthly, from the manner of his calling,
                      when he says, "He called him at the wedding, namely, the
                      wedding to which Jesus and his disciples were invited,
                      where he changed water into wine.

                          But an objection comes from Matthew 6:21, that John
                          was called with his brother James from the boat, not
                          from the wedding. An answer is that there were
                          different callings of the apostles. First they were
                          called to familiarity with Christ, but lastly to
                          discipleship, when they left all and followed Jesus.
                          Jerome is talking about the first calling, when John,
                          at the wedding, was called to familiarity with Jesus.
                          Matthew's description is of the last calling, when
                          Jesus called him with his brother James, when they
                          left all and followed Christ.

                              Then, when he says "cui virginitatis in hoc duplex
                              testimonium datur, he proves the proclamation of
                              his virginity by two signs: First the sign of
                              greater love. Regarding this, he says "to whom",
                              that is John, "in this", that is the Gospel, a
                              double testimony of his virginity is given. This
                              refers to the verse that says he was loved by God
                              above the other disciples, and at 21:24: "This is
                              the disciple who bore witness to these things, and
                              has written this. The reason for this special love
                              was his purity, which attracts love, as is said in
                              Proverbs 22:11: "He who loves purity of heart,
                              because of gracious speach, will have the king as
                              his friend." Secondly, he proves this by the sign
                              of his Mother's commendation, when he said: "And
                              to him, that is John, the Lord, hanging on the
                              cross, commended his mother (Jn 19:27)," so that
                              the virgin John might fittingly serve his virgin
                              Mother.

                                  Evangelio", he show that John was competent to
                                  write the Gospel, and that for four reasons.
                                  First, as for the opening of the Gospel, which
                                  begins from the incorruptible Word, which
                                  requires an incorrupt author to describe.
                                  Regarding this, he says, "denique
                                  manifestans", that is, John, in the Gospel,
                                  who was beginning the work of the
                                  incorruptible Word, was the only one to
                                  testify that the Word became flesh, and that
                                  the darkness did not grasp the light.

                                      miraculo quod Deus in nuptiis ostendit,
                                      quando scilicet aquam mutavit in vinum, ut
                                      patet Io. II, 1-11, in quibus vinum
                                      nuptiarum defecit, vino novo, scilicet

                                      dominus invitatus sit, deficere vinum

                                      quia scilicet homines conversi ad
                                      Christum, debent exuere veterem et induere
                                      novum hominem, ut dicitur Col. c. III, 10,

                                      miracles. For he begins his narration of
                                      the miracles with that which God worked at
                                      the wedding, when he changed water into
                                      wine (Jn 2:1-11), when the wedding wine
                                      ran out, and the new wine of virginity was
                                      put in its place. Regarding this, he says
                                      "the first sign", or miracle "which the
                                      Lord made", putting it ahead of the other
                                      miracles. He shows that he, the virgin,
                                      was the one to show his readers that,
                                      where the Lord was invited, the wedding
                                      wine, that is conjugal pleasure, had to
                                      give out: that the old would be
                                      changed—old wine into new—and all the new
                                      things that Christ instituted would
                                      appear, because people converted to Christ
                                      would have to put off the old man and put
                                      on the new man, as said in Colossians 3:10
                                      and Revelation 21:5: "He who sat on the
                                      throne said, 'See, I make everything
                                      new'."

                                          quicumque Deum amat, et diligit, debet
                                          cessare a coniugio: non ergo licet

                                          seems that anyone who loves God must
                                          give up marriage, and that it is not
                                          licit to marry.

                                              the wedding wine need not cease,

                                              in 1 Corinthians 7:34: "A woman
                                              who is married thinks how she may
                                              please her husband," and thus she

                                              contemplation. But the unmarried
                                              woman thinks how she may please
                                              Christ.

                                                      this Gospel was writting
                                                      after all the other books
                                                      of Sacred Scripture. Since
                                                      the Canon of Scripture
                                                      begins with the book of
                                                      Genesis and ends with the
                                                      Apocalypse, this Gospel
                                                      waswritten after John was
                                                      called back from the
                                                      island of Patmos to Asia,
                                                      where, at the request of
                                                      the bishops of Asia he
                                                      wrote this Gospel. It is
                                                      not put at the end of the
                                                      Bible, even though it was
                                                      written last. This shows
                                                      the fittingness of writing
                                                      this Gospel, because at
                                                      the beginning of the Canon
                                                      of Sacred Scripture we
                                                      see, in the words "In the

                                                      is advance mention of the
                                                      incorruptible Principle.
                                                      Likewise, through a
                                                      virgin, we see in the
                                                      Apocalypse the
                                                      incorruptible End. We are
                                                      speaking of the order of
                                                      the books, not the order
                                                      of their writing.
