          THE SACRAMENTS OF THE CHURCH</b>

          <td>Nunc restat considerandum de Ecclesiae sacramentis, quae tamen omnia comprehenduntur sub uno articulo, quia ad effectum gratiae pertinent. Sed quia specialem de sacramentis fecistis quaestionem, de his seorsum agendum est. Est primo igitur sciendum, quod sicut Augustinus dicit in X Lib. de Civit. Dei, sacramentum est sacrum signum, vel sacrae rei signum. Fuerunt autem in veteri lege quaedam sacramenta, idest sacrae rei signa, sicut agnus paschalis, et alia sacramenta legalia, quae quidem solum significabant Christi gratiam, non tamen eam causabant. Unde apostolus Galat. IV, 9 vocat ea egena et infirma elementa: egena quidem, quia gratiam non continebant; et infirma, quia gratiam conferre non poterant. Sacramenta vero novae legis continent et conferunt gratiam. In eis enim virtus Christi sub tegumento rerum visibilium secretius operatur salutem, ut dicit Augustinus. Et ideo sacramentum novae legis est invisibilis gratiae visibilis forma, ut eius similitudinem gerat et causa existat. Sicut ablutio quae fit in aqua Baptismatis repraesentat interiorem mundationem quae fit a peccatis per virtutem Baptismi.
          <td>
            We shall now consider the Sacraments of the Church. We shall treat them under one heading, since they all pertain to the effect of grace. First of all, that must be known which St. Augustine wrote in the tenth book of "The City of God": "a Sacrament is a sacred thing" or "the sign of a sacred thing." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#1">[1]</a> Even in the Old Law there were certain sacraments, that is, signs of a sacred thingâ€”for example, the paschal lamb and other legal sacred signs or "sacraments" which, however, did not cause grace but only signified or indicated the grace of Christ. The Apostle calls these "sacraments" "weak and needy elements." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#2">[2]</a> They were needy because they did not contain grace, and they were weak because they could not confer grace. In them, as St. Augustine says, the merits of Christ brought about salvation in a more hidden manner under the cover of visible things. The Sacraments of the New Law, on the other hand, both contain grace and confer it. A Sacrament of the New Law is a visible form of invisible grace. Thus, the exterior washing which takes place when the water is poured in Baptism represents that interior cleansing which takes away sin by virtue of the Sacrament of Baptism. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#3">[3]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sunt autem sacramenta legis novae septem, scilicet Baptismus, confirmatio, Eucharistia, poenitentia, extrema unctio, ordo et matrimonium: quorum prima quinque ordinantur ad perfectionem unius hominis in seipso, sed alia duo, scilicet ordo et matrimonium, ordinantur ad perfectionem et multiplicationem totius Ecclesiae.
          <td>There are seven Sacraments of the New Law: Baptism, Confirmation, the Eucharist, Penance, Extreme Unction, Orders, and Matrimony. The first five of these Sacraments are intended to bring about the perfection of the individual man in himself; whereas the other two, Orders and Matrimony, are so constituted that they perfect and multiply the entire Church.

          <td colspan="2"><b>THE SPIRITUAL AND THE PHYSICAL LIFE: AN ANALOGY</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Vita enim spiritualis conformatur vitae corporali. In vita autem corporali perficitur homo primo per generationem, qua nascitur in hoc mundo; secundo per augmentum, quo perducitur ad quantitatem et virtutem perfectam; tertio per cibum, quo sustentatur hominis vita et virtutes. Et haec quidem sufficerent, si nunquam eum infirmari contingeret; sed quia frequenter homo infirmatur, quarto indiget sanatione.
          <td>The spiritual life conforms to the physical life. In the physical life man is perfected in three chief ways: first, by generation, in that he is born into this world; secondly, by growth, through which he is brought up into stature and perfect strength; thirdly, by food which sustains man's life and powers. This would suffice were it not that man is attacked by illnesses, and hence, fourthly, he needs something which will bring him back to health.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sic est in vita spirituali. Primo enim indiget homo regeneratione, quae fit per Baptismum, secundum illud Ioan. III, 5: nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu sancto, non potest introire in regnum Dei. Secundo oportet quod homo accipiat perfectam virtutem quasi quoddam spirituale augmentum, scilicet per sacramentum confirmationis ad similitudinem apostolorum, quos spiritus sanctus in eos veniens confirmavit. Unde dominus dixit eis Luc. ult., 49: vos sedete in civitate (Ierusalem) quoadusque induamini virtute ex alto. Tertio oportet quod homo spiritualiter nutriatur per Eucharistiae sacramentum, secundum illud Ioan. VI, 54: nisi manducaveritis carnem filii hominis et biberitis eius sanguinem, non habebitis vitam in vobis. Quarto oportet quod homo sanetur spiritualiter per sacramentum poenitentiae, secundum illud Psal. XL, 5: sana, domine, animam meam, quia peccavi tibi. Quinto spiritualiter simul et corporaliter per sacramentum extremae unctionis sanatur, secundum illud Iac. ult., 14: infirmatur aliquis in vobis? Inducat presbyteros Ecclesiae, et orent super eum, ungentes eum oleo in nomine domini: et oratio fidei salvabit infirmum, et alleviabit eum dominus; et si in peccatis sit, dimittentur ei. Quantum autem ad communem Ecclesiae utilitatem ordinantur duo sacramenta, scilicet ordo et matrimonium. Nam per ordinem Ecclesia gubernatur et multiplicatur spiritualiter, et per matrimonium multiplicatur corporaliter.
          <td>
            This also holds true in the spiritual life. First, man needs regeneration or re-birth which is brought through the Sacrament of Baptism: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#4">[4]</a> Secondly, it is necessary that man develop perfect strength, which is, as it were, a spiritual growth, and this indeed comes to him in the Sacrament of Confirmation. This is like the strengthening which the Apostles received when the Holy Spirit came upon them and confirmed them. The Lord had said to them: "But stay you in the city of Jerusalem till you be endued with power from on high." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#5">[5]</a> The third similarity is that man must be fed with spiritual food: "Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood, you shall not have life in you." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#6">[6]</a> Fourthly, man must be healed spiritually through the Sacrament of Penance: "Heal, O Lord, my soul, for I have sinned against You." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#7">[7]</a> Lastly, one is healed both in soul and in body in the Sacrament of Extreme Unction: "Is any man sick among you? Let him bring in the priests of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith shall save the sick man, and the Lord shall raise him up, and if he be in sins, they shall be forgiven him." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#8">[8]</a> Two of the Sacraments, Orders and Matrimony, are instituted for the common good of the Church. Through the Sacrament of Orders the Church is ruled and is spiritually multiplied; and through Matrimony it is increased physically in numbers. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#9">[9]</a>

          <td colspan="2"><b>THE SEVEN SACRAMENTS IN GENERAL</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Est autem considerandum quod praedicta septem sacramenta quaedam habent communia, et quaedam propria. Commune quidem est omnibus sacramentis quod conferant gratiam, sicut dictum est. Commune etiam est omnibus, quod sacramentum consistit in verbis et rebus corporalibus, sicut in Christo, qui est sacramentorum auctor, est verbum caro factum. Et sicut caro Christi sanctificata est, et virtutem sanctificandi habet per verbum sibi unitum, ita et res sacramentorum sanctificantur, et vim sanctificandi habent per verba quae in his proferuntur. Unde Augustinus dicit super Ioan.: accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum. Unde verba quibus sanctificantur sacramenta, dicuntur sacramentorum formae; res autem sanctificatae dicuntur sacramentorum materiae, sicut aqua est materia Baptismi et chrisma confirmationis.
          <td>
            The seven Sacraments have some things which they all hold in common, and some things which are proper to each one. That which is common to all the Sacraments is that they confer grace. It is also common to all the Sacraments that a Sacrament is made up of words and physical acts. And so also Christ, who is the Author of the Sacraments, is the Word made flesh. And just as the flesh of Christ was sanctified, and has the power of sanctifying because of the Word united to itself, so also the Sacraments are made holy and have the power of sanctifying through the words which accompany the action. Thus, St. Augustine says: "The word is joined to the element, and the Sacrament is made." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#10">[10]</a> Now, the words by which the Sacraments are sanctified are called the form of the Sacraments; and the things which are sanctified are called the matter of the Sacraments. Water, for example, is the matter of Baptism, and the holy chrism is the matter of Confirmation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Requiritur etiam in quolibet sacramento persona ministri conferentis sacramentum cum intentione conferendi et faciendi quod facit Ecclesia: quorum trium si aliquid desit, idest si non sit debita forma verborum, et si non sit debita materia, et si minister sacramenti non intendit sacramentum conficere, non perficitur sacramentum.
          <td>
            In each Sacrament there is required a minister, who confers the Sacrament with the intention of doing that which the Church intends. If any one of these three requirements is lacking, the Sacrament is not brought into being, viz., if there is lacking the due form of the words, or if the matter is not present, or if the minister does not intend to confer the Sacrament. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#11">[11]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Impeditur etiam effectus sacramenti per culpam recipientis, puta, si fictus accedat, et non corde parato ad suscipiendum sacramentum. Talis enim licet sacramentum suscipiat, effectum tamen sacramenti, idest gratiam spiritus sancti, non recipit, quia, ut dicitur Sap. I, 5: spiritus sanctus disciplinae effugiet fictum. E contrario autem sunt alii qui nunquam recipiunt sacramentum, qui tamen effectum sacramenti suscipiunt propter devotionem quam habent ad sacramentum, quod habent in voto, sive desiderio.
          <td>
            The effect of the Sacrament is likewise impeded through the fault of the recipient, for example, if one feigns to receive it and with a heart unprepared to receive worthily. Such a one, although he actually receives the Sacrament, does not receive the effect of the Sacrament, that is, the grace of the Holy Spirit. "For the Holy Spirit of discipline will flee from the deceitful." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#12">[12]</a> On the other hand, however, there are some who never even receive sacramentally, yet who receive the effect of the Sacrament because of their devotion towards the Sacrament, which they may have in desire or in a vow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sunt autem et quaedam propria sacramentis quibusdam. Nam quaedam horum imprimunt characterem, idest spirituale quoddam signum distinctivum a ceteris, sicut in sacramento ordinis vel sacramento Baptismi, et in sacramento confirmationis: et talia sacramenta nunquam iterantur super eandem personam. Nunquam enim ille qui est baptizatus, debet ulterius baptizari; neque confirmatus, iterum confirmari; neque ordinatus, iterum ordinari: quia character, qui in huiusmodi sacramentis imprimitur, indelebilis est.
          <td>There are some things which are characteristic of each individual Sacrament. Certain ones impress a character on the soul which is a certain spiritual sign distinct from the other Sacraments. Such are the Sacraments of Orders, Baptism, and Confirmation. The Sacraments which give a character are never repeated in the same person who has once received it. Thus, he who is baptized need never again receive this Sacrament; neither can he who has been confirmed receive Confirmation again; and one who has been ordained need never repeat his ordination. The reason is that the character which each of these Sacraments impresses is indelible.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>In aliis vero sacramentis non imprimitur character suscipienti ea, et ideo possunt iterari quantum ad personam suscipientem, non tamen quantum ad materiam. Potest enim unus homo frequenter poenitere, frequenter Eucharistiam sumere, frequenter extremam unctionem suscipere, frequenter matrimonium contrahere, non tamen eadem hostia debet frequenter consecrari, nec idem oleum infirmorum debet frequenter benedici. Est etiam alia differentia, quia quaedam sacramenta sunt de necessitate salutis, sicut Baptismus et poenitentia, quibus non existentibus, non potest homo salvari. Alia vero sacramenta non sunt de necessitate salutis, quia sine eis potest esse salus, nisi propter contemptum sacramenti.
          <td>
            In the other Sacraments, however, a character is not impressed on the recipient, and hence they can be repeated as far as the person is concerned, not however as far as the matter is concerned. Thus, one can frequently receive Penance, frequently receive the Eucharist, and can be anointed more than once with Extreme Unction, and likewise he can be married more than once. Yet, regarding the matter, the same Host cannot be frequently consecrated, nor ought the oil of the sick be frequently blessed. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#13">[13]</a>

          <td colspan="2"><b>BAPTISM</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>His visis in communi circa Ecclesiae sacramenta, oportet quaedam in speciali de singulis dicere. Primo igitur circa Baptismum sciendum est, quod materia Baptismi est aqua vera et naturalis, nec differt utrum sit frigida vel calefacta. In aquis autem artificialibus, sicut est aqua rosacea, et aliis huiusmodi, non potest baptizari. Forma autem Baptismi est ista: ego te baptizo in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti. Minister huius sacramenti proprius est sacerdos, cui ex officio competit baptizare. In articulo tamen necessitatis, non solum diaconus, sed etiam laicus et mulier, immo Paganus et haereticus potest baptizare, dummodo servet formam Ecclesiae, et intendat facere quod facit Ecclesia. Si vero extra articulum necessitatis aliquis a talibus baptizetur, recipit quidem sacramentum, et non debet iterum baptizari; non tamen recipit gratiam sacramenti, quia ficti deputantur, utpote contra statutum Ecclesiae sacramentum accipientes.
          <td>
            Having considered the Sacraments in general, it is now necessary to say something about each one in particular. First, we consider Baptism, of which it must be known that the matter of this Sacrament is natural water, and it makes no difference whether it is cold or warm. In artificial waters, however, such as rose water, one cannot baptize. The form of Baptism is: "I baptize You in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit." The minister of Baptism ordinarily is the priest, whose office it is to baptize. In case of necessity, however, not only a deacon but also any lay person, even a pagan or a heretic, can baptize as long as he observes the form specified by the Church, and intends to act according to the intention of the Church. If a person is baptized by these not in a case of necessity, he received the Sacrament and must not again be baptized; but the grace of the Sacrament is not received, because such persons are not truly deputed to baptize outside of cases of necessity, and, hence, they act contrary to the law of the Church regulating reception of the Sacraments. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#14">[14]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:center" valign="top">
          <td colspan="2"><b>THE EFFECT OF BAPTISM</b>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Effectus autem Baptismi est remissio culpae originalis et actualis, et etiam totius culpae et poenae, ita quod baptizatis non est aliqua satisfactio iniungenda pro peccatis praeteritis, sed statim morientes post Baptismum introducuntur ad gloriam Dei. Unde effectus Baptismi ponitur apertio ianuae Paradisi.
          <td>The effect of Baptism is to remit both original and actual sin as well as all guilt and punishment which they incur. No kind of punishment must be enjoined for past sins upon those just newly baptized. Hence, those who die immediately after Baptism are admitted to the glory of God without delay. The effect, therefore, of Baptism is the opening of the gates of paradise.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa hoc sacramentum fuerunt aliqui errores. Primus quidem fuit Solentianorum, qui Baptismum in aqua non recipiunt, sed solum Baptismum spiritualem, contra quos dicit dominus, Ioan. III, 5: nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu sancto, non potest introire in regnum Dei. Secundus error fuit Donatistarum rebaptizantium eos qui sunt baptizati a Catholicis, contra quos dicitur Ephes. IV, 5: una fides, unum Baptisma. Est autem alter error eorum: nam dicunt quod homo in peccato existens, non potest baptizare, contra quos dicitur Ioan. I, 33: super quem videris spiritum descendentem et manentem, hic est qui baptizat, scilicet Christus. Unde non nocet homini malus minister nec in hoc nec in aliis sacramentis, quia Christus est bonus qui merito suae passionis perficit sacramentum. Quartus error est Pelagianorum, qui dicunt pueros baptizari, ut regeneratione adoptati admittantur ad regnum Dei, de bono in melius translati, non ista regeneratione aliquo malo obligationis veteris absoluti.
          <td>
            There have been certain errors concerning this Sacrament. The first was that of the Solentiani, who received a baptism not of water but of the spirit. Against them the Lord says: "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#15">[15]</a> The second error was that of the Donatists, who re-baptized those who had been baptized by the Catholics. Against them it is written: "One faith, one baptism." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#16">[16]</a> They also err in holding that a man in the state of sin cannot baptize. Against them it is said: "He upon whom you see the Spirit descending, and remaining upon Him, He it is who baptizes." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#17">[17]</a> It is thus seen that a minister who is himself evil does not invalidate either this or any of the other Sacraments, because it is Christ who, by the merits of His passion, gives to each Sacrament its efficacy; and He is good. The fourth error is that of the Pelagians who say that children must be baptized because by their regeneration they, as adopted children of God, are admitted into the kingdom, but by this regeneration they are not freed from original sin.

The one who is confirmed is anointed on the forehead wherein is the seat of fear; so that he will not blush to confess either the name of Christ or especially the cross of Christ, which to the Jews was a scandal and to the pagans foolishness. For this reason he is signed with the sign of the cross.

Against this it is said that the Apostles sent the Apostles Peter and John to impose hands upon those who had been baptized by Philip the deacon, and they received the Holy Spirit.

The form of this Sacrament is the very words of Christ, "This is My Body," and "This is the chalice of My Blood of the new and eternal testament; the mystery of faith; which shall be shed for you and for many, to the remission of sins."

Alius vero effectus huius sacramenti, quem in anima digne sumentis facit, est adunatio hominis ad Christum, sicut ipse dicit Ioan. VI, 57: qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet, et ego in eo. Et quia per gratiam homo Christo incorporatur et membris eius unitur, dignum est quod hoc sacramentum sumentibus digne gratia augeatur. Sic igitur in hoc sacramento est aliquid quod est sacramentum tantum, scilicet ipsa species panis et vini; et aliquid quod est res et sacramentum, scilicet corpus Christi verum; et aliquid quod est res tantum, scilicet unitas corporis mystici, idest Ecclesiae, quam hoc sacramentum et significat et causat.
          <td>
            The effect of this Sacrament is twofold: first, in the very consecration of the Sacrament, since in virtue of the above words bread is changed into the Body of Christ, and wine into His Blood; so that Christ is entirely contained under the appearances of bread which remain without a subject; and Christ is entirely contained under the appearances of wine. And, moreover, under each part of the consecrated Host and of the consecrated wine, Christ is totally present even after the separation is made. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#21">[21]</a> The second effect of this Sacrament brought about in the soul of one who worthily receives is the union of man with Christ, as He himself says: "He who eats My Flesh, and drinks My Blood, abides in Me, and I in him." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#22">[22]</a> And since man is incorporated with Christ and united to His members through grace, it follows that through this Sacrament grace is increased in those who receive it worthily. Thus, therefore, in this Sacrament there is that which is the Sacrament alone ("sacramentum tantum"), that is, the species of bread and wine; and that which is known as the "res et sacramentum," that is, the true Body of Christ; and that which is the "res tantum," that is the unity of the Mystical Body, that is, the Church which this Sacrament both signifies and causes. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#23">[23]</a>

          <td>Fuerunt autem circa hoc sacramentum multi errores. Quorum primus est eorum qui dicunt, quod in hoc sacramento non est verum corpus Christi, sed tantum significative. Auctor erroris eius dicitur fuisse Berengarius, contra quem dicitur Ioan. VI, 56: caro mea vere est cibus, et sanguis meus vere est potus. Secundus est error Artotyritarum qui offerunt in sacramento hoc panem et caseum, dicentes a primis hominibus oblationes de frugibus terrae et ovium celebratas fuisse: contra quod est quod dominus huius sacramenti institutor, panem et vinum discipulis suis dedit. Tertius est error Cathaphrygarum et Praeputiatorum qui de infantis sanguine, quem de toto eius corpore minutis punctorum vulneribus extorquent, quasi Eucharistiam suam conficere perhibentur, immiscentes eum farinae, panemque inde facientes; quod magis est simile sacrificiis Daemonum, quam sacrificiis Christi, secundum illud Psal. CV, 38: effuderunt sanguinem innocentem (...) quem sacrificaverunt sculptilibus Chanaan. Quartus est error aquariorum, qui aquam solam in sacrificiis offerunt, cum tamen Prov. IX, 5, dicatur ex ore sapientiae, qui est Christus: bibite vinum quod miscui vobis. Quintus est error Ophitarum, qui serpentem Christum esse aestimantes, habent unum colubrum assuetum panes lingua lambere, atque ita eis velut Eucharistiam sanctificare. Sextus est error Praeputiatorum, qui tantum dant mulieribus principatum, ut sacerdotio quoque apud eos honorentur. Septimus est error pauperum de Lugduno, qui dicunt quemlibet iustum hominem posse conficere hoc sacramentum. Contra quos errores est quod dominus apostolis suis potestatem tradidit hoc sacramentum celebrandi, unde solum illi qui quadam successione ab apostolis acceperunt hanc potestatem, possunt hoc sacramentum conficere. Octavus est error quorundam, qui dicuntur Adamani, qui imitantes nuditatem Adae, nudi mares feminaeque conveniunt, nudi lectionem audiunt, nudi orant, sacramenta nudi celebrant: contra quos dicitur I Corinth. XIV, 40: omnia honeste et secundum ordinem fiant in vobis.
          <td>
            There have been many errors regarding this Sacrament. The first error is of those who say that in this Sacrament is not the true Body of Christ but only a sign of it. The author of this error is said to be Berengarius against whom it is written: "For My Flesh is meat indeed; and My Blood is drink indeed." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#24">[24]</a> The second is the error of the Arrodinici, who offer in their sacrament bread and cheese because they say men at first made offerings of the fruits of the earth and of their flocks. Against this, however, stands the fact that the Lord who is the institutor of this Sacrament gave to His disciples bread and wine. The third is the error of the Cataphrygae and the Praeputiati, who drew the blood of an infant from tiny punctures in its body, and mixing this with flour made a bread of it; and thus asserted that they consecrated the sacrament. This is more like the sacrifices of demons than that of Christ: "And they shed innocent blood... which they sacrificed to the idols of Chanaan." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#25">[25]</a> The fourth is the error of the Aquarii, who offer water only in their sacrifices. But against this are the words from the mouth of Wisdom, which is Christ: "Drink the wine which I have mingled for you." <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#26">[26]</a> Another error is that of the Poor People of Lyons who hold that any just man can consecrate this Sacrament. Against such errors is the fact that the Lord gave to the Apostles the power to celebrate this Sacrament; and hence only those who receive this power in a certain succession from the Apostles can consecrate this Sacrament.

            The fourth Sacrament is Penance. The matter, <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#27">[27]</a> as it were, of this Sacrament is the acts of the penitent, which are called the three parts of Penance. The first part is a heart-felt contrition, by which one is sorry for the sins one has committed, and determines not to sin again. The second part is confession, which consists in this that the sinner confesses all the sins of which he is mindful to the priest; and all of them at one time to one priest, not dividing them to a number of priests. The third part is satisfaction, which is enjoined according to the judgment of the priest; and consists especially in fasting and prayer and almsgiving.

            The form of this Sacrament is the words of absolution which the priest speaks when he says: "I absolve You" ("Ego te absolvo").

Quidam autem inungunt in renibus, ubi viget libido. Forma autem huius sacramenti est ista: per istam unctionem et suam piissimam misericordiam indulgeat tibi dominus quidquid deliquisti per visum; et similiter in aliis. Minister huius sacramenti est sacerdos. Effectus autem huius sacramenti est sanatio mentis et corporis.

          <td>
            The fifth Sacrament is Extreme Unction. Its matter is olive oil blessed by the bishop. This Sacrament should only be received by those who are in danger of death through sickness. They are to be anointed in the places of the five senses: that is, on the eyes, because it is the organ of the sense of sight; on the ears, because of hearing; on the nostrils, because of smell; on the lips, because of taste or speech; and on the hands because of touch, and on the feet because of walking. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#30">[30]</a> The form of this Sacrament is this: "Through this anointing and through His most divine mercy, may the Lord forgive You whatever thou hast committed through sight" (and so on for the other senses). The minister of this Sacrament is the priest. The effect of this Sacrament is a medicine for both mind and body. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#31">[31]</a> Concerning this Sacrament is the error of the Elaeonitae, who are said to anoint their dying with oil and balsam and water and to accompany the anointing with invocations in Hebrew pronounced over the head of the sick. This is, however, contrary to the form handed down by St. James, as given above.

Clericatus autem non est ordo, sed quaedam professio vitae dantium se divino ministerio. Episcopatus autem magis est dignitas quam ordo. Materia autem huius sacramenti est illud materiale, per cuius traditionem confertur ordo: sicut presbyteratus traditur per collationem calicis, et quilibet ordo traditur per collationem illius rei quae praecipue pertinet ad ministerium illius ordinis.

            The sixth Sacrament is Holy Orders. There are seven orders: priesthood, deaconate, subdeaconate, acolyte, exorcist, lector, and porter. Tonsure (clerk-ship, clericatus) is not an order, but a formal profession of giving one's life to the divine ministry. The episcopate is rather a dignity than an order. <a href="DeArticulisFidei.htm#32">[32]</a> The matter of this Sacrament is that matter which is handed over to the candidate at the conferring of the order. Thus, priesthood is conferred by the handing over of the chalice, and so each order is conferred by the handing over of that matter which in a special way pertains to the ministry of that particular order. The form of this Sacrament is this: "Receive the power to offer sacrifice in the Church for the living and the dead." And similarly power is conferred in the other orders. The minister of this Sacrament is the bishop who confers the orders. The effect of this Sacrament is an increase of grace for the performance of the duties of a worthy minister of Christ.

In order to explain more fully the nature of a Sacrament it should be taught that it is a thing subject to the senses which possesses, by divine institution, the power not only of signifying holiness and justice, but also to impart both to the recipient. Hence, it is easy to see that the images of the Saints, crosses, and the like, although they are signs of sacrcd things, cannot be called Sacraments. Thus, the solemn ablution of the body [in Baptism] not only signifies, but also has the power to effect a sacred thing which is worked interiorly in the soul by the invisible operation of the Holy Spirit" ("Roman Catechism," "Sacraments in General," Chapter I, 6 and 11).</a>

"It should be explained that the pastor will inform the faithful that the 'sensible thing' which enters into the definition of a Sacrament as already given, although constituting but one sign, is of a twofold nature. Every Sacrament consists of two things: 'matter' which is called the element, and 'form' which is commonly called the word... In order to make the meaning of the rite that is being performed easier and clearer, words had to be added to the matter. Water for example, has the quality of cooling as well as of making clean, and may e symbolic of either. In Baptism, therefore, unless the words were added, it would not be certain which meaning of the sign was intended. When the words are added, we immediately understand that the Sacrament possesses and signifies the power of cleansing... Although God is the author and dispenser of the Sacraments, He nevertheless willed that they should be administered by men in His Church, not by Angels. The ministers of the Sacraments, in performing their duties, do not act in their own persons but in that they represent Christ, and hence, be they good or bad, they validly confer the Sacraments as long as they make use of the matter and the form always observed in the Catholic Church according to the institution of Christ, and intend to do what the Church does in the administration of the Sacraments" ("Roman Catechism," "loc. cit.," 16 and 24).</a>

Cardinals can confirm validly anywhere.</a>
    <p><a name="20" id="20">20. A priest of the Latin Rite who has a special indult granted by the Holy See may confirm Catholics of his own rite only, unless it is otherwise stated (Canon 782, # 4).</a>

"Hence it also follows that Christ is so contained, whole and entire, under either species that, as under the species of bread are contained not only the body but also the blood and Christ entire, so in like manner under the species of wine are truly contained not only the blood, but also the body and Christ entire. These are matters on which the faithful cannot entertain a doubt. Wisely, however, was it ordained that two distinct consecrations should take place. They represent in a more lively manner the Passion of Our Lord, in which His blood was separated from His body; and hence in the form of consecration we commemorate the shedding of His blood. Again, since the Sacrament is to be used by us as the food and nourishment of our souls, it was most appropriate that it should be instituted as food and drink, two things which obviously constitute the complete sustenance of man.<br>
    "Nor should it be forgotten that Christ is, whole and entire. contained not only under either species, but also in each particle of either species. 'Each,' says St. Augustine, 'receives Christ the Lord, and He is entire in each portion. He is not diminished by being given to many, but gives Himself whole and entire to each' (cited in Gratian, 'De consecratione,' dist. 2). This is also an obvious inference from the narrative of the Evangelists. It is not to be supposed that Our Lord consecrated the bread used at the Last Supper in separate parts, applying the form particularly to each, but that all the bread then used for the sacred mysteries was consecrated at the same time and with the same form, and in a quantity sufficient for all the Apostles.

That it differs from the other Sacraments in that for them the matter is something, whether natural or artificial; the matter as it were (quasi-materia) of Penance is the acts of the penitent, i.e., contrition confession, and satisfaction. This has thus been defined by the Council of Trent...

The minister of the Sacrament of Penance must be a priest possessing ordinary or delegated jurisdiction, as is evident in the law of the Church. Whoever performs this sacred duty must be invested not only with the powers of orders, but also with that of jurisdiction. We have greatest proof of this ministry in the words of Our Lord: 'Whose sins you shall forgive, they are forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained' John, xx. 23).
