              Besides, friendship is especially necessary for living, to the
              extent that no one, even though he had all other goods would
              choose to live without friends. Indeed the rich, the rulers and
              the powerful seem to need friends most of all. What purpose do
              goods of fortune serve if not for the beneficence which is
              especially and most laudably exercised towards friends? Or how
              will goods of fortune be preserved and retained without friends?
              For the greater they are the less secure they become. In poverty
              and other misfortunes people consider friends their only refuge.
              Likewise friendship helps young men to guard against wrongdoing;
              it helps old men to support their deficiencies and faltering
              movements arising from weakness. Friendship is even useful to
              people in their prime for the performance of good actions, since
              two persons working together either in intellectual endeavor or
              external activity are more effective.

              By nature the parent feels friendship for its offspring not only

              also friendship among people who are of the same race with one
              another, and notably among men in general. Hence we have praise
              for lovers of their fellow men. Even when traveling abroad we see

              States, it seems, are maintained by friendship; and legislators

              most of all wish to encourage concord and to expel discord as an
              enemy of the state.

              On this subject not a few things are uncertain. Some philosophers
              contend that friendship is a kind of likeness, and that friends
              are like one another. Hence the saying: “Like seeks like,” “Birds
              of a feather flock together,” and other proverbs of this sort.
              Others, on the contrary, hold that all similar individuals are
              mutually opposed.

              Likewise some seek less superficial reasons, those more rooted in
              nature. Euripides, for instance, maintained that the parched earth
              longs for rain and when majestic heaven is filled with rain, it
              longs to fall on the earth. Heraclitus held that contrary
              contributes to contrary, that the most excellent harmony results
              from opposites, and that all things have their origin from strife.
              But others were of a contrary opinion, especially Empedocles who
              contended that like desires like.

            1538. After the Philosopher has determined the moral and
            intellectual virtues and continence, which is something imperfect in
            the genus of virtue, he now turns his attention to friendship which
            is founded upon virtue as an effect of it. First he explains by way
            of introduction what he intends to do. Then [Lect. 2], at “Perhaps
            these questions etc.” (B. 1155 b 17), he begins to treat friendship.
            He develops the first point in two ways. First [1] he shows that it
            pertains to ethics to treat friendship. Next [2], at “On this
            subject etc.,” he shows what matters are to be treated in the
            question of friendship. In regard to the first item he offers six
            reasons to explain what we must consider about friendship. He states
            first what has to be treated, after the previous discussions, in
            examining the subject of friendship, viz., we must consider the
            things pertaining to the study of moral philosophy, omitting what
            belongs to the field of the cosmologist. The first reason [1, a] why
            we must investigate friendship is that the consideration of virtue
            is the concern of moral philosophy. Friendship is a kind of virtue
            inasmuch as it is a habit of free choice—this will be explained
            later (1559, 1602-1604, 1645, 1831). Also it is reduced to the genus
            of justice as offering something proportional (a point that will
            also be discussed later), or at least it accompanies virtue insofar
            as virtue is the cause of true friendship,

            Moral philosophy considers all things that are required for human
            living; and among these friendship is especially necessary, to such
            an extent that no one in his right mind would choose to live in the
            possession of great external goods without friends. Indeed friends
            seem most necessary for the wealthy, the rulers, and the powerful,
            who have abundant external goods. First, for the enjoyment of these
            goods; there is no advantage to be derived from goods of fortune if
            no one can be benefited by them, but a benefit is especially and
            most laudably done for friends. Second, for the preservation of such
            goods that cannot be retained without friends. The greater the goods
            of fortune, the less secure they are because many people secretly
            covet them. Nor are friends useful only in good fortune but also in
            adversity.

            refuge. So then in any situation friends are needed. Likewise
            friendship is necessary for young men that the help of friends may
            restrain them from sin, for they themselves are inclined to desires
            for pleasures, as has been already remarked in the seventh book
            (1531). On the other hand, friends are useful to the old for
            assistance in their bodily infirmities; because they are faltering
            in their movements from weakness, friends are needed to assist them.
            But even to those who are at their peak, in the very prime of life,
            friends are useful for the performance of good actions. When two
            work together, they are more effective. This is true both in
            rational investigation where one sees ‘what the other cannot see,
            and external activity in which one is especially a help to the
            other. Thus it is evident that we must investigate friendship as a
            state necessary for all.

            By nature a parent feels friendship for its child. This is true not
            only of mankind but even of birds who obviously spend a long time
            training their young. And the same goes for other animals. There is
            also a natural friendship between people of the same race who have
            common customs and social life. There is above all that natural
            friendship of all men for one another by reason of their likeness in
            specific nature. For this reason we praise philanthropists or
            friends of mankind as, fulfilling what is natural to man. This: is
            evident when a man loses his way; for everyone stops even an unknown
            stranger from taking the wrong road, as if every man is naturally a
            familiar and a friend of every other man. But those things which are
            naturally good must be treated by the moralist. Therefore he ought
            to treat friendship.

            pointing out that states seem to be preserved by friendship. Hence
            legislators have greater zeal for maintaining friendship among
            citizens than even justice itself which is sometimes omitted, for
            example, in the infliction of punishment, lest dissension be stirred
            up. This is clear from the fact that concord and friendship are
            similar. Certainly lawmakers especially want this harmony and
            eliminate from the citizenry as much as possible contention inimical
            to the security of the state. Because the whole of ethics seems to
            be ordered to the good of the state, as was said at the beginning
            (25), it pertains to ethics to treat friendship.

            if men are friends there should be no need of justice in the strict
            sense because they should have all things in common; a friend is
            another self and there is no justice to oneself. But if men are just
            they nevertheless need friendship for one another. Likewise perfect
            justice seems to preserve and restore friendship. Therefore it
            pertains to ethics to treat friendship much more than justice.

            shows the kind of doubts to be resolved about friendship. Last [2,

            philosophers. He considers the first point in a twofold manner.
            First [a, i] he states conflicting opinions of some thinkers on
            friendship in human affairs; second [a, ii], at “Likewise some
            etc.,” on friendship in things of nature. He says first that not a
            few things regarding friendship are uncertain. This is obvious,
            primarily from the diversity of opinions. Some contend that
            friendship is a kind of likeness and that like people are friends of
            one another. In favor of this they quote proverbs: “Like seeks
            like,” “Birds of a feather flock together.” Certain birds like
            starlings do flock together. There are other proverbs of this type.
            But others, on the contrary, hold that all potters are enemies of
            each other, since one hinders another’s gain. But the truth of the
            matter is that, essentially speaking, like is lovable; it is,
            however, hateful incidentally, precisely as an impediment to one’s
            own good.

            very question some seek loftier, i.e., deeper reasons, more in the
            manner of cosmologists. Thus Euripides maintained that the parched
            earth desires rain as if loving its contrary; and that when heaven,
            worthy of honor on account of its excellence, is filled with rain
            its longs to fall on the earth, i.e., to send down rain to earth,

            things to a man suffering from excessive heat, insofar as the most
            excellent harmony or equilibrium is produced from different and
            contrary things. But he said that the contrary does this inasmuch as
            all things had their origin from strife by means of which the
            elements, mingled in the beginning, are separated. But others like

              neither a mutual return nor a will for the good of the objects.
              Indeed it would be absurd to wish good to wine, although a man
              does want it to remain unspoiled so he can have it. On the other

            (1156 a 5), he distinguishes its kinds. Last [Lect. 1, Bk IX], at

            The first point from two aspects. First [A, 1] he investigates the

            friendship. First [1, a] he investigates the portion dealing with
            the object. In regard to this he does three things. First [a, i] he
            determines the object of friendship. Second [a, ii], at “Do men then
            love etc.,” he raises a doubt. Third [a, iii], at “it seems though
            etc.,” he gives the answer. He says first that these questions will
            perhaps be somewhat clarified if we understand the nature of the
            thing that is lovable, the object of love from which friendship (or
            love) receives its name.

            1552. Not everything is loved indiscriminately because evil as such
            is not loved, but man loves what is lovable, and this is either good
            in itself, i.e., honorable, or it is a pleasurable or useful good.
            The last or useful good seems to be a means of attaining the
            honorable and pleasurable goods which are lovable on account of
            themselves as ends. On the other hand, useful good is lovable on
            account of another, as a means to an end. But the good and the
            pleasurable taken in general are not distinguished from one another
            in substance but only in concept. Something is described as good
            precisely insofar as it is intrinsically perfect and desirable; and
            pleasurable inasmuch as the appetite rests in it. However that is
            not the meaning here: the question here is of man’s genuine good,
            which belongs to reason; and the pleasurable is taken here as that
            which appeals to the senses.

            relative to themselves? These sometimes do differ from each other.
            For instance, to philosophize in itself is good but not in the case

            seems to love what is good for him because every faculty tends to
            the object proportionate to itself. Thus everyone’s vision sees what
            is visible to it. As the totally lovable is the totally good, so the

            1556. Third [iii, z], at “But this makes,” he gives the answer that
            this makes no difference to our proposition; for, when some apparent
            good is loved it is loved as a good for oneself. Hence it can also
            be said that what is lovable is what appears good.

            quia in tali amatione non potest esse redamatio quae requiritur ad
            amicitiam. Non enim vinum amat hominem, sicut homo amat vinum.
            Secundo, quia non sic amamus inanimata ut insit nobis voluntas boni
            illorum. Ridiculum enim esset dicere quod aliquis vellet vino bonum:
            sed hoc bonum quod est vinum homo vult sibi. Unde per hoc quod homo

            1557. The second portion which he gives at “While there are” [i, b],
            relates to the quality of love. He says that while there are three
            reasons why men love, viz., the good, the pleasurable, and the
            useful, friendship does not consist in that love which a man is said
            to have for inanimate things, like wine or gold. He shows this in
            two ways. First, because in a love of this kind there cannot be the
            mutual return that is necessary for friendship, for wine does not
            love man as man loves wine. Second, because we do not love inanimate
            things in such a way that we will their good. It would be absurd to
            say that we willed good to wine; but the good which is wine a man
            wills for himself. Therefore, in loving wine man obviously does not
            have benevolence towards the wine but towards himself.

            1558. If someone says that a man wishes good to the wine because he
            wishes that it be preserved, we should consider that a man wants the
            wine to remain unspoiled so he can have it. In this way he does not
            desire the preservation of the wine for the good of the wine but for
            his own good. And this is contrary to the notion of friendship, for
            we say that the good of a friend must be willed for his sake and not
            for the sake of the one loving.

            1559. The third portion [i, c], which he presents at “But those
            wishing,” refers to change in the one loved. He explains that when
            people wish good to someone for his sake we call them benevolent but
            not friends if the wish is not reciprocated so that the loved one
            wishes good to, and for the sake of, the one loving. The reason is
            that we say friendship is benevolence with corresponding requital
            inasmuch as the one loving is loved in return, for friendship has a
            kind of exchange of love after the manner of commutative justice.

            complete the notion of friendship we must add that it is a mutual
            benevolence which is recognized. Many men are benevolent towards
            those they have never seen, for, from reports, they judge these
            people are just, i.e., virtuous, or useful to themselves. Likewise
            it is possible that one of them should have the same feeling towards
            him who is benevolent in this way. Consequently men of this kind
            seem to be benevolent towards one another but cannot be friends
            while they are unaware of one another’s feelings.

              absolutely all the qualities necessary for friends are joined

              pleasure, either absolutely or to the one loving and according to
              a kind of likeness. But all the preceding qualities are found in

            1562. After the Philosopher has shown the nature of friendship, he
            now distinguishes the kinds of friendship. On this point he does two
            things. First he makes his distinction. Then [Lect. 13], at “There
            are three etc.” (B.1162 a 34), he shows which kinds of friendship
            give rise to complaints or grumblings. He treats his first point
            from two aspects. First he distinguishes the kinds of friendship
            which exist between persons of equal rank. Next [Lect. 7], at “There
            is another etc.” (B. 1158 b 11), he distinguishes the kinds of
            friendship that exist between persons of unequal rank. On the first
            point he does two things. First he distinguishes the kinds of
            friendship. Second [Lect. 6], at “Consequently, the friendships
            etc.” (B 1158 b), he shows, that these consist in equality. He
            -discusses the first point from three aspects. First [I] he
            distinguishes the kinds of friendship. Then [Lect. 5; II], at “Just
            as in the case etc.” (B.1157 b 5), he treats them in relation to
            their acts. Last [Lect. 6; III], at “But friendship etc.” (B. 1158 a
            3), he treats them in relation to their subjects. On the first point
            [I, A] he gives the distinction of the kinds. Next [I, B], at
            “Therefore of those etc.,” he treats the particular kinds.

            is indicated (1552, 1557), namely, the good as such, the
            pleasurable, and the useful; these do not differ in kind as three
            equal species of a genus but are classified by priority and
            posteriority. Since acts are diversified according to the difference
            of objects, the types of love will differ in kind according to these
            three: thus there is one type of love by which a thing is loved for
            the good, another for the pleasurable, and a third for the useful.
            Likewise, because love is an act of friendship, there will be three
            kinds of friendship equal to the three objects of love. One is
            friendship for the honorable good or the good as such, another for
            the pleasurable, and a third for the useful.

            of utility, one does not love the other for the sake of the other
            but inasmuch as he receives from the other some good for himself.
            The same is true of those who love each other on account of
            pleasantness, for the one does not love the other precisely as witty
            or virtuous in merriment but merely as pleasant to himself. So it is
            obvious that those who love for the sake of utility love for the
            good they get, and those who love for the sake of pleasantness love
            for the pleasure they enjoy. Thus they do not love their friend for
            what he is in himself but for what is incidental to him, his utility
            or pleasantness. Therefore, friendships of this sort plainly are not
            friendships essentially but incidentally, because a person is not
            loved for what he is but for utility or pleasure.

            that is incidental to the persons loved and in this men do not
            always remain the same. The same man, for instance, is not always
            pleasant or useful. Therefore, when those who are loved cease to be
            pleasant or useful, their friends stop loving them. This is very
            obvious in friendship based on utility, for the same thing is not
            always useful to a man. it is one thing now, and then another in
            different times and places. So a doctor is useful for sickness, a
            sailor for navigation and so on. Since then friendship was
            cultivated not for the man himself but for the utility he afforded,
            when the cause of the friendship vanishes the friendship too is
            consequently dissolved.

            assigned, saying that friendship based on pleasure belongs most of
            all to youths. This is so because they live according to the
            impulses of passion since they have not been strengthened in
            rational judgment by which the passions are regulated. Because all
            passions terminate at pleasure and pain, as we stated in the second
            book (296, 441), youths principally seek what is pleasurable at the
            present moment. The passions belong to the sensitive part of man
            which is chiefly concerned with the present. But to love a present
            thing because it is productive of future pleasure coincides with the
            notion of the useful.

            of the pleasurable objects, because other things become pleasing to
            them with the passing of time. It is not in the same thing that
            children, adolescents, and youths alike find pleasure; and so they
            easily make friends and easily forsake them because with the change
            of pleasure comes a change of friendship. But youthful pleasure is
            characteristically swift to change since the nature of youth
            consists wholly in a state of change.

            rational choice but from passion and inasmuch as they are very
            desirous of pleasure. Therefore they love passionately and
            intensely. Since passion vanishes as quickly as it appears, such
            persons as easily fall in love as they cease to love; many times
            they even fall in and out of love the same day. But as long as the
            friendship endures these people want to remain together all day long
            and live in the other’s presence inasmuch as they enjoy the company
            of each other. This is the way their friendship works.

            is essential is always better than that which is incidental. Since
            this is friendship essentially and the others incidentally, the
            virtuous who wish good to friends for their sake and not for the
            sake of something that may come from them are the highest type of
            friends.

            further: from the fact that men of this kind love one another by
            reason of their goodness, their friendship consequently remains as
            long as they are good in virtue. But virtue is a permanent habit and
            does not change easily, as is clear from discussions in the second
            book (305). Therefore this friendship is lasting.

            1578. At “Likewise each” [2, b, ii] he shows that this friendship
            lacks nothing that belongs to the notion of what is perfect, as is
            evident in the third book of the <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 6, 207 a 10;
            St. Th. Lect. 11, 385). On the first point he does three things.
            First [2, b, ii, x] he shows that this friendship comprehends those
            things that are found in other kinds of friendship. He explains that
            each friend is good not only simply or in himself but also in
            relation to his friend, because those who are virtuous are also good
            without qualification and useful to one another and completely
            pleasing. This is so because each man takes pleasure in his own
            actions and in actions similar to his own. Likewise the actions of
            virtuous men are those belonging to one man as proper to him and to
            another as similar to these; for operations that are according to
            virtue are not contrary to each other but all are according to right
            reason. So then it is obvious that the friendship of virtuous men
            comprehends not only good in an unqualified sense but also pleasure
            and utility.

            Omnis enim amicitia est propter bonum vel propter delectationem: et

            1579. Then [2, b, ii, y], at “It is reasonable,” he concludes
            further that it is reasonable for such friendship to be long lasting
            and not readily transient, because it contains absolutely everything
            necessary for friends. Every friendship is for the sake of good or
            pleasure: either in itself (for example, when what is loved is in
            itself good and pleasurable) or in relation to the one loving which
            is to be good and pleasurable not in itself and properly but
            according to a kind of likeness to what is really and properly good
            and pleasurable. in fact all the preceding things are found in this
            friendship not incidentally but essentially; and those who are alike
            according to this friendship have the remaining goods too, because
            what is simply good is also pleasing. Since this friendship has all
            the requisites of friendship, it is not easily broken up, for a
            defective thing is usually set aside.

            observes that this friendship is the noblest kind because the state
            in which all the reasons for loving are united is most lovable.
            Objects of this kind are honorable goods because they are good
            without qualification and at the same time pleasurable and useful.
            Hence love in these cases should be most complete, and such
            friendship the noblest.

            this friendship exists between virtuous men. But such men are scarce
            because of the difficulty of attaining the mean, as was pointed out
            in the second book (370). Consequently it is very likely that such
            friendships are rare.

            1582. Then [x, bb], at “Besides, time,” be gives the second reason.
            Friendship between men of this kind requires a long time and mutual
            association so that they can decide among themselves who are
            virtuous and their friends. This is so because, according to the
            proverb, people do not come to know one another before they eat a
            peck of salt together. But one man ought not to take another as his
            friend until he appears to the other worthy of being loved and is
            believed to be so. This rarely occurs. Consequently such friendships
            are uncommon.

              is not easy to believe some evil about a person who often has been
              proved and never found acting unjustly, and in whom we have
              discovered whatever is considered worthy of true friendship. But
              in other types of friendship there is nothing to prevent all such
              kinds of suspicions from occurring. Indeed men designate as
              friends both those who love for utility, like alliances between
              states which seem to be contracted with a view to advantage, and
              those who love for pleasure, like children. Consequently we too
              should call men of this sort friends.

              There are then many kinds of friendship. First and principally is
              the friendship between good men qua good. The remaining types are
              called friendship by analogy, for some men are friends in virtue
              of something good or something akin to good; even what is
              pleasurable seems to be good to those who are fond of pleasures.

              But friendship is divided into these species: evil men can be
              friends for pleasure or utility, this being their point of
              resemblance. On the other hand, good men are friends for one
              another’s sake, i.e., in virtue of their goodness. The good then
              are friends in an absolute sense, but the others only incidentally
              and because of their resemblance to the good.

            friendship, he now [B, 3] compares them. On this point he does three
            things. First [3, a] he shows in what respect the other kinds of
            friendship are like perfect friendship. Then [3, b], at “Therefore,
            for the sake etc.,” he shows how they differ. Last [3, c], at “There
            are then etc.,” he summarizes what has been discussed. He treats the
            first point in a twofold manner. First [a, i] he shows the likeness
            of the other kinds of friendship with perfect friendship in regard
            to the reason for loving. He explains that friendship for pleasure
            has a likeness to perfect friendship to the extent that virtuous men
            are pleasing to one another. Similarly, utilitarian friendship is
            like perfect friendship in this that virtuous men are useful to one
            another.

            1586. Second [a, ii], at “But here again,” he shows the likeness in
            regard to the duration of friendship. On this point he does two
            things. First [ii, x] he shows how useful and pleasurable
            friendships endure. Next [ii, y], at “Likewise, people who etc.,” he
            shows which of these is more enduring. He discusses the first point
            from a double aspect. First [x, aa] he proposes two reasons why
            these two kinds of friendship are lasting; and in this they resemble
            perfect friendship. Then [x, bb], at “Where people etc.,” he states
            the reasons why they lack permanency. Initially [aa, a] he says that
            friendships even among those who are friends for utility and
            pleasure endure for the most part, since such persons make the same
            and an equal return to one another, for example, pleasure for
            pleasure. Because there is a variety of pleasures differing in kind
            and number according to the variety of pleasurable objects, the
            durability of friendship requires not only a return of pleasure but
            a return by the same kind of pleasurable object; this occurs among
            the witty, when one delights in the banter of the other. But this
            does not necessarily happen among persons who love one another
            sexually, since sometimes they do not take pleasure in the same
            things.

            utility and pleasure many remain friends when one loves the ways of
            the other, like one lustful person loves the ways of another, or one
            miser loves the ways of another; not that such ways are attractive
            of themselves but by reason of habit inasmuch as both persons have
            like habits. But likeness is essentially a cause of friendship
            unless it incidentally hinders the good of the individual, as we
            stated previously (1566). Since evil habits acquired from custom are
            enduring, such a friendship is lasting.

            bad, and even those who are neither virtuous nor vicious with both
            (i.e., the good and the bad), and with each other. But only good men
            make friends in that perfect friendship by which men are loved for
            their own sakes; evil men do not provide anything except utility by
            reason of which they can love one another or find mutual pleasure.

            perfect kind, is of itself unchangeable. Friendship is destroyed

            their friendship. But this is impossible in friendship between the
            virtuous. A man does not readily believe some evil about one whom he
            has often proved and never found doing any wrong and in whom he has
            discovered whatever is considered worthy of true friendship.
            Consequently, such a friendship does not break up because it is
            friendship essentially and not incidentally, and because it is
            perfect containing in itself everything requisite for friendship—the
            reasons have been given before (1578-1582); and also because it does
            not admit as an obstacle to friendship what is now offered as a
            reason.

            believing evil of another and acting unjustly to another. Therefore,
            some would not be termed friends according to these types of
            friendship. But people have usually designated as friends of this
            kind both those who love for the sake of utility (friendship is said
            to exist among states because of the advantage of mutually fighting
            against their common enemies) and those who love one another for the
            sake of pleasure, as is evident among children. So we should follow
            the customary way of speaking and call such men friends.

            said about the kinds of friendship, stating that there are many
            kinds of friendship. That between good men, as good, being
            friendship in the primary and proper sense, while the remaining
            kinds are called friendship from a likeness to this. Some men are
            called friends according to these types of friendship to the extent
            that there is present a likeness to true friendship. It is clear
            that what is pleasurable seems to be a kind of good to those who
            love pleasures. So this friendship has a likeness to that which is
            an unqualified good; and the same argument prevails in the case of
            useful friendship.

            that friends for utility and friends for pleasure are identical, for
            things that are incidental are not united in all cases, for
            instance, what is musical and white. The kinds of friendship just
            treated are friendships incidentally, as we have pointed out (1566),
            hence they are not always combined. If then, according to the
            division of friendship into the foregoing species, the evil can be
            friends among themselves, to that extent they are like one another
            in one or other of these aspects. But only the good are friends
            essentially; others are friends by way of resemblance, to the extent
            that they resemble the good.

              kind of equality. What has been said applies especially to the
              friendship which exists between virtuous men.

            distinxit species amicitiae, hic determinat de eis per comparationem

            maximam ex ratione ipsius actus amicitiae, ibi, maxime quidem igitur
            et cetera. Dicit ergo primo quod sicut est in aliis virtutibus, quod
            quidam dicuntur boni, idest virtuosi secundum habitum, puta fortes
            vel liberales, etiam quando actum virtutis non exercent, quidam vero
            dicuntur virtuosi secundum hoc quod actu exercent operationem
            virtutis: ita etiam est et in amicitia quod quidam dicuntur actu
            amici inquantum convivunt cum delectatione adinvicem et sibiinvicem
            bene faciunt, quae duo videntur pertinere ad actum amicitiae: quidam
            vero non operantur actu opera amicitiae, sed tamen sic sunt
            dispositi secundum habitum ut inclinentur ad operandum huiusmodi
            opera, sicut patet de amicis quando dormiunt, vel quando abinvicem
            loco separantur. Non enim ipsa amicitia simpliciter dissolvitur per
            distantiam locorum, sed sola amicitiae operatio. Et sic patet, quod
            amicitia remanet habitu etiam operatione cessante.

            1596. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of
            friendship, he now [II] treats them in relation to the proper act of
            friendship. On this point he does two things. First [II, A] he
            distinguishes friendship by reason of habit and act. Second [II, B],
            at “Affection resembles etc.,” he proves what he had assumed. He
            discusses the first point from three aspects. First [A, 1] he
            distinguishes the kinds of friendship by way of habit and act. Then
            [A, 2], at “However, if etc.,” he shows that some lose friendship by
            lack of friendly acts. Last [A, 3], at “Friendship then etc.,” he
            shows that friendship especially between virtuous men arises from
            the nature of the very act of friendship. He says first that, as in
            other virtues some men are called good or virtuous by reason of
            habit (for example, the brave or the generous) even when they are
            not performing the act of virtue, but others are called virtuous for
            actually performing a virtuous action; so too in friendship some are
            friends actually inasmuch as they live together pleasantly and do
            good for one another—two things that seem to belong to the act of
            friendship. But others are not actually performing the works of
            friendship, although they are so disposed by habit that they are
            inclined to perform such works—this is obvious of friends who are
            asleep or locally separated from one another. Indeed, separation
            does not sever friendship itself but only friendship’s activity.
            Thus it is evident that the habit of friendship remains even when
            its expression ceases.

            colloquitur et convivit alteri.

            1597. Then [A, 2], at “However, if the absence,” he shows how in
            some cases friendship ceases from a lack of friendly acts. First [2,
            a] he explains his proposition. Second [2, b], at “Nothing is so
            etc.,” he proves what he had assumed. He explains his proposition in
            regard to three classes of men. First [a, i], about those who are
            separated from one another for a long time. He says that if the
            absence of friends from one another is prolonged, it seems to cause
            forgetfulness of a previous friendship. In this way other habits are
            also weakened and finally disappear from lack of use. As habits are
            acquired by practice, they must be preserved by practice, for
            everything is preserved by its cause. For that reason it has become
            proverbial that many friendships are destroyed through a man’s
            neglect to call upon his friend, to converse and associate with him.

            1598. Second [a, ii], at “Neither old men,” he shows the same thing
            about the old and the morose. He says that neither the old nor the
            morose, i.e., people severe in word and social intercourse, seem to
            be friendly or disposed for friendship because they are not inclined
            to the activity of friendship, namely, association. Very little that
            is pleasant is found in them. For this reason they are not easy to
            live with, for no one can spend his days (i.e., a long time) with a
            man who is gloomy or with one who is unpleasant. Men and other
            animals find it natural to avoid pain and seek pleasure which
            appears to be simply repose of the appetite in a desired good.

            another in this, that one approves the ways and conduct of the other
            although for some reason the two never live together. Such persons,
            he says, are more like well-wishers than friends because friendship
            requires living together for some time.

            1600. Next [2, b], at “Nothing is so, “ he proves what he had
            assumed, namely, that living together is required for friendship as
            its proper act. He says nothing is so characteristic of friends as
            living together. Previously (1595) he stated that two works belong
            to the act of friendship: living together and bestowing favors on
            one another—this is to bring a friend some benefit, a thing that not
            all but only the needy seek from friends. Even happy people, i.e.,
            those with abundance (who do not like to be alone) desire to spend
            their days (i.e., a long time) with friends. Nor can men associate
            with one another if they are not mutually pleasant and do not
            rejoice in the same things—two qualities found in the friendship of
            those who are brought up together. So then it is evident that the
            principal act of friendship is to live with one’s friends.

            1601. At “Friendship then” [A, 3] he concludes from the premises
            that friendship between virtuous., men is friendship in the best
            sense, as we have frequently noted (1574-1579, 1592). That seems to
            be lovable and absolutely worthy of choice in itself which is wholly
            good and pleasurable. But something of this nature, i.e., good or
            pleasurable in itself is lovable and worthy of choice for everyone.
            But one virtuous man is lovable to another and worthy of choice for
            these two reasons: each is good and pleasant without qualification,
            and each is good and pleasant to the other. Consequently, virtuous
            men especially can live pleasantly with one another.

            according to act but also according to habit. On this point he does
            three things. First [B, 1] he states his proposal, saying that
            affection seems to indicate passion. But friendship seems to
            indicate habit and to be like other habits.

            rationem amicitiae, ut supra dictum est, est cum electione; non enim

          <td>
            1603. Second [B, 2], at “Affection, however,” he proves his
            proposition by two reasons. The first [2, a] is that one-sided love
            can be bestowed even on lifeless objects, as we are said to love
            wine or gold. But mutual love—which belongs to the notion of
            friendship, as we have indicated (1557)—is accompanied by deliberate
            choice, for this is found only among rational beings. But what is
            done by choice is not done from passion but rather from habit.
            Therefore friendship is a habit.

            Secundam rationem ponit ibi: et bona volunt et cetera. Et dicit quod
            homines secundum amicitiam volunt bona amicis propter ipsos amicos;
            nam si eis vellent bona propter seipsos, hoc magis esset diligere se
            quam alios. Amare autem alios eorum gratia, non est secundum
            passionem; quia passio, cum pertineat ad appetitum sensitivum, non
            excedit proprium bonum amantis. Unde relinquitur quod hoc sit

            1604. He gives the second reason at “Men wish” [2, b], saying that
            by friendship men wish good to friends for their friends’ sake. If
            men wished good for their own sake they would love themselves rather
            than others. But to love others for their sake is not from passion
            because passion, since it belongs to the sensitive’ appetite, does
            not go beyond the particular good of the one loving. Consequently,
            it remains that this is from habit; and so friendship is a habit.

            Tertio ibi: et amantes amicum etc., respondet cuidam tacitae
            obiectioni. Dictum est enim supra, quod unicuique est amabile, quod

            quod est bonum sibiipsis. Nam, quando ille qui est bonus in se est
            factus amicus alicui, fit etiam bonum amico suo. Et sic uterque, dum
            amat amicum, amat quod sibi bonum est et uterque retribuit aequale

          <td>
            1605. Third [B, 3], at “Likewise, those who love,” he answers an
            implied objection. It has just been said (1601) that what is good to
            anyone is lovable to him. It seems contrary to this, that a man
            loves his friend for the friend’s sake. But he answers that those
            who love a friend love what is good to themselves. When a person,
            who is a good in himself ‘ becomes a friend to someone, he also
            becomes a good to his friend. So each, in loving his friend, loves
            what is good for himself; and each makes an equal return to his
            friend both in the fact of willing —as he wishes good to his
            friend—and in the kind of willing. He wishes good to his friend not
            for his own but for the friend’s sake. The reason is that friendship
            is a kind of equality precisely as it requires mutual love. This
            seems to be an addition above the mode of virtue, for in any virtue
            the act of the virtuous man is enough. But in friendship the act of
            one is not sufficient but the acts of two mutually loving one
            another must concur. For that reason the Philosopher did not state
            absolutely that it is a virtue but added “or at least accompanies
            virtue,” because it seems to add something above the notion of
            virtue.

              But friendship among morose and elderly people occurs less
              frequently inasmuch as they are more peevish and have little taste
              for conversations that especially seem to be the marks and cause
              of friendship. For this reason youths make friends quickly but not
              old people, for they cannot become friends of those whose company
              they do not enjoy. The same reason holds for austere persons who,
              nevertheless, entertain kindly feelings toward one another; for
              they wish each other well and assist one another in their needs.
              However, they do not really become friends because they do not
              live together nor take pleasure in one another’s
              company-activities that are especially characteristic of
              friendship.

              dissimilarity to the same thing they seem to be or not to be
              friendships. Inasmuch as they have a likeness to friendship based
              on virtue they seem to be friendships; for one kind has pleasure
              and the other utility. But perfect friendship has both. They
              differ, however, for perfect friendship is unchanging and
              permanent while the others quickly change; on account of this
              dissimilarity the latter do not seem to be genuine friendships.

            In severis autem et senibus et cetera. Postquam philosophus

            1607. After the Philosopher has distinguished the different kinds of
            friendship, he now [III] discusses these friendships in relation to
            their subject, that is, to friends themselves. This aspect he treats
            from three angles. First [III, A] he treats the aptitude and
            ineptitude of some persons for friendship; then [III, B], at “It is
            not possible etc.,” the number of friends; last [III, C], at “Men in
            power etc.,” the differentiation of friends. He says first that the
            more peevish they are, the fewer friendships morose and elderly
            people form because, presuming on themselves, they follow their own
            way, For that reason they cannot agree with others: they have little
            taste for conversation with others both because they are intent on
            themselves and because they are suspicious of others. But concord
            and conversation with friends seem especially to be the works of
            friendship and its cause.

            1608. Consequently youths, who find much pleasure in conversation
            and readily agree with others, quickly make friends. This does not
            happen with old people, for they cannot become friends of those
            whose company and conversation they do not enjoy. The same reason
            holds for morose persons who are quarrelsome and critical of what
            others do. But such people, i.e., the elderly and the severe, can be
            benevolent inasmuch as they affectively wish good to others and even
            effectively assist them in their needs. However they do not really
            become friends because they do not live with nor take pleasure in
            the company of their friends-activities that seem to be the special
            works of friendship.

            1609. Then [III, B], at “It is not possible,” he treats the number
            of friends. He explains this point in a threefold manner. First [ B,
            1 ] he shows that it is not possible to be a friend to many people
            by the perfect friendship that exists between virtuous persons.
            Second [B, 2], at “In friendships etc.,” he shows that this happens
            in two other kinds of friendship: those for utility and pleasure.
            Third [B, 3], at “Friendship between etc.,” he compares the two
            kinds of friends with one another. He shows first, by three reasons,
            that it is not possible for a person to be a friend of many people
            by perfect friendship built on the good of virtue. The first [1, a]
            is that, since this friendship is perfect and best, it has a
            likeness to excess in loving-if the extent of love be considered.
            But if we consider the notion of loving there cannot be an excess.
            It is not possible for virtue and a virtuous person to be loved
            excessively by another virtuous person who regulates his affections
            by reason. Superabundant love is not designed by nature for many but
            for one only. This is evident in sexual love according to which one
            man cannot at the same time love many women in an excessive manner.
            Therefore, the perfect friendship of the virtuous cannot extend to
            many persons.

            difficult.” It is this. In perfect friendship friends are
            exceedingly pleasing to one another. But it is not easy for many to
            be exceedingly pleasing at the same time to the same individual,
            because few are to be found who do not have something displeasing to
            a person affected in some way by man’s many defects and conflicting
            dispositions. Thus it happens that, while one is very pleasing,
            another may not be. Perhaps it is fortunate and desirable that many
            cannot be exceedingly pleasing to one man who, while associating
            with many, would not be able to care for himself. Therefore, one
            cannot be a friend to many by perfect friendship.

            happen with many people. Therefore, one does not have many friends

            pleasure’s sake seems to be more like true friendship; on condition,
            though that the same thing is done by both, namely, each affords
            pleasure to the other, for in this way they rejoice in the same
            things—a characteristic of friendship. In fact, this is an
            indication that there is one pleasure for those who delight in the
            same things. But the case is different when pleasure is occasioned
            on the part of one and utility on the part of the other. However,
            such are the friendships among youths that on either side they love
            each other for the sake of pleasure.

            friendship in which a profitable return is sought—this friendship
            seems to be a kind of business affair. Hence friendship for the sake
            of pleasure is more powerful, as more resembling perfect friendship,
            which is most generous inasmuch as by it friends are loved for their
            own sakes.

            Secundam rationem ponit ibi: et beati autem et cetera. Quae talis

            amicis, quia beati sunt sibi sufficientes: indigent autem amicis
            delectabilibus, quia oportet quod aliquibus convivant; quod non
            potest fieri sine delectatione. Sustinent enim homines aliquid
            triste per modicum tempus, sed continue nullus posset aliquid cum
            tristitia sustinere, neque etiam ipsum bonum honestum si esset ei
            triste. Et inde est quod homines qui non delectantur in operibus
            virtutis non possunt in eis perseverare. Sic ergo patet quod
            amicitia delectabilis potior est quam amicitia utilis, utpote

          </td>
          <td>
            1615. He gives the second reason [b, ii] at “But fortunate people.”
            It is this. Fortunate men, i.e., the rich, have no need of useful
            friends since they are sufficient unto themselves, but they do have
            need of pleasant friends, for they must live with others; and this
            is impossible without pleasantness. People can bear unpleasantness
            for a time. But no man can continuously endure something unpleasant;
            he could not even stand good itself if it were displeasing.
            Consequently men who do not find pleasure in virtuous activities
            cannot persevere in them, So then it is evident that pleasurable
            friendship is more effectual than useful friendship, as being
            necessary to a great number and to more generous people.

            must be pleasant to one another. They must be not only good in
            themselves, but also good to one another. Thus they will have the

            habent amicos divisos.
          </td>
          <td>
            1618. Second [C, 2], at “Nor do the powerful,” he proves his
            proposition from the fact that these powerful men do not seek the
            pleasures of virtue—this type of pleasure has utility connected with
            it. Nor do they seek friends useful in the attainment of honorable
            good—this utility has a pleasure attached to it. For amusement they
            seek witty or entertaining people, like comedians. But for utility
            they desire other friends (<i>dinos</i>) i.e., shrewd in executing
            whatever is commanded, either good or bad. These two qualities,
            viz., shrewdness and jocularity, are not found in the same person
            because skillful people are not given to jesting but to serious
            matters. Hence it is evident that the powerful have different kinds
            of friends.

            1619. Third [C, 3], at “It has been said, though,” he answers an
            objection. Someone can object that friends of the powerful are at
            the same time pleasant and useful because, as was explained
            previously (1585), a good or virtuous person is at the same time
            pleasant and useful. But Aristotle answers that the virtuous man
            does not become a friend of one eminent in power or riches unless
            the virtuous person is surpassed in virtue by the powerful. If this
            is not the case, the more powerful one who is surpassed in virtue
            does not make himself proportionately equal, i.e., does not give
            proportionate compensation to the virtuous man; that is to say, as
            the virtuous person defers to him as the more powerful so he should
            defer to the virtuous man as the better.

            that the kinds of friendship discussed consist in equality. He
            treats this point in a twofold manner. First [D, 1] he explains his
            proposition, concluding from the premises that the kinds of
            friendship just treated consist in equality. Since this is obvious
            about friendship for the sake of virtue, he proves the proposition
            in regard to friendship based on utility and pleasure: either men
            wish and do the same things for one another, i.e., return pleasure
            for pleasure or utility for utility, or they exchange one for the
            other, i.e., utility for pleasure or vice versa.

            kinds compare with the definition of friendship. He says that from
            the discussions obviously the kinds of friendship which are less
            proper are less lasting than the perfect friendship of the virtuous,
            according to whose likeness or unlikeness friendships seem to be or
            not to be denominated. Inasmuch as they resemble perfect friendship
            they seem to be friendship according as one of them has pleasure and
            another utility. Perfect friendship has both.

            remaining kinds, however, quickly change; they also differ in many
            other particulars, as is evident from the previous discussions
            (1594-1595). On account of this dissimilarity they do not seem to be

            1624. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of
            friendship that consist in equality, he now distinguishes the kinds
            of friendship that exist between unequal persons. He treats two
            aspects of this subject. First he determines the things pertaining
            in general to the distinction of such friendships. Then [Lect. 9],
            at “As we noted at the outset etc.” (B. 1159 b 25), he treats the
            distinction of these friendships according to their particular
            natures. On the first point he does two things. First [I] he
            discusses the friendships of a superior for a subordinate, as father
            for son, husband for wife. Second [Lect. 8; II], at “Between
            opposites, however etc.” (B. 1159 b 12), he discusses friendships
            existing between opposites, like a poor man and a rich man, and so
            on. He treats the first point in a threefold manner. First [I, A] he
            distinguishes the classification of this friendship from the
            previous kinds of friendships. Then [I, B], at “These friendships,
            though etc.,” he distinguishes friendships of this type from one
            another. Last [I, C], at “Certainly the same benefits etc.,” he
            shows how these friendships are preserved.

            said (1562-1595) consist in equality from the fact that they belong
            to persons having likeness in virtue or utility or pleasure, there
            is another kind of friendship that consists in inequality (inasmuch
            as one person excels another), as the friendship of a father with a
            son, or—in general—of an older with a younger person, or of a
            husband with a wife, or for the most part of a superior with a

            these friendships from one another. First [B, 1] he states his
            proposal, saying that friendships of this type differ in kind. He
            assigns two differences, one according to various relations of
            inequality: the friendship of a father for a son is one kind, and of
            a ruler for his subject is another. Another difference is according
            to the contrasting relation of the superior and subordinate; for the
            friendship of a father for a son is not the same as the friendship
            of a son for a father, nor is the friendship of a husband for a wife
            the same as the friendship of a wife for a husband.

            1627. Second [B, 2], at “Indeed the virtue,” he explains his
            proposal by two reasons. The first [2, a] is that, since friendship
            may be predicated according to habit and act, every friend
            necessarily should have an habitual disposition to do the things
            pertaining to friendship as well as the function itself of
            friendship. But it is clear in the case of the persons just
            mentioned that the function is not the same, for example of a father
            toward a son and of a husband toward a wife or even of a son toward
            a father; and consequently there is not the same virtue. Therefore,
            they are also different kinds of friendship.

            In praedictis amicitiis inveniuntur diversae rationes propter quas

            1628. He gives the second reason [2, b] at “Different, too, are.” It
            is this. In these friendships there are different motives why people
            love. It is for a different reason that a father loves a son and a
            son loves a father, and a husband loves a wife. But according to the
            different reasons for loving there are different kinds of love and
            so different kinds of friendship.

            1629. Next [I, C], at “Certainly the same benefits,” he shows how
            these friendships are preserved. First [C, 1] he explains that they
            are preserved by the parties mutually offering what. they should in
            regard to loving and being loved. Then [Lect. 8; C, 2], at “Because
            of a desire for honor etc.” (B. 1159 a 13), he explains how loving
            and being loved are related to friendship. He discusses the first
            point in a threefold manner. First [1, a] he shows how these
            friendships are preserved because the parties mutually offer what is
            proper. Next [1, b], at “In all friendships etc.,” he shows that
            these reciprocations are considered according to proportionality.
            Last [1, c], at “Equality, however etc.,” he explains how this
            applies to justice and friendship in a different manner. He says
            first that in these friendships the same benefits are not bestowed
            by each friend, and it is unnecessary to expect in return the same
            benefits that one bestows. For example, a son ought not to ask of
            his father the reverence that the son shows the father, as in the
            previous friendships pleasure was offered for pleasure and utility
            for utility. But when children show their parents what is due those
            who have generated them, and when parents show their children what
            is due their offspring, there will exist between them a lasting and
            just or virtuous friendship.

            friendships involving inequality of one person to the other, love is
            given proportionately, so that the superior party is loved more than
            he loves; the same is true concerning the person who is more useful,
            more pleasant, or more excellent in any way whatsoever. For when
            each person is loved by reason of the worth he manifests, an
            equality of proportion that apparently pertains to friendship will
            ensue.

            [c, i] he gives the difference. Second [c, ii], at “This is clearly
            etc.,” he makes it clear by an indication. Last [c, iii], at “From
            this a doubt etc., he solves a doubt. He says first that equality
            and proportion, which are considered in the light of one’s
            excellence, are not found in the same way in justice and friendship.
            For, as we have noted in the fifth book (935) concerning justice,
            excellence first must be accounted or judged according to
            proportion, and then an exchange will be made according to equality.
            But in friendship, on the contrary, an equality between the persons
            loving one another first must be taken into consideration and then
            what is in conformity with excellence must be offered to each.

            Et huius diversitatis ratio est, quia amicitia est quaedam unio sive
            societas amicorum, quae non potest esse inter multum distantes, sed
            oportet quod ad aequalitatem accedant. Unde ad amicitiam pertinet
            aequalitate iam constituta ea aliqualiter uti; sed ad iustitiam
            pertinet inaequalia ad aequalitatem reducere. Aequalitate autem
            existente cessat iustitiae opus. Et ideo aequalitas est ultimum in

            1632. The reason for this difference is that friendship is a kind of
            union or association of friends that cannot exist between widely
            separated persons; but they must approach equality. Hence it
            pertains to friendship to use an equality already uniformly
            established, but it pertains to justice to reduce unequal things to
            an equality. When equality exists the work of justice is done. For
            that reason equality is the goal of justice and the starting point
            of friendship.

            friendship people in humbler walks of life are not likely to have.

            1635. Third [ii, z], at “In such matters,” he answers an implied
            question. Someone might ask what barriers can friendship overcome
            and what barriers can it not overcome. Aristotle answers that in
            such matters an exact determination is not possible. But it suffices
            to know in general that many qualities can be absent from one that
            are present in the other and the friendship still remains. If the
            persons are far apart, like men from God, then the friendship we are
            discussing does not survive.

            doubt. First [iii, x] he raises it. He says that from the
            discussions a doubt arises whether men can wish their friends the
            greatest goods, for example, that they be gods or kings or most
            virtuous. It seems not, because then they will no longer have their
            friends, and in this way they themselves will lose great benefits,
            viz., their friends.

            1637. Next [iii, y], at “If it was,” he solves this doubt in two
            ways. First [y, aa], when it was explained before (1604) that a man
            wishes good things to a friend for his sake, we must suppose that
            the friend himself remains much the same, whatever that may be,
            after the possession of these goods. A person wishes the most
            excellent goods to a friend as he is a man, not as he is changed
            into a god.

            Secundam solutionem ponit ibi: forte autem et cetera. Et dicit, quod
            amicus vult bona amico, non magis quam omnibus aliis. Quia
            unusquisque vult maxime sibi ipsi bona, unde non oportet quod velit
            amico illa bona, per quae ipse perdet amicum, quod est magnum bonum.
          </td>
          <td>
            1638. He gives the second solution at “but perhaps.” He asserts that
            a man wishes good to his friend, but not more than to all others,
            because everyone wishes good to himself most of all. Hence it is not
            reasonable that a man should wish a friend those goods by which he
            will lose that friend who is a great good.

              Since friendship consists rather in loving and friends are praised

              For this reason persons who love their friends in proportion to
              their worth remain friends and their friendship is lasting. In
              this way, more than any other, those who are unequal will become
              friends because they will thus be made equal. But then friendship

            1639. After the Philosopher has determined that friendship between
            unequal persons is maintained by a proportionality of loving and
            being loved, he now [C, 2] shows how loving and being loved pertain
            to friendship. On this point he does two things. First [2, a] he
            shows that loving is more characteristic of friendship than being
            loved. Then [2, b], at “Since friendship etc.,” he shows that
            friendship is preserved by loving according to excellence or
            proportionately. He treats the first point from three aspects. First
            [a, i] he shows why some people wish rather to be loved than to
            love. Second [a, ii], at “And yet men etc.,” he compares being loved
            with being honored. Third [a, iii], at “Friendship, however etc.,”
            he shows that loving is more proper to friendship than being loved.
            He discusses the first point in a threefold manner. First [i, x] he
            states his proposition saying that the majority seem to wish rather
            to be loved than to love; and this because they are lovers of honor.
            It befits the more worthy, to whom honor is due, rather to be loved
            than to love.

            From the fact that many people wish to be loved rather than to love,
            it follows that they are fond of flattery; they take pleasure in
            someone fawning upon them. The flatterer is either really a friend
            of humbler status, since it is characteristic of the lowly to
            indulge in flattery; or by flattering pretends to be a friend and to
            love more than he is loved.

            connected with being honored which many desire. Honor indeed is a
            mark of goodness in him who is honored; and anything that is good or
            apparently good is loved.

            1643. Many are glad to be honored by the powerful, not for the honor
            itself but by reason of the hope they derive from it. They expect to
            obtain something they need from those who honor them. So they
            delight in the honor as a mark of the good disposition or kindly
            affection of the persons honoring them. But there are others who
            want to be honored by just men, that is, by the virtuous and wise
            because in this way they seek to confirm a personal opinion about
            their own goodness. Thus they really rejoice in the fact that they
            are virtuous, as it were, accepting this for the judgment of good
            men who by the very act of honoring them seem to say they are good.

            loved is better than being honored inasmuch as friendship is in

            1646. At “Friendship, however” [a, iii] he shows in what the

            it consists rather in loving, for friendship is predicated by way of
            habit, as has been explained (1596, 1602, 1627). But a habit
            terminates at activity; and loving is certainly an activity, while
            being loved is rather passivity. Hence loving is more proper to
            friendship than being loved.

            Et hoc manifestat per quoddam signum. Matres enim, quarum est

            1647. He makes this clear by an example. Mothers who have a strong
            affection for their children take more pleasure in loving them than
            in being loved by them. Some mothers give their children to others
            to rear; knowing the children to be theirs they love them,
            nevertheless they do not strive much for a return of love, since
            this is not possible. But it seems enough for the mothers to see
            that their children do well and are in good health. Thus they love
            their little ones although the little ones cannot make a suitable
            return of love because of ignorance, since the children do not know
            them to be their mothers.

            1649. Because everyone is praised for his own virtue, the virtue of
            a lover should be judged according to his love. For this reason
            persons who love their friends in proportion to their worth remain
            friends and their friendship is lasting. Thus, when people love one
            another according to their worth, even those who are of unequal
            condition can be friends because they are made equal in this
            way—provided that the one who is more lacking in goodness or some
            other excellence loves that much more. In this way the abundance of
            love makes up for the inadequacy of condition. So by a kind of
            equality and likeness, which properly belong to friendship, people
            become and remain friends.

            kinds of friendship in reference to his previous statements. First
            [b, ii, x] he shows which friendship is most enduring. He says that
            the likeness, which causes and preserves friendship, seems to be
            found especially among virtuous men; for they remain like-minded
            both in themselves—they do not easily change from one thing to
            another—and in friendship with one another. This is so because the
            one has no need for the other to do anything evil for him, which
            would be contrary to the virtue of the agent. In this way neither of
            them serves the other in any evil. But if any evil may possibly
            occur among the virtuous, one rather prevents the other from doing
            wrong; for it is characteristic of virtuous men that they neither
            sin themselves nor allow their friends to commit sins.

            friendship is least enduring, stating that evil men do not have any
            steadfastness or stability about them. The reason is that
            wickedness, to which they adhere, is in itself hateful and so their
            affection varies when they find nothing in which the will can
            repose; in this way they do not long remain like-minded. But they
            desire things contrary to what they previously wanted. Thus they are
            friends for a short time, as long as they enjoy the evil in which
            they agree.

            for utility and pleasure remain longer together in friendship than
            do friends in evil. Utility and pleasure are such that they may be
            loved. Hence friendships of this kind last as long as pleasure and
            utility are mutually provided. But it is otherwise with those who
            are friends for the sake of evil which has no lovableness in itself.

            persons of disparate condition seems to be for the sake of utility,
            inasmuch as one friend seeks from the other what he himself needs,
            and gives something in return to the other. Thus a poor man desires
            to obtain money from the rich man in return for service.

            loves the beloved; for sometimes there is the disparity of beauty
            and ugliness. On the other hand, in friendship based on virtue,
            there is no disparate condition because the greatest likeness is
            found in it, as was noted previously (1580).

            exists in the lover and the beloved, for example, ugliness and
            beauty, it follows that sometimes lovers are derided who think they
            are worthy of being loved as much as they love. This is fitting when
            they are equally worthy of love. But if they have nothing of such a
            nature that they are worthy to be so loved it is ridiculous for them
            to ask it.

            thing (<i>secundum se</i>) but incidentally, for what is essentially
            (<i>per se</i>) sought is the mean which is the good of the subject
            induced to excess by one of contraries. For example, if a man’s body

            absolutely (<i>per se</i>) speaking, but as a means to a middle
            state attained by the moisture. The same reason holds for what is
            hot and contraries of this kind. Because these matters belong more
            to the study of physics, he says they will be passed over.

            1657. After the Philosopher has treated the different kinds of
            friendships existing between unequal persons, he now distinguishes
            them according to their proper formalities. He handles this in two
            ways. First he shows that these kinds of friendships are
            distinguished in much the same way as civic associations. Then
            [Lect. 10; I], at “There are three kinds etc.” (B.1160 a 30), he
            distinguishes the kinds of friendships according to the distinctions
            of civic units. Concerning the first point he gives this argument.
            [A] Every friendship consists in association. [B] Every association
            is reduced to civic association. Therefore all friendships must be
            understood according to civic associations (<i>communicationes</i>).
            He treats this argument under three aspects. First he proves the
            first statement [A]; second, at “All associations are etc..” he
            proves the second statement [B]; third, at “all these associations
            etc.,” he draws a conclusion [C]. He does two things in regard to
            the first point. First [A, 1] he shows that every friendship
            consists in association. Next [A, 2], at “Brothers and comrades
            etc.,” he shows that friendship is differentiated according to the
            diversity of association.

            But justice consists in association’ for every kind of justice has a
            relation to another, as we stated in the fifth book (885, 886, 906,
            909, 934). Therefore friendship too consists in association.

            fellow voyagers who take part in seafaring; fellow soldiers who
            share in military service. The same is true in other kinds of
            association, because friendship seems to exist among people to the
            extent that they share with one another; and because, in accordance
            with this, justice also exists among them.

            1661. At “Brothers and comrades” [A, 2] he shows that friendships
            differ according to different modes of association. He discusses
            this point under three aspects. First [2, a] he explains the
            diversity of friendships according to the diversity of association.
            We see that brothers and similar relatives have all things in
            common, like home, table, and so on. But other friends have
            particular things as their own; some have more, some less. In
            accordance with this some friendships are greater, for example,
            among those who have many things in common; and others are less, as
            among those who have few things in common. From this it is very
            evident that if there were no communication there could be no
            friendship.

            1662. Second [2, b], at “Similarly the notions,” he shows that
            justice is differentiated according to different types of
            association. The same kind of right is not found in every
            association, but a different kind. Thus it is obvious that the same
            right does not exist between father and sons, as between brother and
            brother. Likewise there is a different justice between
            <i>etairos</i>, i.e., people of the same age and rearing than
            between citizens, because they bestow different things on one
            another as mutually due. The same pattern holds in other kinds of
            friendship. So it is clear that different types of justice exist
            between the individuals just mentioned.

            He says justice and injustice increase in proportion as they are
            done to closer friends. The reason is that it is just in a greater
            degree to do good to a closer friend, and unjust in a greater degree
            to injure him. So it is more offensive and unjust to rob or steal
            money from a familiar acquaintance or a comrade than from a fellow
            citizen; likewise, to withhold help from a brother than a stranger;
            to strike one’s father than to strike someone else.

            civic association. Second [B, 2], at “Other associations then etc.,”
            he shows that all other associations are contained under civic
            association. He says first that every association has some likeness
            to the parts of civic association. We see that all associations
            agree in something useful, in the fact that they acquire something
            necessary for living. And civic association also appears to have
            this because fellow citizens seem both to have come together in the
            beginning and to have remained together for their common interest.
            This is evident for two reasons.

            does three things. First [2, a] he shows how some of the other
            associations are directed to a particular interest. He says that
            associations other than the civic intend some private gain. For
            example, fellow voyagers intend to acquire money or something of the
            sort if they are merchants. If they are soldiers they agree in the
            objective of the war, whether this be riches, victory alone, or
            capture of a city. In this way, too, those who belong to one tribe
            or one people agree on some private gain.

            1668. Second [2, b], at “Still other associations,” he shows that
            even associations that are apparently formed for pleasure are really
            for some utility. He says still other associations seemingly exist
            for pleasure, e.g., choruses or those who sing together in a choir
            or a dance, and bands or those who play brass instruments like
            trumpets and cymbals. Associations of this kind were accustomed to
            be established for the sake of the religious cult so that men may be
            more pleasantly detained there, and on account of a wedding or
            nuptials that the groom and bride may have greater pleasure since
            they share in such great rejoicing.

            that all the other previous associations are contained under civic
            association. He says that all were usually placed under civic
            association inasmuch as customarily all are directed by it. He gives
            the explanation because, as previously observed (1667), other
            associations are ordered to some private advantage. Civic
            association, however, does not aim at a private and present gain but
            at what is useful all during life. He shows this especially in
            regard to associations of persons providing entertainment; and most
            of all in sacrifices where it seems less evident.

            of this kind intend to render honor to God and to acquire for
            themselves repose and a little pleasure, which is ordered to the
            good of living. Wherefore the ancients, also, gathered together
            after the harvest in the autumn to offer sacrifices, that is, to pay
            first-fruits. This was a suitable time for men to have leisure both
            that they might rest from their recent labors and because abundant
            food was available. So obviously all these things are subjected to
            the ordering of the state as they pertain to the benefit of living.

            intended, viz., that all associations are contained under civic
            association, as parts of it; to this extent others are directed to
            particular interests but civic association to the common welfare.
            Now since friendships are formed in relation to associations of this
            kind, it follows that the distinction of friendships should be
            observed according to the distinction of civic association.

              The perversion of kingdom is called tyranny. Both are forms of
              monarchy but they differ very much, for a tyrant aims at his own
              selfish interest while a king strives for the good of his
              subjects. No man is truly a king who is not adequate of himself to
              rule and does not abound in all good things. Such a one is in need
              of nothing and therefore will not work for himself but for his
              subjects. Then too a king not independent of his subjects will
              resemble a ruler chosen by lot. But the very opposite of a king is
              a tyrant because he seeks his own profit. Obviously, this
              corruption is the worst, for the worst is contrary to the best.
              But a ruler deviates from a monarchy into tyranny, for the
              perversion of a monarchy is tyranny, and a wicked king becomes a
              tyrant.

              Certainly the association of a father with his sons has the form
              of a monarchy, for he takes care of their interests. Hence Homer
              calls Jove “father” because paternal rule is the ideal of a

              With the Persians the authority of a father is tyrannical; they
              use their sons as slaves. But the authority of a master over
              slaves is tyrannical, for he uses them to his own advantage. This

            1672. After the Philosopher has explained that the species of
            friendship are reducible to civic or political association, he now
            distinguishes them according to the divisions of political
            association. On this point he does two things. First he
            distinguishes the species of friendship according to the divisions
            of political association or states. Then [Lect. 12], at “All
            friendship then etc.” (B.1161 b 11), he subdivides these kinds of
            friendship. He treats the first point in a twofold manner. First [I]
            he distinguishes the kinds of states one from another; second [Lect.
            11; II], at “Each form of etc.” (B.1161 a 10), according to these he
            distinguishes the kinds of friendship. He discusses the first point
            under two aspects. First [I, A] he distinguishes the kinds of
            states; second [I, B], at “Likenesses of these etc.,” he points out
            the kinds of domestic association that resembles them. He handles
            the first point in a threefold manner. First [A, 1] he indicates the
            forms of government; second [A, 2], at “Of these, however etc.,” he
            compares them; third [A, 3], at “The perversion of kingdom etc.,” he
            shows how they are corrupted.

            1673. He says first that there are three forms of polity and just as
            many corruptions or violations. The three good forms are kingdom or
            the rule of one; aristocracy or the government by the best, in this
            that a society is governed by virtuous men. It seems fitting that
            there be another kind too, although some authors do not recognize
            it, as is evident in the fourth book of the <i>Politics</i> (Ch. 8,
            1293 b 22-1294 a 29; St. Th. Lect. 7, 604-613). This is aptly called
            timocracy from <i>timos</i> — <i>timos</i> means reward—because
            under this form of government rewards are bestowed on the poor when
            they serve in a judicial capacity and penalties are imposed on the
            rich when they do not, as is clear from the fourth book of the
            <i>Politics</i> (Ch. 9, 1294 a 30-1294 b 41; St. Th. Lect. 8,
            614-620). Some are accustomed to call it by the common name polity
            from the fact that it is common to rich and poor, as appears in the
            fourth book of the i (Ch. 3-4, 1289 b 27-1290 b 20; St. Th. Lect. 2,

            the best qualified man rules. The worst, i.e., the least good, is
            timocracy in which many mediocre men govern. In the middle is
            aristocracy in which a few very good men rule; however, their power

            headings. First he states his intent, saying that perversion or
            corruption of kingdom is called tyranny. He makes this clear first
            by the fact that they agree in kind, for both are forms of monarchy,
            i.e.. rule by one. Just as one man governs in a kingdom so also in a
            tyranny.

            contraries are things that differ greatly and are in the same genus.
            He manifests this difference by saying that a tyrant in his
            government aims at what is, useful to himself, but a king strives
            for what is beneficial to his subjects.

            1677. He proves this by the fact that a ruler cannot truly be called
            a king who is not of himself adequate to rule, that is, excelling in
            all goods both of soul and body and external things, so he is worthy
            and able to govern. But when he is so endowed he needs nothing, so
            will not work for his own interest, which the poor
            characteristically do, but rather for the benefit of his subjects—as
            the affluent do. A man not excelling in all goods can better be
            called <i>clerotos</i>, as if chosen by lot to rule, than king. But
            a tyrant is the very contrary of a king because he seeks his own
            profit. So obviously this corruption is the worst, for the worst is
            contrary to the best. But a ruler deviates from a kingship that is
            best, as we have noted (1676), to a tyranny that is nothing else
            than a perversion of monarchy or one-man rule; and when a king
            becomes wicked he is called a tyrant. Hence it is evident that
            tyranny is the worst perversion.

            perversion of aristocracy, saying that an aristocracy degenerates
            into an oligarchy which is the government of a few. This happens by
            the wickedness of the rulers not distributing the goods of the state
            according to merit but usurping all or the greater part of them for
            themselves; and always keeping the same people in office, aiming
            especially at enriching themselves and their friends. By reason of
            this a few evil men come into power in place of very good men who
            rule in an aristocracy.

            perversion of timocracy, saying it deteriorates into democracy,
            which is rule of the populace. In fact these two are coterminous or
            bordering upon one another, for they are alike in two ways. First,
            because timocracy or government of rewards is likewise the rule of
            the masses, just as democracy is. Second, in both forms of
            government all who occupy places of honor are equal. On the other
            hand they differ because in a timocracy the common good of the rich
            and the poor is intended, but in a democracy the good of the poor
            alone is aimed at. Hence the perversion inherent in democracy is the
            least, for it departs very little from timocracy which is a kind of
            good government.

            first is the way Persian fathers look upon sons; for they treat
            their sons as slaves. The second is the way masters manage slaves;
            masters intend their own profit in the use of slaves. However, these
            two procedures differ, for the one in which masters employ slaves
            for their usefulness seems to be right. But the other in which
            fathers use their sons as slaves seems to be wrong. The reason is
            that completely different persons should be governed in different
            ways. Consequently, it is wrong for a man to govern children and
            slaves in the same manner.

            wife govern a household is aristocratic because the husband has
            dominion and charge over the affairs that pertain to him according
            to his dignity and he hands over to the wife those matters that

              This is true also of friendship.

            1688. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of political
            and domestic association, he now [II] distinguishes the
            corresponding kinds of friendships. He discusses this point in a
            twofold manner. First [II, A] he states his intent. He says each
            form of government and political order apparently involves a kind of
            friendship from the fact that in every polity a kind of justice is
            found. But friendship and justice are in some way concerned with the
            same matters, as we have indicated (1658, 1664).

            statement: first [B, 1] in regard to good forms of government; next
            [B, 2], at “On the other hand etc.,” in regard to evil systems. He
            treats the first point under three headings. First [i, a] he shows
            how friendship can exist on the basis of kingdom; then [i, b], at
            “But the friendship etc.,” on the basis of aristocracy; last [i, c],
            at “Friendship between brothers etc.,” on the basis of timocracy. On
            the first point he does two things. First [a, i] he shows how
            friendship may exist between a king and his subjects. Second [a,
            ii], at “Such too is etc.,” he compares a father’s friendship with a
            king’s. He says first that by reason of benefit a superabundant
            friendship exists between a king and his subjects, as between a
            benefactor and a beneficiary.

            It is proper to a king to confer benefits on his subjects, for if he

            his subjects as a shepherd his flock, he is even given the title.

            1691. Second [ii, x], at “These friendships, though ‘ “ he shows the
            difference between the two friendships, noting that they differ in
            greatness of benefits. Although the benefaction of a king absolutely
            speaking is greatest insofar as it extends to all the people,
            nevertheless the benefaction of a father is greater in relation to
            one person. A father is the cause of the son’s three greatest goods.
            First, by generation he is the cause of the son’s existence
            (considered the greatest good); second, by upbringing, of his
            rearing; third, of his instruction. These three goods are attributed
            not only to fathers in regard to their sons but also to the
            ancestors, viz., the grandfathers and the great-grand fathers in
            regard to their grandsons and great-grandsons.

            nature a father is the ruler of his son and an ancestor of his
            descendants, just as a king is a ruler of his subjects.
            Consequently, sons are under the dominion of their father, and
            grandsons, of their grandfather, just as subjects are under the
            dominion of their king.

          </td>
          <td>
            1693. Fourth [ii, z], at “Friendships of this type,” he shows the
            basis of agreement for all such friendships. He states two common
            features: one, that they all consist in a kind of excellence of one
            person over the other. Since this is obvious in the case of a king
            and his subjects, he manifests it concerning fathers and sons.
            Because the father greatly excels, parents are honored by their
            sons; for honor is due to one who excels-as we pointed out in the
            first book (214).and the same must be said of ancestors. The other
            feature is that in friendships of this nature the same thing is not
            just on the part of each. The king, therefore, must not do the same
            for his subject as the subject must do for his king, nor the father
            the same for his son as the son for his father. But what is just
            must be judged for both parties according to worth so that each does
            for the other what is proper, because in this way friendship between
            them entails one loving the other in a fitting manner.

            1694. Next [1, b], at “But the friendship,” he shows that there is a
            friendship corresponding to aristocracy. He says that friendship
            between husband and wife is similar to that found in an aristocracy
            in which a few are entrusted with authority by reason of excellence,
            on account of which they are loved. Since those in authority are
            better qualified, more good is attributed to them inasmuch as they
            are esteemed above others; and nevertheless what is proper to each
            is assigned to him. Indeed virtuous men constituted in power do not
            take from their subjects the good that belongs to them. By this
            procedure justice is preserved in accordance with aristocracy; and
            the same is true in a friendship between a husband and wife. The
            husband, being more worthy, is placed over the wife; however, the
            husband does not direct the affairs belonging to the wife.

            1695. At “Friendship between brothers” [1, c] he shows how
            friendship is understood in accordance with timocracy. He states
            that friendship between brothers is similar to <i>etairiciae</i>,
            i.e., friendship between persons of the same age, for brothers are
            equal and alike in age. Persons of this kind have the same training
            and habits for the most part because habits follow the way of
            living, as was indicated in the second book (248, 315). From this
            there appears an obvious likeness between such a friendship and
            friendship corresponding to timocracy in which citizens, who are in
            control, are equal and fair or virtuous. Hence it is just that they
            rule in turn so that one does not have all the power but a part of
            it, which makes them equal in power. So too is the friendship among
            them. This is also clearly observed in friendship among those who
            are brothers and of a like age or upbringing.

            the worst regimes, viz., in tyrannies in which no friendship or very
            little exists.

            proposition. Friendship consists in sharing in common, as we have
            explained (1655-1660, 1661). Obviously then if nothing is shared
            between ruler and ruled-as when the ruler aims at his own good—no
            friendship can exist between them; nor can there be any justice
            between them inasmuch as the ruler usurps for himself all the good
            due to the subject. But this happens under tyranny because the
            tyrant does not strive for the common good but for his own. Thus he
            acts with his subjects -like a workman with a tool, a soul with the
            body, or a master with a slave, for the tyrant uses his subjects as
            slaves.

            persons who use them, to the extent that the objects are moved,
            i.e., the slave by the master, the body by the soul, the tool by the
            workman. However, those who use things do not have friendship toward
            them. Even if they somehow benefit the things, they intend by this
            the good of the things only as it is related to their own good. This
            is particularly obvious of an artisan in relation to lifeless
            instruments which are not objects of friendship or justice because
            they do not share in the activity of human life. Indeed horses and
            cattle are not objects of friendship though they do have life. So,
            too, a master does not have friendship with a slave because they
            share nothing, but all the good of the slave is the master’s as all
            the good of a tool is the artisan’s. In fact a slave is, as it were,
            a living tool and conversely a tool is, as it were, a lifeless
            slave.

            premises there is no friendship of a master for a slave
            <i>qua</i> slave, although there is friendship for him precisely as
            man. A friendship can exist between any two men inasmuch as they can
            share some thing according to law or arrangement, i.e., agreement or
            promise. In this way a master can have friendship with a slave as a
            human being. Thus it is obvious that under tyranny, in which rulers
            use subjects as slaves, there is little friendship or justice.

            1702. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of
            friendship according to the species of political and domestic
            association, he now subdivides the kinds of friendships. On this
            point he does two things. First [I] he states a general principle
            for dividing and subdividing friendships. Then [II], at “Friendships
            between relatives, however etc.,” he gives special treatment to some
            particular kinds of friendships. He discusses the first point under
            three aspects. First [I, A] he proposes a general principle for
            distinguishing the kinds of friendship, concluding from the premises
            that all friendship consists in common participation
            (<i>communicatio</i>), as has been pointed out (1698).

            common participation, the kinds of friendship that seem to have less
            in common. He says that, according to the diversity of common
            participation, friendship can be distinguished in itself and from
            others into consanguineous (or that between blood relatives) and
            companionate (or that between comrades). Blood relatives have a
            common origin, and comrades a common upbringing.

            1704. Third [I, C], at “But civic friendships,” according to this he
            distinguishes friendships that seem to have more in common. He
            states that civic friendships (i.e., those among fellow tribesmen,
            fellow voyagers or men sailing together) and all others of this kind
            (for example, between fellow soldiers or fellow students) have more
            evident signs of association than the friendships of blood relatives
            or comrades; for in the former we must clearly acknowledge that
            association is the cause of friendship. (Friendship between fellow
            travelers can be placed in this category.) But the friendship of
            blood relatives or comrades does not have any present and permanent
            mode of communicating, and so is less obvious.

            1705. Then [II], at “Friendships between relatives, however,” he
            treats in particular some kinds of friendship: first [II, A],
            friendship between relatives; second [II, B], at “Between man and
            wife etc.,” friendship existing between husband and wife. On the

            kinds of friendship between blood relatives. Next [A, 2], at
            “Children have friendship etc.,” he points out the characteristics
            of each division. He discusses the first point under three headings.
            First [A, 1, a] he treats a father’s friendship for his son; second

            for one another; third [A,1, c], at “Nephews, however etc.,” the
            friendship of other blood relations. He handles the first point in a
            threefold manner. First [A, 1, a, i] he proposes in what way
            paternal friendship is related to other friendships between blood
            relatives. He says that friendship between blood relatives seems to
            have great variety, i.e., to be divided into many species by reason
            of the different grades of consanguinity; nevertheless, all such
            friendships depend on paternal friendship as a starting point. This
            will be clear from what follows.

            1706. Second [A, 1, a, ii], at “Parents indeed,” he gives the reason
            for this friendship. He says that parents love their children as
            part of themselves; they are generated from the seed of their
            parents. Hence the son is a separated part of the father, so to
            speak. Consequently this friendship is nearest to the love of a man
            for himself, from which all friendship is derived, as will be
            indicated in the ninth book (1797). With reason then paternal
            friendship is considered to be the starting point. But children love
            their parents as the source of their existence, much like a
            separated part would love the whole from which it is separated.

            1707. Third [A, 1, a, iii], at “Now parents are,” he compares a
            father’s friendship with a son’s. He discusses this point in a
            three-fold fashion. First [iii, x] he ranks paternal friendship
            above filial; next [iii, y], at “From these observations etc.,”
            maternal above paternal; last [iii, z], at “Undoubtedly parents
            etc.,” he clarifies his statement. He gives three reasons for the
            initial assertion. The first is this [x, aa]. The more a man knows
            the causes for love, the more reasonable it is that he love more. It
            has been noted (1076) that parents love their children as part of
            themselves. But children love their parents as the authors of their
            existence. Now fathers can know their offspring better than their
            children can know they are their children, for the parents know the
            generative action (which produced the child) but the children do not
            since they were not yet born. Hence it is reasonable for parents to
            love their children more than children their parents.

            Secundam rationem ponit ibi: et magis quo approximatur et cetera.
            Quae talis est. Ratio dilectionis in omni amicitia cognata est
            propinquitas unius ad alterum. Sed ille a quo, scilicet generans,
            propinquior est genito quam factum facienti, id est quam genitum
            generanti. Genitum enim, sicut dictum est, est quasi quaedam pars
            generantis separata. Unde videtur comparari ad generantem, sicut
            partes separabiles ad totum, puta dens vel capillus vel si quid est
            aliud huiusmodi; huiusmodi autem partes quae separantur a toto
            magnam propinquitatem habent ad totum, quia totum in se continet
            ipsas, non autem e converso et ideo ad partes vel nihil videtur
            attinere totum, vel minus quam e converso. Pars enim, etsi sit
            aliquid totius, non tamen est idem ipsi toti, sicut tota pars

          <td>
            1708. He assigns the second reason [x, bb] at “Moreover, the
            procreator.” It is this. The basis for love in every friendship of
            blood relatives is the relationship of one person to another. But
            the principal or begetter is nearer to the begotten than the thing
            made to the maker or the begotten to the begetter. The offspring
            is—as it were—a separated part of the procreator, as we have
            indicated (1706, 1707). Hence it seems to be compared to the
            procreator as a separable part to the whole, for example, a tooth or
            a hair or the like. But such parts, which are. separated from the
            whole, have an affinity to the whole because the whole includes them
            in itself, and not the opposite. For that reason the whole seems not
            to belong to the parts at all or to belong to them less than if the
            converse were the case; for even if a part pertains to the whole,
            nevertheless it is not identical with the whole itself, as all the
            parts are included in it. Consequently, it is reasonable that
            parents love their children more than children their parents.

            Tertiam rationem ponit ibi, sed cum multitudine et cetera.
            Manifestum est enim quod amicitia per diuturnitatem temporis
            confirmatur. Manifestum est autem quod in maiori multitudine
            temporis parentes diligunt filios quam e converso; parentes enim

            1709. He gives the third reason [x, cc] at “But length of time etc.”
            Obviously friendship is strengthened with the passage of time. But
            it is evident that parents love their children for a greater length
            of time than do children their parents. Indeed parents love their
            children as soon as they are born. But children love their parents
            only after some time has elapsed and they attain intelligence or the
            use of reason, or at least the capacity to distinguish their parents
            from others. For, in the beginning, children call all men fathers
            and all women mothers, as mentioned in the first book of the
            <i>Physics</i> (Ch. 1, 184 b 12; St. Th. Lect. 1, II). It is
            reasonable then for parents to love their children more than
            children love their parents.

            1710. Then [iii, y], at “From these observations,” he compares a
            mother’s love with a father’s. He says that it can be clearly shown
            from the previous considerations why mothers love their children
            more than fathers do. The first reason he gives does not need proof
            because mothers know better than fathers who their children are.
            Likewise in regard to time, for mothers before fathers conceive the
            affection of love for their children because they are more
            constantly in their company. But the second reason is applicable in
            one part but not in the other. For the father disposes the son’s
            principal part, the form; and the mother disposes the matter, as is
            noted in the treatise <i>De Generatione Animalium</i> (Bk. II, Ch.

            what he stated in the second reason, that children are closer to
            their parents than the converse. This is so because parents love
            their children as themselves. Children generated by their parents

            friendship. First [A, 1, b, i] he gives the basis of this
            friendship. Then [A, 1, b, ii], at “Similarity in upbringing etc.,”
            he shows the means of strengthening this friendship. He remarks
            first that brothers love one another because they are begotten by
            the same parents. Things that are identical with one and the same
            thing are identical in some fashion with one another. Since then
            children are identical in some way with their parents, as has been
            observed (1711), the children’s identity with the parents makes the
            children identical in some way. Consequently we say that brothers
            are the same by blood, by stock, and so on. Although the parents’
            blood (the common origin) is entirely the same, this identity also
            endures in some measure even in the children who are separated from
            their parents and from one another.

            how this friendship is strengthened. He observes that fraternal
            friendship is fostered greatly by the fact that brothers are reared
            together and are nearly the same age, since it is natural for people
            alike in years to love one another. Likewise, companions or persons
            of common upbringing usually have an identical manner of life which
            is a cause of mutual love. Consequently, fraternal friendship
            resembles friendship between comrades or persons brought up
            together.

            features are found in friendship of brothers as in the friendship of
            comrades or persons living together. And if brothers are just or
            virtuous and entirely alike in their habits, then friendship is
            greater from this common upbringing inasmuch as they are closer to
            one another. This is due to three considerations. First, to length
            of time, since they love each other almost as soon as they are born.
            Second, to a more perfect likeness. Brothers born of the same
            parents seem more alike in their ways and hence appear to have the
            same natural disposition; they have been reared together and trained
            in a similar fashion by their parents. Third, this is due to the
            proof of friendship since they have put each other to the test; and
            for that reason their friendship is highest and firmest.

            Second [B, 2], at “Children seem to be etc.,” he points out the

            does two things. First [B, 1, a] he offers the proper reason for
            this friendship. Then [B, 1, b], at “Therefore, this etc.,” he shows
            how this friendship shares the general reasons for friendship. He
            treats the first point from two aspects. First [B, 1, a, i] he
            assigns the particular reason for the friendship that is common both
            to man and other animals. Next [B, 1, a, ii], at “Only to this
            extent etc.,” he gives another reason restricted to men. He remarks
            first that a natural friendship seems to exist between man and wife.
            He proves this by recourse to a higher principle; for man is by
            nature a political animal, and it is more natural for him to be a
            “conjugal” (conjugale) animal. Aristotle presents two arguments.

            1720. The first is that antecedent and necessary things seem to
            belong to nature more completely. But domestic society, to which the
            union of man and wife pertains, is antecedent to civil society; for
            the part is antecedent to the whole. Domestic society is also more
            necessary because it is ordered to acts necessary for life, viz.,
            generation and nourishment. Obviously then man is inclined by nature
            more to conjugal than political society. The second reason is that
            generation of offspring, to which the union of man and wife is
            ordered, is common to other animals and therefore follows the nature
            of the genus. So it is clear that man is by nature more a conjugal
            than a political animal.

            concludes from the premises that pairing of male and female among
            other animals exists exclusively for generation of offspring, as has
            been noted (1720). But union of male and female among men occurs not
            only for the procreation of children but also for the functions
            needed in human living. These functions—it is immediately
            apparent—are so divided between man and woman that some are proper
            to the husband, like external works; and others to the wife, like
            sewing and other domestic occupations. Thus mutual needs are

            to have children are separated more readily. In fact, divorce was
            granted in former times because of sterility. And the reason for
            this is that children are a common good of both husband and wife
            whose union exists for the sake of children. But what is common
            continues and preserves friendship which also consists in sharing
            (<i>communicatio</i>), as has been pointed out (1702).

            1725. At “To ask how man and wife” [B, 3] he answers an inquiry,
            viz., how a man and wife ought to live together. He himself replies
            that to ask this is the same as to inquire how justice exists
            between man and wife; for they ought to live together in such a way
            that each fulfills what is just to the other. This will be different
            for different persons, for the same justice must not be observed
            toward friend, stranger, comrade and disciple. Therefore, a study of
            this kind belongs to domestic ethics or political science.

              There are three kinds of friendship, as was noted at the outset.
              In each of them some men are friends on a basis of equality and
              others on a basis of superiority. (Virtuous people become friends,
              and a more virtuous person becomes a friend of a less virtuous
              person; people having the same and different usefulness become
              friends for pleasure or utility.) Equal friends must be equated in
              affection and in the other aspects of friendship, but unequal
              friends must bestow something proportionate to superior merits.

              pain on a person who loves him and acts well towards him, but a

              Now legal utility is expressed in agreements. This is either of a
              commercial type, in hand to hand dealings; or of a liberal type in
              allowing a period of delay, though the quid pro quo is determined.

              Moral utility, however, is not expressed in definite words, but
              the gift is made to any other as to a friend. But the giver
              expects something equal or better in return, as if he were not
              making a gift but a loan; and when the exchange and repayment do

              Therefore, in useful friendship the measure is the utility to the
              receiver. For he needs the help and it is given to him on the
              assumption of an equal return. Now the help of the benefactor will
              be only as much as the recipient gets from it, and he must repay
              what he received, or even more for that would be more generous. In
              friendships of virtue, however, complaints do not arise. Here the
              intention of the giver has a likeness to a measure, for intention
              is the essential element in virtue and moral practice.

            1726. After the Philosopher has distinguished the kinds of
            friendships, he now shows how complaints or grumblings arise in
            friendships. He does this under three headings. First [i] he
            indicates what must be done to avoid quarrels in friendships. Second
            [II], at “It is to be expected etc.,” he points out the friendships
            in which quarrels occur. Third [III], at “As justice is of two kinds
            etc.,” he explains the cause of quarreling. He says first there are
            three kinds of friendship: for virtue, for pleasure, and for
            utility; and in any one of these, men can be friends on terms of
            equality or of merit. He takes up each kind on this very point.

            or between a more virtuous and a less virtuous man; a friendship for
            pleasure, between equally pleasant men or between a more pleasant
            and a less pleasant man; a friendship for utility may provide
            advantages in equal measure or in a greater and less measure. If
            then friends would be equal in any kind of friendship, they must be
            equated both in respect to loving —so that each loves the other
            equally&amp;8212; and in respect to the other requirements such as
            the courtesies of friends. But if they were unequal each must bestow
            something in proportion to his superiority or inferiority.

            proper function of virtue and friendship. And when each strives to
            serve his friend, complaints and contentions cannot possibly arise.

            based on pleasure; for if friends enjoy one another’s company each
            has what he desires, viz., pleasure. For that reason there is no

            pleasant it is ridiculous to complain of him not being pleasant,
            since the one has it in his power not to stay in the other’s

            of so much. But, on the other hand, their benefactors say they

            kinds. One is moral, according as a person provides another with
            help (utilitatem) in conformity with moral practice. The other is
            legal utility, according as a person provides another with help in
            conformity with a statute of law. Now complaints arise in useful
            friendships especially when an exchange of utility is not made
            according to the same standard. One bestows help according to the
            requirements of law, but the other demands it according to moral
            practice. And in this way friendship is broken up.

            statement: first [ii, x] in regard to legal utility; then [ii, y],
            at “Moral utility, however etc.,” in regard to moral utility. He
            notes first that legal utility is expressed in definite words or
            pacts entered into by agreement of both parties. This is twofold.
            One is entirely formal—after the manner of buying and selling done
            from hand to hand—e.g., when someone immediately takes what is
            promised him for service rendered. The other is more liberal
            allowing a period of delay, although the <i>quid pro quo</i> must
            necessarily be determined. Thus the debt is clear and unambiguous,
            but the postponement of it is a kind of friendly gesture. For this
            reason some do not require a judicial exercise of justice but honor
            their word in business dealings; and it is thought they should be

            1736. At “Moral utility, however” [ii, y] he explains what moral
            utility is. He says it is not expressed in definite words or
            compacts made by agreement, but without any contract externally
            declared a person gives to someone else what is usually given gratis
            to a friend. However, the man who makes a worthy gift intends and
            expects in return something equal or even better, as if he were not
            making a gift but a loan. But when an exchange does not take place
            in such a way that the recipient restores and pays equal or more,
            the giver will accuse the recipient and complain of him.

            that what he just said, viz., the person who gives gratis seeks a
            return, happens because all, or most people, wish or approve what is
            noble but actually choose what serves their interests. But that a
            man confer a benefit on another without intending a benefit in
            return is noble. Consequently, men want to appear to confer benefits
            in this way in order to be acceptable to others. But it is
            profitable to receive benefits. Therefore, whatever else they may
            pretend, men choose what is profitable.

            1738. Then [x, b], at “But when a person,” he shows how quarreling
            of this kind is to be avoided. He says the recipient of a benefit,
            when he can, should make a return worthy of the gifts he has
            received; and he should do this of his own accord because a man
            should not make someone a friend against his will, in the sense of
            being willing to accept gratis from a person who is unwilling to
            give gratis. But the man who accepts a benefit made a mistake in
            this at the outset in accepting a favor of a person from whom he
            should not have taken it. For he does not receive a benefit from a
            real friend nor from one who bestowed it for the sake of him to whom
            it was given but for an expected advantage. Hence the recipient of a
            benefit ought to repay the giver on fixed terms or compacts made by
            agreement. And if he can return to the giver the equal of what he
            received, he ought to insist on making complete repayment. But if he
            is unable to repay, neither he who bestowed nor he who accepted the
            benefit thinks it proper to demand this.

            to make repayment to the kind of benefactor who is intent on
            repayment. But when a man accepts a benefit he ought to consider at
            the beginning the person from whom he is receiving it, whether from
            a friend freely giving or from one who seeks repayment. Likewise he
            ought to consider under what conditions he is accepting the benefit,
            whether he could make a return or not, so that he may accept or
            decline the benefit.

            difficulty, stating it is doubtful whether the recommended repayment
            ought to be measured by the utility conferred on the recipient of
            the benefit or by the action of the bestower of the benefit.

            trifle for their benefactors, such as they themselves were able to
            get from others. On the contrary, though, benefactors wanting to
            extol their benefits maintain that they gave the best they had,
            which were such as could not be gotten from others, and that they
            gave these in times of danger and great need.

            1742. Third [2, c], at “Therefore, in useful friendship etc.,” he
            solves the difficulty by saying that repayment ought to be measured
            by the utility accruing to the recipient’s benefit. He is the one
            who needed the benefit and it is sufficient for him to attempt an
            equal return. Indeed the help of the benefactor was only as much as
            the receiver obtains from it; and if it effects more it is better.
            In friendships of virtue, however, complaints do not arise, as has

            intention or will in the giver of the benefit has a likeness to a
            measure, because a measure in any genus is the principal element in
            that genus. But the excellence of virtue and moral practice lies in
            intention. For that reason, in friendship based on virtue a return
            ought to be made according to the will of the person who bestowed
            the benefit even if someone obtained little or no help from it.

              It seems to happen this way in civil affairs, for the man who does
              not contribute any good to the community is not honored. But he
              who benefits the community receives a common good—honor is just
              that. A person cannot expect to be honored by the community and
              simultaneously made rich. Indeed no one could bear to have the
              smaller share in everything. But one person losing in wealth
              receives honor, and another expecting gifts receives riches; thus
              each is equated in proportion to merit, and friendship is
              preserved—as has been explained. Therefore, our friendship with
              unequals should be so conducted that the friend, who benefits us
              in money or virtue, is recompensed in the way that is possible,
              namely, in honor.

            arise in useful friendship between equals, he now shows how
            complaints occur in friendships between unequals [III, B]. He
            discusses this point under three headings. First [B, 1] he states
            the disagreement usually happening in these friendships. Next [B,
            2], for “For the better person etc.,” he gives the reason for
            disagreement. Last [B, 3], at “Both seem etc.,” he defines the
            truth. He remarks first that some difference and discord among
            friends exist also in friendships between unequals when each, the
            superior and the inferior, thinks it right that he should have more.
            If he does not get it the friendship is broken up for this reason.

            motivating the superior parties; then [2, b], at “But the needy
            etc.,” the reason influencing the inferior parties. He observes
            first that in friendship for virtue the better person thinks it
            reasonable for him to receive the greater benefit; for if good is
            due to the good man then more good is due to the better one.
            Likewise, in friendship for utility the more useful person thinks he
            should receive the greater benefit.

            should receive the equal of the more useful partner; for this would
            be a kind of public benefaction or service and not friendship, if
            the advantages arising from friendship were not distributed
            according to the value of works so that the man who does better work
            would have more. In fact they think that, as in business
            enterprises, the bigger investors receive larger returns from the
            general fund, so also in friendship the person who contributes more
            to friendship should receive more.

            maintain that it is the role of a friend excelling in good to

            But he who bestows some benefit on the community is given a common
            good, honor. It is not easily possible for someone to get riches and
            honors from the community simultaneously. Indeed no one could bear
            to have the smaller share of everything, honor and riches alike. But
            the person who loses money by the expenses incurred in serving the
            community is given honor by the state, and the person who expects
            gifts for his service is given riches.

            some and wealth on others according to their excellence, so we must
            handle unequal friends. We should render honor to one who performs a
            useful service by bestowing riches or who does virtuous acts; we
            should do this in such a way that compensation is made—perhaps not

            discussion. First [c, i] he concludes that it is not lawful for a
            son to disown his father but it is lawful sometimes for a father to
            disown his son.

            Secundo ibi: debentem enim etc., manifestat, quod dictum est, duabus
            rationibus. Quarum prima est quia filius, cum sit constitutus
            debitor patri propter suscepta beneficia, debet ei retribuere, nec
            potest aliquid dignum facere beneficiis receptis. Unde semper
            remanet debitor. Et ideo non licet ei abnegare patrem. Sed illi
            quibus debetur aliquid, habent potestatem dimittendi eos qui sibi
            debent. Et ita pater habet potestatem dimittendi filium.

            1754. Second [c, ii], at “For a debt etc.,” he clarifies his
            conclusion by two reasons. The first is [ii, x] that the son being
            indebted to the father for the benefits received ought to repay. But
            he is unable to make a repayment that the benefits deserve.
            Therefore he will always remain in debt. For this reason he is not
            at liberty to disown his father. But creditors have the power to
            dismiss their debtors, so a father has the power of dismissing his
            son.

            Secundam rationem ponit ibi simul autem forte et cetera. Et dicit,
            quod nullus filius videtur recedere a patre abnegando ipsum, nisi
            forte per excellentem malitiam, quia, praeter amicitiam naturalem
            quae est inter filium et patrem, humanum est, quod aliquis non
            expellat eum qui sibi auxiliatus est. Et ita iniquissimum est, quod
            filius expellat patrem. Sed si filius sit malus, pater debet fugere
            eum vel ad minus non dare magnam operam ad providendum ei
            sufficienter, quia per hoc in malitia cresceret. Multi enim sunt qui
            volunt bene pati ab aliis, sed fugiunt benefacere ac si hoc esset
            inutile.

            1755. He states the second reason at “At the same time no one” [ii,
            y], observing that no son seems to forsake his father and disown him
            except out of excessive wickedness. Because of the natural
            friendship between father and son, it is human that no one should
            thrust out a person who has supported him. Thus it would be most
            wicked for a son to expel his father. But if a son is bad the father
            ought to put him out, or at least not work hard to provide
            adequately for him, since the son would thereby increase in
            wickedness. For the majority are willing to accept benefits but
            avoid assisting others as something unprofitable.

            questions pertaining only to the kinds of friendship. Thus he
            finishes the teaching of the eighth book.
