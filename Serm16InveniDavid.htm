                >I have discovered David my servant; with my holy oil I have
                anointed him; my hand will help him, and my a m will strengthen
                him</i
              >
              (Ps. 88:21-22). The wonders of God are inscrutable to man, hence
              Job (5:9): <i>He does wondrous things and unsearchable.</i> Among
              these are the wonders God accomplishes in His saints, about which
              Augustine says: It is a greater thing to justify man than to
              create him, since creation passes away but justification endures.
              Hence, <i>God</i> is <i>wonderful in His saints</i> (Ps 67:36). We
              are not able to scrutinize these wonders that God accomplishes in
              his saints unless He who searches the mind and heart should
              instruct us. Let us, therefore hasten back to Him through prayer
              and ask him at the outset to grant me something to say, etc.
              <i>I have discovered David my servant,</i> etc. From these words
              we are able to learn four commendable things about this holy
              bishop: first, his wondrous election; second his singular
              consecration; third, his effective execution of office; and
              fourth, his unshakable and steadfast stability. His wondrous
              election is pointed out in these words:
              <i>I have discovered David my servant</i>; his particular
              consecration is pointed out in these words:
              <i>with my holy oil I have anointed him</i>; his effective
              execution of office is pointed out in these words:
              <i>for my hand shall help him</i>; and his abiding steadfastness
              is pointed out in these words:
              <i>and my arm shall strengthen him</i>.

                  <b>[His wondrous election]</b>
                  <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                    <td>
                      Let us then look at what it [the text] says:
                      <i>I have discovered David my servant</i>; and here we can
                      consider four ways of understanding a discovery. A
                      discovery implies rarity, investigation, disclosure, and
                      conviction from experience.
                      <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                        <td>
                          First, I say that a discovery implies rarity, because
                          rare things are said to be discovered. It would be
                          laughable to say: “I discovered people on the Little
                          Bridge.” But what is rare is said to be discovered, as
                          we see in Proverbs (31:10) where it is asked:
                          <i>Who shall discover a strong woman?</i> As if to
                          say, only with difficulty is a strong woman to be
                          found because a woman is naturally delicate and frail.
                          <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                            <td>
                              Secondly, things sought for are said to be
                              discovered, as it says in Proverbs (2:4):
                              <i
                                >If you will seek for it as [other men seek for]
                                money, you will find it</i
                              >, namely divine knowledge. Moreover, the Gospel
                              speaks about a woman searching for a lost coin,
                              <i>until she finds it</i> (Lk 15:8).
                              <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                                <td>
                                  Thirdly, a discovery implies disclosure, as we
                                  read in the Gospel:
                                  <i>The kingdom of heaven is like</i> the head
                                  of a household searching for a
                                  <i
                                    >treasure hidden in a field; when he finds
                                    it, he goes and sells all that he has</i
                                  >
                                  etc. (Mt 13:44). When a treasure is brought
                                  forth from the earth and shown to others, then
                                  it is said to have been discovered.
                                  <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                                    <td>
                                      Fourthly, a discovery implies conviction
                                      from experience. When a person doubts
                                      something and afterwards comes to know it
                                      with certainty, he declares: “I have
                                      discovered this to be so.” And in just
                                      this way Solomon declares:
                                      <i
                                        >I have discovered that a woman is more
                                        bitter than death</i
                                      >
                                      (Eccles. 7:22).
                                      <tr
                                        style="text-align: justify"
                                        valign="top"
                                      >
                                        <td>
                                          The Lord <i>discovered</i> blessed
                                          Nicholas in these ways.
                                          <tr
                                            style="text-align: justify"
                                            valign="top"
                                          >
                                            <td>
                                              First, he discovered in him
                                              something very rare, namely,
                                              virtue in the prime of his youth,
                                              which is rare among youths; hence
                                              it says in Proverbs:
                                              <i
                                                >Youth and pleasure are vain.</i
                                              >
                                              This is a <i>rara avis</i>,
                                              namely, that as a youth he was not
                                              subject to vanity; and because
                                              blessed Nicholas preserved his
                                              holiness from childhood, he is
                                              said to have been
                                              <i>discovered.</i> For he himself
                                              "while still a little boy used to
                                              afflict his body with much
                                              fasting." I Also the saying in
                                              Hosea (9:10) [comes to mind]:
                                              <i
                                                >I discovered Israel like grapes
                                                in the desert, I discovered the
                                                sons of Israel as first fruits
                                                of the fig tree.</i
                                              >
                                              The fig ripens later than other
                                              fruits, but if it ripens in prime
                                              season it is said to be
                                              "discovered." Likewise, children
                                              who preserve their holiness from
                                              childhood are called the first
                                              fruits of a fig tree and are said
                                              to be discovered, and this is
                                              pleasing to God; thus in Micah [we
                                              read] (7:1):
                                              <i
                                                >My soul desired the first ripe
                                                figs.</i
                                              >
                                              Fish and fruit in season are very
                                              much desired; so, too, very
                                              desirable to God is the man who
                                              carries the Lord's yoke from his,
                                              youth, as is said in Lamentations
                                              (3:27):
                                              <i
                                                >It will be good for a man, when
                                                he has borne the Lord's yoke
                                                from his youth</i
                                              >, because
                                              <i
                                                >a young man shall walk
                                                according to his way, even when
                                                he is old he will not depart
                                                from it</i
                                              >
                                              (Prov. 22:6). At the same time, if
                                              such as these should depart from
                                              the path of holiness, they return
                                              to it more easily. Secondly, the
                                              Lord discovers in blessed Nicholas
                                              what He seeks. And what does the
                                              Lord seek? Surely, He seeks a
                                              faithful soul, hence [we read] in
                                              John (4:24):
                                              <i
                                                >God is spirit, and those who
                                                worship Him must worship Him in
                                                spirit and in truth</i
                                              >. And why does God seek out the
                                              man with a faithful soul? I say:
                                              whoever takes delight in dwelling
                                              with another person seeks out that
                                              person. So it is with God, because
                                              it gives Him delight to dwell with
                                              a faithful soul. Hence He says:
                                              <i
                                                >My delights are to be with the
                                                children of men</i
                                              >
                                              (Prov 8:31). And God discovered in
                                              blessed Nicholas a faithful soul,
                                              because he was frequently in
                                              church faithfully at his prayers;
                                              so, what is said in Hosea (12:4)
                                              is suitably said of him:
                                              <i
                                                >He wept and made supplication
                                                to Him, and He discovered him in
                                                Bethel</i
                                              >. Bethel means “the house of
                                              God.” Notice how rightly it is
                                              said that
                                              <i>He discovered David</i>, for
                                              David possessed great virtues from
                                              his youth: he slew a bear and a
                                              lion, he was preferred over all
                                              his brothers, and he was also most
                                              devout. The Psalmist says:
                                              <i>As with the marrow and fat</i>,
                                              that is, of devotion,
                                              <i>let my soul be filled</i> (Ps
                                              62:6); and Sirach (47:1):
                                              <i
                                                >As the fat taken away from the
                                                flesh, thus was David separated
                                                from among he children of
                                                Israel</i
                                              >. And blessed Nicholas was
                                              eminently holy.

                                                  Thirdly, the Lord discovered
                                                  in blessed Nicholas something
                                                  outstanding, namely a pious
                                                  affection. What makes a person
                                                  stand out? I say that nothing
                                                  makes a person so outstanding
                                                  as piety and a ready will to
                                                  do good for others. God is
                                                  hidden in Himself, yet He is
                                                  revealed to us through the
                                                  benefits He grants. So, in
                                                  Sirach it is said about those
                                                  who show pity toward others:
                                                  <i
                                                    >These were men of mercy,
                                                    whose pious deeds have not
                                                    failed</i
                                                  >
                                                  (44:10), and
                                                  <i
                                                    >the church declares their

                                                  >
                                                  (44:15). And in another place
                                                  it says:
                                                  <i
                                                    >The lips of many will
                                                    praise him who gives freely
                                                    of his bread</i
                                                  >
                                                  (Sir 31:28). Blessed Nicholas
                                                  was especially “sympathizing
                                                  with and showing pity from his
                                                  heart toward the afflicted,
                                                  and indeed having given them
                                                  gold, he relieved the poverty
                                                  of virgins. Thus, what Hosea
                                                  (14:9) says can be applied to
                                                  him:
                                                  <i
                                                    >From me is his fruit
                                                    discovered</i
                                                  >. And this is why the Lord
                                                  says rightly:
                                                  <i
                                                    >I discovered David, my
                                                    servant</i
                                                  >. A servant is one who
                                                  carried out his lord’s work;
                                                  and the principal work of the
                                                  Lord is mercy, as the Psalmist
                                                  says:
                                                  <i
                                                    >And His tender mercies are
                                                    over all His works</i
                                                  >
                                                  (Ps 144:9). Therefore, the
                                                  Lord’s servant is the one who
                                                  exercises mercy toward the
                                                  poor. As the Apostle says:
                                                  <i
                                                    >We are servants for Jesus’

                                                  (2 Cor 4:5).

                                                      by experience, namely
                                                      faithfulness, which is
                                                      greatly sought after; thus
                                                      the Apostle says:

                                                      (1 Cor 4:2); and the Book
                                                      of Wisdom (3:5) says:

                                                      >. A faithful man must be
                                                      a servant, so that he
                                                      refers all that is his to
                                                      God. You pray, you perform

                                                      refer it to God. Hence it
