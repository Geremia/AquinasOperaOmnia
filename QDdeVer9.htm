                          Quia, ut dicit Augustinus, solus Deus potest mentem
                          formare. Sed illuminatio Angeli est quaedam formatio
                          mentis illuminati, ergo solus Deus potest Angelum
                          illuminare.

                          1. As Augustine says,’ only God can perfect a mind.
                          But the illumination of an angel is, in a way, a
                          perfecting of the mind of the person illumined. Hence,
                          only God can illumine an angel.

                              Praeterea, in Angelis non est aliud lumen nisi
                              gratiae et naturae. Sed lumine naturae unus
                              Angelus alium non illuminat, quia unusquisque
                              habet naturalia sua immediate a Deo; similiter nec
                              lumine gratiae, quae immediate a solo Deo est.
                              Ergo unus Angelus alium non potest illuminare.

                            <td>
                              2. There are no lights in angels other than those
                              of nature and of grace. Now, one angel does not
                              illumine another by the light of nature, because
                              every angel has his natural powers directly from
                              God, nor does one angel illumine another by the
                              light of grace, because grace also comes directly
                              from God alone. Consequently, one angel cannot
                              illumine another.

                                  Praeterea, sicut se habet corpus ad lumen
                                  corporale, ita spiritus ad lumen spirituale.
                                  Sed corpus illuminatum a lumine
                                  superexcedenti, non illuminatur simul a lumine
                                  minori; sicut aer illuminatus a lumine solis,
                                  non simul illuminatur a luna. Ergo, cum plus
                                  excedat lumen spirituale divinum quodlibet
                                  lumen creatum, quam lumen solis lumen candelae
                                  vel stellae; videtur quod, cum omnes Angeli
                                  illuminentur a Deo, quod unus ab alio non
                                  illuminetur.

                                  3. As a body is related to material light, so
                                  is a spirit related to spiritual light. Now, a
                                  body illuminated by a very bright light is not
                                  illuminated simultaneously by a weaker light.
                                  For example, air illuminated by the light of
                                  the sun is not illuminated at the same time by
                                  the moon Consequently, since God’s spiritual
                                  light surpasses any created light more than
                                  the light of the sun surpasses that of a star
                                  or of a candle, it seems one angel is not
                                  illumined by another, simply because all
                                  angels are illumined by God.

                                      Praeterea, si unus Angelus alium
                                      illuminat, aut hoc est per medium, aut
                                      sine medio. Sed non sine medio, quia sic
                                      oporteret unum Angelum alteri illuminato
                                      per ipsum esse coniunctum; quod esse non
                                      potest cum solus Deus mentibus illabatur.
                                      Similiter nec per medium: quia nec per
                                      corporale medium, cum non sit spiritualis
                                      luminis receptivum; nec per spirituale,
                                      quia hoc spirituale medium non potest poni
                                      aliud quam Angelus; et sic vel esset abire
                                      in infinitum in mediis: quod si esset, non
                                      posset sequi aliqua illuminatio, cum sit
                                      impossibile infinita pertransire; vel erit
                                      devenire ad hoc quod unus Angelus alium
                                      immediate illuminet: quod ostensum est
                                      esse impossibile. Ergo impossibile est
                                      quod unus Angelus alium illuminet.

                                      4. If one angel illumines another, he does
                                      this either through a medium or directly.
                                      But he cannot do it directly, because then
                                      he would have to be joined directly to the
                                      angel he is to illumine; and only God can
                                      be joined to minds in this manner. On the
                                      other hand, he cannot illumine another
                                      angel through a medium. He cannot illumine
                                      by means of a material medium, because
                                      such a medium cannot receive a spiritual
                                      light. Nor can he illumine by means of a
                                      spiritual medium because this medium would
                                      have to be an angel, and then an infinite
                                      series would arise, and illumination would
                                      be utterly impossible, for it is
                                      impossible to pass through an infinite.
                                      And, if we finally arrive at a point where
                                      one angel directly illumines another, this
                                      has already been shown to be impossible.
                                      Consequently, it is impossible for one
                                      angel to illumine another.

                                          quod dat ei aliquod aliud lumen. Sed

                                          Nec iterum secundo modo, quia sic

                                          illius luminis, cum illud lumen non

                                          5. If one angel illumines another, he
                                          does this by giving him either his own
                                          light or some other light. But he does
                                          not do it in the first manner,
                                          because, in that case, one and the
                                          same light would be in two different
                                          illuminated beings; nor does he do it
                                          in the second manner, because that
                                          light then would have to be made by
                                          the higher angel and from this it
                                          would follow that he created that
                                          light, since such a light is not made
                                          out of matter. Therefore, it seems
                                          that one angel doe not illumine
                                          another.

                                              by another, then the illumined
                                              angel must be reduced from potency
                                              to act, because to be illumined is
                                              a kind of becoming. But whenever a
                                              thing is reduced from potency to
                                              act something in it must undergo
                                              corruption. Now, since nothing in
                                              an gels can corrupt, it seems that
                                              one angel is not illumined by
                                              another.

                                                  7. If one angel is illumined
                                                  by another, the light which
                                                  one gives to the other is
                                                  either a substance or an
                                                  accident. Now, it cannot be a
                                                  substance, because, as
                                                  Aristotle says, when a
                                                  substantial form is added to a
                                                  thing, it changes the species
                                                  of the thing, just as an added
                                                  unit changes the species of a
                                                  number; hence, it would follow
                                                  that an angel, by the fact of
                                                  being illumined, would undergo
                                                  a specific change. Similarly
                                                  this light cannot be an
                                                  accident, because an accident
                                                  does not extend beyond its
                                                  subject. Hence, one angel does
                                                  not illumine another.

                          1. An inferior angel is in potency to receiving grace
                          in his will and illuminations in his intellect. Now,
                          he receives only as much grace from God as he is
                          capable of receiving. Therefore, he receives only as
                          much illumination from God as he is capable of
                          receiving. Consequently, he is directly illumined by
                          God, and not through an intermediate angel.

                              Praeterea, sicut inter Deum et inferiores Angelos
                              sunt medii superiores, ita inter superiores et nos
                              sunt medii inferiores. Sed superiores Angeli
                              quandoque illuminant nos immediate, sicut Seraphim
                              illuminavit Isaiam, ut patet Isa., VI, 6. Ergo et
                              inferiores Angeli quandoque illuminantur immediate
                              a Deo.

                            <td>
                              2. just as superior angels stand midway between
                              God and the inferior angels, so do the inferior
                              angels stand midway between superior angels and
                              men. Now, the superior angels sometimes illumine
                              us directly. For example, a Seraph illumined
                              Isaiah (Isaiah 6:6). Consequently, the inferior
                              angels also are sometimes illumined directly by
                              God.

                                  Praeterea, sicuti est ordo quidam determinatus

                                  substantiis corporalibus. Sed quandoque in
                                  rebus corporalibus divina virtus operatur
                                  praetermissis causis mediis; sicut cum
                                  suscitat mortuum non cooperante corpore
                                  caelesti. Ergo etiam et quandoque illuminat
                                  inferiores Angelos sine ministerio superiorum.

                                  3. just as there is a definite order of
                                  spiritual substances, so is there also a
                                  definite order of material substances. But
                                  God’s power sometimes acts directly on
                                  material things, passing over intermediate
                                  causes. For example, He sometimes raises a

                                  of a celestial body. Consequently, He
                                  sometimes illumines inferior angels without
                                  the services of superior angels.

                                      power can. Therefore, if a higher angel
                                      can illumine a lower angel, God can
                                      certainly illumine the lower angel
                                      directly. Hence, it is not necessary that
                                      God’s illuminations should always be given
                                      to lower angels by means of higher.

                                              1. Dionysius says’ that God has
                                              established an unchangeable law
                                              that lower beings be led back to
                                              God through the mediation of
                                              higher beings. Consequently, God
                                              never directly illumines lower
                                              angels.

                                                  2. just as angels are, by

                                                  bodies, so are the higher
                                                  angels, by their very nature,
                                                  superior to the lower. Now, in
                                                  matters related to God’s rule
                                                  over material things, He never
                                                  causes anything to happen
                                                  without the ministry of His
                                                  angels. This is clear from
                                                  what Augustine has written.
                                                  Consequently, God likewise
                                                  never causes anything to
                                                  happen in lower angels without
                                                  the ministry of the higher.

                          Purgatio enim est ab impuritate. Sed in Angelis non
                          est aliqua impuritas. Ergo unus alium purgare non

                          1. To be cleansed is to be freed from impurity. But
                          there is no impurity in angels; consequently, one
                          angel cannot cleanse another.

                              peccato, sed ab ignorantia sive nescientia.- Sed
                              contra, cum illa ignorantia non possit esse in
                              beatis Angelis ex peccato, quia in eis nullum
                              fuit, non erit nisi ex natura. Sed quae sunt
                              naturalia, non removentur natura manente. Ergo
                              Angelus ab ignorantia purgari non potest.

                              2. But it was said that this cleansing is not from
                              sin but from ignorance or lack of knowledge.—On
                              the contrary, since such ignorance cannot be the
                              result of any sin in the beatified angels, for
                              they have no sin, it must be the result of nature.
                              Now, those things that are natural cannot be
                              removed while the nature remains. Consequently, an
                              angel cannot be freed of his ignorance.

                                  ergo per purgationem nescientia removetur,
                                  purgatio et illuminatio idem erunt, nec debent

                                  3. Illumination dispels darkness. Now, the
                                  only darkness which makes sense in regard to
                                  angels is the darkness of ignorance or of lack
                                  of understanding. Consequently, if their
                                  ignorance is removed when they are cleansed,
                                  their being cleansed and their being illumined
                                  come to the same thing, and the two should not
                                  be distinguished.

                                      Sed dicebat, quod illuminatio respicit

                                      tertio loco ponit perfectionem.

                                      4. But it was said that illumination is
                                      referred to the end-term, while cleansing
                                      is referred to the initial term.—On the
                                      contrary, in no way of taking them is
                                      there found a term that is other than the
                                      end-term or the initial term.
                                      Consequently, if those two hierarchical
                                      actions, purgation and illumination, are
                                      distinguished according as one is referred
                                      to the initial term and the other to the
                                      end-term, a third hierarchical action
                                      cannot be posited; but to deny such a
                                      third action is to oppose Dionysius, who
                                      places’ the action of perfecting third.

                                          But, as the Master of the
                                          <i>Sentences</i> says, angels’
                                          knowledge grows in some way until
                                          judgment day. Hence, at the present
                                          time, one angel cannot perfect
                                          another.

                                              6. Illumination is the cause of
                                              perfecting, just as it is the
                                              cause of cleansing. Now, a cause
                                              must be prior to its effect.
                                              Therefore, just as illumination
                                              precedes perfection, so does it
                                              also precede purgation if the
                                              purgation be from ignorance.

                          Iob XXVIII, 17: non adaequabitur ei aurum vel vitrum,
                          tunc erit unus conspicabilis alteri, sicut nunc non
                          est conspicabilis ipse sibi. Sed nunc non oportet quod
                          aliquis sibi loquatur, ad hoc quod conceptum suum
                          cognoscat. Ergo nec in patria erit necessarium ut unus
                          alteri loquatur ad suum conceptum demonstrandum; ergo
                          nec in Angelis, qui sunt beati, necessaria est
                          locutio.

                          1. Commenting on the words of Job (28:17), “Gold or
                          crystal cannot equal it,” Gregory says: “In heaven
                          everyone will be seen by others as now he does not
                          even see himself.” But while on earth person does not
                          have to speak to himself in order to know his own
                          idea. Consequently, in heaven it will not be necessary
                          for him to speak to another so that he can know it.
                          Hence, speech is unnecessary for beatified angels.

                              Praeterea, Gregorius, ibidem, dicit: cum
                              uniuscuiusque vultus attenditur, simul et
                              conscientia penetratur. Ergo non requiritur ibi
                              locutio, ad hoc quod unus alterius conceptum
                              sciat.

                              2. In the same passage, Gregory writes: “When
                              one’s face is seen, in the same instant, his
                              conscience will be penetrated.” Therefore, in
                              heaven speech is not required for one person to
                              know another’s concept.

                                  silentium locutioni opponitur. Ergo Angeli

                                  to speak to each other. For, in some way, they
                                  silently discuss things and communicate their
                                  thoughts to each other.” Now, since silence is
                                  opposed to speech, angels know what other
                                  angels want to signify, without having to
                                  speak.

                                      4. All speech takes place through signs.
                                      Now, a sign must be some thing that can be
                                      sensed, because, as is said in the
                                      <i>Sentences</i>: “A sign is that which,
                                      besides impressing a species upon the
                                      senses, make something else known.”
                                      Consequently, since angels do not receive
                                      their knowledge from sensible things, they
                                      do not receive it by mean of signs, and,
                                      hence, not through speech.

                                          est demonstratio propter quid. Sed
                                          Angelus non accipit cognitionem ex his
                                          quae sunt posteriora in natura. Ergo
                                          nec per signum; et ita nec per
                                          locutionem.

                                          5. A sign seems to be something that
                                          is more known to us but les known
                                          according to nature. Accordingly, the
                                          Commentator distinguishes between a
                                          demonstration through a sign and a
                                          perfect demonstration, the latter
                                          being a demonstration which is causal.
                                          Now, angels do not receive their
                                          knowledge from things posterior in
                                          nature, consequently, not from signs.
                                          Hence, they do not receive knowledge
                                          by means of speech.

                                              arouse his listener to attention
                                              to his words, which, in our case,
                                              are produced by the voice of the
                                              speaker. But to listen to words of
                                              this kind is impossible for an
                                              angel. Therefore, speech is
                                              likewise impossible for him.

                                                  given to us so we could know
                                                  signs of others’ wills. But
                                                  one angel knows the signs of
                                                  another angel’s will by
                                                  knowing himself, because these
                                                  signs are spiritual, and, by
                                                  the same knowledge, an angel
                                                  knows all spiritual things.
                                                  Hence, since one angel knows
                                                  the spiritual nature of
                                                  another angel by knowing
                                                  himself in the same way he
                                                  knows his will. Therefore, he
                                                  has no need of speech.

                                                      whatever exists in a
                                                      thing, whether it be
                                                      interior or exterior, are
                                                      produced by means of these
                                                      intelligible characters.
                                                      Therefore, when an angel
                                                      knows another angel by
                                                      means of the forms within
                                                      his own intellect, he also
                                                      knows all that is within
                                                      that angel; and, as a
                                                      consequence, he knows that
                                                      angel’s thought. Hence,
                                                      the same must be said as
                                                      before.

                                                          9. We have two kinds
                                                          of speech, namely,
                                                          internal and external.
                                                          Now, we do not say
                                                          that there is external
                                                          speech in angels,
                                                          because, if this were
                                                          true, angels would
                                                          have to form vocal

                                                          each other. However,
                                                          as Anselm~ and
                                                          Augustine” say,
                                                          “Internal speech is
                                                          nothing other than
                                                          thought.” Therefore,
                                                          it is not necessary to
                                                          assert that there
                                                          exists in angels any
                                                          kind of speech other
                                                          than thought.

                          Per Glossam quae habetur I Cor. XIII, 1: si linguis
                          hominum etc., quae sic dicit: linguae sunt quibus
                          Angeli praepositi significant minoribus quod de Dei
                          voluntate primi sentiunt. Ergo locutio, quae est actus
                          linguae, ad solos superiores Angelos pertinet.

                          1. In its explanation of that verse in the first
                          Epistle to the Corinthians (13:1), “If I speak with
                          the tongues of men and of angels,” the Gloss reads as
                          follows: “These tongues are the means by which the
                          superior angels tell the inferior angels what they are
                          first to learn about the will of God.” Consequently,
                          speech, an act of the tongue, belongs only to the
                          higher angels.

                              audiente. Sed ab Angelis inferioribus nihil potest
                              in superiores fieri, quia superiores non sunt in
                              potentia respectu inferiorum, sed magis e
                              converso; cum superiores habeant magis de actu, et
                              minus de potentia. Ergo inferiores Angeli non
                              possunt loqui superioribus.

                              2. Whenever anyone speaks, something takes place
                              in his listener. Now, in the higher angels,
                              nothing can take place that is caused by the
                              lower, because the higher are not in potency with
                              respect to the lower; rather, the opposite is
                              true, since the superior angels have more act and
                              less potency. Consequently, the lower angels
                              cannot speak to the higher.

                                  non possunt aliquid infundere superioribus,
                                  quia sic in eos agerent, quod esse non potest.
                                  Ergo eis non loquuntur.

                                  3. To the notion of thought speech adds that
                                  of infusing knowledge. But the lower angels
                                  cannot infuse anything into the higher angels,
                                  because in that case they would be acting upon
                                  them, and this is impossible. Therefore, the
                                  lower do not speak to the higher angels.

                                      quam manifestatio alicuius ignoti. Sed
                                      locutio est in Angelis ad manifestandum
                                      aliquid ignotum. Ergo locutio in Angelis
                                      est illuminatio quaedam. Ergo, cum Angeli
                                      inferiores non illuminent superiores,
                                      videtur quod inferiores superioribus non
                                      loquantur.

                                      4. To illumine is simply to manifest
                                      something unknown. Now, angelic speech is
                                      for the manifestation of something
                                      unknown. Therefore, angelic speech is an
                                      illumination. Hence, since inferior angels
                                      do not illumine superior angels, it would
                                      seem that they also do not speak to them.

                                          Praeterea, Angelus ad quem fit
                                          locutio, est in potentia cognoscens id
                                          quod locutione exprimitur; per
                                          locutionem autem fit actu cognoscens.
                                          Ergo Angelus loquens reducit illum cui
                                          loquitur de potentia in actum. Sed hoc
                                          non est possibile inferioribus Angelis
                                          respectu superiorum, quia sic essent
                                          eis nobiliores. Ergo non loquuntur
                                          inferiores superioribus.

                                          5. The angel to whom another angel
                                          speaks is in potency to knowing what
                                          is expressed in the speech, and, by
                                          means of this speech, he comes to know
                                          it actually. Consequently, the angel
                                          speaking reduces the one spoken to
                                          from potency to act. Now, this is not
                                          possible for inferior angels with
                                          respect to superior angels, because in
                                          that case the inferior angels would be
                                          more noble. Hence, inferior angels do
                                          not speak to superior angels.

                                              6. One person teaches another if
                                              he tells him something that he did
                                              not know. Consequently, if
                                              inferior angels speak to superior
                                              angels about their concepts, which
                                              the superior are ignorant of, it
                                              would seem that they teach the
                                              superior angels, and thus perfect
                                              them, since, as Dionysius says, to
                                              teach is to perfect. But this
                                              would be contrary to the
                                              hierarchical order, according to

                                                      Gregory says: “God speaks
                                                      to angels, and angels
                                                      speak to God.” On the same
                                                      principle, therefore,
                                                      superior angels can talk
                                                      to the inferior, and
                                                      inferior to the superior.

                          1. Whenever arrival and departure are involved, there
                          is necessarily a determinate distance. But, as Maximus
                          says, angels see each other’s thoughts as they
                          approach and depart from one another. Therefore.

                              operatur, ibi est. Si ergo Angelus alteri Angelo
                              loquitur, oportet quod sit ubi est ille cui
                              loquitur, et sic requiritur determinata distantia.

                              2. According to Damascene, an angel is where he
                              operates. Consequently, if he speaks to another
                              angel, he must be where his listener is; hence,
                              some determinate distance is involved.

                                  Praeterea, Isa. VI, 3, dicitur quod alter
                                  clamabat ad alterum. Sed locutio clamosa non
                                  habet locum nisi propter distantiam eius cui
                                  loquimur. Ergo videtur quod distantia impediat
                                  locutionem Angeli.

                                  3. We read in Isaiah (6:3): “They cried one to
                                  another.” Now, the only reason for making
                                  cries is that a distance separates us from the
                                  one to whom we are speaking. Therefore, it
                                  seems that distance impedes the speech of
                                  angels.

                                      Praeterea, locutio oportet quod deferatur
                                      a loquente in audientem; sed hoc non
                                      potest esse si sit localis distantia inter
                                      loquentem Angelum et audientem, quia
                                      locutio spiritualis per medium corporale
                                      non defertur. Ergo distantia localis
                                      locutionem Angeli impedit.

                                      4. Speech must be carried from the one
                                      speaking to the one listening. Now, this
                                      is not possible unless local distance
                                      separates the angel speaking from the one
                                      listening, because spiritual speech cannot
                                      be carried by a material medium..
                                      Therefore, local distance impedes the
                                      speech of angels.

                                          cognosceret ea quae hic aguntur: cum
                                          autem est in caelo, non cognoscit;
                                          unde Isa. LXIIII, super illud Abraham
                                          nescivit nos, dicit Glossa Augustini:
                                          nesciunt mortui, etiam sancti, quid
                                          agant vivi etiam eorum filii. Ergo
                                          distantia localis impedit animae
                                          beatae cognitionem; et eadem ratione
                                          Angeli et etiam locutionem.

                                          5. If Peter’s soul were on earth, it
                                          would know the events taking place
                                          here; but, since it is in heaven, it
                                          does not. Hence, the gloss of
                                          Augustine on Isaiah (6 3:16), “Abraham
                                          has not known us,” says: “The
                                          dead”—even the saints—“do not know
                                          what the living are doing”—even their
                                          own sons. Consequently, local distance
                                          impedes the cognition of a separated
                                          soul, and, by the same reasoning, that
                                          of angels, and also their speech.

                                                  The greatest possible distance
                                                  separates paradise from hell;
                                                  but the blessed and the damned
                                                  can see each other, especially
                                                  before the day of final
                                                  judgment. This is clear from
                                                  Luke’s account of Lazarus and
                                                  the rich man (Luke 16:19-31).
                                                  Consequently, no local
                                                  distance impedes the cognition
                                                  of a separated soul or that of
                                                  an angel. By the same
                                                  reasoning, it does not impede
                                                  angels’ speech.

                                                          Hence, since his

                          1. For angelic speech, all that is required is an
                          intelligible species and a turning to another angel.
                          But, if that species and turning are known by one
                          angel, so they are also known by another. Therefore,
                          what an angel says is equally perceived by all.

                              Angelos loquitur. Si igitur aliquis Angelus
                              cognoscit locutionem qua aliquis Angelus ei
                              loquitur, eadem ratione cognoscet locutionem qua
                              idem Angelus aliis loquitur.

                              2. Using the same “nods,” one angel can speak to
                              all the angels. Consequently, if an angel knows
                              the speech by which another angel addresses him,
                              he will also know the speech by which he addresses
                              others.

                                  intuentur. Ergo unus Angelus semper cognoscit
                                  locutionem alterius, sive sibi sive alteri
                                  loquatur.

                                  3. Whoever sees an angel perceives the species
                                  by which that angel understands and speaks.
                                  But angels always see one another. Therefore,
                                  one angel always knows what another is
                                  speaking, whether that angel is speaking to
                                  him or to some other angel.

                                      quam ille ad quem loquitur, secundum
                                      ordinem naturae, vel etiam secundum locum.
                                      Ergo non solum auditur ab eo ad quem
                                      loquitur.

                                      4. If a man speaks, he is heard equally by
                                      all those standing at the same distance
                                      from him, unless there is some defect in
                                      one of the hearers, that is, if he is hard
                                      of hearing. Now, sometimes another angel
                                      is by nature or locally closer to the
                                      angel speaking than is the angel who is
                                      being addressed. Therefore, the angel
                                      speaking is heard by others than those
                                      whom he addresses.

                                              Inconveniens videtur dicere, quod

                                              non possint. Sed homo potest

                                              Angelus potest alteri loqui sine
                                              hoc quod ab aliquo alio
                                              percipiatur.

                                              It seems inconsistent to assert
                                              that the angels cannot do
                                              something which we can do. But a
                                              man can confide to another what he
                                              has conceived in his heart in such
                                              a way that it remains hidden from
                                              others. Consequently, an angel is
                                              also able to speak to another
                                              without letting others know what
                                              he is saying.

                                                      to the knowledge of
                                                      another after the manner
                                                      of spiritual speech from
                                                      the fact that the latter
                                                      angel is actuated by a

                                                      subjectively but also with
                                                      reference to the former;
                                                      and this occurs by the
                                                      will of the speaker.
