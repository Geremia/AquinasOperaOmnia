          <td>It seems that it is the essence of the soul, for
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia Augustinus dicit, IX de Trinitate, quod mens et spiritus non relative dicuntur, sed essentiam demonstrant: nonnisi essentiam animae. Ergo mens est ipsa animae essentia.
          <td>1. Augustine says: “The terms <i>mind</i> and spirit are not taken relatively, but denote the essence, and nothing but the essence of the soul. Therefore, the mind is the essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, diversa genera potentiarum animae non uniuntur nisi in essentia. Sed appetitivum et intellectivum sunt diversa genera potentiarum animae: ponuntur enim, in fine I de anima, quinque genera communissima potentiarum animae: scilicet vegetativum, sensitivum, appetitivum, motivum secundum locum, et intellectivum. Cum ergo mens comprehendat in se intellectivum et appetitivum, quia in mente ponitur ab Augustino intelligentia et voluntas, videtur quod non sit mens aliqua potentia, sed ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>2. Different classes of powers of the soul are found only in its essence. But the appetitive and intellective are different classes of powers of the soul. For <i>The Soul</i> gives five most general classes of powers of the soul: vegetative, sensitive, appetitive, locomotive, and intellective. But the mind includes within it appetitive and intellective powers, for Augustine puts understanding and will in the mind. It seems, then, that the mind is not a power, but the very essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus, XI de civitate Dei, dicit, quod nos sumus, ad imaginem Dei, inquantum sumus, novimus nos esse, et amamus utrumque; in IX vero de Trinit. assignat imaginem Dei in nobis secundum mentem, notitiam et amorem. Cum ergo amare sit actus amoris, et nosse sit actus notitiae, videtur quod esse sit actus mentis. Sed esse est actus essentiae. Ergo mens est ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>3. Augustine says: “We are in the image of God by the fact that we exist, that we know that we exist, and that we love this knowledge and this existence.” He also bases the attribution of the likeness of God in us upon knowledge, mind, and love. Since, then, loving is the act of love, and knowing is the act of knowledge, it seems that existence is the act of the mind. But existence is the act of essence. Therefore, the mind is the very essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, eadem ratione invenitur mens in Angelo et in nobis. Sed ipsa essentia Angeli est mens eius. Unde Dionysius frequenter Angelos nominat divinas vel intellectuales mentes. Ergo etiam et mens nostra est ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>4. Mind has the same nature in angels and in us. But the very essence of an angel is its mind. For this reason Dionysius frequently calls angels divine or intellectual minds. Therefore, our mind, also, is the very essence of our soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit in X de Trinitate, quod memoria, intelligentia et voluntas sunt una mens, una essentia, una vita. Ergo, sicut vita ad essentiam pertinet, ita et mens.
          <td>5. Augustine says: “Memory, understanding, and will are one mind, one essence, one life.” Therefore, as life belongs to the essence of the soul, so does mind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, accidens non potest esse principium substantialis distinctionis. Sed homo substantialiter distinguitur a brutis in hoc quod habet mentem. Ergo mens non est aliquod accidens. Sed potentia animae est proprietas eius, secundum Avicennam: et sic est de genere accidentis. Ergo mens non est potentia, sed est ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>6. An accident cannot be the source of a substantial distinction. But, by his possession of mind, man is substantially distinguished from brute animals. So, mind is not an accident. But a power of the soul is a property of the soul, according to Avicenna and so it belongs to the class of accident. Therefore, mind is not a power, but the very essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ab una potentia non egrediuntur diversi actus secundum speciem. Sed a mente egrediuntur diversi actus secundum speciem, scilicet memorari, intelligere et velle, ut patet per Augustinum. Ergo mens non est aliqua potentia animae, sed ipsa essentia eius.
          <td>7. Acts specifically different do not come from one power. But, as is clear from Augustine, acts specifically different—namely: remembering, understanding, and willing—come from the mind. Therefore, mind is not a power of the soul, but its very essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, una potentia non est subiectum alterius potentiae. Sed mens est imaginis subiectum, quae consistit in tribus potentiis. Ergo mens non est potentia, sed ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>8. One power is not the subject of another power. But mind is the subject of the image of the Trinity, which is constituted by the three powers. Therefore, mind is not a power, but the essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nulla potentia comprehendit in se plures potentias. Sed mens comprehendit intelligentiam et voluntatem. Ergo non est potentia, sed essentia.
          <td>9. No power contains in itself other powers. But the mind includes understanding and will. Therefore, it is not a power, but the essence.

          <td>Anima non habet alias partes nisi suas potentias. Sed mens est quaedam pars animae superior, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de Trin. Ergo mens est potentia animae.
          <td>1. Powers of the soul are its only parts. But mind is the higher part of the soul, as Augustine says. Therefore, mind is a power of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea essentia animae communis est omnibus potentiis, quia omnes in ea radicantur. Sed mens non est communis omnibus potentiis, quia dividitur contra sensum. Ergo mens non est ipsa essentia animae.
          <td>2. The essence of the soul is common to all the powers, because all are rooted in it. But mind is not common to all the powers, because it is distinguished from sense. Therefore, mind is not the essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, in essentia animae non est accipere supremum et infimum. Sed in mente est supremum et infimum; dividit enim Augustinus, mentem in superiorem et inferiorem rationem. Ergo mens est potentia animae, non essentia.
          <td>3. We cannot speak of highest and lowest in the essence of the soul. But there are highest and lowest in mind. For Augustine divides mind into higher and lower reason. Therefore, mind is a power of the soul and not its essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, essentia animae est principium vivendi. Sed mens non est principium vivendi, sed intelligendi. Ergo mens non est ipsa essentia animae, sed potentia eius.
          <td>4. The essence of the soul is the principle of life. But mind is not the principle of life, but of understanding. Therefore, mind is not the essence of the soul, but one of its powers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, subiectum non praedicatur de accidente. Sed mens praedicatur de memoria, intelligentia, et voluntate, quae sunt in essentia animae sicut in subiecto. Ergo mens non est essentia animae.
          <td>5. A subject is not predicated of an accident. But mind is predicated of memory, understanding, and will, which are in the soul as in a subject. Therefore, mind is not the essence of the soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum Augustinum in libro II de Trinitate, anima non est ad imaginem secundum se totam, sed secundum aliquid sui. Est autem ad imaginem secundum mentem. Ergo mens non nominat totam animam, sed aliquid animae.
          <td>6. According to Augustine, the relation of the soul to the image does not arise from the whole soul, but only from part of it, namely, the mind. Therefore, the mind does not denote the whole soul, but a part of it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nomen mentis ex eo quod meminit sumptum esse videtur. Sed memoria designat aliquam potentiam animae. Ergo et mens, et non essentiam.
          <td>7. The name <i>mind</i> ( <i>mens</i> ) seems to have been attributed [to the soul] from the fact that it remembers ( <i>memini</i> ) <i>.</i> But memory refers to a power of the soul. Therefore, mind also denotes a power and not the essence.

          <td>Dicendum, quod nomen mentis a mensurando est sumptum. Res autem uniuscuiusque generis mensuratur per id quod est minimum, et principium primum in suo genere, ut patet in X Metaphys.; et ideo nomen mentis hoc modo dicitur in anima, sicut et nomen intellectus. Solum enim intellectus accipit cognitionem de rebus quasi mensurando eas ad sua principia. Intellectus autem, cum dicatur per respectum ad actum, potentiam animae designat: virtus enim, sive potentia, est medium inter essentiam et operationem, ut patet per Dionysium, cap. XI Caelest. Hierarch.
          <td>The term <i>mind</i> ( <i>mens</i> ) <i>is</i> taken from the verb <i>measure</i> ( <i>mensurare</i> ) <i>.</i> For a thing of any genus is measured by that which is least and first in its genus, as is clear from the <i>Metaphysics.</i> So, the word <i>mind</i> is applied to the soul in the same way as <i>understanding</i> is <i>.</i> For understanding knows about things only by measuring them, as it were, according to its own principles. But, since it signifies reference to act, understanding designates a faculty of the soul. But a power or faculty lies between essence and activity, as Dionysius says.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia vero rerum essentiae sunt nobis ignotae, virtutes autem earum innotescunt nobis per actus, utimur frequenter nominibus virtutum vel potentiarum ad essentias significandas. Sed quia nihil notificatur nisi ex hoc quod est sibi proprium, oportet quod, cum aliqua essentia designatur per suam potentiam, quod designetur per potentiam sibi propriam. In potentiis autem hoc communiter invenitur, quod illud quod potest in plus, potest in minus, sed non convertitur; sicut qui potest ferre mille libras, potest ferre centum, ut dicitur in I caeli et mundi. Et ideo, si aliqua res per suam potentiam debeat designari, oportet quod designetur per ultimum potentiae suae.
          <td>Since, however, the essences of things are not known to us, and their powers reveal themselves to us through their acts, we often use the names of the faculties and powers to denote the essences. But, since knowledge of a thing comes only from that which is proper to it, when an essence takes its name from one of its powers, it must be named according to a power proper to it. It is commonly true of powers that that which can do more can do less, but not conversely. So, a man who can carry a thousand pounds can carry a hundred, as is said in <i>Heaven and Earth.</i> Hence, if a thing is to be classified by its power, it must be classified according to the utmost of its power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Anima autem quae est in plantis, non habet nisi infimum gradum inter potentias animae; unde ab ea denominatur, cum dicitur nutritiva vel vegetabilis. Anima autem bruti pertingit ad altiorem gradum, scilicet qui est sensus; unde ipsa anima vocatur sensitiva, vel quandoque etiam sensus. Sed anima humana pertingit ad altissimum gradum inter potentias animae, et ex hoc denominatur; unde dicitur intellectiva, et quandoque etiam intellectus, et similiter mens, inquantum scilicet ex ipsa nata est effluere talis potentia, quia est sibi proprium prae aliis animabus.
          <td>Now, among souls, the soul in plants has only the lowest level of power, and so is classified according to this when it is called nutritive or vegetative. The soul of a brute animal, however, reaches a higher level, that of sense, and so its soul is called sensitive, or, sometimes, even simply sense. But the human soul reaches the highest level which there is among powers of soul and takes its name from this, being called intellective or, sometimes, also understanding and mind, inasmuch as from the intellective soul such power naturally arises, as is proper to the human soul above other souls.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Patet ergo, quod mens in anima nostra dicit illud quod est altissimum in virtute ipsius. Unde, cum secundum id quod est altissimum in nobis divina imago inveniatur in nobis, imago non pertinebit ad essentiam animae nisi secundum mentem, prout nominat altissimam potentiam eius. Et sic mens, prout in ea est imago, nominat potentiam animae, et non essentiam; vel si nominat essentiam, hoc non est nisi inquantum ab ea fluit talis potentia.
          <td>It is clear, then, that in us mind designates the highest power of our soul. And since the image of God is in us according to that which is highest in us, that image will belong to the essence of the soul only in so far as mind is its highest power. Thus, mind, as containing the image of God, designates a power of the soul and not its essence. Or, if we take mind to mean essence, it means it only inasmuch as such a power flows from the essence.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod mens non dicitur significare essentiam secundum quod essentia contra potentiam dividitur; sed secundum quod essentia absoluta dividitur contra id quod relative dicitur. Et sic mens dividitur contra notitiam sui, inquantum per notitiam mens ad seipsam refertur; ipsa vero mens dicitur absolute. Vel potest dici, quod mens accipitur ab Augustino secundum quod significat essentiam animae, simul cum tali potentia.
          <td>1. Mind is not taken to mean essence, as essence is contrasted with power, but as absolute essence is distinguished from that which is relatively so called. Thus, mind is distinguished from knowledge of itself in this, that through knowledge mind is referred to itself, but mind itself is an absolute term. Or we can say that mind is taken by Augustine to mean the essence of the soul along with this power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod genera potentiarum animae distinguuntur dupliciter: uno modo ex parte obiecti; alio modo ex parte subiecti, sive ex parte modi agendi, quod in idem redit. Si igitur distinguantur ex parte obiecti, sic inveniuntur quinque potentiarum animae genera supra enumerata. Si autem distinguantur ex parte subiecti vel modi agendi, sic sunt tria genera potentiarum animae: scilicet vegetativum, sensitivum et intellectivum. Operatio enim animae tripliciter se potest habere ad materiam.
          <td>2. There are two ways of classifying powers of the soul: first, according to their objects; and second, according to their subjects, or, what comes to the same thing, according to their manner of acting. If we classify them according to their objects, we have the five classes of powers of the soul mentioned above. However, if we classify them according to their subjects or manner of acting, there are three classes of powers of the soul: vegetative, sensitive, and intellective. For the activity of the soul can be related to matter in three ways.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Uno modo ita quod per modum materialis actionis exerceatur; et talium actionum principium est potentia nutritiva, cuius actus exercentur qualitatibus activis et passivis, sicut et aliae actiones materiales. Alio modo ita quod operatio animae non pertingat ad ipsam materiam, sed solum ad materiae conditiones, sicut est in actibus potentiae sensitivae: in sensu enim recipitur species sine materia, sed tamen cum materiae conditionibus. Tertio modo ita quod operatio animae excedat et materiam et materiae conditiones; et sic est pars animae intellectiva.
          <td>In the first of these, the relation is such that the activity is performed as a natural activity. The source of this kind of activity is the nutritive power, and the exercise of the acts of this power takes place through active and passive qualities, just as other material activity does. In the second way, the relation is such that the activity of the soul does not reach matter itself, but only the conditions of matter, as in the activity of the sensitive power. For, in sense, the species is received without matter, but with the conditions of matter. In the third way, the relation is such that the activity of the soul is beyond both matter and the conditions of matter. The intellective part of the soul acts in this way.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Secundum igitur has diversas potentiarum animae partitiones contingit aliquas duas potentias animae ad invicem comparatas in idem vel diversum genus reduci. Si enim appetitus sensibilis et intellectualis, qui est voluntas, consideretur secundum ordinem ad obiectum, sic reducuntur in unum genus, quia utriusque obiectum est bonum. Si vero consideretur quantum ad modum agendi, sic reducuntur in diversa genera; quia appetitus inferior reducetur in genus sensitivi, appetitus vero superior in genus intellectivi.
          <td>According to these different divisions of powers of the soul, two powers of the soul can belong to the same or different classes when compared with each other. For, if sensible appetite and intellectual appetite, which is will, are considered with reference to their object, both belong to the same class, because the good is the object of both. But, if we view them with reference to their manner of acting, they belong to different classes, for we classify the lower appetite as sensitive, and the higher as intellective.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sicut enim sensus non apprehendit suum obiectum sub conditionibus materialibus, prout scilicet est hic et nunc; sic et appetitus sensibilis in suum obiectum fertur, in bonum scilicet particulare. Appetitus vero superior in suum obiectum tendit per modum quo intellectus apprehendit; et sic quantum ad modum agendi voluntas ad genus intellectivi reducitur.
          <td>For, just as the sense grasps its object under the material conditions it has here and now, so, too, the sense appetite tends toward its object in the same way, and thus to a particular good. But the higher appetite is directed to its object after the manner in which the understanding perceives. So, with reference to manner of acting, will belongs to the intellective class.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Modus autem actionis provenit ex dispositione agentis: quia quanto fuerit perfectius agens, tanto est eius actio perfectior. Et ideo, si considerentur huiusmodi potentiae secundum quod egrediuntur ab essentia animae, quae est quasi subiectum earum, voluntas invenitur in eadem coordinatione cum intellectu; non autem appetitus inferior, qui in irascibilem et concupiscibilem dividitur. Et ideo mens potest comprehendere voluntatem et intellectum, absque hoc quod sit essentia animae; inquantum, scilicet, nominat quoddam genus potentiarum animae, ut sub mente intelligantur comprehendi omnes illae potentiae quae in suis actibus omnino a materia et conditionibus materiae recedunt.
          <td>The manner of acting follows the state of the agent, for, as the agent is more perfect, so its activity is more perfect. Therefore, if we consider powers of this kind as they issue from the essence of the soul, which is, as it were, their subject, we find that will is on an equal footing with understanding, whereas the lower appetite, which is divided into the concupiscible and irascible, is not. Therefore, mind can include both understanding and will without thereby being the essence of the soul. Thus, mind denotes a certain class of powers of the soul, the group in which we include all the powers which withdraw entirely from matter and the conditions of matter in their activity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod ab Augustino et aliis sanctis imago Trinitatis in homine multipliciter assignatur: nec oportet ut una illarum assignationum alteri correspondeat; sicut patet quod Augustinus assignat imaginem Trinitatis secundum mentem, notitiam et amorem; et ulterius secundum memoriam, intelligentiam et voluntatem. Et quamvis voluntas et amor sibi invicem correspondeant, et notitia et intelligentia, non tamen oportet quod mens correspondeat memoriae; cum mens omnia tria contineat quae in alia assignatione dicuntur. Similiter etiam assignatio Augustini quam obiectio tangit, est alia a duabus praemissis. Unde non oportet quod, si amare amori correspondeat, et nosse notitiae, quod esse respondeat menti sicut proprius actus eius, inquantum est mens.
          <td>3. According to Augustine and other saints, the image of the Trinity is attributed to man under diverse formulae, and there is no need that the members of one formula correspond to those of another. This is clearly the case when Augustine makes the image of the Trinity follow mind, cognition, and love, and also memory, understanding, and will. Now, although will and love are parallel, as are understanding and cognition, it is not necessary that mind parallel memory, for mind includes all three which are given in the other way of attributing this likeness. Similarly, the attribution of Augustine referred to in the objection differs from the two we have Just mentioned. So, there is no need for existence to relate as proper act to mind, in so far as it is mind, although loving so relates to love and knowing so relates to knowledge.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod Angeli dicuntur mentes, non quia ipsa mens sive intellectus Angeli, sit eius essentia, prout mens et intellectus potentiam nominant; sed quia nihil aliud habent de potentiis animae nisi hoc quod sub mente comprehenditur: unde totaliter sunt mens. Animae vero nostrae adiunguntur aliae potentiae quae sub mente non comprehenduntur, ex eo quod est actus corporis: scilicet sensitivae et nutritivae potentiae; unde non ita potest dici anima esse mens sicut et Angelus.
          <td>4. Angels are called minds not because the mind or understanding of an angel, in so far as it designates a power, is its essence, but because they have no other powers of the soul except those which are included in the mind, and, so, are completely mind. Our soul, however, since it is the act of the body, has other powers which are not included in the mind, namely, sensitive and nutritive powers. So, soul cannot be called mind as an angel can.

In hoc enim perfectissime secundum genus conformatur essentialibus attributis.
          <td>5. Living adds something to existing, and understanding something to living. But, for something to have the image of God in it, it must reach the highest kind of perfection to which a creature can aspire. So, if a thing has existence only, as stones, or existence and life, as plants and beasts, these are not enough to preserve the character of image. To have the complete character of image the creature must exist, live, and understand. For in this it has most perfectly the generic likeness to the essential attributes.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo, quia in assignatione imaginis mens locum divinae essentiae tenet, haec vero tria, quae sunt memoria, intelligentia et voluntas, tenent locum trium personarum; ideo Augustinus menti adscribit illa quae requiruntur ad imaginem in creatura, cum dicit, quod memoria et intelligentia et voluntas sunt una vita, una mens, una essentia. Nec tamen oportet quod ex hoc ipso in anima dicatur mens et vita quo et essentia; quia non est idem in nobis esse, vivere et intelligere, sicut et in Deo; dicuntur tamen haec tria una essentia, inquantum ab una essentia mentis procedunt; una vita inquantum ad unum genus vitae pertinent; una mens, inquantum sub una mente comprehenduntur ut partes sub toto, sicut visus et auditus comprehenduntur sub parte animae sensitiva.
          <td>Therefore, since in applying the image mind takes the place of the divine essence, and memory, intellect, and will take the place of the three Persons, Augustine attributes to mind those things which are needed for the image in creatures when he says: “Memory, understanding, and will are one life, one mind, and one essence.” Still, it is not necessary to conclude from this that in the soul mind and life mean the same as essence, for to be, to live, and to understand are not the same thing in us as they are in God. Nevertheless, these three are called one essence since they flow from the one essence of the mind, one life because they belong to one kind of life, and one mind because they are included in one mind as parts in the whole, just as sight and hearing are included in the sensitive part of the soul.

Et similiter est de rationali, vel de eo quod est habens mentem.
          <td>6. Since, according to the Philosopher, we do not know the substantial differences of things, those who make definitions sometimes use accidental differences because they indicate or afford knowledge of the essence as the proper effects afford knowledge of a cause. Therefore, when <i>sensible</i> is given as the constitutive difference of animal, it is not derived from the sense power, but the essence of the soul from which that power comes. The same is true of rational, or of that which has mind.

          <td>7. Just as we do not understand that the sensitive part of the soul is a single power over and above the particular powers contained in it, but, rather, a kind of potential whole, including all those powers as parts, so, too, mind is not a single power over and above memory, understanding, and will, but a kind of potential whole including these three. In the same way, we see that the power of house building embraces those of cutting the stones and building the wall. The same holds true for the other powers.

          <td>3. Understanding and all that belong to understanding abstract from space and time. Memory, however, does not so abstract, for it deals with a definite time, the past. For memory concerns things past, as Cicero says. Therefore, memory does not pertain to mind or understanding.

Intellectus autem non utitur organo corporali; unde nihil in eo retinetur nisi intelligibiliter; et sic oportet quod actu intelligatur. Ergo memoria non est in intellectu sive in mente.
          <td>4. Since in memory we retain things that are not being actually apprehended, it follows that, wherever there is memory, there must be a difference between apprehension and retention. But it is in sense only, and not in understanding, that we find this difference. The two can differ in sense because sense makes use of a bodily organ. But not everything that is retained in the body is apprehended. But understanding does not make use of a bodily organ, and so retains things only according to the mode of understanding. So, these things have to be actually understood. Therefore, memory is not part of understanding or mind.

          <td>5. The soul does not remember until it has retained something. But before it receives from the senses, which are the source of all our know ledge, any species which it can retain, it already has the character of image [of the Trinity].

          <td>7. If memory were part of the mind, the intelligible species would be maintained in the mind as they are in the angelic mind. But the angels can understand by turning their attention to the species which they have within them. Therefore, the human mind should be able to understand by turning its attention to the species it retains, without referring to phantasms. But this is obviously false. For, no matter to what degree one has scientific knowledge as a habit, if the organ of the power of imagination or memory is injured, this knowledge cannot be made actual. This would not result if the mind could actually understand without referring to powers which use organs. So, memory is not part of the mind.

For understanding does not know the singular as singular, but according to some common character, as it is man or white or even particular, but not in so far as it is this man or this particular thing. In a similar way, understanding does not know a present and a past thing as this present and this past thing.

          <td>Since memory, taken strictly, looks to what is past with reference to the present, it is clear that memory, properly speaking, does not belong to the intellectual part, but only to the sensitive, as the Philosopher shows. But, since intellect not only understands the intelligible thing, but also understands that it understands such an intelligible thing, the term memory can be broadened to include the knowledge by which one knows the object previously known in so far as he knows he knew it earlier, although he does not know the object as in the past in the manner earlier explained. In this way all knowledge not received for the first time can be called memory.

Et sic memoria est in parte intellectiva nostrae animae: et hoc modo videtur Augustinus memoriam accipere, ponens eam partem imaginis: vult enim, omne illud quod habitualiter in mente tenetur ut in actum non prodeat, ad memoriam pertinere.
          <td>This can take place in two ways, either when there is continuous study based on acquired knowledge without interruption, or when the study is interrupted. The latter has more of the character of past, and so it more properly participates in the nature of memory. We have an example of this when we say that we remember a thing which previously we knew habitually but not actually. Thus, memory belongs to the intellective part of our soul. It is in this sense that Augustine seems to understand memory, when he makes it part of the image of the Trinity. For he intends to assign to memory everything in the mind which is stored there habitually without passing into act.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quomodo autem hoc possit contingere, diversimode a diversis ponitur. Avicenna enim in VI de naturalibus ponit, quod hoc non contingit (quod anima habitualiter notitiam teneat alicuius rei quam actu non considerat) ex hoc quod aliquae species actu conserventur in parte intellectiva; sed vult quod species actualiter non consideratae non possunt conservari nisi in parte sensitiva, vel quantum ad imaginationem, quae est thesaurus formarum a sensu acceptarum; vel quantum ad memoriam, quantum ad intentiones particulares non acceptas a sensibus. In intellectu vero non permanet species, nisi quando actu consideratur. Post considerationem vero in eo esse desinit: unde, quando iterum actu vult considerare aliquid, oportet quod species intelligibiles de novo fluant in intellectum possibilem ab intelligentia agente.
          <td>There are various explanations of the manner in which this can take place. Avicenna holds that the fact that the soul has habitual knowledge of anything which it does not actually consider does not come from this, that certain species are retained in the intellectual part. Rather, he understands that it is impossible for the species not actually considered to be kept anywhere except in the sensitive part, either in the imagination, which is the storehouse of forms received by the senses, or in the memory, for particular apprehensions not received from the senses. The species stays in the understanding only when it is actually being considered. But, after the consideration, it ceases to be there. Thus, when one wants actually to consider something again, it is necessary for new intelligible species to flow from the agent intelligence into the possible intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nec tamen sequitur, secundum ipsum, quod quandocumque aliquis de novo debet considerare quae prius scivit, oporteat eum iterum addiscere vel invenire sicut a principio, quia relicta est in eo quaedam habilitas per quam facilius se convertit ad intellectum agentem, ut ab eo species effluentes recipiat quam prius; et haec habilitas est habitus scientiae in nobis. Et secundum hanc opinionem memoria non esset in mente secundum retentionem aliquarum specierum, sed secundum habilitatem ad accipiendum de novo.
          <td>However, it does not follow, according to Avicenna, that the new consideration of what was known previously necessarily entails learning or discovering all over again, for one retains a certain aptitude through which he turns more easily to the agent intellect to receive the species flowing from it than he did before. In us, this aptitude is the habit of scientific knowledge. According to this opinion, memory is not part of the mind because it preserves certain species, but because it has an aptitude for receiving them anew.

Primo, quia cum intellectus possibilis sit stabilioris naturae quam sensus, oportet quod species in eo recepta stabilius recipiatur; unde magis possunt in eo conservari species quam in parte sensitiva. Secundo, quia intelligentia agens aequaliter se habet ad influendum species convenientes omnibus scientiis. Unde si in intellectu possibili non conservarentur aliquae species, sed sola habilitas ad convertendum se ad intellectum agentem, aequaliter remaneret homo habilis ad quodcumque intelligibile; et ita ex hoc quod homo addisceret unam scientiam, non magis sciret illam quam alias.

          <td>But this does not seem to be a reasonable explanation. In the first place, since the possible intellect has a more stable nature than sense, it must receive its species more securely. Thus, the species can be better preserved in it than in the sensitive part. In the second place, the agent intelligence is equally disposed to communicate species suitable for all the sciences. As a consequence, if some species were not conserved in the possible intellect, but there were in it only the aptitude of turning to the agent intellect, man would have an equal aptitude for any intelligible thing. Therefore, from the fact that a man had learned one science he would not know it better than other sciences. Besides, this seems openly opposed to the opinion of the Philosopher, who commends the ancients for holding that the intellective part of the soul is the place of the species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

          <td>Therefore, others say that the intelligible species remain in the possible intellect after actual consideration, and that the ordered arrangement of these is the habit of knowledge. In this classification the power by which our minds retain these intelligible species after actual consideration will be called memory. This comes closer to the proper meaning of memory.

Sometimes it has the act of this species incompletely, that is, in some way between pure potency and pure act. This is habitual knowledge.

Et ideo, sicut intellectus noster secundum statum viae indiget phantasmatibus ad actu considerandum antequam accipiat habitum, ita et postquam acceperit. Secus autem est de Angelis, quorum intellectus obiectum non est phantasma.
          <td>7. No power can know anything without turning to its object, as sight knows nothing unless it turns to color. Now, since phantasms are related to the possible intellect in the way that sensible things are related to sense, as the Philosopher points out, no matter to what extent an intelligible species is present to the understanding, understanding does not actually consider anything according to that species without referring to a phantasm. Therefore, just as our understanding in its present state needs phantasms actually to consider anything before it acquires a habit, so it needs them, too, after it has acquired a habit. The situation is different with angels, for phantasms are not the object of their understanding.

          <td>Diversarum enim potentiarum sunt diversi actus.

Ergo memoria non distinguitur ab intelligentia sicut potentia a potentia.
          <td>1. Different acts belong to different powers. But the possible intellect and memory, as part of the mind, are said to have the same act, to preserve the species. For Augustine assigns this function to memory and the Philosopher assigns it to the possible intellect. Therefore, memory is not distinguished from understanding as one power from another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, accipere aliquid non concernendo aliquam temporis differentiam, est proprium intellectus, qui abstrahit ab hic et nunc. Sed memoria non concernit aliquam differentiam temporis, quia, secundum Augustinum, XIV de Trinit., memoria est communiter praeteritorum, praesentium, et futurorum. Ergo memoria ab intellectu non distinguitur.
          <td>2. To receive something without paying attention to any difference of time belongs properly to understanding, which abstracts from the here and now. But memory pays no attention to difference of time, for, according to Augustine, memory deals indifferently with things present, past, and future. Therefore, memory is not distinguished from understanding.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intelligentia accipitur dupliciter secundum Augustinum, XIV de Trinit. Uno modo prout dicimur intelligere illud quod actu cogitamus; alio modo prout dicimur intelligere illud quod non actu consideramus. Sed intelligentia, secundum quam id tantum dicimur intelligere quod actu cogitamus, est intelligere in actu; quod non est potentia, sed operatio alicuius potentiae; et sic non distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. Secundum vero quod intelligimus ea quae non actu cogitamus, nullo modo a memoria distinguitur, sed ad memoriam pertinet; quod patet per Augustinum, XIV de Trinitate, ubi sic dicit: si nos referamus ad interiorem mentis memoriam, qua sui meminit, et interiorem intelligentiam, qua se intelligit et interiorem voluntatem, qua se diligit; ubi haec tria simul semper sunt, sive cogitarentur, sive non cogitarentur; videtur quidem imago Trinitatis ad solam memoriam pertinere. Ergo intelligentia nullo modo distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia.
          <td>3. According to Augustine, intelligence can be taken in two ways. According to the first, we are said to understand that which we actually think. According to the second, we are said to understand that which we do not actually consider. But intelligence, in the meaning of understanding only that which we actually think, is understanding in act. This is not a power, but the activity of a power; hence, it is not distinguished from memory as a power from a power. But, in so far as we understand those things which we do not actually consider, understanding is not in any way distinguished from memory, but belongs to it. This is clear from Augustine: “If we look to the inner memory of the mind by which it remembers itself, to the inner understanding by which it understands itself, and to the inner will by which it loves itself, where these three are always together, whether they are thought about or not, we will see that the image of the Trinity belongs only to the memory.” Therefore, understanding is in no way distinguished from memory as a power from a power.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si dicatur, quod intelligentia est quaedam potentia secundum quam anima est potens actu cogitare, et sic etiam intelligentia, qua non dicimur intelligere nisi cogitantes, distinguitur a memoria sicut potentia a potentia. Contra: eiusdem potentiae est habitum habere, et uti habitu. Sed intelligere non cogitando, est intelligere in habitu; intelligere autem cogitando, est uti habitu. Ergo ad eamdem potentiam pertinet intelligere non cogitando, et intelligere cogitando: et sic per hoc non diversificatur intelligentia a memoria sicut potentia a potentia.
          <td>4. Someone may say that intelligence is a power through which the soul is able actually to think, and so, also, that the intelligence through which we are said to understand only when we are thinking is distinguished from memory as one power from another.—On the contrary, it belongs to the same power to have a habit and to use that habit. But to understand when not thinking is to understand habitually, whereas to understand when thinking is to use the habit. Therefore, to understand when not thinking and to understand when thinking belong to the same power. And so, for this reason, understanding does not differ from memory as one power from another.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea in intellectiva parte animae non invenitur aliqua potentia nisi cognitiva et motiva vel affectiva. Sed voluntas est affectiva vel motiva; intelligentia autem est cognitiva. Ergo memoria non est alia potentia ab intelligentia.
          <td>5. In the intellective part of the soul there are only the cognoscitive and motive, or affective, powers. But the will is the affective or motive; understanding, the cognoscitive. Therefore, memory is not a different power from understanding.

          <td>Est quod Augustinus dicit, XIV de Trin., quod secundum hoc anima est ad imaginem Dei quod uti ratione atque intellectu ad intelligendum Deum et conspiciendum potest. Sed potest anima conspicere secundum potentiam. Ergo imago in anima attenditur secundum potentias. Sed imago in anima attenditur secundum quod haec tria in ea inveniuntur, memoria, intelligentia, et voluntas. Ergo haec tria sunt tres potentiae distinctae.
          <td>1. Augustine says that “the soul partakes of the image of God in this, that it can use reason and understanding to know and see God.” But the soul can see through its powers. Therefore, the image in the soul is considered according to its powers. But the image in the soul is considered according to the presence of memory, understanding, and will in the soul. Therefore, these three are three distinct powers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si ista tria non sunt tres potentiae, oportet aliquod eorum esse actum sive operationem. Sed actus non semper est in anima; non enim semper actu intelligit vel vult. Ergo ista tria non semper erunt in anima; et sic non semper erit anima ad imaginem Dei, quod est contra Augustinum.
          <td>2. If these are not three powers, there must be one of them which is act or activity. But act is not always in the soul, for one does not always actually understand or will. Therefore, these three will not always be in the soul, and consequently the soul will not always be in the image of God, contrary to Augustine.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, inter haec tria invenitur aequalitas, per quam aequalitas divinarum personarum repraesentatur.

Ergo non potest esse quod aliquod eorum sit habitus, et aliud actus.
          <td>3. There is a certain equality among these three which portrays the equality of the divine Persons. But there is no equality among act, habit, and power, because power embraces more than habit and habit more than act. For many habits belong to one power, and many acts can come from one habit. Therefore, one of these cannot be habit and another act.

          <td>We must say that the image of the Trinity in the soul can be predicated in two ways: one in which there is perfect imitation of the Trinity, the other in which the imitation is imperfect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Anima quidem perfecte Trinitatem imitatur secundum quod meminit, intelligit actu, et vult actu. Quod ideo est, quia in illa Trinitate increata, media in Trinitate persona est verbum. Verbum autem esse non potest sine actuali cognitione. Unde secundum hunc modum perfectae imitationis assignat Augustinus imaginem in his tribus: memoria, intelligentia et voluntate; prout memoria importat habitualem notitiam, intelligentia vero actualem cogitationem ex illa notitia prodeuntem, voluntas vero actualem voluntatis motum ex cogitatione procedentem. Et hoc expresse patet ex hoc quod dicit in XIV de Trinit., sic dicens: quia ibi, scilicet in mente, verbum esse sine cogitatione non potest (cogitamus enim omne quod dicimus illo interiori verbo, quod ad nullius gentis pertinet linguam); in tribus potius illis imago ista cognoscitur memoria scilicet, intelligentia, voluntate. Hanc autem nunc dico intelligentiam, qua intelligimus cogitantes; et eam voluntatem, quae istam prolem parentemque coniungit.
          <td>For the mind perfectly imitates the Trinity in this, that it actually remembers, actually understands, and actually wills. This is so because in the uncreated Trinity the middle Person is the Word. Now, there can be a word only with actual cognition. Hence, it is according to this kind of perfect imitation that Augustine puts the image in memory, understanding, and will. In it, memory refers to habitual knowledge, understanding to actual cognition which proceeds from the habitual knowledge of memory, and will to the actual movement of the will which proceeds from thought. This appears expressly from what he says in <i>The Trinity:</i> “Since the word cannot be there,” in the mind, “without thought; for everything which we speak we think with that internal word which belongs to the language of no people, the image is found especially in those three: memory, intelligence, and will. Intelligence I now call that by which we understand when thinking; I call that will which joins this offspring [thought] with its parent [intelligence].”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Imago vero secundum imperfectam imitationem est, quando assignatur secundum habitus et potentias; et sic assignat Trinitatis imaginem in anima, IX de Trinitate, quantum ad haec tria, mens, notitia et amor; ut mens nominet potentiam, notitia vero et amor habitus in ea existentes. Et sicut posuit notitiam, ita ponere potuisset intelligentiam habitualem: utrumque enim habitualiter accipi potest, ut patet ex hoc quod dicit in libro XIV de Trinitate: numquid recte possumus dicere: iste musicus novit quidem musicam; sed nunc eam non intelligit, quia eam non cogitat; intelligit vero nunc geometriam, hanc enim nunc cogitat? Absurda est quantum apparet, ista sententia. Et sic secundum hanc assignationem haec duo, quae sunt notitia, et amor, habitualiter accepta, ad memoriam tantum pertinent, ut patet per auctoritatem eiusdem in obiiciendo inductam.
          <td>We have the image in which there is imperfect imitation when we designate it according to habits and powers. It is thus that Augustine bases the image of the Trinity in the soul upon mind, knowledge, and love. Here, mind means the power; knowledge and love, the habits existing in it. In place of knowledge he could have said habitual intelligence, for both can be taken in the sense of habit. This is clear from <i>The Trinity,</i> where he says: “Can we correctly say that the musician knows music, but he does not now understand it because he is not now thinking about it, or that he now understands geometry because he is now thinking about it? This opinion is obviously absurd.” So, in this sense, knowledge and love, taken as habitual, belong only to memory, as is clear from the authoritative citation from Augustine in the objections.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia actus sunt in potentiis radicaliter sicut effectus in causis; ideo etiam perfecta imitatio, quae est secundum memoriam, intelligentiam actualem et voluntatem actualem, potest originaliter inveniri in potentiis, secundum quas anima potest meminisse, intelligere actualiter et velle, ut per verba Augustini inducta patet. Et sic imago attendetur secundum potentias; non tamen hoc modo quod memoria possit esse, in mente, alia potentia praeter intelligentiam: quod sic patet.
          <td>But, since acts have radical existence in powers, as effects in their causes, even perfect imitation according to memory, understanding in act, and will in act can in the first instance be found in the powers through which the soul can remember, actually understand and will, as the citation from Augustine shows. Thus, the image will be based upon the powers, though not in the sense that in the mind memory could be some power besides the understanding. This is clear from what follows.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Potentiae enim non diversificantur ex diversitate obiectorum nisi diversitas obiectorum sit ex his quae per se accidunt obiectis, secundum quod sunt talium potentiarum obiecta; unde calidum et frigidum, quae colorato accidunt, inquantum huiusmodi, non diversificant potentiam visivam: eiusdem enim visivae potentiae est videre coloratum calidum et frigidum, dulce et amarum. Quamvis autem mens sive intellectus aliquo modo cognoscere possit praeteritum, tamen, cum indifferenter se habeat ad cognoscenda praesentia, praeterita et futura; differentia praesentis et praeteriti est accidentalis intelligibili inquantum huiusmodi. Unde, quamvis in mente aliquo modo possit esse memoria, non tamen potest esse ut potentia quaedam per se distincta ab aliis, per modum quo philosophi de distinctione potentiarum loquuntur; sed hoc modo solummodo inveniri potest memoria in parte animae sensitiva, quae fertur ad praesens inquantum est praesens; unde, si debeat ferri in praeteritum, requiritur aliqua altior virtus quam ipse sensus.
          <td>Diversity of objects is the source of differentiation of powers only when the diversity comes from those things which of themselves belong to the objects, in so far as they are objects of such powers. Thus, hot and cold in something colored do not, as such, differentiate the power of sight. For the same power of sight can see what is colored, whether hot or cold, sweet or bitter. Now, although mind or understanding can in a certain way know what is past, still, since it relates indifferently to knowledge of present, past, and future, the difference of past and present is accidental to what is intelligible, in so far as it is intelligible. For this reason, although memory can be in the mind in a certain way, it cannot be there as a power distinct of itself from other powers in the way in which philosophers speak of the distinction of powers. In this way, memory can be found only in the sensitive part, which is referred to the present as present. For this reason, a higher power than that of sense is needed if it is to relate to the past.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Nihilominus tamen, etsi memoria non sit potentia distincta ab intelligentia, prout intelligentia sumitur pro potentia, tamen invenitur Trinitas in anima etiam considerando ipsas potentias, secundum quod una potentia, quae est intellectus, habet habitudinem ad diversa, scilicet ad tenendum notitiam alicuius habitualiter et ad considerandum illud actualiter, sicut etiam Augustinus, distinguit rationem inferiorem a superiori secundum habitudinem ad diversa.
          <td>Nevertheless, although memory is not a power distinct from intelligence, taken as a power, the Trinity is still in the soul if we consider those powers in so far as the one power of understanding has an orientation to different things, namely, habitually to keep the knowledge of something, and actually to consider it. It is in this way that Augustine distinguishes lower from higher reason, according to an orientation to different things.

          <td>3. Between power, act, and habit there can be equality inasmuch as they are referred to one object. Thus, the image of the Trinity is in the soul inasmuch as it is directed to God. Still, even in the ordinary way of speaking about power, habit, and act, there is an equality among them. However, this equality does not follow the distinctive character of the nature, because activity, habit, and power have the act of existence in different ways. But it does follow the relation to act according to which we consider the quantity of these three. It is not necessary to consider only one act numerically, or one habit, but habit and act in general.

Secundum quidem primum respectum facit cognoscentem actu cognoscere; sed secundum respectum secundum determinat cognitionem ad aliquod cognoscibile determinatum. Et ideo modus cognoscendi rem aliquam, est secundum conditionem cognoscentis, in quo forma recipitur secundum modum eius.

          <td>All cognition follows some form which is the principle of cognition in the knower. Such a form can be considered under two aspects: either with relation to the being it has in the knower, or in the reference it has to the thing it represents. Under the first aspect, it causes the knower actually to know. Under the second, it limits the cognition to some definite knowable object. Therefore, the manner of knowing a thing conforms to the state of the knower, which receives the form in its own way. It is not necessary that the thing known exist in the manner of the knower or in the manner in which the form which is the principle of knowing exists in the knower. From this it follows that nothing prevents us from knowing material things through forms which exist immaterially in our minds.

          <td>There is a difference on this point between the human mind, which derives forms from things, and the divine or angelic minds, which do not draw their cognition from things. In the mind which depends on things for knowledge, the forms exist because of a certain action of things on the soul. But, since all action is through form, the forms in our minds first and mainly refer to things which exist outside our soul according to their forms. These forms are of two kinds. Some forms involve no determined matter, as line, surface, and so forth. Others do involve a special matter, as all natural forms.

Quod in visione corporali, scilicet sensitiva, et spirituali, scilicet imaginativa, non accidit. Obiecta enim imaginationis et sensus sunt quaedam accidentia, ex quibus quaedam rei figura vel imago, constituitur; sed obiectum intellectus est ipsa rei essentia; quamvis essentiam rei cognoscat per eius similitudinem, sicut per medium cognoscendi, non sicut per obiectum in quod primo feratur eius visio.
          <td>1. The text cited in the first objection can be explained in two ways. In the first place, it can be taken to refer to intellectual sight with reference to all that is included in its scope. Taken in this way, intellectual sight is taken to refer only to those things which have no likenesses which are not identical with themselves. This is not to be understood of the likenesses by which we see things in intellectual sight, for these are a kind of means of knowing. What is known by intellectual sight is the things themselves, not their representations. This differs from bodily (sensitive) vision and spiritual (imaginative) vision. For the objects of imagination and sense are certain accidents from which the shape or image of a thing is made up. But the object of the intellect is the very essence of the thing, although the intellect knows the essence of the thing through its likeness, as through a cognoscitive medium, and not through an object which is known first.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Vel dicendum, quod hoc, quod in auctoritate dicitur, pertinet ad visionem intellectualem secundum quod excedit imaginativam et sensitivam; sic enim Augustinus, ex cuius verbis Glossa sumitur, intendit assignare differentiam trium visionum, attribuens superiori visioni illud in quo inferiorem excedit; sicut dicit, quod spiritualis visio est cum absentia cogitamus per similitudines quasdam, et tamen spiritualis sive imaginaria visio etiam est de his quae praesentialiter videntur; sed in hoc quod etiam absentia videt imaginatio, sensum transcendit; et ideo ponitur hoc quasi proprium eius. Similiter etiam intellectualis visio in hoc transcendit imaginationem et sensum, quod ad illa se extendit quae per essentiam suam sunt intelligibilia; et ideo hoc ei attribuit Augustinus quasi eius proprium, quamvis etiam cognoscere possit materialia, quae per suas similitudines cognoscibilia sunt. Unde dicit Augustinus, XII super Genesim ad litteram, quod per mentem et ista inferiora diiudicantur, et ea cernuntur quae neque sunt corpora, neque ullas gerunt formas similes corporum.
          <td>A second explanation would be that the text cited refers to intellectual sight in so far as it surpasses the imaginative and sensitive powers. Following this line of thought, Augustine, from whose words the comment in the Gloss is taken, wishes to differentiate three types of sight, designating the higher by that in which it surpasses the lower. Thus it is said that spiritual sight takes place when through certain likenesses we know things which are absent. Spiritual (imaginative) sight can nevertheless relate to things seen as present. But imagination outstrips sense, inasmuch as it can also see things absent. Hence, this is attributed to it as a sort of property. Similarly, intellectual sight surpasses imagination and sense because it can reach things that are essentially intelligible through their essence. So, Augustine makes this a sort of property of intellectual vision, although it can also know material things which are knowable by means of their likenesses. For this reason Augustine says: “Through the mind judgment is passed even upon those lower types of being, and those things which are not bodies and do not have forms of a bodily kind are known.”

Sic autem considerata materia non est individuationis principium, sed secundum quod consideratur materia in singulari, quae est materia signata sub determinatis dimensionibus existens: ex hac enim forma individuatur. Unde philosophus dicit in VII Metaph., quod hominis partes sunt forma et materia ut universaliter, Socratis vero forma haec et haec materia.
          <td>As is clear from what has been said, human and angelic minds know material things in different ways. For the cognition of the human mind is directed, first, to material things according to their form, and, second, to matter in so far as it is correlative to form. However, just as every form is of itself universal, so correlation to form makes us know matter only by universal knowledge. Matter thus considered is not the principle of individuation. Designated matter, existing under definite dimensions and considered as singular, is, rather, that principle because form receives its individuation from such matter. For this reason, the Philosopher says: “The parts of man are matter and form taken generally, whereas the parts of Socrates are this form and this matter.”

          <td>From this it is clear that our mind is not able directly to know singulars, for we know singulars directly through our sensitive powers which receive forms from things into a bodily organ. In this way, our senses receive them under determined dimensions and as a source of knowledge of the material singular.

Et sic mens singulare cognoscit per quamdam reflexionem, prout scilicet mens cognoscendo obiectum suum, quod est aliqua natura universalis, redit in cognitionem sui actus, et ulterius in speciem quae est sui actus principium, et ulterius in phantasma a quo species est abstracta; et sic aliquam cognitionem de singulari accipit.

This conjunction comes about in two ways. First, the movement of the sensitive part terminates in the mind, as happens in the movement that goes from things to the soul. Thus, the mind knows singulars through a certain kind of reflection, as when the mind, in knowing its object, which is some universal nature, returns to knowledge of its own act, then to the species which is the principle of its act, and, finally, to the phantasm from which it has abstracted the species. In this way, it attains to some knowledge about singulars.

          <td>In the other way, this conjunction is found in the movement from the soul to things, which begins from the mind and moves forward to the sensitive part in the mind’s control over the lower powers. Here, the mind has contact with singulars through the mediation of particular reason, a power of the sensitive part, which joins and divides individual intentional likenesses, which is also known as the cogitative power, and which has a definite bodily organ, a cell in the center of the head. The mind’s universal judgment about things to be done cannot be applied to a particular act except through the mediation of some intermediate power which perceives the singular. In this way, there is framed a kind of syllogism whose major premise is universal, the decision of the mind, and whose minor premise is singular, a perception of the particular reason. The conclusion is the choice of the singular work, as is clear in <i>The Soul.</i>

          <td>1. Action and passion cannot take place between things unless both are material, as is clear from Boethius, and also from the Philosopher. But our mind does not share in matter with sensible things. Therefore, sensible things cannot act on our mind to imprint knowledge on it.

Ergo videtur quod intelligibiles species non sint in mente a sensibus acceptae.
          <td>3. When speaking of the way in which we acquire cognition of intelligible things, Augustine says: “They were there” that is, intelligibles in our mind, “before I learned them, but they were not in my memory. Therefore, it seems that intelligible species are not received in the mind from the senses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut Augustinus probat in X de Trinitate, anima non potest amare nisi cognita.

Ergo antequam addiscat illam scientiam, habet eam in notitia sua; ergo videtur quod non accipiat mens cognitionem a rebus sensibilibus.
          <td>4. Augustine proves that the soul can love only what it knows. But one loves a science before he learns it, as is clear from the eagerness with which he seeks this knowledge. Therefore, before he learns such a science, he has some acquaintance with it. So, it seems that the mind does not receive knowledge from sensible things.

Ergo videtur quod mens non accipiat species intelligibiles a sensibus, sed ipsa eas in se formet.
          <td>5. Augustine says: “The body does not make the image of the body in the spirit. Rather, the spirit itself with a wonderful swiftness which is ineffably far from the slowness of the body makes in itself the image of the body.” Therefore, it seems that the mind does not receive intelligible species from sensible things but constructs them in itself.

          <td>6. Augustine says that our mind judges about bodily things through non-bodily and eternal principles. But principles received from the senses are not of this kind. Therefore, it seems that the human mind does not receive knowledge from sensible things.

          <td>Praeterea, si mens cognitionem a sensibilibus accipiat, hoc non potest esse nisi inquantum species quae a sensibilibus accipitur, intellectum possibilem movet. Sed talis species non potest movere intellectum possibilem. Non enim movet ipsum in phantasia adhuc existens, quia ibi existens nondum est actu intelligibilis, sed potentia tantum; intellectus autem non movetur nisi ab intelligibili actu, sicut nec visus nisi a visibili in actu; similiter nec movet intellectum possibilem existens in intellectu agente, qui nullius speciei est receptivus, alias non differret ab intellectu possibili; similiter nec existens in ipso possibili intellectu, quia forma iam inhaerens subiecto subiectum non movet, sed in ipso quodammodo quiescit; nec etiam per se existens, cum species intelligibiles non sint substantiae, sed de genere accidentium, ut dicit Avicenna in sua metaphysica. Ergo nullo modo esse potest ut mens nostra a sensibilibus accipiat scientiam.
          <td>7. If the mind receives knowledge from sensible things, it must do so because the species received from sensible things set the possible intellect in motion. But such species cannot influence the possible intellect. For, when they are in the imagination, they are not intelligible actually, but only potentially, and so cannot set the possible intellect in motion. The intellect, however, is moved only by something actually intelligible, just as the power of sight is moved only by something actually visible. Similarly, something existing in the agent intellect cannot move the possible intellect, because the agent intellect does not receive species. If it did, it would not differ from the possible intellect. Again, these representations do not actuate the possible intellect by existing in it, for a form already adhering in a subject does not set the subject in motion, but is, as it were, at rest in it. Finally, they do not cause movement in the possible intellect by existing of themselves, for intelligible species are not substances, but belong to the class of accidents, as Avicenna says. Therefore, in no way can our mind receive knowledge from sensible things.

          <td>8. The agent is more noble than the patient, as is clear from Augustine and from the Philosopher. But the receiver is related to that which it receives, as a patient is related to the agent. Since, therefore, the mind is much more noble than sensible things and the senses themselves, it cannot receive knowledge from them.

          <td>The views of the ancients on this question are manifold. Some held that our knowledge derived completely from an external cause separated from matter. There are two explanations of this position.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam enim posuerunt ortum scientiae nostrae totaliter a causa exteriori esse, quae est a materia separata: quae in duas sectas dividitur. Quidam enim, ut Platonici, posuerunt formas rerum sensibilium esse a materia separatas, et sic esse intelligibiles actu, et per earum participationem a materia sensibili effici individua in natura; earum vero participatione humanas mentes scientiam habere. Et sic ponebant formas praedictas esse principium generationis et scientiae, ut philosophus narrat in I Metaph. Sed haec positio a philosopho sufficienter reprobata est; qui ostendit quod non est ponere formas sensibilium rerum nisi in materia sensibili, cum etiam nec sine materia sensibili in universali formae naturales intelligi possint, sicut nec simus sine naso.
          <td>Some, as the Platonists, held that the forms of sensible thing existed apart from matter and so were actually intelligible. According to them, real individuals come about through the participation by sensible matter in these forms, and the human mind has knowledge by sharing in them. Thus, these forms are the principle of generation and knowledge, as the Philosopher says. But the Philosopher has adequately confuted this position by showing that sensible forms must exist in sensible matter, and that sensible matter in general is necessary for the understanding of physical forms, just as there is no snub without nose.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo alii non ponentes formas sensibilium separatas, sed intelligentias tantum, quas nos Angelos dicimus, posuerunt originem nostrae scientiae totaliter ab huiusmodi substantiis separatis esse. Unde Avicenna voluit, quod sicut formae sensibiles non acquiruntur in materia sensibili nisi ex influentia intelligentiae agentis, ita nec formae intelligibiles humanis mentibus imprimuntur nisi ex intelligentia agente, quae non est pars animae, sed substantia separata, ut ipse ponit. Indiget tamen anima sensibus quasi excitantibus et disponentibus ad scientiam; sicut agentia inferiora praeparant materiam ad suscipiendum formam ab intelligentia agente.
          <td>For this reason, others, bypassing separated forms of sensible things, demanded only intelligences, which we call angels, and made separated substances of this sort the sole source of our knowledge. Accordingly, Avicenna holds that just as sensible forms are not received into sensible matter except through the influence of the agent intelligence, so, too, intelligible forms are not imprinted on human minds except by the agent intelligence, which for him is not a part of the soul, but a separated substance. However, the soul needs the senses to prepare the way and stimulate it to knowledge, just as the lower agents prepare matter to receive form from the agent intelligence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed ista etiam opinio non videtur rationabilis: quia secundum hoc non esset necessaria dependentia inter cognitionem mentis humanae et virtutes sensitivas; cuius contrarium manifeste apparet: tum ex hoc quod deficiente sensu deficit scientia de suis sensibilibus, tum etiam ex hoc quod mens nostra non potest actu considerare etiam ea quae habitualiter scit, nisi formando aliqua phantasmata; unde etiam laeso organo phantasiae impeditur consideratio. Et praeterea praedicta positio tollit proxima rerum principia, si omnia inferiora ex substantia separata immediate formas consequuntur tam intelligibiles quam sensibiles.
          <td>But this opinion does not seem reasonable, because, according to it, there is no necessary interdependence of the human mind and the sensitive powers. The opposite seems quite clear both from the fact that, when a given sense is missing, we have no knowledge of its sensible objects, and from the fact that our mind cannot actually consider even those things which it knows habitually unless it forms some phantasms. Thus, an injury to the organ of imagination hinders consideration. Furthermore, the explanation just given does away with the proximate principles of things, inasmuch as all lower things would derive their intelligible and sensible forms immediately from a separated substance.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alia opinio fuit ponentium nostrae scientiae originem totaliter a causa interiori esse: quae etiam in duas sectas dividitur. Quidam enim posuerunt humanas animas in seipsis continere omnium rerum notitiam; sed per coniunctionem ad corpus praedictam notitiam obtenebrari. Et ideo dicebant nos indigere sensibus et studio, ut impedimenta scientiae tollerentur; dicentes, addiscere, nihil aliud esse quam reminisci; sicut etiam manifeste apparet quod ex his quae audimus vel videmus, reminiscimur ea quae prius sciebamus. Sed haec positio non videtur etiam rationabilis. Si enim coniunctio animae ad corpus sit naturalis, non potest esse quod per eam totaliter naturalis scientia impediretur: et ita, si haec opinio vera esset, non pateremur omnimodam ignorantiam eorum quorum sensum non habemus. Esset autem opinio consona illi positioni quae ponit animas ante corpora fuisse creatas, et postmodum corporibus unitas; quia tunc compositio corporis et animae non esset naturalis, sed accidentaliter proveniens ipsi animae. Quae quidem opinio et secundum fidem et secundum philosophorum sententias reprobanda iudicatur.
          <td>A second explanation has been given by those who make an inferior cause the complete source of our knowledge. There are also two explanations; of this position. Some held that human souls had within themselves knowledge of all things, but that this cognition was darkened by union with the body. Therefore, they said that we need assiduous use of the senses to remove the hindrance to knowledge. Learning, they said, is nothing but remembering, as is abundantly clear from the way in which those things which we have seen and heard make us remember what we formerly knew. But this position does not seem reasonable. For, if the union of soul and body is natural, it cannot wholly hinder natural knowledge. And if this opinion be true, we would not be subject to the complete ignorance of those objects which demand a sense faculty of which one is deprived. This opinion would fit in with the theory that holds that souls were created before bodies and later united to them. Then, the conjunction d body and soul would not be natural, but only an accidental accretion to the soul. This opinion must be rejected on the score both of faith and philosophic tenets.

          <td>Alii vero dixerunt, quod anima sibi ipsi est scientiae causa: non enim a sensibilibus scientiam accipit quasi per actionem sensibilium aliquo modo similitudines rerum ad animam perveniant; sed ipsa anima ad praesentiam sensibilium in se similitudines sensibilium format. Sed haec etiam positio non videtur totaliter rationabilis. Nullum enim agens, nisi secundum quod est actu, agit; unde si anima in se format omnium rerum similitudines, oportet quod ipsa in se actu habeat illas similitudines rerum; et sic redibit in praedictam opinionem, quae ponit omnium rerum scientiam animae humanae naturaliter insitam esse.
          <td>Other proponents of this second opinion said that the soul is the cause of its own knowledge. For it does not receive knowledge from sensible things as if likenesses of things somehow reached the soul because of the activity of sensible things, but the soul itself, in the presence of sensible things, constructs in itself the likenesses of sensible things. But this statement does not seem altogether reasonable. For no agent acts except in so far as it is in act. Thus, if the soul formed the likenesses of all things in itself, it would be necessary for the soul to have those likenesses of things actually within itself. This would be a return to the previous opinion which held that the knowledge of all things is naturally present in the human soul.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo prae omnibus praedictis positionibus rationabilior est sententia philosophi, qui ponit scientiam mentis nostrae partim ab intrinseco et partim ab extrinseco esse; non solum a rebus a materia separatis, sed etiam ab ipsis sensibilibus. Cum enim mens nostra comparatur ad res sensibiles quae sunt extra animam, invenitur se habere ad eas in duplici habitudine. Uno modo ut actus ad potentiam: inquantum, scilicet, res quae sunt extra animam sunt intelligibiles in potentia. Ipsa vero mens est intelligibilis in actu; et secundum hoc ponitur in anima intellectus agens, qui faciat intelligibilia in potentia esse intelligibilia in actu. Alio modo ut potentia ad actum: prout scilicet in mente nostra formae rerum determinatae, sunt in potentia tantum, quae in rebus extra animam sunt in actu; et secundum hoc ponitur in anima nostra intellectus possibilis, cuius est recipere formas a rebus sensibilibus abstractas, factas intelligibiles in actu per lumen intellectus agentis. Quod quidem lumen intellectus agentis in anima procedit, sicut a prima origine, a substantiis separatis et praecipue a Deo.
          <td>Therefore, the opinion of the Philosopher is more reasonable than any of the foregoing positions. He attributes the knowledge of our mind partly to intrinsic, partly to extrinsic, influence. Not only things separated from matter, but also sensible things themselves, play their part. For, when our mind is considered in relation to sensible things outside the soul, it is found to be related to them in a twofold manner. In one way, it is related as act to potency, to the extent that things outside the mind are only potentially intelligible. The mind itself, however, is intelligible in act, and it is on this basis that the agent intellect, which makes potentially intelligible things actually intelligible, is held to be included in the soul. In another way, it is related to things as potency to act, inasmuch as determined forms of things are only potentially in our mind, but actually in things outside the soul. In this respect our soul includes the possible intellect, whose function it is to receive forms abstracted from sensible things and made actually intelligible through the light of the agent intellect. This light of the agent intellect comes to the soul from the separated substances and especially from God as from its first source.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et secundum hoc, verum est quod scientiam mens nostra a sensibilibus accipit; nihilominus tamen ipsa anima in se similitudines rerum format, inquantum per lumen intellectus agentis efficiuntur formae a sensibilibus abstractae intelligibiles actu, ut in intellectu possibili recipi possint. Et sic etiam in lumine intellectus agentis nobis est quodammodo originaliter omnis scientia originaliter indita, mediantibus universalibus conceptionibus, quae statim lumine intellectus agentis cognoscuntur, per quas sicut per universalia principia iudicamus de aliis, et ea praecognoscimus in ipsis. Ut secundum hoc etiam illa opinio veritatem habeat quae ponit, nos ea quae addiscimus, ante in notitia habuisse.
          <td>Accordingly, it is true that our mind receives knowledge from sensible things; nevertheless, the soul itself forms in itself likenesses of things, inasmuch as through the light of the agent intellect the forms abstracted from sensible things are made actually intelligible so that they may be received in the possible intellect. And in this way all knowledge is in a certain sense implanted in us from the beginning (since we have the light of the agent intellect) through the medium of universal conceptions which are immediately known by the light of the agent intellect. These serve as universal principles through which we judge about other things, and in which we foreknow these others. In this respect, that opinion is true which holds that we previously had in our knowledge those things which we learn.

          <td><b>Answers to Difficulties</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod formae sensibiles, vel a sensibilibus abstractae, non possunt agere in mentem nostram, nisi quatenus per lumen intellectus agentis immateriales redduntur, et sic efficiuntur quodammodo homogeneae intellectui possibili in quem agunt.
          <td>1. Sensible forms, those, namely, which are abstracted from sensible things, cannot act on our mind unless they are rendered immaterial through the light of the agent intellect, and thus in some way are made homogeneous with the possible intellect on which they must act.

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod circa idem virtus superior et inferior operantur, non similiter, sed superior sublimius; unde et per formam quae a rebus recipitur, sensus non ita efficaciter rem cognoscit sicut intellectus: sed sensus per eam manuducitur in cognitionem exteriorum accidentium; intellectus vero pervenit ad nudam quidditatem rei, secernendo eam ab omnibus materialibus dispositionibus unde non pro tanto dicitur cognitio mentis a sensu originem habere, quod omne illud quod mens cognoscit, sensus apprehendat; sed quia ex his quae sensus apprehendit, mens in aliqua ulteriora manuducitur, sicut etiam sensibilia intellecta manuducunt in intelligibilia divinorum.
          <td>2. A higher and lower power do not operate in the same way even in respect to the same thing, but the higher power acts more nobly. Thus, when sense knows a thing through a form received from things, it does not know it so effectively as the intellect. Sense is led through it to a knowledge of the external accidents; the intellect reaches to the bare quiddity of the thing, distinguishing it from all material dispositions. Thus, when the mental knowing is said to take its origin from sense, this does not mean that sense apprehends all that the mind knows, but that, from those things which sense apprehends, the mind is led on to something more, just as the intellectual knowledge of sensible things leads to knowledge of divine things.

Nevertheless, we should refer this statement of Augustine to higher reason, which confines itself to the contemplation of eternal truths. Although this higher reason is first in dignity, its operation is subsequent in time: “For the invisible things of him [God]... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made” (Romans 1:20).

Et sic formae intelligibiles in actu non sunt per se existentes neque in phantasia neque in intellectu agente, sed solum in intellectu possibili.
          <td>7. In the reception through which the possible intellect receives species from phantasms, the phantasms act as instrumental and secondary agents. The agent intellect acts as the principal and first agent. Therefore, the effect of the action is received in the possible intellect according to the condition of both, and not according to the condition of either one alone. Therefore, the possible intellect receives forms whose actual intelligibility is due to the power of the agent intellect, but whose determinate likeness to things is due to cognition of the phantasms. These actually intelligible forms do not, of themselves, exist either in the imagination or the agent intellect, but only in the possible intellect.

          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod, quamvis intellectus possibilis sit simpliciter nobilior quam phantasma; tamen secundum quid nihil prohibet phantasma nobilius esse, inquantum scilicet phantasma est actu similitudo talis rei; quod intellectui possibili non convenit nisi in potentia. Et sic, quodammodo potest agere in intellectum possibilem virtute luminis intellectus agentis, sicut et color potest agere in visum virtute luminis corporalis.
          <td>8. Although the possible intellect is simply more noble than the phantasm, nothing prevents the phantasm from being more noble n a certain respect, namely, that it is actually the likeness of such a thing, whereas this likeness belongs to the possible intellect only potentially. Thus, in a certain sense, we can say that the phantasm acts on the possible intellect in virtue of the light of the agent intellect, just as color can act on sight in virtue of bodily light.

          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod quies in qua perficitur scientia, excludit motum materialium passionum; non autem motum et passionem communiter accepta, secundum quod quodlibet recipere pati dicitur et moveri; sic enim philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod intelligere quoddam pati est.
          <td>9. The rest in which knowledge is achieved eliminates the movement of material passions. It does not eliminate movement and passion in a general sense, inasmuch as all receiving is called passion and movement. In accord with this, the Philosopher says in <i>The Soul:</i> “Intellection is a kind of passion.”

          <td>It seems that it is not only as the mind knows eternal things, for
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quia, ut dicit Augustinus, libro XII de Trinitate, cum quaerimus Trinitatem in anima, in tota quaerimus, non separantes actionem rationalem in temporalibus a contemplatione aeternorum. Sed mens non est ad imaginem nisi secundum quod in ea Trinitas invenitur. Ergo mens est ad imaginem non solum secundum quod inhaeret aeternis contemplandis, sed etiam secundum quod inhaeret temporalibus agendis.
          <td>1. As Augustine says: “When we look for the Trinity in our soul, we look for It in the whole soul without separating the activity of reason concerning temporal things from the contemplation of things eternal.” But mind has the character of image only as it has the Trinity in it. Therefore, the mind has the character of image not only in so far as it applies itself to the contemplation of eternal things, but also in so far as it engages in activity concerning temporal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, imago Trinitatis consideratur in anima inquantum in ea repraesentatur aequalitas personarum, et earum origo. Sed magis aequalitas personarum repraesentatur in mente secundum quod cognoscit temporalia, quam secundum quod cognoscit aeterna; cum aeterna in infinitum excedant mentem, mens autem non in infinitum temporalia excedit. Origo etiam personarum repraesentatur in cognitione temporalium, sicut et in cognitione aeternorum, quia utrobique ex mente procedit notitia, et ex notitia procedit amor. Ergo imago Trinitatis non solum est in mente secundum quod cognoscit aeterna, sed etiam secundum quod cognoscit temporalia.
          <td>2. We consider the image of the Trinity in the soul in so far as the equality and origin of the persons are represented there. But the equality of the persons is better represented in the mind as knowing things of time than as knowing eternal things, since the latter are infinitely above the mind, whereas the mind is not infinitely above things of time. The origin of the persons, too, is displayed in cognition of things of time as well as in cognition of things eternal, for in both instances knowledge proceeds from the mind and love proceeds from knowledge. Therefore, it has the character of image of the Trinity not only in so far as it knows eternal things, but also in so far as it knows temporal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, similitudo est in potentia diligendi; sed imago in potentia cognoscendi, ut habetur in II sententiarum, XVI distinct. Sed mens nostra per prius cognoscit materialia quam aeterna, cum ex materialibus in aeterna perveniat; et etiam perfectius, cum materialia comprehendat, non autem aeterna. Ergo imago magis est in mente secundum quod comparatur ad temporalia quam secundum quod comparatur ad aeterna.
          <td>3. Likeness is in the power of loving, but the image is in the power of knowing, as is said in the <i>Sentences.</i> But our mind knows material things before it knows things eternal, since it goes from material things to eternal things. It also knows material things more perfectly, since it has a comprehensive grasp of temporal things, but not of things eternal. Therefore, the image is in the mind more according to temporal things than according to eternal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, imago Trinitatis invenitur in anima quodammodo secundum potentias, ut supra, dictum est. Sed potentiae indifferenter se habent ad omnia obiecta ad quae potentiae determinantur. Ergo imago Dei invenitur in mente respectu quorumlibet obiectorum.
          <td>4. The image of the Trinity in the soul somehow follows its powers, as has been said above. But the powers are related indifferently to all the objects to which they are directed. Therefore, the image of God is in the mind with reference to any of its objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, perfectius videtur illud quod in seipso videtur, quam quod videtur in sui similitudine. Sed anima videt seipsam in se, Deum autem non nisi in similitudine, in statu viae. Ergo perfectius cognoscit seipsam quam Deum. Et ita magis est attendenda imago Trinitatis in anima secundum quod anima cognoscit seipsam, quam secundum quod cognoscit Deum; cum in nobis secundum id imago Trinitatis inveniatur quod perfectissimum in natura nostra habemus, ut Augustinus dicit.
          <td>5. Something seen in itself is seen more perfectly than something seen in its likeness. But the soul sees itself in itself; whereas in this life it sees God only in a likeness. Therefore, it knows itself more perfectly than it knows God. So, we should look for the image of the Trinity in the soul rather as it knows itself than as it knows God, since the image of the Trinity is in us according to that which is most perfect in our nature, as Augustine says.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum hoc personarum aequalitas in mente nostra repraesentatur quod memoria, intelligentia et voluntas tota, invicem se capiunt, ut patet per Augustinum, X de Trinitate. Sed ista mutua comprehensio non ostenderet earum aequalitatem, nisi quantum ad omnia obiecta se comprehenderent. Ergo ratione omnium obiectorum imago Trinitatis invenitur in potentiis mentis.
          <td>6. The equality of the persons is represented in our mind in this, that memory, understanding, and the whole will each grasp the others, as is clear from Augustine. But this mutual comprehension shows forth the equality only in so far as they grasp themselves with reference to all objects. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is in the powers of the mind by reason of all their objects.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut imago est in potentia cognoscendi, ita caritas in potentia diligendi. Sed caritas non solum respicit Deum, sed etiam proximum; unde et duplex ponitur actus caritatis, scilicet dilectio Dei et proximi. Ergo et imago non solum est in mente secundum quod cognoscit Deum, sed etiam secundum quod cognoscit creaturas.
          <td>7. As the image is in the power of knowing, so charity is in the power of loving. But charity looks not only to God, but also to the neighbor. Thus, there is a double act of charity: love of God and love of the neighbor. Therefore, the image, also, is in the mind not only as it knows God, but also as it knows creatures.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, potentiae mentis in quibus consistit imago, aliquibus habitibus perficiuntur, secundum quos imago deformata dicitur reformari et perfici. Sed potentiae mentis non indigent habitibus secundum quod comparantur ad aeterna, sed solum secundum quod comparantur ad temporalia, quia habitus ad hoc sunt ut secundum eos potentiae regulentur; in aeternis autem error non potest accidere, ut ibi regula opus sit, sed solum in temporalibus. Ergo imago magis consistit in mente secundum quod cognoscit temporalia quam secundum quod cognoscit aeterna.
          <td>8. The powers of the mind in which the image resides are made perfect by certain habits, according to which the deformed image is said to be re-formed and made perfect. But the powers of the mind do not need habits inasmuch as they are related to things eternal, but only to things temporal. For we have habits in order that powers may be regulated according to them. But there can be no error in things eternal to need regulation, but only in temporal things. Therefore, the image is more in the mind as it knows temporal things than as it knows eternal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Trinitas increata repraesentatur in imagine mentis nostrae, praecipue quantum ad consubstantialitatem et coaequalitatem. Sed haec duo inveniuntur etiam in potentia sensitiva, quia sensibile et sensus in actu efficiuntur unum, et species sensibilis non recipitur in sensu nisi secundum suam capacitatem. Ergo etiam in potentia sensitiva imago Trinitatis invenitur: multo igitur magis in mente, secundum quod temporalia cognoscit.
          <td>9. The uncreated Trinity is represented in the image of the mind especially according to consubstantiality and equality. But these two are also found in the sensitive power, because the sensible thing and sense are made actually one, and the sensible species is received in the senses only according to their capacity. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is in the sensitive power, and so, <i>a fortiori</i> , it is in the mind as it knows temporal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, metaphoricae locutiones secundum aliquas similitudines attenduntur, quia, secundum philosophum, omnes transferentes secundum aliquam similitudinem transferunt. Sed a quibusdam creaturis sensibilibus magis fit transumptio in divina per metaphoricas locutiones, quam etiam ab ipsa mente; sicut patet de radio solari, ut dicit Dionysius, cap. IV de divinis nominibus. Ergo creaturae sensibiles aliquae magis possunt dici ad imaginem quam etiam ipsa mens. Et ita non videtur aliquid impedire quin mens, secundum quod temporalia cognoscit, ad imaginem sit.
          <td>10. Metaphorical expressions are accepted according to certain likenesses, for, according to the Philosopher, every term used figuratively is applied according to some likeness. But the application to God through metaphor is taken rather from certain sensible creatures than from the mind itself. This is evidently what Dionysius does when speaking of the rays of the sun. Therefore, some sensible creatures can be said to have the character of image more than the mind. And so, there seems to be nothing to prevent the mind, as knowing temporal things, from having the character of image.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Boetius dicit in libro de Trinitate, quod formae quae sunt in materia, sunt imagines illarum rerum quae sunt sine materia. Formae autem in materia existentes sunt formae sensibiles. Ergo formae sensibiles sunt imagines ipsius Dei; et ita mens, secundum quod ea cognoscit, videtur ad imaginem Dei esse.
          <td>11. Boethius says that forms which exist in matter are images of those things which exist without matter. But forms existing in matter are sensible forms. Therefore, sensible forms are images of God Himself. Thus, the mind, as knowing them, seems to have the character of image of God.

          <td><b>To the Contrary</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est quod Augustinus dicit in XV de Trinitate, quod Trinitas quae in inferiori scientia invenitur, licet ad interiorem hominem iam pertineat, nondum tamen imago Dei appellanda est vel putanda. Inferior autem scientia est, secundum quod mens temporalia contemplatur; sic enim a sapientia aeternorum distinguitur. Ergo imago Trinitatis non attenditur in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit.
          <td>1. Augustine says: “The trinity which is found in a lower science should not be called or be thought to be the image of God, although it doe’s belong to the inner man.” But a lower science is that according to which the mind considers temporal things, and is thus distinguished from wisdom, which refers to eternal things. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is not to be found in the mind according to its knowledge of temporal things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, partes imaginis secundum ordinem debent tribus personis respondere. Sed ordo personarum non invenitur in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit. In cognitione enim temporalium intelligentia non procedit ex memoria, ut verbum a patre; sed magis memoria ab intelligentia, quia ea quae prius intelleximus, memoramur. Ergo imago non consistit in mente secundum quod temporalia cognoscit.
          <td>2. The parts of the image, considered according to their order, should correspond to the three persons. But the order of the persons does not appear in the mind as it knows temporal things. For, in knowing temporal things, understanding does not proceed from memory, as the Word from the Father, but memory rather proceeds from understanding, for we remember those things which we have previously understood. Therefore, the image is not in the mind as it knows things of time.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, XII de Trinitate: facta ista distributione mentis, quae scilicet dividitur in contemplationem aeternorum, et actionem temporalium, in eo solo quod ad contemplationem pertinet aeternorum, non solum Trinitas, sed etiam imago Dei; in hoc autem quod derivatum est in actione temporalium, etiamsi Trinitas possit, non tamen imago Dei potest inveniri; et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>3. Augustine, having given that division of the mind (into contemplation of things eternal and activity concerning temporal things), says: “Not only the Trinity, but also the image of God, exists only in that part which is concerned with contemplation of eternal things. Even if we could find a trinity in that which is derived from activity about things of time, we still would not find the image of God there.” Thus, we conclude as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, imago Trinitatis semper existit in anima, non autem cognitio rerum temporalium, cum per acquisitionem habeatur. Ergo imago Trinitatis non invenitur in anima secundum quod temporalia cognoscit.
          <td>4. The image of the Trinity always exists in the soul, but knowledge of temporal things does not, since it is acquired. Therefore, the image of the Trinity is not in the soul as it knows temporal things.

          <td>Dicendum, quod rationem imaginis similitudo perficit. Non tamen quaelibet similitudo ad rationem imaginis sufficiens invenitur; sed expressissima similitudo, per quam aliquid repraesentatur secundum rationem suae speciei; et ideo in corporalibus imagines rerum attenduntur magis secundum figuras, quae sunt specierum propria signa, quam secundum colores et alia accidentia. Invenitur autem in anima nostra aliqua similitudo Trinitatis increatae secundum quamlibet sui cognitionem, non solum mentis, sed etiam sensus, ut patet per Augustinum XI de Trinit.: sed in illa tantum cognitione mentis imago Dei reperitur, secundum quam in mente nostra expressior Dei similitudo invenitur.
          <td>Likeness brings the character of image to completion. However, for the character of image not every likeness is sufficient, but the fullest likeness, through which something is represented according to its specific nature. For this reason, in bodies we look for the image more in their shapes, which are the proper marks of species, than in colors and other accidents. There is a likeness of the uncreated Trinity in our soul according to any knowledge which it has of itself, not only of the mind, but also of sense, as Augustine clearly shows.” But we find the image of God only in that knowledge according to which there arises in the mind the fuller likeness of God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ut igitur cognitionem mentis secundum obiecta distinguamus, triplex cognitio in mente nostra invenitur. Cognitio, scilicet, qua mens cognoscit Deum, et qua cognoscit seipsam, et qua cognoscit temporalia. In illa igitur cognitione qua mens temporalia cognoscit, non invenitur expressa similitudo Trinitatis increatae neque secundum conformationem, quia res materiales magis sunt Deo dissimiles quam ipsa mens, unde per hoc quod mens earum scientia informatur, non efficitur Deo maxime conformis; similiter etiam neque secundum analogiam, eo quod res temporalis, quae sui notitiam parit in anima, vel intelligentiam actualem, non est eiusdem substantiae cum ipsa mente, sed extraneum a natura eius; et sic non potest per hoc increatae Trinitatis consubstantialitas repraesentari.
          <td>Therefore, if we distinguish the knowledge of the mind according to objects, we find in our mind a threefold knowledge. There is the knowledge by which the mind knows God, by which it knows itself, and by which it knows temporal things. In the knowledge by which the mind knows temporal things there is no expressed likeness of the uncreated Trinity, either according to adaptation or according to analogy. It is not according to the first, because material things are more unlike God than is the mind itself. Thus, the mind does not become fully conformed to God for being informed by knowledge of these material things. Nor yet is it according to analogy, for a temporal thing, which begets knowledge, or even actual understanding of itself in the soul, is not of the same substance as the mind, but something extraneous to its nature. Thus, the consubstantiality of the uncreated Trinity cannot be represented through it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in cognitione qua mens nostra cognoscit seipsam, est repraesentatio Trinitatis increatae secundum analogiam, inquantum hoc modo mens cognoscens seipsam verbum sui gignit, et ex utroque procedit amor. Sicut pater seipsum dicens, verbum suum genuit ab aeterno, et ex utroque spiritus sanctus procedit. Sed in cognitione illa qua mens ipsum Deum cognoscit mens ipsa Deo conformatur, sicut omne cognoscens, inquantum huiusmodi, assimilatur cognito.
          <td>But in the knowledge by which our mind knows itself there is a representation of the uncreated Trinity according to analogy. It lies in this, that the mind, knowing itself in this way, begets a word expressing itself, and love proceeds from both of these, just as the Father, uttering Himself, has begotten the Word from eternity, and the Holy Spirit proceeds from both. But in that cognition by which the mind knows God the mind itself becomes conformed to God, just as every knower, as such, is assimilated to that which is known.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Maior est autem similitudo quae est per conformitatem, ut visus ad colorem, quam quae est per analogiam, ut visus ad intellectum, qui similiter ad sua obiecta comparatur. Unde expressior similitudo Trinitatis est in mente secundum quod cognoscit Deum, quam secundum quod cognoscit seipsam. Et ideo proprie imago Trinitatis in mente est secundum quod cognoscit Deum primo et principaliter: sed quodam modo et secundario etiam secundum quod cognoscit seipsam et praecipue prout seipsam considerat ut est imago Dei; ut sic eius consideratio non sistat in se, sed procedat usque ad Deum. In consideratione vero rerum temporalium non invenitur imago, sed similitudo quaedam Trinitatis, quae magis potest ad vestigium pertinere, sicut et similitudo quam Augustinus assignat in potentiis sensitivis.
          <td>But there is a greater likeness through conformity, as of sight to color, than through analogy, as of sight to understanding, which is related to its objects in a way similar to that of sight. Consequently, the likeness of the Trinity is clearer in mind, as knowing God, than as knowing itself. Therefore, properly speaking, the image of the Trinity is in the mind primarily and mainly, in so far as the mind knows God, and it is there in a certain manner and secondarily, in so far as the mind knows itself, especially when it considers itself in so far as it is the image of God. As a result, its consideration does not stop with itself, but goes on to God. There is no image in the consideration of temporal things, but a kind of likeness of the Trinity, which can partake more of the character of vestige. Such is the likeness which Augustine attributes to the sensitive powers.

          <td>1. There is indeed a trinity in the mind, as it applies itself to activity concerned with temporal things. But this trinity is not called the image of the uncreated Trinity, as is clear from what Augustine adds to that passage.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod aequalitas divinarum personarum magis repraesentatur in cognitione aeternorum quam temporalium. Non enim est attendenda aequalitas inter obiectum et potentiam, sed inter unam potentiam et aliam. Quamvis autem maior sit inaequalitas inter mentem nostram et Deum, quam inter mentem nostram et rem temporalem; tamen inter memoriam quam mens nostra habet de Deo, et actualem intelligentiam eius et amorem, maior invenitur aequalitas quam inter memoriam quam habet de rebus temporalibus, et earum intelligentiam et amorem. Ipse enim Deus per seipsum cognoscibilis est et diligibilis, et ita tantum a mente uniuscuiusque intelligitur et amatur, quantum menti praesens est; cuius praesentia in mente ipsius memoria in mente est et sic memoriae, quae de ipso habetur, intelligentia et huic voluntas sive amor adaequatur.
          <td>2. The equality of the divine persons is better represented in the knowledge of eternal than of temporal things. For we should not look for equality between object and power, but between one power and another. Moreover, although there is greater inequality between our mind and God than between our mind and a temporal thing, yet between the memory which our mind has of God and actual understanding and love of God there is greater equality than between the memory it has of temporal things and the understanding and love of them. For God is knowable and lovable of Himself and is understood and loved by the mind of each to the degree in which He is present to the mind. His presence in the mind is memory of Him in the mind; thus, intelligence is proportioned to the memory of Him, and will or love is proportioned to this intelligence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Res autem materiales non sunt secundum se intelligibiles et diligibiles. Et ideo respectu earum talis aequalitas in mente non invenitur, nec etiam idem ordo originis cum ex hoc nostrae memoriae praesentes sint, quod a nobis intellectae fuerunt; et sic memoria ex intelligentia oritur potius quam e converso; cuius contrarium in mente creata accidit respectu ipsius Dei, ex cuius praesentia mens intellectuale participat lumen, ut intelligere possit.
          <td>However, physical things as such are not intelligible or lovable and so there is not this equality in the mind with reference to them. Neither is there the same order of origin, since these are present to our memory because we have understood them, and so memory arises from understanding rather than conversely. The opposite of this takes place in the created mind with reference to God from whose presence the mind participates in intellectual light so that it can understand.

Nobilitas enim scientiae ex nobilitate sciti dependet, ut patet in principio I de anima; unde et in XI de animalibus philosophus praeponit modicam scientiam quam habemus de rebus caelestibus omni scientiae quam de rebus inferioribus habemus.
          <td>3. Although the knowledge which we have of physical things is prior in time to that which we have of God, the latter is prior in dignity. And the fact that we know physical reality better than we know God offers no difficulty, because the least knowledge which can be had about God surpasses all knowledge about creatures. The nobility of knowledge depends on the nobility of the thing known, as is clear from <i>The Soul</i> . For this reason, the Philosopher puts the little knowledge which we have of heavenly things before all the knowledge which we have about things here below.

          <td>6. Although the equality belongs to the image which is in our mind, it is not necessary to consider the image with respect to everything, with reference to which some equality is found in it, since many other things are needed for an image. Hence, the argument does not follow.

          <td>8. The powers of the image, even in so far as they are related to God, are made perfect through certain habits, as faith, hope, charity, wisdom, and others like these. For, although in these eternal things there is no error on their part, there still can be error on the part of our understanding in its knowledge of these. The difficulty in knowing them comes not from them, but from us, as is said in the Metaphysics.”

          <td>10. With reference to the effectiveness of their causality, certain irrational creatures can in some way become more like God than even rational creatures. This appears in the sun’s rays, by which everything in lower bodies is caused and renewed. In this way, it is like the divine goodness which causes all things, as Dionysius says. Still, according to properties inhering in it, the rational creature is more like God than any irrational creature.

Translatio enim a creaturis nobilioribus facta aestimationem posset inducere, quod ea quae metaphorice dicerentur essent secundum proprietatem intelligenda; quod opinari nullus potest de ipsis vilioribus creaturis.
          <td>That metaphorical expressions are more frequently taken from irrational creatures and applied to God is due to their dissimilarity. This is done because, as Dionysius says, what belongs to less noble creatures is more frequently transferred to God to remove all occasion for error. For the transfer made from noble creatures could bring about the belief that those things which are applied metaphorically were to be understood properly. No one can think this about less noble things.

          <td>1. As the Philosopher says: “Our intellect understands nothing without a phantasm.” But it cannot receive a phantasm of the very essence of the soul. Therefore, our mind must understand itself through some other species abstracted from phantasms.

          <td>2. Those things which are seen through their essence are most certainly apprehended without error. But many err about the human mind, for some say it is air, others fire, and hold many other foolish opinions about it. Therefore, the mind does not see itself through its essence.

          <td>3 It was said that through its essence the mind sees that it exists, but can err in the investigation of its nature.—On the contrary, to know something through its essence is to know what it is, for the essence of a thing is the same as its quiddity. Therefore, if the soul saw itself through its essence, everyone would unerringly know the essence of his soul, which is obviously false.

          <td>4 Our soul is a form joined to matter. But every form of this kind is known through abstraction of the species from matter and from material conditions. Therefore, the soul is known through an abstracted species.

Ergo, mens non videt se ipsam per essentiam.
          <td>5. Understanding is not an act of the soul alone, but of the composite, as is said in <i>The Soul.</i> But every such act is common to soul and body. Therefore, there must always be something from the body in understanding. But this would not be if the mind saw itself through its essence without any species abstracted from the bodily senses. Therefore, the mind does not see itself through its essence.

          <td>Praeterea, philosophus dicit in III de anima, quod intellectus intelligit se sicut et alia. Sed alia intelligit non per essentiam suam, sed per aliquas species. Ergo nec se ipsam mens intelligit per suam essentiam.
          <td>6. The Philosopher says that the intellect understands itself just as it understands other things. But it does not understand other things through its essence, but through species. Therefore, it does not understand itself through its essence.

          <td>7. Powers are known through their acts, and acts through their objects. But the essence of the soul can be known only when its powers are known, for what a thing can do manifests the nature of the thing. Therefore, it has to know its essence through its acts and through the species of its objects.

Ergo et in intellectuali cognitione requiritur quaedam distantia, ut nunquam se per essentiam suam intelligere possit.
          <td>8. As sense is related to what is sensible, so understanding is related to what is intelligible. But there has to be some distance between sense and the sensible. For this reason, the eye cannot see itself. Therefore, there also has to be some distance in intellectual vision, with the result that mind can never understand itself through its essence.

          <td>9. According to the Philosopher, in a demonstration we should not proceed in a circle, because it would follow that a thing would become known through itself. Thus, it would follow that it would exist before itself and be better known than itself, which is impossible. But, if the mind sees itself through its essence, that which is known and that through which it is known will be the same. Therefore, the same untenable conclusion would follow, for something would exist before itself and be better known than itself.

          <td>Praeterea, Dionysius dicit, VII cap. de divinis nominibus, quod anima circulo quodam cognoscit existentium veritatem. Circularis autem motus est ab eodem in idem.

          <td>10. Dionysius says that the soul knows the truth of existing things in a sort of circle. However, a circular movement is from the same thing to the same thing. Therefore, it seems that the soul goes out from itself in its understanding, and through things outside returns to knowledge of itself. Thus, it does not understand itself through its essence.

          <td>11. While the cause remains, the effect remains. Therefore, if the mind saw itself through its essence because its essence is present to it, it would always see it, for it is always present to it. Therefore, since it is impossible to understand many things at once, the mind would never understand anything else.

          <td>12. Things that follow have more composition than those which come earlier. But understanding follows existing. Therefore, there is more composition in the understanding of the soul than in its existence. But, in the soul, <i>that which exists</i> is not the same as <i>that by which it exists.</i> Therefore, that in the soul by which it understands will not be the same as that which is understood. Thus, the mind does not see itself through its essence.

          <td>13. The same thing under the same aspect cannot be form and that which is informed. But, since the understanding is a power of the soul, it is a kind of form of its essence. Therefore, the essence of the soul cannot be the form of the understanding. Therefore, the mind does not see itself through its essence.

          <td>14. The soul is a subsistent substance. However, intelligible forms are not of themselves subsistent. Otherwise, knowledge, which is made up of these intelligible forms, would not be classified as an accident. Therefore, the essence of the soul cannot have the character of intelligible form by which the mind sees itself.

Sed animam Pauli non intelligit per eius essentiam, cum ab ea sit absens. Ergo nec se intelligit per essentiam suam.
          <td>15. Since acts and movements are distinguished in their terms, intelligible things which belong to the same species are understood according to their species in the same way. But the soul of Peter belongs to the same species as that of Paul. Therefore, the soul of Peter understands itself just as it understands Paul’s soul. But it does not understand Paul’s soul through its essence, for it is not present to it. Therefore, it does not understand itself through its essence.

Sed ut in eadem Glossa dicitur: intellectualis visio eas res continet quae non habent imagines sui similes, quae non sunt quod ipsae. Ergo mens non cognoscit seipsam per aliquid quod non sit idem quod ipsa.
          <td>2. The Gloss on the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:2) reads: “By that sight which is called intellectual, those things are known which are not bodies and do not have any forms like bodies, as mind itself and every disposition of the soul.” The same Gloss adds: “Intellectual sight contains those things which have no likenesses not identical with themselves.” Therefore, the mind does not know itself through something not identical with it.

          <td>3. In <i>The Soul</i> we read: “In things separated from matter, that which understands and that by which it is understood are the same.” But the mind is an immaterial thing. Therefore, it is understood through its essence.

          <td>4. Everything which, as intelligible, is present to the understanding is understood by the understanding. But the essence of the soul is present to understanding in an intelligible manner, for it is present to it through its truth. Truth, however, is the reason for understanding, as goodness is the reason for loving. Therefore, the mind understands itself through its essence.

          <td>5. The species through which something is understood is simpler than that which we understand through it. But the soul does not have any species simpler than itself to be abstracted from it. Therefore, the soul does not understand itself through a species, but through its essence.

          <td>7. That which is a cause by which other things are made knowable is not known through anything other than itself. But the soul is a cause which makes other physical things knowable, for they are intelligible inasmuch as we make them intelligible, as the Commentator says. Therefore, the soul is understood only through itself.

          <td>10. As physical light makes all things actually visible, so the soul through its light makes all material things actually intelligible, as is clear from <i>The Soul</i> .

As the Philosopher says, the agent intellect “does not at one time understand and at another not understand, but always understands.” But it is only itself which it understands at all times.

          <td>When we ask if something is known through its essence, we can understand the question in two ways. In the first, “through its essence” is taken to refer to the thing known, so that we understand that a thing is known through its essence when its essence is known, and that it is not known through its essence when not its essence but only certain of its accidents are known. In the second way, it is taken to refer to that by which something is known, so that we thus understand that something is known through its essence because the essence itself is that by which it is known. It is in this sense that we ask here if the soul understands itself through its essence.

Illa igitur cognitio quae communiter de omni anima habetur, est qua cognoscitur animae natura; cognitio vero quam quis habet de anima quantum ad id quod est sibi proprium, est cognitio de anima secundum quod esse habet in tali individuo. Unde per hanc cognitionem cognoscitur an est anima, sicut cum aliquis percipit se habere animam; per aliam vero cognitionem scitur quid est anima, et quae sunt per se accidentia eius.
          <td>For a clear understanding of this question we should observe that each person can have a twofold knowledge of the soul, as Augustine says. One of these is the knowledge by which the soul of each man knows itself only with reference to that which is proper to it. The other is that by which the soul is known with reference to that which is common to all souls. This latter, which concerns all souls without distinction, is that by which the nature of the soul is known. However, the knowledge which each has of his soul, in so far as it is proper to himself, is the knowledge of the soul as it exists in this individual. Thus, it is through this knowledge that one knows whether the soul exists, as when someone perceives that he has a soul. Through the other type of knowledge, however, one knows what the soul is and what its proper accidents are.

          <td>Quantum igitur ad primam cognitionem pertinet, distinguendum est, quia cognoscere aliquid est habitu et actu. Quantum igitur ad actualem cognitionem, qua aliquis se in actu considerat animam habere, sic dico, quod anima cognoscitur per actus suos. In hoc enim aliquis percipit se animam habere, et vivere, et esse, quod percipit se sentire et intelligere, et alia huiusmodi vitae opera exercere; unde dicit philosophus in IX Ethicorum: sentimus autem quoniam sentimus; et intelligimus quoniam intelligimus; et quia hoc sentimus, intelligimus quoniam sumus. Nullus autem percipit se intelligere nisi ex hoc quod aliquid intelligit: quia prius est intelligere aliquid quam intelligere se intelligere; et ideo anima pervenit ad actualiter percipiendum se esse, per illud quod intelligit, vel sentit.
          <td>With reference to the first type of cognition we must make a distinction, because one can know something habitually or actually. Concerning the actual cognition by which one actually considers that he has a soul, I say that the soul is known through its acts. For one perceives that he has a soul, that he lives, and that he exists, because he perceives that he senses, understands, and carries on other vital activities of this sort. For this reason, the Philosopher says: “We sense that we sense, and we understand that we understand, and because we sense this, we understand that we exist.” But one perceives that he understands only from the fact that he understands something. For to understand something is prior to understanding that one understands. Therefore, through that which it understands or senses the soul arrives at actual perception of the fact that it exists.

Ad hoc autem quod percipiat anima se esse, et quid in seipsa agatur attendat, non requiritur aliquis habitus; sed ad hoc sufficit sola essentia animae, quae menti est praesens: ex ea enim actus progrediuntur, in quibus actualiter ipsa percipitur.
          <td>Concerning habitual knowledge I say this, that the soul sees itself through its essence, that is, the soul has the power to enter upon actual cognition of itself from the very fact that its essence is present to it. This is like the case of one who, because he has the habit of some knowledge, can by reason of the presence of the habit perceive those things which fall under that habit. But no habit is required for the soul’s perception of its existence and its advertence to the activity within it. The essence alone of the soul, which is present to the mind, is enough for this, for the acts in which it is actually perceived proceed from it.

          <td>But, if we speak of the knowledge of the soul when the human mind is limited to specific or generic knowledge, we must make another distinction. For the concurrence of two elements, apprehension and judgment about the thing apprehended, is necessary for knowledge. Therefore, the knowledge by which the nature of the soul is known can be considered with reference to apprehension and with reference to judgment.

Sicut enim materia prima est in potentia ad omnes formas sensibiles, ita et intellectus possibilis noster ad omnes formas intelligibiles; unde in ordine intelligibilium est sicut potentia pura, ut materia in ordine sensibilium.

          <td>If, then, we consider this knowledge with reference to apprehension, I say that we know the nature of the soul through species which we abstract from the senses. For our soul holds the last place among intellectual things, just as first matter does among sensible things, as the Commentator shows. For, as first matter is in potency to all sensible forms, so our possible intellect is in potency to all intelligible forms. Thus, it is, in fact, pure potency in the order of intelligible things, as matter is in the order of sensible reality. Therefore, as matter is sensible only through some added form, so the possible intellect is intelligible only through a species which is brought into it.

Rather, it comes to a knowledge of itself through apprehension of other things, just as the nature of first matter is known from its receptivity for forms of a certain kind.

Otherwise, it would be individuated and so would not lead to knowledge of the universal. From the immateriality of the species by which we understand, philosophers have understood that the intellect is a thing independent of matter. And from this they have proceeded to a knowledge of the other properties of the intellective soul. Thus, the Philosopher says: “The intellect is intelligible just as the other intelligible things are.” The Commentator also affirms this in his explanation: “Intellect is understood through an intention in it, just as other intelligible things.” This intention is nothing but the intelligible species. But this intention is in the intellect as actually intelligible. In other things, however, it is not actually but only potentially intelligible.

We see this inviolable truth in its likeness which is impressed on our mind to the extent that we naturally know some things as self-evident. We examine all other things with reference to these, judging of them according to these.

          <td>1. Our understanding can actually understand nothing before it abstracts from phantasms. Nor can it have habitual knowledge of things other than itself, which are not within it, before the abstraction just mentioned, because species of other intelligible things are not innate in it. However, its essence is innate in it, so that it does not have to obtain it from phantasms, just as it is not the essence of matter which is received from the natural agent, but only its form, which is related to physical matter as intelligible form is related to sensible matter, as the Commentator says. Therefore, before the mind abstracts from phantasms, it has habitual knowledge of itself, by which it can perceive that it exists.

In the second way, a thing is said to b~ known by means of something else in the sense that it is known in that something. In this case, an act of cognition distinct from that in which the thing is known is not required in order that the medium in which the thing is known might itself be known. So, there is nothing to prevent something from being known by means of itself in this way, as God knows Himself by means of Himself. Thus, in some way the soul, too, knows itself through its essence.

Hence, “that by which a thing is understood” is related to that which understands as “that which is to that by which it is.” And, therefore, just as in the soul “that which is,” is different from “that by which it is,” so that by which it understands, that is to say, the intellective power, which is the source of the act of understanding, is different from its essence.

We must understand these words of Augustine to mean that the mind knows itself through itself, since from itself the mind has the power to enter upon the act by which it actually knows itself, by perceiving that it exists.

Dicitur enim in Glossa eadem, quod per visionem corporalem videntur corpora, per visionem vero spiritualem (id est imaginariam) similitudines corporum; per intellectualem autem ea quae neque sunt corpora neque similitudines corporum. Si enim hoc referretur ad id quo intelligitur, tunc quantum ad hoc nulla esset differentia inter visionem corporalem et spiritualem sive imaginariam, quia etiam corporalis visio fit per similitudinem corporis; non enim lapis est in oculo, sed similitudo lapidis.
          <td>2. The words of the Gloss which read: “Intellectual sight contains those things...” are to be referred to the object of knowledge rather than to that by which it is understood. This is clear from a consideration of what is said about other kinds of sight. For the same Gloss reads: “Through bodily sight bodies are seen; through spiritual sight (that is, sight of imagination) likenesses of bodies are seen; through intellectual sight those things which are neither bodies nor likenesses of bodies are seen.” If this were referred to that by which we understand, there would be no difference between bodily sight and spiritual sight (that of imagination), because even bodily sight takes place through the likeness of a body. For the stone is not in the eye, but a likeness of the stone.

Sicut enim visione corporali aliquis intuetur ipsum corpus, non ita quod inspiciat aliquam corporis similitudinem, quamvis per aliquam similitudinem corporis inspiciat: ita in visione intellectuali aliquis inspicit ipsam essentiam rei sine hoc quod inspiciat aliquam similitudinem illius rei, quamvis quandoque per aliquam similitudinem illam essentiam inspiciat; quod etiam experimento patet. Cum enim intelligimus animam, non confingimus nobis aliquod animae simulacrum quod intueamur, sicut in visione imaginaria accidebat; sed ipsam essentiam animae consideramus. Non tamen ex hoc excluditur quin ista visio sit per aliquam speciem.
          <td>But between the kinds of sight mentioned there is this difference, that bodily sight terminates at the body itself, whereas the sight of imagination terminates at the image of the body, as at its object. So, also, when it is said that intellectual sight embraces things which have no likenesses not identical with themselves, this does not mean that spiritual sight does not take place through species which are not the same as the things understood, but that intellectual sight does not terminate at the likeness of a thing but at the very essence of the thing. For, as by bodily sight one sees a body itself without seeing a likeness of the body, although he sees through a likeness of the body, so in intellectual sight one sees the very essence of a thing without seeing the similitude of the thing, although sometimes he sees that essence through some likeness, as is clear from experience. For, when we understand the soul, we do not construct a likeness of the soul and look at it, as happens in imagination. Rather, we study the essence of the soul itself. Nevertheless, this does not deny that this sight takes place through a species.

          <td>8. Knowledge about the soul is most certain in this, that each one experiences within himself that he has a soul and that acts of the soul are within him. But it is very difficult to know what the soul is. Hence, the Philosopher adds: “It is extremely difficult to get any assurance about it.”

          <td>9. The soul is not known through a species abstracted from sensible beings, as though that species were understood to be a likeness of the soul. Rather, from a study of the nature of the species abstracted from sensible things we discover the nature of the soul in which such a species is received, just as matter is known from form.

Sicut enim species lapidis non est in oculo, sed similitudo eius, ita non potest esse quod forma lucis quae est in sole, ipsa eadem sit in oculo. Et similiter etiam lumen intellectus agentis per seipsum a nobis intelligitur, inquantum est ratio specierum intelligibilium, faciens eas intelligibiles actu.
          <td>10. Physical light is seen through itself only in so far as it is the reason for the visibility of visible things and a kind of form making them actually visible. Now, we see the light which exists in the sun only through its likeness which exists in our sight. For as the specific nature of stone is not in the eye, but its likeness, so the form of light which is in the sun cannot be the same form that is in the eye. Similarly, we understand the light of the agent intellect, in so far as it is the reason for the intelligible species, making them actually intelligible.

          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod verbum illud philosophi potest dupliciter exponi, secundum duas opiniones de intellectu agente. Quidam enim posuerunt intellectum agentem esse substantiam separatam, unam de aliis intelligentiis; et secundum hoc semper actu intelligit, sicut aliae intelligentiae.
          <td>11. What the Philosopher says can be explained in two ways, according to the two opinions about the agent intellect. For some have held that the agent intellect is a separated substance, one of a number of intelligences. According to this it always actually understands, as the other intelligences do.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Quidam vero ponunt intellectum agentem esse potentiam animae; et secundum hoc dicitur, quod intellectus agens non quandoque intelligit et quandoque non, quia causa quandoque intelligendi et quandoque non, non est ex parte eius, sed ex parte intellectus possibilis. In omni enim actu quo homo intelligit, concurrit operatio intellectus agentis et intellectus possibilis. Intellectus autem agens non recipit aliquid ab extrinseco, sed solum intellectus possibilis. Unde quantum ad id quod requiritur ad nostram considerationem ex parte intellectus agentis, non deest quin semper intelligamus; sed quantum ad id quod requiritur ex parte intellectus possibilis, qui non completur nisi per species intelligibiles a sensibus abstractas.
          <td>Others, hold that the agent intellect is a power of the soul. According to this it is said that the agent intellect is not a power which sometimes understands and sometimes does not, because the cause of understanding at some times and not at others does not come from it, but from the possible intellect. For, in every act by which man understands, the action of the agent intellect and that of the possible intellect concur. Moreover, the agent intellect does not receive anything from outside. Only the possible intellect does so. Hence, with reference to the requirements for our thought, there is nothing on the part of the agent intellect to keep us from always understanding, but there is on the part of the possible intellect, for it is brought to completion only through intelligible species abstracted from the senses.

Ergo dilectio, per essentiam suam, non per aliquam sui similitudinem, a mente cernitur; et eadem ratione quilibet alius habitus.
          <td>1. The Gloss on this passage, “I know a man...” in the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:2) reads: “We do not see love in one way in the species through which it exists when it is present, and in another way in some image similar to it when it is not present. But it is perceived in so far as it can be discerned by the mind, more by one, less by another.” Therefore, love is perceived by the mind through its essence and not through some likeness of it. This is true of every other habit for the same reason.

          <td>3. The cause of the perfection of a thing has that perfection in an even higher degree. But habits of the mind are the cause whereby other things which fall under the habits are known. Therefore, habits are known by the mind especially through their essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod cognoscitur a mente per sui similitudinem, prius fuit in sensu quam fiat in mente. Sed habitus mentis nunquam fit in sensu. Ergo a mente non cognoscuntur per aliquam similitudinem.
          <td>4. Everything which the mind knows through its likeness arises in sense before it arises in the mind. But a habit of the mind never arises in sense. Therefore, these habits are not known by the mind through a likeness.

          <td>5. The closer a thing is to the mind, the more it is known by the mind. But habit is closer to the intellective power of the mind than act, and act is closer than object. Therefore, the mind knows habit more than act or object. So, it knows habit through its essence and not through acts or objects.

          <td>6. Augustine says that the mind and art are known by the same kind of sight. But the mind is known through its essence by the mind. Therefore, art, also, is known through its essence, and so are the other habits of the mind.

          <td>7. The true is related to understanding as the good is related to affection. But the good is not in affection through some likeness of itself.

Ergo et secundum hoc scitur fides a mente, quod per essentiam suam praesentialiter menti inest.
          <td>8. Augustine says: “Faith is not seen by its possessor in the heart in which it is,” as the soul of another man is seen from movements of the body; “rather, certain knowledge clings to it, and consciousness proclaims it.” Therefore, according to this, knowledge of the mind clings to faith in so far as consciousness proclaims it. But consciousness proclaims faith in so far as it is present in it. Therefore, faith is known by the mind in so far as it is present in the mind through its essence.

          <td>9. Form is most exactly proportionate to that of which it is the form. But habits exist in the mind as forms of the mind. Therefore, they are most exactly proportionate to the mind. Consequently, our mind knows them immediately through their essence.

          <td>10. Understanding knows the intelligible species which is in it, not through another species, but through its essence. Otherwise, there would be an infinite series. But this is so only because these species inform the understanding. Since understanding is informed in a similar way through habits, it seems that the mind knows them through their essence.

          <td>Est quod Augustinus dicit X confessionum: ecce in memoriae meae campis et antris et cavernis innumerabilibus atque innumerabiliter plenis, innumerabilium generibus rerum, sive per imagines, sicut omnium corporum, sive per praesentiam, sicut artium, sive per nescio quas notiones, sicut affectionum animi, quas et cum animus non patitur, memoria tenet. Ex quo videtur quod affectiones animi cognoscantur non per sui essentiam sed per aliquas sui notiones; et eadem ratione habitus virtutum, qui circa huiusmodi affectiones consistunt.
          <td>l. Augustine says: “Behold in the fields and caves and numberless caverns of my memory, full beyond reckoning, there are innumerable sorts of things, [present] either through images, as those of all bodies, or through actual presence, as that of the arts, or through I know not what notions, as those of affections of the mind which memory retains even when the mind is not acted upon.” From this it seems that affections of the mind are not known through their essence, but through some notions of them; and for the same reason neither are habits of the virtues, which group themselves around affections of this kind.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus dicit XI de civitate Dei: habemus alium sensum interioris hominis, sensu isto, scilicet corporali, praestantiorem, quo iusta et iniusta sentimus; iusta per intelligibilem speciem, iniusta per eius privationem. Iusta autem et iniusta appellat habitus virtutum et vitiorum. Ergo habitus animae per speciem, et non per suam essentiam, cognoscuntur.
          <td>2. Augustine says: “We have another sense of the interior man which surpasses that sense,” the bodily, “and through which we perceive just and unjust things, the former through an intelligible species, the latter through its privation.” But he calls just and unjust things the habits of virtues and vices. Therefore, habits of virtues are known through a species and not through their essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil cognoscitur ab intellectu per essentiam nisi quod praesentialiter est in intellectu. Habitus autem virtutum non sunt praesentialiter in intellectu, sed in affectu. Ergo non cognoscuntur per sui essentiam ab intellectu.
          <td>3. Understanding knows through its essence only that which is present in the understanding. But habits of virtues are not present in the understanding, but in the affective part. Therefore, they are not known through their essence by the understanding.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, visio intellectualis est praestantior quam corporalis. Ergo est cum maiori discretione. Sed in visione corporali species qua aliquid videtur, semper est aliud a re quae per ipsam videtur. Ergo et habitus qui per intellectualem visionem videntur, non videntur a mente per essentiam, sed per aliquas species alias.
          <td>4. Intellectual vision is superior to bodily sight. Therefore, it entails greater distinction. But in bodily sight the species through which something is seen is always different from the thing seen through it. Therefore, habits, which are seen through intellectual vision, are not seen by the mind through their essence, but through some other species.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nihil appetitur nisi quod cognoscitur, ut Augustinus probat in Lib. de Trinit. Sed habitus animae appetuntur ab aliquibus qui ipsos non habent. Ergo habitus illi cognoscuntur ab eis. Non autem per sui essentiam cum eos non habeant. Ergo per sui speciem.
          <td>5. We desire only what we know, as Augustine proves.. But some people who do not have habits of the soul desire them. Therefore, they know those habits, but not through their essence since they do not have them. Therefore, they know them through a species of them.

          <td>Praeterea, Hugo de sancto Victore, distinguit in homine triplicem oculum, scilicet oculum rationis, oculum intelligentiae et oculum carnis. Oculus intelligentiae est quo Deus inspicitur; et hunc dicit erutum post peccatum. Oculus carnis est quo ista corporalia videntur; et hic post peccatum integer mansit. Oculus rationis est quo intelligibilia creata cognoscuntur; et hic post peccatum factus est lippus, quia in parte, non totaliter, intelligibilia cognoscimus. Sed omne quod videtur tantum in parte, non cognoscitur per essentiam. Ergo cum habitus mentis sint intelligibiles, videtur quod mens non videat eos per essentiam.
          <td>6. Hugh of St. Victor says that <i>eye</i> can have three meanings in man. There can be the eye of reason, the eye of intelligence, and the eye of flesh. We see God with the eye of intelligence which, Hugh says, was plucked out after the fall. We see physical things with the eye of flesh, which has remained intact after the fall. We know intelligible created things with the eye of reason, which has become blear since the fall, for we know intelligible things only partially and not entirely. But everything that is seen only partially is not known through its essence. Therefore, since habits of the mind are intelligible, it seems that the mind does not see them through their essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, multo praesentior est Deus per essentiam suam menti quam habitus, cum ipse sit cuilibet rei intimus. Sed praesentia Dei in mente non facit quod mens nostra Deum per essentiam videat. Ergo nec habitus per essentiam videntur a mente, quamvis sint in ea praesentes.
          <td>7. God is much more present to the mind through His essence than habits are, for He is innermost in everything. But God’s presence in the mind does not make our mind see God through His essence. Therefore, habits, too, are not seen by the mind through their essence, although they are present in it.

          <td>Praeterea, intellectus qui est potentia intelligens, ad hoc quod actu intelligat, requiritur quod per aliquid reducatur in actum: et id est quo intellectus intelligit actu. Sed habitus essentia, inquantum praesens menti est, non reducit intellectum de potentia in actum, quia sic oporteret quod quamdiu habitus sunt praesentes in anima actu intelligerentur. Ergo habituum essentia non est id quo habitus intelliguntur.
          <td>8. Intellect, which potentially understands, needs something to reduce it to act, if it is actually to understand. And it is by reason of this that intellect does actually understand. But the essence of a habit, in so far as it is present to the mind, does not reduce intellect from potency to act, for, if it did, things would necessarily be understood as long as they were present in the soul. Therefore, that by which habits are understood is not their essence.

Cognitio enim qua quis novit se habere aliquem habitum, praesupponit notitiam qua cognoscat quid est habitus ille: non enim possum scire me habere castitatem, nisi sciam quid est castitas. Sed ex parte animae non est sic. Multi enim sciunt se animam habere qui nesciunt quid est anima.
          <td>Knowledge of habits, as that of the soul, is twofold. One knowledge is that by which one knows whether he has a habit. The other is that by which one knows what a habit is. Nevertheless, these two types of knowledge relate to habits in a way different from that in which they relate to the soul. For the knowledge by which one knows he has a habit presupposes the knowledge by which he knows what that habit is. For I cannot know that I have chastity unless I know what chastity is. This is not the case with the soul. For many know that they have a soul without knowing what the soul is.

          <td>Cuius diversitatis haec est ratio, quia tam habitus quam animam non percipimus in nobis esse, nisi percipiendo actus quorum anima et habitus sunt principia. Habitus autem per essentiam suam est principium talis actus, unde si cognoscitur habitus prout est principium talis actus, cognoscitur de eo quid est; ut si sciam quod castitas est per quam quis se cohibet ab illicitis delectationibus in venereis existentibus, scio de castitate quid est. Sed anima non est principium actuum per essentiam suam, sed per suas vires; unde perceptis actibus animae, percipitur inesse principium talium actuum, utpote motus et sensus; non tamen ex hoc natura animae scitur.
          <td>The reason for such diversity is this, that we perceive that habits as well as the soul exist in us only by perceiving acts of which the soul and habits are the principles. And by its essence a habit is the principle of a certain kind of act. Thus, if we know a habit as the principle of such an act, we know what it is. Accordingly, I know what chastity is if I know it is that through which one refrains from illicit thoughts in matters of sex. But the soul is a principle of acts not through its essence, but through its powers. Thus, from a perception of the acts of the soul we perceive that the principle of such acts, for example, of movement and of sense, is in the soul. Nevertheless, we do not know the nature of the soul from this.

          <td>Loquendo igitur de habitibus prout de eis scimus quid sunt, duo in eorum cognitione oportet attendere; scilicet apprehensionem et iudicium. Secundum apprehensionem quidem eorum notitia oportet quod obiectis et actibus capiatur; nec ipsi possunt per essentiam suam apprehendi. Cuius ratio est, quia cuiuslibet potentiae animae virtus est determinata ad obiectum suum; unde et eius actio primo et principaliter in obiectum tendit. In ea vero quibus in obiectum dirigitur, non potest nisi per quamdam reditionem, sicut videmus, quod visus primo dirigitur in colorem; sed in actum visionis suae non dirigitur nisi per quamdam reditionem, dum videndo colorem videt se videre. Sed ista reditio incomplete quidem est in sensu, complete autem in intellectu, qui reditione completa redit ad sciendum essentiam suam.
          <td>Accordingly, in so far as we know that habits exist, there are, then, two things which we have to keep in mind when we speak of them: the apprehension of the habit and the judgment we form about it. For apprehension we must get knowledge of the habits from objects and acts. The habits themselves cannot be grasped through their essence, because the power of any faculty of the soul is limited to its object. For this reason its activity is directed first of all and principally to its object. It extends only through a kind of return to those things by which it is directed to its object. Thus, we see that sight is first directed to color, but is directed to the act of seeing only through a kind of return, when, in seeing color, it sees that it sees. But this return is incomplete in sense and complete in understanding which goes back to know its essence by a complete return.

Unde actio intellectus nostri primo tendit in ea quae per phantasmata apprehenduntur, et deinde redit ad actum suum cognoscendum; et ulterius in species et habitus et potentias et essentiam ipsius mentis. Non enim comparantur ad intellectum ut obiecta prima, sed ut ea quibus in obiectum feratur.
          <td>As is said in <i>The Soul</i> , “in this life our understanding is related to phantasms as sight is related to colors, not, however, so that it knows phantasms as sight knows colors, but that it knows the things which the phantasms represent. Thus, the activity of our understanding is directed, first, to the things which are grasped through phantasms, then returns to know its act, and then goes further to the species, habits, powers, and the essence of the mind itself. For these are not related to understanding as primary objects, but as those things by which understanding attains its object.

          <td>Iudicium autem de unoquoque habetur secundum id quod est mensura illius. Cuiuslibet autem habitus mensura quaedam est id ad quod habitus ordinatur: quod quidem ad nostram cognitionem se habet tripliciter.

Quandoque vero est naturali cognitioni inditum; quod maxime patet in habitibus virtutum, quarum fines naturalis ratio dictat. Quandoque vero est divinitus infusum, sicut patet in fide et spe, et aliis huiusmodi habitibus infusis. Et quia etiam naturalis cognitio in nobis ex illustratione divina oritur, in utroque veritas increata consulitur. Unde iudicium in quo completur cognitio de natura habitus, vel est secundum id quod sensu accipimus, vel secundum quod increatam consulimus veritatem.
          <td>Moreover, we have judgment about each one of these according to that which is its measure. And the measure of any habit is that to which the habit is ordained. This object has a triple relation to our knowledge. For, sometimes, it is obtained from sense, either from sight or hearing, as when we see the usefulness of grammar or medicine, or we hear it from others, and from this usefulness we know what grammar or medicine is. Sometimes it is inherent in natural knowledge, as is abundantly clear in the habits of virtues, whose ends natural reason proposes. Sometimes it is divinely infused, as appears in faith, hope, and other infused habits of this kind. In both of these latter, uncreated truth is taken into account, because even natural knowledge arises in us from divine enlightenment. Hence, the judgment in which knowledge about the nature of a habit is brought to completion takes place either according to that which we receive by sense or according to a comparison with uncreated truth.

          <td>Sed quantum ad habitualem cognitionem, habitus mentis per seipsos cognosci dicuntur. Illud enim facit habitualiter cognosci aliquid, ex quo aliquis efficitur potens progredi in actum cognitionis eius rei quae habitualiter cognosci dicitur. Ex hoc autem ipso quod habitus per essentiam suam sunt in mente, mens potest progredi ad actualiter percipiendum habitus in se esse, inquantum per habitus quos habet, potest prodire in actus, in quibus habitus actualiter percipiuntur.
          <td>But, with reference to habitual knowledge, habits of the mind are said to be known through themselves. For the cause of habitual knowledge is that by which someone is rendered capable of entering into the act of knowing the thing which is said to be known habitually. From the very fact that habits are in the mind through their essence, the mind can enter upon actual perception of the existence of the habits within it, in so far as through the habits which it has it can enter upon acts in which the habits are actually perceived.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quantum ad hoc differentia est inter habitus cognitivae partis et affectivae. Habitus enim cognitivae partis est principium et ipsius actus quo percipitur habitus, et etiam cognitionis qua percipitur, quia ipsa actualis cognitio ex habitu cognitivo procedit: sed habitus affectivae partis est quidem principium illius actus ex quo potest habitus percipi, non tamen cognitionis qua percipitur.
          <td>But, in this, habits of the cognitive and affective parts differ. For a habit of the cognitive part is the source both of the very act by which the habit is received and also of the knowledge by which it is perceived. For the actual knowledge proceeds from the cognitive habit, whereas a habit of the affective part is the source of that act from which the habit can be perceived but not of the knowledge by which it is perceived.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et sic patet quod habitus cognitivae, ex hoc quod per essentiam suam in mente existit, est proximum principium suae cognitionis; habitus autem affectivae partis est principium quasi remotum, in quantum non est causa cognitionis, sed eius unde cognitio accipitur; et ideo Augustinus dixit in X confessionum, quod artes cognoscuntur per sui praesentiam, sed affectiones animae per quasdam notiones.
          <td>Thus, it is clear that a habit of the cognitive part is the proximate source of knowledge of it because it is present in the mind through its essence. However, a habit of the affective part is, as it were, a remote source, for such a habit does not have within it the cause of knowledge but of that from which knowledge is received. Therefore, Augustine says that arts are known through their presence, but affections of the soul are known through certain conceptions.

          <td>1. What is said in the Gloss should be taken as referring to the object of knowledge and not to the means of knowing. For, when we know love, we consider the very essence of love and not some likeness of it, as happens in imagination.

Sed in eorum quae in ipsa sunt actualem cognitionem devenire potest ex his quae penes se habet, quamvis etiam per aliqua alia cognoscantur.
          <td>2. The mind knows nothing better than that which is within it, for this reason, that it does not have within itself something of the things outside of it in order to proceed from this to knowledge of those things. But the mind can issue into actual cognition of those things which are within it from the things which are present to it internally, even though these are known through some other things.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod habitus non est causa cognoscendi alia sicut quo cognito alia cognoscantur, prout principia sunt causa cognoscendi conclusiones; sed quia ex habitu perficitur anima ad aliquid cognoscendum. Et sic non est causa cognitorum quasi univoca, prout unum cognitum est causa cognitionis alterius cogniti; sed quasi causa aequivoca, quae eamdem nominationem non recipit; sicut albedo facit album, quamvis ipsa non sit alba, sed est quo aliquid est album. Similiter etiam habitus, inquantum huiusmodi, non est causa cognitionis ut quod est cognitum, sed ut quo aliquid est cognitum; et ideo non oportet quod sit magis cognitum quam ea quae per habitum cognoscuntur.
          <td>3. Habit is not the cause of knowing other things as something which is the source of knowledge of other things, once it is known itself, as principles are the cause of knowing conclusions. Rather, from a habit the soul acquires a perfection ordered to knowledge of something. Thus, it is not a univocal cause of the things known, as when one thing which is known is the cause of the knowledge of something else which is known, but an equivocal cause, which does not receive the same name. For example, it is like whiteness which makes a thing white although it itself is not white, but that by which something is white. In like manner, a habit, as such, is not the cause of knowledge, as that which is known, but as that by which something is known. Therefore, it is not necessary that it be better known than those things which are known through the habit.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod habitus non cognoscitur ab anima per aliquam eius speciem a sensu abstractam, sed per species eorum quae per habitum cognoscuntur; in hoc ipso quod alia cognoscuntur, et habitus cognoscitur ut principium cognitionis eorum.
          <td>4. A habit is not known by the soul through a species of it abstracted from sense, but through the species of those things which are known through the habit. And habits are known as the source of knowledge in the cognition of these other things.

          <td>5. Although habit is closer to power than act is, act is closer to the object which constitutes that which is known. Power, however, constitutes the source of knowing. Therefore, act is known before habit, but habit is more a source of knowing.

Sed motus vel operatio affectivae partis incipit ab anima, et terminatur ad res; et ideo non requiritur in affectu aliqua similitudo rei qua informetur, sicut in intellectu.
          <td>7. Movement or activity of the cognitive part realizes its perfection within the mind itself, and, therefore, for a thing to be known, there must be some likeness in the mind. This is especially true if, as an object of knowledge, it is not joined to the mind through its essence. But movement or activity of the affective part begins from the soul and terminates at things. Therefore, a likeness of the thing by which it is informed is not required in the affection as it is in the understanding.

          <td>1. In the passage cited, Augustine distinguishes three ways of knowing. One of these concerns things which are outside the soul, and about which we cannot have knowledge from the things which are within us. To know these things outside, images or likenesses of them must be formed within us.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alius est eorum quae sunt in parte intellectiva; quae quidem per sui praesentiam dicit cognosci, quia ex eis est ut in actum intelligendi exeamus, in quo actu ea quae sunt intelligendi principia, cognoscuntur: et ideo dicit, quod artes per sui praesentiam cognoscuntur.
          <td>A second way deals with those things which are in the intellective part. He says that these are known by reason of their presence, because it is from them that we enter upon the act of knowing. And in this act those things which are the principles of understanding are known. Therefore, he says that arts are known by reason of their presence.

          <td>Tertius modus est eorum quae pertinent ad partem affectivam, quorum ratio cognoscendi non est in intellectu, sed in affectu: et ideo non per sui praesentiam, quae in affectu, sed per eius notitiam vel rationem, quae est in intellectu cognoscuntur, sicut per immediatum principium; quamvis etiam habitus affectivae partis per sui praesentiam sint quoddam remotum principium cognitionis inquantum eliciunt actus in quibus eos intellectus cognoscit; ut sic etiam possit dici quod quodammodo, per sui praesentiam cognoscuntur.
          <td>The third way refers to those things which belong to the affective part, and the reason for knowing these is not in the understanding, but in the affections. Therefore, they are known as through an immediate principle, not by their presence, which is in the affections, but through the knowledge or definition of it which is in the understanding. Yet, by their presence, habits of the affective part are also a remote principle of knowledge in so far as they elicit acts in which understanding knows them. As a result, we can in a sense also say that they are known by reason of their presence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod species illa per quam iustitia cognoscitur, nihil est aliud quam ratio ipsa iustitiae, per cuius privationem iniustitia cognoscitur. Haec autem species vel ratio non est aliquid a iustitia abstractum, sed id quod est complementum esse ipsius ut specifica differentia.
          <td>2. That species through which justice is known is not something other than the very notion of justice through the privation of which injustice is known. Moreover, this species or notion is not something abstracted from justice, but it is that which, as a specific difference, is the ultimate perfection of its being.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod intelligere, proprie loquendo, non est intellectus, sed animae per intellectum; sicut nec calefacere est caloris, sed ignis per calorem. Nec istae duae partes, scilicet intellectus et affectus, sunt cogitandae in anima ut situaliter distinctae, sicut visus et auditus, qui sunt actus organorum; et ideo illud quod est in affectu, est etiam praesens animae intelligenti. Unde anima per intellectum non solum redit ad cognoscendum actum intellectus, sed etiam actum affectus; sicut etiam per affectum redit ad appetendum et diligendum non solum actum affectus, sed etiam actum intellectus.
          <td>3. Understanding, properly speaking, is not an activity of the intellect, but of the soul through the intellect, just as to make warm is not an activity of heat, but of fire through heat. Nor again are those two parts, understanding and affection, to be thought of as distinguished according to position, as sight and hearing, which are acts of organs. Therefore, that which is in affection is also present to the understanding soul. For this reason, through understanding, the soul returns to know not only the act of the understanding but also the act of the affections. In a similar way, through the affections it returns to seek and desire not only the act of the affections but also the act of the understanding.

          <td>4. The distinctness ( <i>discretio</i> ) which has a bearing on the perfection of knowledge is not the state of being distinct ( <i>discretio</i> ) by which that which is understood is distinct from that by which it is understood, for, thus, the divine cognition by which God knows Himself would be most imperfect. Rather, it is the discernment ( <i>discretio</i> ) by which that which is known is [seen as] distinct from everything else.

          <td>5. Those who do not have habits of the mind do not know these habits by that knowledge in which one perceives that they exist in himself, but by that in which one knows what they are, or perceives that they exist in others. This is not through presence, but in another way, as has been said.

Tamen ea quae sunt in ratione, nihil prohibet quin immediate inclinent per essentiam suam ad actus in quibus intelliguntur, ut dictum est.
          <td>6. The eye of reason is said to be blear in relation to created intelligible things in so far as it actually understands nothing without getting something from sensible things, to which intelligible things are superior. Therefore, it does not have all that is needed to know intelligible things. Nevertheless, nothing prevents those things which are in reason from immediately tending through their essence toward acts in which they are understood, as has been said.

          <td>7. Although God is more present to our mind than habits are, still, from objects which we naturally know, we cannot see the divine essence as perfectly as we see the essence of habits, for habits have a proportion to the objects and acts and are their proximate principles. We cannot say this about God.

          <td>3. Augustine says: “One knows the love by which he loves better than the brother whom he loves.” But he knows with greatest certainty that the brother whom he loves exists. Therefore, he also knows with greatest certainty that the love with which he loves exists within him.

Ergo et caritatem se habere quilibet percipere potest.
          <td>4. The attraction of charity is stronger than that of any other virtue. But one is certain that he has other virtues in himself because he has an inclination to their acts. For it is hard for one who has the habit of justice to do what is unjust, but easy to do what is just, as is said in the <i>Ethics.</i> And anyone can perceive this facility within him. Therefore, he can also perceive that he has charity.

          <td>The reason for this, as is clear from what has been said earlier, is that the knowledge by which one knows that he has a habit presupposes the knowledge by which he knows what the habit is. What a habit is, however, cannot be known unless one bases his judgment about it upon that to which that habit is ordained, which is the measure of that habit.

          <td>But that to which charity is ordained cannot be comprehended, because its immediate object and end is God, the highest good, to whom charity unites us. Hence, one cannot know from the act of love which he perceives within him whether he has reached the stage where he is united to God in the way which is needed for the nature of charity.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod caritas per essentiam videtur, inquantum ipsa per essentiam suam est principium actus dilectionis, in quo utrumque cognoscitur; et sic est etiam per essentiam suam et suae cognitionis principium, licet remotum. Non tamen oportet quod certitudinaliter percipiatur, quia actus ille dilectionis quem in nobis percipimus secundum id quod de eo est perceptibile, non est sufficiens signum caritatis, propter similitudinem dilectionis naturalis ad gratuitam.
          <td>1. Charity is seen through its essence, in so far as through its essence it is the source of the act of love, in which both are known. Thus, through its essence, also, it is a source of its knowledge, although a remote source. Nevertheless, it is not necessary that it be perceived with certainty, for the act of love which we perceive in ourselves, in so far as it is perceptible, is not an adequate indication of charity because of the similarity between natural love and infused love.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod delectatio illa quae in actu relinquitur ex caritate, potest etiam ex aliquo habitu acquisito causari; et ideo non est sufficiens signum ad caritatem demonstrandam, quia ex communibus signis non percipitur aliquid per certitudinem.
          <td>2. The pleasure which remains in an act by reason of charity can also be caused by some acquired habit. Therefore, it is not a sufficient indication to show that charity is present because we do not perceive a thing with certainty from common marks.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod quamvis mens certissime cognoscat dilectionem qua diligit fratrem, inquantum est dilectio, tamen non certissime novit eam esse caritatem.
          <td>3. Although the mind knows most certainly the love with which it loves a brother, in so far as it is love, it does not know as certainly that it is charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod quamvis inclinatio qua caritas inclinat ad agendum, sit quoddam principium apprehendendi caritatem, non tamen sufficit ad perfectam perceptionem caritatis. Nullus enim potest percipere se aliquem habitum habere, nisi sciat perfecte illud ad quod habitus ordinatur, per quod de habitu iudicatur; et hoc in caritate sciri non potest.
          <td>4. Although the inclination with which charity tends to action is a source of perceiving charity, it is not enough for perfect perception of charity. For no one can perceive that he has a given habit unless he knows perfectly that to which the habit is ordained, for it is through this that he judges about the habit. In charity this cannot be known.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod philosophus loquitur de habitibus intellectivae partis, qui, si sint perfecti, non possunt latere habentes, eo quod de perfectione eorum est certitudo; unde quilibet sciens scit se scire, cum scire sit causam rei cognoscere, et quoniam illius est causa, et quoniam impossibile est aliter se habere; et similiter aliquis habens habitum intellectus principiorum, scit se habitum illum habere. Sed caritatis perfectio non consistit in certitudine cognitionis, sed in vehementia affectionis; et ideo non est simile.
          <td>5. The Philosopher is speaking of habits of the intellective part, which, if they are perfect, cannot be concealed from those who have them, because certainty belongs to their perfection. Hence, anyone who knows, knows that he knows, since to know is to perceive the cause of a thing, that it is the cause of it, and that it cannot be otherwise. Similarly, one who has the habit of the understanding of principles knows that he has that habit. But the perfection of charity does not consist in certitude of knowledge but in strength of affection. Therefore, the case is not the same.

Unde nec gratia luci comparatur quantum ad hoc quod ita se spirituali visui ingerat manifeste sicut lux corporea visui corporali; sed quantum ad hoc quod gratia est principium spiritualis vitae, sicut lux caelestium corporum est quodam modo initium corporalis vitae in his inferioribus, ut dicit Dionysius; et etiam quantum ad aliquas alias similitudines.
          <td>6. When we are speaking metaphorically, we should not apply the likeness to every detail. Thus, grace is not compared to light in so far as it plainly pours itself out on spiritual vision as physical light does on bodily vision. Rather, the comparison lies in this, that grace is the source of spiritual life as light of the heavenly bodies is a source of bodily life in things here below, as Dionysius says. This holds also for other likenesses.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum quod se habere caritatem potest accipi dupliciter: uno modo in vi orationis; alio modo in vi nominis.

          <td>7. “To have charity” can be understood in two ways. In one it has the force of a statement; in the other, the force of a term. It has the force of a statement, for instance, when one says: “It is true that someone has charity.” It is used with the force of a term when we predicate something about the phrase “to have charity” or about its meaning.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Cum autem ad affectum non pertineat componere et dividere, sed solummodo in ipsas res ferri, cuius conditiones sunt bonum et malum; cum dicitur: ego diligo: vel: volo me habere caritatem; hoc quod dico: me habere caritatem; sumitur in vi cuiusdam nominis, ac si diceretur: volo hoc quod est me habere caritatem. Et hoc nihil prohibet esse mihi cognitum. Scio enim quid est me habere caritatem, etiam si eam non habeo; unde et non habens caritatem, appetit se caritatem habere. Non tamen sequitur quod aliquis sciat se caritatem habere, secundum quod hoc in vi orationis sumitur, id est, quod habeat caritatem.
          <td>However, it does not belong to the affections to join or divide, but only to be drawn to things themselves, for good and evil are its conditions. Therefore, when one says: “I love,” or “I want to have charity,” the phrase “to have charity” is taken in the sense of a term, as though I said: “This is what I want, to have charity.” Now, nothing prevents us from knowing this. For I know what it is to have charity, even if I do not have it. Thus, even one who does not have charity desires to have charity. Nevertheless, it does not follow that one knows that he has charity, taking this with the force of a statement, affirming that he does have charity.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod quamvis habere caritatem sit necessarium ad salutem, non tamen scire se habere caritatem; immo magis expedit nescire communiter, quia per hoc magis sollicitudo et humilitas conservatur. Quod autem dicitur unctio docet de omnibus necessariis ad salutem, intelligitur de omnibus quorum cognitio necessaria est ad salutem.
          <td>8. Although it is necessary to have charity to be saved, it is not necessary to know that one has charity. In fact, it is generally more advantageous not to know, because thus solicitude and humility are preserved. The saying, “The unction of God teaches all that is needed for salvation,” should be understood as referring to all that has to be known for salvation.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod virtus dicitur esse certior omni arte, certitudine inclinationis ad unum, non autem certitudine cognitionis. Virtus enim, ut dicit Tullius, inclinat ad unum per modum cuiusdam naturae; natura autem certius et directius pertingit ad unum finem quam ars; et per hunc etiam modum dicitur quod virtus est certior arte, non quod certius aliquis percipiat se habere virtutem, quam artem.
          <td>9. Virtue is more certain than any art with the certainty of tendency to one thing, but not with the certainty of knowledge. For virtue, as Cicero says,” tends to one thing in the manner of a nature. But nature reaches a single end more surely and more directly than art does. It is in this sense, too, that virtue is said to be more certain than art, and not in the sense that one perceives virtue in himself more surely than art.

          <td>1. In Numbers (12:8) it is said of Moses: “For I speak to him mouth to mouth: and plainly and not by riddles doth he see the Lord.”, But to see God without riddles is to see Him through His essence. Therefore, since Moses was still a wayfarer, it seems that someone in this life can see God through His essence.

Claritas autem Dei est eius essentia, ut in eadem Glossa dicitur. Ergo aliquis in hac mortali vivens carne potest Deum per essentiam videre.
          <td>2. Gregory’s gloss on Exodus (33:20), “For man shall not see me and live,” says: “The glory of God everlasting can be seen with the keenness of contemplation by some living in this flesh but growing in priceless virtue.” But the glory of God is His essence, as is said in the same gloss. Therefore, one living in this mortal flesh can see God through His essence.

          <td>4. In this life God is known by means of intellectual sight. Hence, Romans (1:20) says: “For the invisible things of him... are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made.” But the sight of understanding is that through which things are seen in themselves, as Augustine says. Therefore, our mind can see God in this life through His essence.

          <td>5. The Philosopher says: “Our soul in a certain sense is all things,” because sense is all sensible things and understanding is all intelligible things. But the divine essence is most intelligible. Therefore, our understanding even according to the conditions of this life, about which the Philosopher is speaking, can see God through His essence, just as our sense can perceive all sensible things.

III, vers. 18: nos autem revelata facie gloriam domini speculantes, etc.; creaturae vero velamen divinae essentiae visionem, ut videtur, impedire non potest, quia Deus est interior menti nostrae quam aliqua creatura. Ergo in statu viae mens nostra Deum per essentiam videt.
          <td>7. Our understanding has been made to see God. If it cannot see God in this life, this is only because of some veil. This is twofold, a veil of guilt and of creaturehood. The veil of guilt did not exist in the state of innocence, and even now is taken away from the saints. The second Epistle to the Corinthians (3:18) says: “But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face...” Now, the veil of creaturehood, as it seems, cannot keep us from seeing the divine essence, because God is deeper within our mind than any creature. Therefore, in this life our mind sees God through His essence.

          <td>8. Everything that is in another is there according to the mode of the one receiving. But God is in our mind through His essence. Since, therefore, intelligibility itself is the mode of our mind, it seems that the divine essence is in our mind as intelligible. So, our mind understands God through His essence in this life.

          <td>10. As the being which is predicated of all things stands first in universality, so the being by which all things are caused, that is to say, God, stands first in causality. But the being which is first in universality is the first concept of our understanding even in this life. Therefore, in this life we can immediately know through His essence the being which is first in causality.

Ergo mens nostra in statu viae Deum per essentiam videre potest.
          <td>11. For sight there must be one who sees, something seen, and an intention. But we have these three in our mind with reference to the divine essence. For our mind itself is naturally capable of seeing the divine essence, since it was made for this. And the divine essence is present in our mind. Nor is an intention lacking, for, whenever our mind turns to a creature, it also turns to God, since in the creature there is a likeness of God. Therefore, our mind can see God through His essence in this life.

Surely, I do not see it in you, nor you in me, but we both see it in the unchangeable truth which is above our minds.”, But the unchangeable truth is the divine essence, in which nothing can be seen unless it itself is seen. Therefore, we see the divine essence in this life, and we see all truth in it.

Therefore, if the soul would see God through His essence, it must be separated from the body, even in so far as it is the first act of the body. But this does not happen as long as man is in this life. Therefore, in this life no one can see God through His essence.

For the quiddities of sensible things, of which intelligible species abstracted from phantasms are likenesses, are essentially different from the essences of even created immaterial substances, and much more from the divine essence.

          <td>Hence, by means of the natural knowledge, which we experience in this life, our mind cannot see either God or angels through their essence. Nevertheless, angels can be seen through their essence by means of intelligible species different from their essence, but the divine essence cannot, for it transcends every genus and is outside every genus. As a result, it is impossible to find any created species which is adequate to represent it.

Quod ei competebat ex hoc quod erat Deus et homo: unde in eius potestate erant omnia quae ad humanam naturam spectabant, ut unaquaeque vis animae et corporis afficeretur secundum quod ipse disponebat. Unde nec dolor corporis contemplationem mentis impediebat, nec fruitio mentis dolorem corporis minuebat: et sic intellectus eius, luce gloriae illustratus, Deum per essentiam videbat, ut tamen ad inferiores partes gloria non derivaretur. Et sic simul erat viator et comprehensor; quod de aliis dici non potest in quibus ex superioribus viribus de necessitate redundat aliquid in inferiores; et a passionibus vehementibus inferiorum virium superiores trahuntur.
          <td>3. It was unique in Christ that at the same time He was a wayfarer and a possessor [of the beatific vision]. This belonged to Him because He was God and man. As a result, everything which related to human nature was under His control, so that each power of soul and body was affected in the way in which He determined. Hence, bodily pain did not hinder contemplation of the mind, nor did delight of the mind lessen bodily pain. Thus, His understanding, which was illumined by the light of glory, saw God through His essence in such a way that the glory did not affect the lower parts. In this way He was at once a wayfarer and a possessor of the beatific vision. This cannot be said of others, in whom there is some necessary diffusion from the higher powers to the lower, and in whom the higher powers are drawn down by the strong passions of the lower powers.

Verbum autem Augustini referendum est ad id quod cognoscitur, non ad id quo cognoscitur, ut ex superioribus quaestionibus patet.
          <td>4. In this life God is known by means of intellectual sight, yet not with the result that we know what He is, but only what He is not. To this extent we know His essence, understanding that it stands above everything. Such cognition, however, takes place through certain likenesses. The statement from Augustine should be taken as referring to that which is known and not to that by which it is known, as is clear from what has been said.

Cuius ratio est, quia, cum affectus ad intellectum sequatur, ubi terminatur operatio intellectus, incipit operatio affectus. Intellectus autem ex effectibus in causas procedens, tandem pervenit in ipsius Dei cognitionem aliqualem, cognoscendo de eo quid non est; et sic affectus fertur in id quod ei per intellectum offertur, sine hoc quod necesse habeat redire per omnia media per quae intellectus transivit.
          <td>6. We can love God directly without having loved anything else first, although sometimes we are drawn to invisible things through love of other things which can be seen. In this life, however, we cannot know God directly without first knowing something else. The reason for this is that the activity of affection begins where the activity of understanding ends, since affection follows understanding. But the understanding, going from effects to causes, finally arrives at some sort of knowledge of God, by knowing what He is not. Hence, affection is directed to that which is presented to it through the understanding, without having to go back through all the intermediate things through which the understanding passed.

          <td>7. Although our understanding has been made to see God, it cannot see God by its own natural power, but through the light of glory infused into it. Therefore, even though every veil is taken away, it is still not necessary to see God through His essence if the soul is not enlightened with the light of glory. For this lack of glory will be an obstacle to seeing God.

Quamvis autem creaturis omnibus communiter det esse, tamen cuilibet creaturae dat proprium modum essendi; et sic etiam quantum ad hoc quod in omnibus est per essentiam, praesentiam, potentiam, invenitur esse diversimode in diversis, et in unoquoque secundum proprium eius modum.
          <td>8. Along with intelligibility, which it has as a property, our mind also has existence in common with other things. Hence, although God is in it, it is not necessary that He be there always as an intelligible form, but as giving existence, just as He is in other creatures. Moreover, although He gives existence to all creatures alike, He gives each creature its own mode of existence. Furthermore, in the sense that He is in all of them through essence, presence, and power, He is seen to exist differently in different things, and in each one according to its own mode.

          <td>9. Soundness of mind is twofold. There is one by which the mind is healed from sin through the grace of faith. This soundness makes the mind see that unapproachable glory in a mirror and obscurely. The other, which will come through glory, is a remedy for all sin, punishment, and distress. This soundness makes the mind see God face to face. These two kinds of sight are distinguished in the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:12): “We see now through a glass in a dark manner; but then face to face.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad decimum dicendum, quod ens quod est primum per communitatem, cum sit idem per essentiam cuilibet rei, nullius proportionem excedit; et ideo in cognitione cuiuslibet rei ipsum cognoscitur.

          <td>10. The being which is most extensive in universality does not exceed the proportion of anything, since it is essentially identified with everything. Therefore, it is perceived in the knowledge of anything whatsoever. But the being which is first in causality exceeds all other things and has no proportion to them. Hence, it cannot be known adequately through knowledge of any other thing. Therefore, in this life, in which we understand through species abstracted from things, we have adequate knowledge of being in general, but not of uncreated being.

          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod quamvis divina essentia sit praesens intellectui nostro, non tamen est ei coniuncta ut forma intelligibilis, quam intelligere possit quamdiu lumine gloriae non perficitur. Ipsa enim mens non habet facultatem videndi Deum per essentiam antequam praedicto lumine illustretur. Et sic deficit et videntis facultas, et visi praesentia. Intentio etiam non semper adest; quamvis enim in creatura inveniatur aliqualis creatoris similitudo, non tamen quandocumque ad creaturam convertimur, convertimur ad eam prout est similitudo creatoris. Unde non oportet quod semper intentio nostra feratur ad Deum.
          <td>11. Although the divine essence is present to our understanding, still, as long as our understanding is not made perfect by the light of glory, it is not joined to it as an intelligible form which it can understand. For the mind itself does not have the faculty of seeing God through His essence before it is illumined with the aforesaid light. Thus, the faculty of seeing and the presence of what is seen are lacking. Again, the intention is not always present, for, although some likeness of the Creator is found in creatures, still, whenever we look at a creature, we do not consider it as a likeness of the Creator. Hence, it is not necessary that our intention always reach God.

Secundum hoc ergo nos in veritate increata aliquid videre dicimur, secundum quod per eius similitudinem in nostra mente resultantem de aliquo iudicamus, ut cum per principia per se nota iudicamus de conclusionibus.

          <td>12. As the Gloss on Psalms (11:2)says: “Truths are decayed.... Many truths are imprinted on human minds,” by the one uncreated truth, “just as from one face many faces appear in different mirrors,” or in one broken mirror. According to this, we are said to see something in uncreated truth when we judge about something through the likeness of uncreated truth reflected in our mind, as when we judge of conclusions through self-evident principles. Hence, it is not necessary that we see uncreated truth through its essence.

Uno modo ut intelligatur de visione imaginaria; unde dicit interlinearis: vidi dominum facie ad faciem: non quod Deus videri possit, sed formam vidit in qua Deus locutus est ei. Alio modo exponit Glossa Gregorii de visione intellectuali, qua sancti in contemplatione divinam veritatem intuentur; non quidem sciendo de ea quid est, sed magis quid non est; unde dicit ibidem Gregorius: veritatem sentiendo videt; quia quanta est ipsa veritas, non videt, cui tanto se longe aestimat, quanto appropinquat; quia nisi illam utcumque conspiceret, non eam conspicere se non posse sentiret. Et post pauca subiungit: haec ipsa per contemplationem facta, non solida et permanens visio, sed quasi quaedam visionis imitatio, Dei facies dicitur. Quia enim per faciem quemlibet agnoscimus, cognitionem Dei faciem vocamus.
          <td>14. This citation is explained in two ways in the Gloss. In one way it is taken to refer to the sight of imagination. Thus, the interlinear Gloss says: “I have seen the Lord face to face. This does not mean that God can be seen, but that he saw the form in which God spoke to him.” It is explained differently in Gregory’s gloss, as referring to intellectual sight, by which saints have seen divine truth in contemplation, not, indeed, knowing what it is, but what it is not. Hence, Gregory says: “He saw by perceiving the truth, for he does not see how great the truth itself is, since the closer he approaches to it, the farther he thinks he is from it. For, unless he saw the truth in some way, he would not perceive that he was not able to see it.” And he adds: “This sight, which comes through contemplation, is not firm and permanent, but, as a kind of imitation of sight, is called the face of God. For, since we recognize a person by his face, we call knowledge of God the face of God.

Thus, we cannot conclude that truth exists simply.—On the contrary, there is the fact that everything which is true in some respect is reduced to something which is true simply, just as every imperfect thing is reduced to something perfect. Therefore, if the fact that truth would exist was true in some respect, something had to be true simply. Thus, it was simply true to say that truth existed.

For the believer’s assent to what he believes does not come from the fact that his understanding concludes to the things believed by virtue of any principles, but from the will, which influences the understanding to assent to what is believed.

But the first power is generative power. Therefore, according to natural reason we can know that there is generative power in God. But, once generative power is postulated in God, the distinction of persons necessarily follows. Therefore, by natural knowledge we can know the distinction of persons.

          <td>Quod autem potentia generativa sit prima potentia, sic probabat. Secundum ordinem operationum est ordo potentiarum.

Ergo potentia intellectiva est prima potentiarum. Sed potentia intellectiva est potentia generativa, quia omnis intelligens gignit notitiam suam in seipso. Ergo potentia generativa est prima potentiarum.
          <td>That generative power is the first power was proved in this way: The order of powers follows the order of operations. But the first operation of all is to understand, for there is proof that an intellectual agent exists first, and in such an agent there is understanding, according to the manner of understanding, before willing or doing. Therefore, intellective power is the first of the powers. But intellective power is generative power, since every understanding begets its likeness in itself. Therefore, generative power is the first of the powers.

          <td>3. Every equivocal is reduced to the univocal as every multitude is reduced to unity. But the procession of creatures from God is an equivocal procession, since creatures do not have the same name and definition as God. Therefore, according to natural reason we must assert that there pre-exists in God a univocal procession according to which God proceeds from God. Given this, there follows the distinction of the persons in God.

          <td>4. One of the glosses says that there has been no sect which has erred about the person of the Father. But it would be a very serious error about the person of the Father to say that he did not have a Son. Therefore, even the schools of philosophers who came to know God by natural reason have held Father and Son in God.

Ergo oportet ponere distinctionem personarum in divinis secundum naturalem rationem.
          <td>5. As Boethius says, equality precedes every inequality. But there is inequality between Creator and creature. Therefore, we must say that there was some equality in God before this inequality. But there cannot be equality in Him unless there is distinction, for nothing is equal to itself, just as nothing is like itself, as Hilary says. Therefore, according to natural reason, we must assign distinction of persons to God.

          <td>6. Natural reason comes to the conclusion that there is the greatest joy in God. But “there is not the greatest enjoyment of any good without a companion,” as Boethius says., Therefore, by natural reason we can know that there are distinct persons in God, and that by reason of their companionship there is joyful possession of goodness.

Augustine also says that he found in certain books of Plato the prologue of St. John’s Gospel, from “In the beginning was the Word” down to, but not including, “The Word was made flesh.” The distinction of the persons is clearly shown in these words. Therefore, by natural reason one can reach knowledge of the Trinity.

          <td>1. Hebrews (11:1) says: “Faith is the substance of things to be hoped for, the evidence of things that appear not.” But those things which are known by natural reason are things that appear.

Haec autem personis appropriata naturali ratione cognosci possunt; propria vero personarum nequaquam.
          <td>The trinity of persons is known in two ways. In the first, it is known according to the properties by which the persons are distinguished. When these are known, the Trinity in God is really known. The second way is through essential notes which are appropriated to the persons, as power to the Father, wisdom to the Son, and goodness to the Holy Spirit. But it is impossible to know the Trinity perfectly through notes like these, for, even if in our minds we prescinded from the Trinity, those things would remain in God. But, once the Trinity is presupposed, attributes of this type are appropriated to the persons because of a certain likeness to properties of the persons. With natural knowledge it is possible to know the things which are thus appropriated to the persons, but it is not at all possible to know the properties of the persons.

Unde ad nullius cognitionem nostra naturalis ratio potest pertingere ad quod se prima principia non extendant.
          <td>The reason for this is that it is impossible for an action outside the range of the instruments of an agent to proceed from that agent. Thus, it is impossible to build with the art of the blacksmith, for this effect is outside the range of the instruments of the smith. Moreover, as the the Commentator says,” in us first principles are, as it were, instruments of the agent intellect, and in virtue of its light, natural reason thrives in us.. Hence, our natural reason cannot attain to knowledge of any of those things which are outside the range of first principles.

But we cannot proceed from sensible things to knowledge of the properties of the persons in the way one reaches causes from effects.

However, the properties of the persons are relations, through which the persons arc related not to creatures, but to each other.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod potentiam intellectivam esse primam potentiarum, satis naturali ratione constare potest; non autem hanc intellectivam potentiam esse potentiam generativam. Cum enim in Deo sit idem intelligens, intelligere et intellectum, naturalis ratio non cogit ponere quod Deus, intelligendo, aliquid gignat a se distinctum.
          <td>2. It can be made sufficiently clear from natural reason that intellective power is the first of the powers, but it cannot be shown that this intellective power is generative power. For, since in God the one who understands, the act of understanding, and what is understood is the same thing, natural reason does not force us to say that God, in understanding, begets something distinct from Himself.

Causae enim aequivocae sunt per se causae speciei: unde in totam speciem causalitatem habent; causae vero univocae non sunt causae speciei per se, sed in hoc vel illo:
          <td>3. Every multiplicity supposes some unity and every equivocation supposes univocity, but every equivocal generation does not presuppose univocal generation. Rather, if we follow natural reason, the opposite is true, for equivocal causes are essential causes of a species. Hence, they exert causality on the whole species. But univocal causes are not essential causes of a species, but only in this or that individual.

Unde hoc modo ex parte ista, aequalitas inaequalitatem praecedit, sicut unitas numerum. Sed supposita aequalitatis sunt multa; et haec non praesupponuntur ad supposita inaequalitatis; alias oporteret ante omnem unitatem dualitatem praecedere, quia in dualitate primo invenitur aequalitas, inter unitatem vero et dualitatem est inaequalitas.
          <td>5. Even without supposing the distinction of persons, we can affirm equality in God, in so far as we say that His goodness is equal to His wisdom. Another answer can be based on a consideration of the two elements of equality, the cause of the equality and its terms. Unity is the cause of equality, but some number is the cause of other proportions. Hence, according to this consideration, equality precedes inequality, as unity precedes number. But the terms of equality are many. And these are not assumed to be prior to the terms of inequality. Otherwise, duality would have to precede every unity, for equality is first found in duality, but between unity and duality there is inequality.
