        things that preserve a human being from evil, namely, the fear of God -
        <i>Ecclesiasticus 2: They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments -</i>
        and the love of truth, because upright works are said to be true as if

        But, if some people do not shun evil because of the fear of God, still
        they are held back from it because of the infamy. But some other people
        do not fear infamy: whence it is said at
        <i>Luke 18</i> of he
        <i>who feared not God, nor regarded man.</i>
        And the Psalmist excludes these two things from his adversaries. First,
        the fear of God, when he says,
        <i>For there is now no holy person:</i>
        for sanctity consists in the fear and worship of God. And for this
        reason holy things are said to be those dedicated to the worship of God;
        as if to say, "there is no man found in this world who would fear God -
        <i>Micheas 7: The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there is
          none upright among men.</i>

        quod est, apparent ab illa una veritate qua sancta anima illustratur,

        But, just as different appearances occur in different mirrors from the
        aspect of one man, and similarly in one mirror broken into pieces,
        likewise in different souls different truths result from one divine
        truth. And in like wise in a single soul, because it does not attain the
        divine simplicity, but rather is composite, and for this reason,
        different truths appear from that single truth by which the saintly soul
        is illuminated: and indeed these truths, when the soul withdraws from
        God, are diminished.

          and with a perfect heart.</i>

        <i>Exodus 18: And provide out of all the people able men, such as fear
          God, in whom there is truth.</i>
        It is apparent that the psalmist speaks of this truth, namely, of the

        diminished, when the good is judged to be evil. Of doctrine, when light
        is said to be shadow. And the truth of justice, when the bitter is
        judged sweet: and conversely -

        is vanity: and he says with respect to this,
        <i>They have spoken vain things.</i>
        A vain thing is that which does not have subsistence. And those things
        are true, therefore, below which there is nothing of vanity: whence

        dicit,
        <i>Labia dolosa in corde, et corde locuti sunt</i>. Geminatio duplex cor
        significat. Ostendunt autem ore se habere unum, corde autem habent
        aliud. Ostendunt se dolere, et gaudent diligere, et odiunt compati, et
        laetantur:
        <i>Iam. 1. Vir duplex animo inconstans est in omnibus viis suis: Eccl.

        Deceit, in the way of a sign, is the diminishment of sanctity; and he
        says, with respect to this,
        <i>With deceitful lips, and with a double heart have they spoken.</i>
        A double heart signifies a doubling [of something]. For they display to
        the ear one thing, but they have another in the heart. They appear to be
        afflicted, and they enjoy loving, and they hate to commiserate, and they
        rejoice -
        <i>James 1: A double minded man is inconstant in all his ways;</i>

          wicked lips.</i>

        <i>Jeremias 17: Bring upon them the day of affliction, and with a double
          destruction, destroy them, O Lord God.</i>
        Consequently, he sets down the cause of their malice: and he sets three

        for there is deceit, when somebody does one thing and feigns another
        thing. He conceives deceit in his heart, but he covers this with words,

        <i>Proverbs 12: Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil
          things.</i>
        "God scatters them because he makes them known: for then their deceit
        does not have the nature of deceit, for deceit is a hidden malice..
