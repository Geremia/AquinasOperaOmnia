<td style=text-align:justify><b>a.<I> In finem pro octava</I> PSALM DAVID. Salvum me fac Domine, quoniam  defecit sanctus; quoniam diminutate sunt veritates a filiis  hominum.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>Unto  the end; for the octave, a psalm for David. Save me, O Lord, for there is  now no holy person: truths are diminished from the children of men.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>b.  Vana locuti sunt unusquisque ad proximum suum; labia dolosa in corde et  corde locuti sunt.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>They  have spoken vain things every one to his neighbour: with deceitful lips,  and with a double heart have they spoken.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><b>c.  Disperdat Dominus universa labia dolosa, et linguam magniloquam. Qui  dixerunt linguam nostram magnificabimus: labia nostra a nobis sunt, quis  noster Dominus est?
<td style=text-align:justify><b>May  the Lord destroy all deceitful lips, and the tongue that speaketh proud  things. Who have said: We will magnify our tongue; our lips are our own;  who is Lord over us?

<td style=text-align:justify><b>d.  Propter miseriam inopum et gemitum pauperum, nunc exurgam, dicit Dominus.  Ponam in salutari, fiducialiter agam in eo. Eloquia Domini eloquia casta,  argentum igne examinatum: probatum terrae, purgatum septuplum. Tu Domine  servabis nos, et custodies nos a generatione hac in aeternum. In circitu  impii ambulant: secundum altitudinem tuam multiplicasti filios  hominum.
<td style=text-align:justify><b>By  reason of the misery of the needy, and the groans of the poor, now will I  arise, saith the Lord. I will set him in safety; I will deal confidently  in his regard. The words of the Lord are pure words: as silver tried by  the fire, purged from the earth refined seven times. Thou, O Lord, wilt  preserve us: and keep us from this generation for ever. The wicked walk  round about: according to thy highness, thou best multiplied the children  of men.

<td style=text-align:justify><B>a.</B> In praemissa decade Psalmista tractavit de percussione, quam  ipse passus est ab Absalone filio suo, per quam figurabatur persecutio,  quam passurus erat Christus a Iuda; in hac autem secunda decade, sicut ex  titulus quorundam psalmorum apparet, agit de persecutione quam passus est  a Saule, per quam figurabatur persecutio, quam Christis erat passurus a  principibus sacerdotum.
<td style=text-align:justify>In  the first decade the Psalmist treats of the beating that he suffered from  his son Absalom, by which the persecution which Christ was to suffer from  Juda was figured; but, in the second decade, just as is apparent from the  title of some of its Psalms, he speaks of the persecution that he suffered  from Saul, by which the persecution that Christ was to suffer by the High  Priests was figured.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dividitur autem deca huius in duas partes. In prima petit liberari ab  inimicis. In secunda iam liberatus orat pro sui exaltatione, <I>In psal.  Exaudiat te Dominus</I>, qui quidem competit quantum ad historiam David,  quia mortuo Saule David promotus est in regem: et quantum ad mysterium  Christo, cuius regnum in morte eius confirmatum est: <I>Phil. 2. Propter  quod</I>, quia scilicet factus est obediens Patri usque ad mortem, <I>Deus  exaltivit illum</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  that decade is divided into two parts. In the first, he asks to be freed  from enemies. In the second, now freed, he prays that he be raised up (at  Psalm 19: <I>May the Lord hear thee</I>), which fits with the history of  David, on the one hand, because upon the death of Saul he was promoted to  king, and on the other hand, to the mystery through Christ, whose kingdom  was confirmed through his death - <I>Philipians 2: For which cause,</I>  namely because he was made obedient to the Father even unto death, <I>God  also hath exalted him.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>In  prima parte facti duo. Primo petit liberationem. Secundo de liberatione  gratias agit: et hoc in <I>17. Psal. Diligam te.</I> Circa primum tria  facit. Primo exaggerat persecutorum malitiam. Secundo commemorat propriam  iustitiam, ibi, <I>Domine quis habitabit.</I> Tertio propter suam  iustitiam petit exauditionis efficaciam, ibi, <I>Exaudi Domine</I>  etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>In  the first part he does two things. First, he asks for his liberation.  Second, he gives thanks for his liberation: and this in <I>Psalm 17: I  will love thee, O Lord.</I> With respect to the first, he does three  things. First, he magnifies in words the malice of his persecutors.  Second, he commemorates proper justice, whence, <I>The Lord liveth</I>  (Psalm 14). Third, he asks for the effectiveness of a hearing on account  of his justice, whence, <I>I called upon the Lord</I> (Psalm  16).
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Circum primum duo facit. Primum reprehendit adversariorum doliositatem.  Secundo arguit eorem iniquitatem, ibi, <I>Dixit insipiens</I>. Circa  primum duo facit. Primo commemorat dolositatem eorem. Secundo petit  divinum lumen, ne ab eis illaqueetur, ibi, <I>Usquequo Domine.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>With  respect to the first, he does two things. First he reproves the deceit of  his adversaries. Second, he declares their iniquity, at, <I>The fool  saith</I> (Psalm 13). With respect to the first, he does two things.  First, he recounts their deceit. Second, he asks for the divine light,  lest he be ensnared by them, whence, <I>How long, O Lord</I> (Psalm  12).
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Hoc  etiam satis competit quantum ad historiam David, contra quem Saul dolose  procedebat. Praemittit autem huic psalmo talem titulum, <I>In finem pro  octava psalmus David</I>, quod expositum est supra. Circa primum tria  facit. Primo describit commemorationem dolositatis eorum. Secundo petit  eorum destructionem, ibi, <I>Disperdat Dominus</I>. Tertio ponit rationis  exauditionem, ibi, <I>Propter miseriam</I> etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>And  this fits with the story of David, against whom Saul advanced with deceit.  He gives such a title, <I>Unto the end; for the octave, a psalm for  David,</I> to this Psalm, whose explanation is above. With respect to the  first he does three things. First, he gives a descriptive account of their  deceit. Second, he asks for their destruction, whence, <I>May the Lord  destroy.</I> Third, he describes the [Lord's] hearing of [the Psalmist's]  account, at, <I>By reason of the misery</I> etc.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Circa primum duo facit. Primo describit eorum defectum. Secundo subdit  defectus signum, ibi, <I>Vana locuti sunt</I>. Circa primum sciendum est  quod David considerans malitiam adversarii contra se invalescentum, quasi  stupefactus, primo recurrit ad divinum auxilium dicens, <I>Domine salvum  me fac.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>With  respect to the first, he does two things. First, he describes their  failing. Second, he adds the sign of their failing, at, <I>They have  spoken vain things.</I> With respect to the first, one should know that  when David, considering the malice of his enemy against him when he was  powerless, as if he was stupefied, first had recourse to the divine aid,  saying, <I>Save me O Lord.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Et  merito: quia propter eum non est salvator, ut dicitur <I>Isa</I>. <I>45.  </I>Secundo enumerat eorum defectus. Duo autem praeservant hominem a malo,  scilicet timor Dei: <I>Eccl. 2. Qui timet Deum, custodiet mandata  illius</I>: et amor vertitatis, quia scilicet recta opera dicuntur vera  quasi concordantia regulae: quae si non sint recta, pertinent ad infamiam.
<td style=text-align:justify>And,  quite correctly: for, he is not a savior on his own account, as is said at  <I>Isaias 45.</I> Second, he enumerates their failing. For there are two  things that preserve a human being from evil, namely, the fear of God -  <I>Ecclesiasticus 2: They that fear the Lord, keep his Commandments -</I>  and the love of truth, because upright works are said to be true as if by  a concordance with a rule: and if they are not upright, they lead to  infamy.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Aliqui enim etsi propter timorem Dei mala non vitent, retrahuntur tamen  ab eis propter infamiam. Sed aliquis nec infamiam timet: unde dicitur  <I>Luc. 18</I>. de quodam qui <I>Nec Deum timet nec hominem reveretur</I>.  Et ista duo excludit ab adversariis Psalmista. Primo quidem timorem Dei,  cum dicit, <I>Quoniam defecit sanctus</I>: sanctitas enim in timore et  cultu Dei consistit. Unde et divino cultui dedicata sancta dicuntur; quasi  dicat, Non invenitur in hoc mundo homo qui Deum timeat: <I>Mich. 7. Periit  sanctus de terra, et rectus in hominibus non est</I>. Secundo excludit  veritatis amorem cum dicit, <I>Quoniam diminutae</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>But,  if some people do not shun evil because of the fear of God, still they are  held back from it because of the infamy. But some other people do not fear  infamy: whence it is said at <I>Luke 18</I> of he <I>who feared not God,  nor regarded man.</I> And the Psalmist excludes these two things from his  adversaries. First, the fear of God, when he says, <I>For there is now no  holy person:</I> for sanctity consists in the fear and worship of God. And  for this reason holy things are said to be those dedicated to the worship  of God; as if to say, "there is no man found in this world who would fear  God - <I>Micheas 7: The holy man is perished out of the earth, and there  is none upright among men.</I> Second, he excludes the love of truth when  he says, <I>Truths are diminished.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Sed quaerendum est, quare dicit, <I>veritates</I> in plurali:  <I>Osee 4. Non est veritas Dei in terra.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>But one must ask why he says <I>truths</I> in the plural:  <I>Hosea 4: There is no knowledge of God in the land. </I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Ad quod dicendum est, quod una est primordalis veritas, quae est  in intellectu divino: <I>Io. 14. Ego sum via, veritas, et vita</I>. Sicut  autem ab una facie hominis diversae simultudines resultant in diversis  speculis, et in uno similiter speculo fracto, ita in diversis animabus ab  una veritate divina diversae veritates resultant. Et similiter in una  anima, quia non attingit ad simplicitatem divinam, sed est composita, ex  quo est, et quod est, apparent ab illa una veritate qua sancta anima  illustratur, diversae veritates: quae quidem veritates, cum anima recedit  a Deo per culpas, diminuuntur.
<td style=text-align:justify>To  which it is to be said that the primordial truth, the one in the divine  intellect, is one: <I>John 14: I am the way, and the truth, and the life.  </I>But, just as different appearances occur in different mirrors from the  aspect of one man, and similarly in one mirror broken into pieces,  likewise in different souls different truths result from one divine truth.  And in like wise in a single soul, because it does not attain the divine  simplicity, but rather is composite, and for this reason, different truths  appear from that single truth by which the saintly soul is illuminated:  and indeed these truths, when the soul withdraws from God, are  diminished.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Vel  dicendum, quod dicit veritates, propter triplicem veritatem creatam quae  est in sanctis, scilicet vitae, de qua <I>Isa. 38. Memento quomodo  ambulaverim coram te in veritate</I>. Doctrinae: <I>Mat. 21. Scimus quia  verax es, et viam Dei in veritate doces</I>. Et justitiae, de qua <I>Exo.  18. Provide de omni plebe viros potentes et timentes Deum, in quibus sit  veritas</I>. De ista veritate videtur loqui psalmus iste, scilicet de  veritate iustitiae; a qua quidem recessit Saul cum persequeretur ipsum  David iniuste.
<td style=text-align:justify>Or,  it is to be said that he says truths on account of the threefold created  truth that is in holy people, namely, of life, of which, <I>Isaias 38: O  Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect  heart.</I> Of doctrine: <I>Matthew 22: We know that thou art a true  speaker, and teachest the way of God in truth. </I>And of justice, of  which <I>Exodus 18: And provide out of all the people able men, such as  fear God, in whom there is truth. </I>It is apparent that the psalmist  speaks of this truth, namely, of the truth of justice; from which Saul  withdrew when he unjustly persecuted David himself.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Dicendum ergo est, quod huiusmodi veritates diminutatae sunt non a  seipsis, sed, <I>A filius hominum</I>, per quorum culpas depravantur. Et  quidem veritas vitae diminuitur, quando bonum iudicatur malum. Doctrinae,  quando lux dicitur tenebrae. Veritas vero iustitia, quando amarum  iudicitur dulce: et e converso: <I>Isa. 5. Vae qui dicitis bonum malum, et  malum bonum: ponentes lucem tenebras, et tenebram lucem: pontentes amarum  dulce, et dulce amarum</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>Therefore it must be said that truths of this sort are not diminished  from their own nature but rather<I> from among the children of men,</I>  who are made depraved by their own fault. And the truth of life is  diminished, when the good is judged to be evil. Of doctrine, when light is  said to be shadow. And the truth of justice, when the bitter is judged  sweet: and conversely - <I>Isaias 5: Woe to you that call evil good, and  good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put  bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. </I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Dicit autem sanctitatem deficere, quia sit a Deo recessus per  gratium, statim tollitur unico peccato mortali. Veritas autem quasi  successive diminuitur: Hieronymus habet, <I>Quoniam deficit  misericors</I>: et quoniam diminuti sunt fideles, quia misericordia et  iustitia requiruntur ad proximum: <I>Proverb. 20. Virum autem fidelum quis  inveniet? </I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>And sanctity is said to be diminished, because when it is  bestowed by God through grace, it is immediately borne away by a single  mortal sin. But truth is diminished, as it were, successively: Jerome has  <I>There is no one who shows pity.</I> For the faithful are diminished,  because pity and justice towards one's neighbor are required - <I>Proverbs  20: But who shall find a faithful man? </I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>b.</B> Consequentur cum dicit <I>Vana,</I> ponit signum defectus  sanctitatis; et est duplex, scilicet vanitas et dolositas. Primum signum  defectis est vanitas: et quantum ad hoc dicit, <I>Vana locuti sunt</I>  etc. Vanum est quod non habent subsisteniam. Vera ergo quibus nihil  vanitatis subest, sunt: unde <I>1. Tim. 1. Finis praecepti est charitas de  corde puro, de conscientia bona, et fide non ficta: a qua quidem  aberrantes conversi sunt in vaniloquium: Hier. 9. Ununquisque a proximo  suo se custodiat</I>: Gregorius: <I>Sermo vanus, vanue mentis index est.  </I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Consequently, when he says, <I>Vain things,</I> he sets forth the  sign of the diminishment of sanctity: and this is twofold, namely, vanity  and deceit. And the first sign of diminishment is vanity: and he says with  respect to this, <I>They have spoken vain things. </I>A vain thing is that  which does not have subsistence. And those things are true, therefore,  below which there is nothing of vanity: whence <I>1. Timothy 1: Now the  end of the commandment is charity, from a pure heart, and a good  conscience, and an unfeigned faith: From which things some going astray,  are turned aside unto vain babbling: Jeremias 9: Let every man take heed  of his neighbor.</I> And Gregory: <I>Vain talk is the herald of a vain  mind.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Item  vanum est quod intellectu non tenetur: etiam superflua verba vana sunt:  <I>Prov. 14. Ubi plurima verba, ibi frequenter egestas</I>. Item vanum est  quod non est stabile: et sic verba de temporalibus vana sunt: <I>Io. 3.  Qui de terra est, de terra loquitur: Isa. 29. De humo mussitabit eloquium  tuum: </I>sed ad quem loquuntur vana? <I>Ad proximum</I>, cui debent  dicere verum: <I>Eph. 4. Loquimini unusquisque veritatem cum proximo  suo</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>Likewise something vain is that which is not retained by the intellect:  so, superfluous words are vain - <I>Proverbs 14: But where there are many  words, there is oftentimes want. </I>Again, a vain thing is something that  is not stable: and so talk about temporal matters is vain -<I> John 3: He  that is of the earth, of the earth he is, and of the earth he speaketh;  Isaias 29: And thy speech shall be heard out of the ground:</I> But to  whom does one speak vain words? <I>To his neighbor,</I> to whom they  should speak the truth - <I>Ephesians 3: Speak ye the truth every man with  his neighbour.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Secundum signum defectus sanctitatis est dolositas; et quantum ad  hoc dicit, <I>Labia dolosa in corde, et corde locuti sunt</I>. Geminatio  duplex cor significat. Ostendunt autem ore se habere unum, corde autem  habent aliud. Ostendunt se dolere, et gaudent diligere, et odiunt compati,  et laetantur: <I>Iam. 1. Vir duplex animo inconstans est in omnibus viis  suis: Eccl. 2. Vae duplici corce et labiis sceletis.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Deceit, in the way of a sign, is the diminishment of sanctity;  and he says, with respect to this, <I>With deceitful lips, and with a  double heart have they spoken.</I> A double heart signifies a doubling [of  something]. For they display to the ear one thing, but they have another  in the heart. They appear to be afflicted, and they enjoy loving, and they  hate to commiserate , and they rejoice - <I>James 1: A double minded man  is inconstant in all his ways;</I> <I>Ecclesiasticus 2: Woe to them that  are of a double heart and to wicked lips.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>c.</B> <I>Disperdat.</I> Hic petit destructionem eorum. Et primo  petit eam. Secundo innuit causam, ibi, <I>Universa labia</I> etc. quasi  bis perdat, scilicet in anima et corpore: <I>Hier. 17. Induc super eos  diem afflictionis, et duplici contritione contere eos Domine Deus</I>.  Consequentur ponit causam malitiae eorum: et ponit tria, scilicet  fraudulentiam, quia, <I>Labia dolosa</I>: est enim dolus, cum quis aliud  agit et aliud simulat. Dolus in corde concipitur, sed tegitur verbis, vel  factis: <I>Prov. 12. Dolus in corde cogitantium mala</I>. Hos dispergit  Deus, quoniam detegit: tunc enim non habet rationem doli, dolus enim est  occulta malitia. Unde non petit eorum destructionem, sed malitiae  detectionem.
<td style=text-align:justify><I>May the Lord destroy.</I> Here, he asks for their destruction. And  first he asks this thing. Second, he states the reason, whence, <I>All  deceitful lips</I> etc. as if the Lord doubly destroys them, namely in  soul and in body - <I>Jeremias 17: Bring upon them the day of affliction,  and with a double destruction, destroy them, O Lord God.</I> Consequently,  he sets down the cause of their malice: and he sets three things down,  namely, their fraudulence, because, <I>Deceitful lips:</I> for there is  deceit, when somebody does one thing and feigns another thing. He  conceives deceit in his heart, but he covers this with words, or with  deeds - <I>Proverbs 12: Deceit is in the heart of them that think evil  things. </I>"God scatters them because he makes them known: for then their  deceit does not have the nature of deceit, for deceit is a hidden malice..  Whence he does not ask for their destruction, but for the uncovering of  their malice.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Vel  petit eorum perditionem per gratiam: <I>Prov. 19. Pestilente flagellato  stultus sapientior erit;</I> unde dicit, <I>Labia dolosa</I>. Glossa,  <I>quasi ratio petitionis est dolositas.</I> Vel <I>disperdat eos,</I>  quasi de malitia puniendo, ut ipsi in ea incidant, insto Dei iudicio, ut  de Aman dicitur <I>Esther. 7. </I>contra Mardochaeum. Suspensus est Aman  in patibulo quod paraverat Maradochaeo: <I>Ezech. 3. Linguam tuam  adhaerere faciam palato tuo: et eris mutus quasi non audiens ulterius  fraudes facere: Prov. 21. Multato pestilente sapientior est parvulus.</I>  Item <I>22. Stultitia colligita est in corde pueri, et virga disciplinae  fugabit eam.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify>Or  he asks for their perdition by grace - <I>Proverbs 19: The wicked man  being scourged, the fool shall be wiser: </I>Whence he says, <I>deceitful  lips.</I> The Gloss adds, <I>as if the reason for his entreaty is their  treachery.</I> Or, <I>may they be destroyed,</I> as if by punishing  malice, so that they should fall into those things, by the just judgement  of God, as is said to have happened to Aman (at<I>Esther 7</I>) against  Maradochai. Aman was hanged from the same gallows that he had prepared for  Marodochai - <I>Ezechiel 3: And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the  roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that  reproveth; Proverbs 21: When a pestilent man is punished, the little one  will be wiser.</I> And, <I>22: Folly is bound up in the heart of a child,  and the rod of correction shall drive it away.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Secundo ponit iactantiam, <I>Et linguam magniloquiam</I>, de se  apud nos, qui eos magnos reputant: <I>Ps. 72. Posuerunt in caelum os suum,  et lingua eorum transvit in terram.</I> Illud autem quod est maius in alio  consuevimus revereri, et quod minus non reputare. Ut ergo appareat magni,  et Deo aequales, contemnunt Deum, idest divinos honores.
<td style=text-align:justify>Second, he sets down their vainglory, <I>the tongue that speaketh proud  things,</I> concerning themselves before us, who repute them to be great  men - <I>Psalm 72: They have set their mouth against heaven: and their  tongue hath passed through the earth.</I> But we are accustomed to revere  that which is greater in another, and not to reckon that which is lesser.  So that, therefore, those who appear to be great men, and equals to God,  despise God, that is, the divine honors.
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Sic  de Antichristo dicitur, quod adversus Deum deorum loquitur: <I>2. The. 2.  Adversatur et extollitur super omne quod dicitur Deus et colitur, ita ut  in templo Dei sedeat, ostendens se quasi ipse sit Deus</I>. Et de Antioco  <I>2. Mach. 9. Iustum est subditum esse Deo, et mortalem Deo non paria  sentire</I>: et <I>Act. 12.</I> de Herode, <I>quod acclamabat ei populus  voces Dei et non hominis</I>. Et ne possent excussari, quod non est  proposito fecerunt, subdit, <I>Qui dixerunt</I>, scilicet ex proposito,  <I>Linguam nostram magnificabimus</I>.
<td style=text-align:justify>Thus  it is said of the Antichrist, that he speaks of gods instead of God - <I>2  Thessalonians 2: Who opposeth, and is lifted up above all that is called  God, or that is worshipped, so that he sitteth in the temple of God,  shewing himself as if he were God. </I>And of Antiochus, <I>2 Machabees 9:  It is just to be subject to God, and that a mortal man should not equal  himself to God;</I> and <I>Acts 12</I> of Herod, <I>And the people made  acclamation, saying: It is the voice of a god, and not of a man.</I> And  lest they be able to be excused, since they did not do what they proposed,  he adds, <I>Who have said,</I> namely, what they proposed, <I>We will  magnify our tongue.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify>Tertio ponit eorum blasphemiam sive superbiam, <I>Labia nostra a nobis  sunt</I>. Haec est enim prima species superbiae, quando quis aestimat se  habere a semetipso: <I>1. Reg. 2. Nolite multiplicare loqui sublimia,  gloriantes: 2. Cor. 3. Non sumus sufficientes cogitare aliquid a nobis,  quasi ex nobis, sed sufficientia nostra a Deo est</I>. Secunda species  superbiae est, quando aliquis vult in aliquo gloriari prae ceteris; unde  dicit, <I>Quis noster Dominus est: Iob. 21. Quis est omnipotens ut  serviamus ei? Osee. 7. Reversis sunt ut essent absque iugo, et facti sunt  quasi arcus dolosus: Iob. 11. Vir vanus in superbiam erigitur, et quasi  pullum onagri se liberum natum putat.</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I></I>Third, he sets down their blasphemy or pride,<I> Our lips are our  own.</I> And this is the first species of pride, when somebody considers  that he is in his circumstances simply by his own nature - <I>1 Kings 2:  Do not multiply to speak lofty things, boasting; 2 Cor. 3: Not that we are  sufficient to think any thing of ourselves, as of ourselves: but our  sufficiency is from God.</I> The second species of pride is when someone  wants to be glorified in some thing above all others; whence he says,  <I>Who is Lord over us? -</I> <I>Job 21: Who is the Almighty, that we  should serve him? Osee 7: They returned, that they might be without yoke:  they became like a deceitful bow; Job 11: A vain man is lifted up into  pride, and thinketh himself born free like a wild ass's  colt.</I>
<tr valign=top>
<td style=text-align:justify><B>d.</B> <I>Propter.</I> Hic tertio ponit orationis exauditionem. Et  primo praemittit. Secundo ponit eius certitudinem, ibi, <I>Eloquia Domini.  </I>Tertio ponit suam credulitatem, ibi, <I>Tu Domine</I>. Dicit ergo,  <I>Propter miseriam</I>, idest multiplicem defectum: <I>Inopem</I>, idest  carentium opibus: <I>Et gemitum</I>, idest singultus: <I>Pauperum</I>,  idest parum habentium: <I>Psal. 9.

<td style=text-align:justify><I>By reason of.</I> Here he sets down three things concerning the  audience of his prayer. And first, he promises. Second, he sets down his  certainty, whence, <I>The words of the Lord.</I> Third, he sets down his  credulity, whence, <I>Thou, O Lord.</I> Therefore he says,<I> By reason of  the misery,</I> that is, the manifold diminishment: <I>Of the needy,</I>  that is, those lacking wealth: <I>And the groans,</I> that is, the  sobbing: <I>Of the poor,</I> that is, of those having but little -  <I>Psalm 9: And the Lord is become a refuge for the poor; Exodus 2: He  heard their groaning and remembered the covenant.</I>

<td style=text-align:justify><I>Nunc exurgam dicit Dominus</I>. Nunc in tempore opportuno: <I>Psal.  9. Adiutor in opportunatibus in tribulatione: Isa. 49. Tempore accepto  exaudivi te, et in die salutis adivi te. Ponam in salutari tuo</I>, idest  apponam: <I>Fiducialiter agam in eo</I>, idest ego ero in eo: <I>Hier. 1.  Ne timeas a facis eorum, quia ego tecum sum: Isa. 14. Dominus exercitum  decrevit, et quis poterit infirmare? Manus eius extenta, et quis avertet  eam? Hiere. 1. Bellabunt adversum te, et non praevalebunt, quia tecum sum  ut liberem te</I>. Et <I>29. Erit tibi anima tua in salutem, quia in me  habuisti fiduciam, ait Dominus</I>
<td style=text-align:justify><I>Now I will arise, saith the Lord. </I>Now, at the opportune time -  <I>Psalm 9: A helper in due time in tribulation; Isaias 49: Thus saith the  Lord: In an acceptable time I have heard thee, and in the day of salvation  I have helped thee: I will set him in safety, </I>that is, "I will  appoint": <I>I will deal confidently toward him</I>, that is, I will  myself be with him - <I>Jeremias 1: Be not afraid at their presence: for I  am with thee to deliver thee; Isaias 14: For the Lord of hosts hath  decreed, and who can disannul it? and his hand is stretched out: and who  shall turn it away? Jeremias 1: And they shall fight against thee, and  shall not prevail: for I am with thee, saith the Lord, to deliver thee.  </I>And <I>Jeremias 39: but thy life shall be saved for thee, because thou  hast put thy trust in me, saith the Lord.</I>

<td style=text-align:justify>Consequenter ponit promissionis certitudinem, <I>Eloquia Domini, eloquia  casta</I>: non adultera per admixtionem alicuius extranei, vel castigate a  superfluitate, vel incorrupta, quia castus quis dicitur ante experientiam,  sed continens post. Non vana, sed firma. <I>Matt. 24. Caelum et terra  transibunt, verba autem mea non transibunt. </I>Secundo sunt plena  veritate, unde, <I>Argentum igne examinatum</I>. Argentum est album sine  maculatione, sonorem sine simulatione, odoriferum sine infectione.  <I>Probatum terrae</I>, idest a terrae.
<td style=text-align:justify>Consequently he establishes the certainty of the promise, <I>The words  of the Lord are pure words: </I>not adulterated by the mixture of anything  extraneous, but rather purified of the superfluous, or uncorrupted,  because one is pure who is not only said to be so before the test, but  also firm after the test. Not vain words, but solid words - <I>Matthew 24:  Heaven and earth shall pass, but my words shall not pass. </I>Second, they  are full of truth; whence, <I>As silver tested by the fire.</I> Silver is  the white without blemish, the resounding voice without insincerity, the  fragrant without putridity. <I>Purged from the earth,</I> that is, of the  dirt.

<td style=text-align:justify>Graeci autem ablativo carent. Haec autem est translatio de Graeco.  <I>Purgatum septuplum</I>, idest perfecte. Et respondet propheta,  <I>Tu</I> ergo <I>Domine servabis nos</I>, a malo, <I>Et custodies nos</I>  in bono <I>a generatione hac aeternum</I>. Ergo <I>In circitu impii  ambulant</I>, ita quod ad finem itineris quem intendunt, nunquam venient,  scilicet ut affligant alios, sicut volunt: <I>Isa. 59. Semitae eorum  incurvatae in eis.</I> Et quare? quia, <I>Secundem altitudinem tuam  multiplicatisti filios hominum</I>, quia in domo mea non solum sunt vase  aurea et argentea, sed lignea et fictilia: et quaedem quidem in honorem  sanctificata ad omne opus bonum parata, <I>2 Tim. 2. </I>Vel <I>In  circitu,</I> vitiorum, <I>ambulant impii, </I>non pertingentes ad medium  virtutis: <I>1. Reg. 25. Anima inimicorum tuorum rotabitur</I>  etc.
<td style=text-align:justify>For  the Greeks lacked the ablative case. And this is a translation from the  Greek. <I>Refined seven times,</I> that is to perfection. And the prophet  responds, <I>Thou</I> therefore<I> O Lord wilt preserve us,</I> from evil,  <I>And keep us</I> in the good <I>from this generation forever.</I>  Therefore, <I>The wicked walk round about,</I> thus they never will come  to the end of the walking that they intend, namely, that they might  afflict other people, just as they will to do - <I>Isaias 59: Their paths  are become crooked to them.</I> And why is this? Because, <I>According to  thy highness, thou best multiplied the children of men, </I>for in my  house there are not only golden and silver vases, but also wooden and  earthen ones: and certain of them are even sanctified to honor and  prepared for every good work - <I>Timothy 2.</I> Or, <I>round about,</I>  viciously, <I>the wicked walk,</I> not keeping to the mean of virtue -  <I>1 Kings 25: But the souls of thy enemies shall be  whirled.</I></TABLE>
