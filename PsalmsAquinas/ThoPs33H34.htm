        Historia haec habetur 1 Reg. 21, ubi dicitur, quod David fugiens a facie

        ejus, quia occiderat Philistaeum; et timens ex hoc sibi periculum
        imminere, quia illi erant de genere Philistinorum, et etiam propter
        virtutis suae invidiam, voluit hoc vitare, et finxit se fatuum, et sic
        rex ille contempsit eum. Totum hoc habetur 1 Reg. 21; nisi quod nomen
        non consonat, quia ibi rex vocatur Achis, hic vero Abimelech. Nec est
        inconveniens, vel quia binomius fuit, vel quia Achis nomine, sed de
        genere Abimelech. Unde mutavit vultum ostendendo se fatuum, et dimisit
        eum et abiit, quia David ejectus ab eo abiit, et recessit.

      <td style="text-align: justify">
        The history of this psalm is found in 1 Kings 21, where it is said that
        David fled from the face of Saul and went to Achis the king of Geth.
        There his strength was recognized since the people of Geth knew he had
        slain the Philistine. Now these people were related to the Philistines
        and moreover were envious of David's strength, so David feared for his
        life. Thus, wishing to extricate himself out of this situation, he
        feigned insanity, which led the king to hold him in contempt. The
        account in 1 Kings 21 calls the king Achis, but here in this psalm he is
        named Abimelech. But this is not a problem since that king could claim
        both names: his personal name was Achis, but his family name was
        Abimelech. Now David changed his appearance by making himself look
        absurd. Thus the king sent him away and he left, for after being ejected
        David left him and withdrew.

        Mystice Christus mutavit vultum suum, quando mutavit sacramentum suum,

        paschale mutavit in novum coram Abimelech, qui interpretatur patris mei
        regnum. Pater Christi Deus secundum divinitatem, David vero secundum
        humanitatem. Regnum David est populus Judaeorum, regnum Dei est
        ecclesia. Christus vero mutavit vultum suum coram Abimelech, idest coram
        Judaeis, quia erant regnum patris sui David, qui non cognoverunt eum:
        Isa. 53: vidimus eum, et non erat aspectus: et contempserunt eum: unde
        nec reputavimus eum. Et abiit ad gentes. Vel Achis<br />

      <td style="text-align: justify">
        In the mystical sense Christ changed his appearance when he changed his
        own sacrament, where the divine truth was hidden. In another way Christ
        changed the old paschal sacrament into the new in the presence of
        Abimelech, whose name means reign of my father. The Father of Christ is
        God according to His divinity, but David according to His humanity. The
        reign of David is the people of Judea, whereas the reign of God is the
        Church. Thus it may also be said that Christ changed his appearance in
        the presence of Abimelech, understood to be the Jews. For they were the
        reign of his father David, yet they did not know him. As Isaiah 53 says:
        <i
          >We saw him and he was not worth looking upon. And they held him in
          contempt, nor did we give him the slightest regard.</i
        >
        Christ also left for the gentiles. Achis could also signify the Jews,
        since his name means incredulous.

        So now taking each division in its turn, he says first of all
        <i>May I bless the lord</i>. Sometimes a person praises God for his own
        benefit, as when he speaks his praise in tongues. In that case the act
        of praise benefits only himself. But sometimes praise is spoken in order
        to console others, as when one prophesies among others. Thus there is a
        difference between <i>benedicere domino</i>, which is to confess the
        praise of God, and <i>benedicere dominum</i>, which is to do a good
        deed.

        In omni tempore, scilicet adversitatis et prosperitatis. Contra Psal.
        48: confitebitur tibi cum benefeceris ei: sed non sic faciebat Job 2: si
        bona suscepimus de manu Domini, mala autem etc.. Tob. 4: omni tempore
        benedic Deum. Item oportet ut non solum in se, scilicet in corde suo
        quis benedicat Deum, sed etiam quod laudem ejus habeat in ore.
        Necessitas enim laudis vocalis est, ut non solum laudes Deum, sed etiam
        ad utilitatem et provocationem aliorum laudes eum. Unde dicit, laus ejus
        in ore meo: Isa. 51: gaudium et laetitia invenietur in ea, gratiarum
        actio, et vox laudis. Semper, autem dicit, idest in omni statuto
        tempore. Vel in praeparatione animi. Vel semper benefaciendo, ex quo
        Deus semper laudatur. Nota quod hic versiculus cantatur in sexta, quando
        Christus passus est, cujus passio est nobis causa laudis.

      <td style="text-align: justify">
        Then he says
        <i>at all times,</i>
        namely in times of adversity and prosperity. Contrast this with what
        Psalm 48 describes:
        <i>He will confess your name when you bless him.</i>
        Job (2) did the opposite:
        <i
          >If we receive goods things from the lord's hand, should we not also
          receive the bad?</i
        >
        And Tobit (4):
        <i>At all times bless God.</i>
        Now the one who praises God should not only bless God in his heart but
        also in his mouth. For vocal praise is necessary so that you may not
        only praise God but also be of help and encouragement to others. This is
        why he says,
        <i>His praise is in my mouth.</i>
        Thus also Isaiah 51:
        <i
          >Joy and delight will be found in it, thanksgiving, and the voice of
          praise.</i
        >
        He says
        <i>always</i>, meaning in every established time. He may also mean to be
        prepared in soul. He may even mean always doing good, which always
        redounds to the praise of God. Notice that this verse is sung at Sext,
        the hour of Christ's passion, which is in us the cause of praise.

        the good of the friend is always taken to be one's own good. Thus, he
        says
        <i>in the praise of God is also my own praise.</i>
        If God is great, then it holds that his friend is great. As in Psalm
        117:
        <i>My courage and my praise is the lord.</i>
        He says
        <i>my soul</i>
        because spiritual joy lies principally there.

        he instructs them on the act of praise itself. The principle of praise
        is interior joy. Hence he says
        <i>let the gentle listen.</i>
        Thus they will rejoice in all things that are of God. But the violent do
        not rejoice; they rebel. And so he says
        <i>let them listen</i>, since this kind of joy comes from hearing about
        the good deeds of others.

        <i>magnify</i>, he urges others to praise. First to an interior praise,
        then to an exterior, when he says

        On the first point he says
        <i>magnify the lord with me</i>, that is, magnify and praise God, since
        God's goodness and greatness are the same. For in those things whose
        greatness is not of size, to be greater is to be better, as Augustine
        argues in <i>De Trinitate</i>. Thus he says
        <i>magnify,</i>
        as does Luke 1:
        <i>my soul magnifies the lord</i>. This echoes what he said earlier:
        <i>May I bless the lord.</i>
        On the second point he says
        <i>and let us exalt his name</i>. Now one is said to be exalted up high
        when many exalt, as Ecclesiasticus says:
        <i>all you glorifying God, exalt Him, as much as you can,</i>
        etc. He then says
        <i>in the selfsame</i>, meaning together in harmony. And this echoes
        what he said earlier:
        <i>His praise is in my mouth.</i>

        So first of all he says
        <i>I have sought the lord.</i>
        To see the lord Himself is the best of choices, as the lord's Prayer
        makes clear in its first petition:
        <i>Hallowed be Thy Name</i>. This is also confirmed in Isaiah 55:
        <i>seek the lord while he may be found.</i>
        Therefore, he says
        <i>I have sought</i>, as if to say, I have sought with great diligence.
        And thus follows the hearkening:
        <i>and he heard me.</i>
        The effect of the hearkening is that
        <i>from my all tribulations he rescued me.</i>
        For sometimes he rescued the just from tribulations such that they would
        suffer no tribulations whatsoever, as in Job 5:
        <i
          >in six tribulations he will rescue you, and in the seventh evil will
          not touch you.</i
        >
        Sometimes he rescues the just so that they are not greatly troubled, as
        expressed in Psalm 93:
        <i
          >as many sorrows as there are in my heart, so many of your
          consolations have gladdened my soul</i
        >. 2 Corinthians 1 also expresses this:
        <i>the one who consoles us in every one of our tribulations</i>. This
        interior consolation always belongs to the saints. Moreover, he also
        rescues external relations, thus evil can never separate the saints from
        Christ, as expressed in Romans 8:
        <i>who will separate us from the charity of Christ?</i>

        [6] Then when he says

        others to attain the benefit of praise. On this point he does two
        things: he first invites; second he describes what will come to pass for
        those who accept the invitation, when he says
        <i>and your faces will not be confused.</i>
        Therefore he says
        <i>approach him</i>, through faith and charity, as James 4 says:
        <i>come close to God and he will come close to you.</i>
        Then he adds
        <i>and be enlightened.</i>
        God is light and one who approaches the light will be illuminated.
        Isaiah 60:
        <i>Rise up</i>

        <i>and be enlightened.</i>
        Deuteronomy 33:
        <i>The man who sits at his feet will receive his teaching.</i>
        Now the result of this invitation is that
        <i>your faces will not be confused</i>
        by being refused. In other words, you will not suffer confusion
        <i>because there is none in those hoping in him</i>
        (Daniel 3). Or in another interpretation,
        <i>your faces</i>, that is, your minds, will not be confused by falling

        [7] Then when he says

        second he promises a similar benefit to others, when he says
        <i>the angel encamps;</i>
        third he urges an experience, when he says

        Therefore first he says

        verse <i>I have sought</i>. Only the modes of speech differ: in the

        speaks in the third person. So the only question is: who is this poor
        man? The Psalmist could be either pointing to himself or to Christ. In
        saying <i>poor man</i>, he hints at the merit of the petition: for the
        poor man is poor in spirit, or poor in pride, or poor in earthly
        desires. And such people get heard, as Judith 9 attests:
        <i>the prayer of the humble and gentle are always pleasing to you.</i>
        And Psalm 32:
        <i>he regarded the prayer of the humble</i>, etc. He cried out with the

        the senses but in different ways, depending on whether the object is
        close or at some distance. If it is removed at a distance, then the
        experience of it comes through sight, smell or hearing. If it is close,
        then touch and taste come into play, but each in its own way. For touch
        senses the outside of the object, whereas taste senses the inside. Now
        God is not far from us nor outside us, but rather He is in us, as
        Jeremiah 14 says:
        <i>You are in us, O lord.</i>

        for those remaining in it. Ecclesiasticus 27:

        Causam autem quare timendum est, subdit, quoniam non est inopia
        timentibus eum. Hoc exponitur multipliciter. Primo de inopia
        spiritualium bonorum: Isa. 33: divitiae salutis sapientia et scientia;
        timor Domini ipse thesaurus ejus. Si ergo timor Domini thesaurus est,
        non est inopia timentibus eum. Item de inopia corporali. Contingit

        inopem. Inops est qui se deficientem reputat: qui timent Deum sunt

        The Psalmist himself adds the reason why one should fear God:
        <i>for there is no want among those who fear him.</i>
        Now this can be explained in several ways. First there is no lack of
        spiritual goods, as Isaiah 33 says:
        <i
          >wealth of salvation, wisdom and knowledge; the fear of the lord is
          his treasure</i
        >. Second, there is no lack of bodily needs. For although one who fears
        God may at times possess very little, this does not mean that he is
        impoverished. The destitute may think themselves failures, but those who
        fear God are content with what they have, as expressed in Phillipians 4:
        <i>everywhere and in all things I am provided for,</i>
        etc. Third, God succors those seeking Him in times of necessity.

        Augustine replies that God is both nourisher and doctor, and a doctor
        takes food away from a sick man, making him to hunger and thirst, for
        the sake of healing him. Thus also God, for the sake of our salvation,

        addresses when he says <i>seek after</i>, etc. On the first point he

        mind only a negation. For avoiding evil only in order to avoid the
        punishment consequent upon doing the evil is not the way to acquire
        life. Thus it follows that avoiding evil is merits nothing if the will
        is not formed in charity, which turns away from evil for the sake of

        He says therefore
        <i>the eyes of the lord</i>, etc. Concerning people under our care or
        authority, we attend to two things: to their deeds with our eyes (which
        the Psalmist touches on at <i>the eyes of the lord</i>), and to their
        words with our ears (at <i>and his ears</i>). Now although in God there
        is neither sight nor hearing, but only his wisdom, nevertheless because
        words and deeds are different, he is said to have both sight and
        hearing. The eyes signify the seeing of deeds, whereas the ears signify
        the hearing of words. Thus the Psalmist says
        <i>the eyes of the lord are upon the just</i>, that is, by a look of
        approval. 2 Timothy 2 states: <i>the lord knows his own</i>. And
        Ecclesiasticus 15:
        <i>the eyes of the lord are toward those who fear him</i>, etc.
        <i>And his ears</i>, signifying his intention to hear our their prayers.
        For whoever wishes to hear another out so as to understand, freely
        listens to that one's petitions. Thus, through this the Psalmist
        signifies that God wishes to hear. And he also says
        <i>unto their prayers</i>, because God hears while they are yet
        speaking, as Isaiah 65 says:
        <i>as they are yet speaking, I will hear them.</i>

        Now this can be understood in two ways. First it can refer to earth as
        it is now, and thus there are two ways to understand cutting off their
        memory: either the memory of them ceases to exist altogether or only the
        evil memory, as in Proverbs 10:
        <i>the name of the impious grows rotten</i>. Many wicked people try to
        have their memory preserved to no avail. However, if the memory of some
        of them does last, it can still be said to perish since it is rotten and
        evil. Psalm 9:
        <i>their memory perishes with a clamor.</i>
        Second, this can also refer to the land of the living. But do not the
        saints remember the impious? For if they did not recall the wicked
        things they suffered, why is it that
        <i>the just man will rejoice when he sees his vindication</i>
        (Psalm 57)? I respond: It needs to be said that they do indeed remember
        the wicked, but not unto good, since they do not recall any compassion
        or mercy from them, nor do they pray for them. As Luke 16 says:
        <i>there is fixed a great chasm</i>, etc. That is, even if they wished,
        they could not show mercy, for they are together with God, where they
        cannot will anything except what the justice of God has decreed. Isaiah
        26: <i>you have inflicted them, and have purged all memory of them</i>.

        for they pray for all eternity. As Matthew 6 says:

        <i>And the lord heard them</i>

        On the first of these he does two things, for there is a twofold merit

        He touches first on the merit of contrition of sins, and he does this at
        <i>the lord is near</i>, etc. As Psalm 144 says:
        <i>the lord is near to all who call upon him</i>. Now some people are
        truly in a miserable state and yet do not realize it and thus are not
        contrite. They do not receive mercy. As Apocalypse 3 says:
        <i
          >You say, "I am rich and getting richer, and have need of nothing."
          But you do not know you are poor, miserable and impoverished, blind
          and naked.</i
        >
        For it is necessary to recognize one's misery by heartfelt bemoaning.
        And so he said
        <i>to those who are troubled in heart</i>. This is the contrition of
        sins. As Isaiah 66 says:
        <i
          >Whom will I regard except the one poor and little and contrite of
          spirit</i
        >, etc. And Matthew 5:
        <i>blessed are those who mourn,</i>
        etc. The second thing about the merit of the just he mentions when he
        says
        <i>and the humble of spirit he will save.</i>
        He says of spirit and not of words, for as Ecclesiasticus 19 says:
        <i>there is one who wickedly humbles himself, and his interior</i>, etc.
        Therefore, the humble in spirit, who have true humility in their heart,
        will be saved. Proverbs 29:
        <i>He will raise up the humble in spirit.</i>

        dominus deus his ossibus: ecce ego intromittam spiritum in vos, et
        vivetis, et dabo super vos carnes. unum ex his non conteretur, quia in
        tribulationibus nulla virtus hominis deficit, quem deus custodit. non
        enim deficiebat caritas in sanctis per odium, quia pro persequentibus
        orabant; non mansuetudo per iram, quia non murmur resonabat: non
        patientia per injustitiam, immo in patientia sua possidebant animas
        suas. et ideo dicitur de agno paschali, os non confringetis ex eo, exod.
        12. ps. 36: cum ceciderit, non collidetur. vel, unum ex his, scilicet

        [19] Then when he says
        <i>the lord guards,</i>
        he shows how God liberates them, lest they succumb. He says therefore
        that
        <i>the lord guards all their bones</i>. Just as sight is in the eye, so
        also courage is in the bones and nerves. And so just as sight is
        signified through the image of the eye, so also courage and virtue
        through the image of bone. For bones hold up the body, just as virtue
        sustains human life. So while in the future he will completely free
        them, in the meantime he keeps their bones, that is, virtues, which
        shine in adversity. Another interpretation is that
        <i>bones</i>
        signifies perfect men, whom the lord guards. Ezechiel 37:
        <i
          >the lord God speaks to these bones, "Behold, I have sent my spirit
          unto you, and you will live, and I will clothe you with flesh</i
        >." <i>Not one among them will be broken</i>, for the one God keeps will
        have no virtue fail him in times of trouble. Charity, for example,
        prevailed against hatred in the saints, for they prayed for their
        persecutors. Meekness prevailed against anger, for there was no sound of
        complaint. Patience prevailed against injustice, for they in their
        suffering gained their own souls. Thus Exodus 12 says of the paschal
        lamb: <i>not a bone in it will you break</i>. Psalm 36:
        <i>when he falls, he will not be bruised</i>. Another interpretation is
        that
        <i>one of these</i>
        signifies the predestined, as in John 17:
        <i>not one among them will perish, except the son of perdition.</i>

        And so he says
        <i>the death</i>, meaning both bodily and spiritual. The bodily death is
        indeed the worst among the wicked, for they are sent to the worst place.
        As Luke 16 says: <i>the rich man died and was buried in Hell</i>.
        Another reason is that they lose the hope of grace after death. As
        Proverbs 11 says:
        <i>when the wicked man dies, there will be no hope</i>. Therefore the
        death of sinners is worst of all, for they die in both body and soul.
        Now concerning spiritual death, Ephesians 5 says:
        <i>rise up from the dead</i>. This state of the dead is the worst. For
        since death is the deprivation of life, the greater the good that gets
        deprived, the worse the death. But spiritual death deprives the soul of
        the life of grace, which is the best since it comes from God. As 1
        Corinthians 6 states:
        <i>the man who adheres to God is one spirit.</i>
        Therefore, such a death is the worst. Jerome holds that wickedness
        kills, that is, slays, the impious. This is the kind of wickedness that
        brings about death to sinners. As Romans 6 states:
        <i>the wages of sin is death</i>.

        And thus the Psalmist says
        <i>and those who hate the just are guilty</i>. As Proverbs 29 says:
        <i>bloodthirsty men hate the simplehearted</i>. If therefore the man who
        hates God commits sin, so also the one who hates the servants of God.

        [21] Then when he says
        <i>the lord will redeem</i>, he show how the good are freed from these
        dangers: first how they are freed from past sins and then how they are
        protected from future sins, at <i>and they will not sin</i>. He says
        therefore
        <i>the lord will redeem the souls of his servants.</i>
        Perhaps it may be objected that, if the death of sinners is the worst,
        then since no one is so just as not to have sinned, it follows that even
        the death of the just is the worst. To exclude this the Psalmist says
        <i>the lord will redeem the souls of his servants.</i>
        He will redeem the souls of his servants, in fact, by the price of his
        own death. Notice he does not say the souls of the free. For those who
        have been freed have shaken off the yoke of justice. As Romans 6 says:
        <i>freed from sin, made servants of God, what fruit did you have</i>,
        etc. Thus he says that these freemen have been made servants of God, but
        they are not redeemed. Only those who have shouldered the yoke of God
        are redeemed from guilt and punishment by the precious blood of Christ.
        As 1 Peter 1 says:
        <i
          >not by anything corruptible, like silver or gold, have you been
          redeemed from your empty life with the paternal tradition, but by the
          precious blood of Christ, an uncontaminated and immaculate lamb.</i

        even the virtuous fall. Thus Psalm 29:
