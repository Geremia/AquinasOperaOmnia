        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non.
          <td>It seems not, for
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Deum nemo vidit unquam; super quo dicit Chrysostomus: sed nec ipsae caelestes essentiae, ipsa dico Cherubim et Seraphim, ipsum ut est unquam videre potuerunt. Sed quicumque videt Deum per essentiam, videt ipsum ut est. Ergo Angelus non videt Deum per essentiam.
          <td>1. We read in the Gospel according to St. John (1:18): “No man has seen God at any time.” Commenting on this, Chrysostom writes: “Not even the heavenly essences themselves, I mean the cherubim and seraphim, were able to see God as He is.”’ But whoever sees God through His essence sees Him as He is. Angels, therefore, do not see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Exod. XXXIII, 11, super illud, loquebatur dominus ad Moysem facie ad faciem, etc., dicit Glossa: substantiam Dei nec hominum nec Angelorum quisquam, sicut est unquam videre potuit; et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>2. Commenting on that verse in Exodus (33:11), “And the Lord spoke to Moses face to face,” the Gloss reads: “No man, no angel has ever seen the essence of God as it is.” Consequently, our conclusion is the same as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum Augustinum, desiderium est rei non habitae. Sed Angeli desiderant in Deum respicere, ut dicitur I Petri, II. Ergo Deum per essentiam non vident.
          <td>3. According to Augustine, one desires a thing only if one does not have it. But in the first Epistle of St. Peter (1:12), we read that “the angels desire to look upon God.” Therefore, they do not see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Chrysostomus dicit super Ioan.: ipsum quod est Deus, non solum prophetae, sed nec Angeli nec Archangeli videre potuerunt; et sic idem quod prius, quia id quod est Deus, est essentia Dei.
          <td>4. Commenting on the first chapter of John, Chrysostom says: “Neither prophets, angels, nor archangels were able to see that which is God. 114 Since that which is God is God’s essence, our conclusion is the same as before.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod videtur ab intellectu, per aliquam formam videtur. Si ergo intellectus Angeli videt essentiam divinam, oportet quod per aliquam formam eam videat. Sed non potest ipsam videre per ipsam divinam essentiam; quia forma qua intellectus intelligit, facit eum intellectum in actu, et sic est actus eius; et sic oportet quod ex ea et intellectu efficiatur unum: quod non potest dici de divina essentia, quae non potest venire ut pars in constitutionem alicuius. Ergo oportet quod Angelus intelligens Deum, videat eum mediante aliqua alia forma; et sic non videt eum per essentiam.
          <td>5. Whatever is seen by the intellect is seen through a form. Consequently, if the intellect of an angel were to see the divine essence, it would have to see it through some form. Now, it could not see it through the divine essence itself, because the form by which the intellect understands makes the intellect to be in act and, consequently, is the act of the intellect. Hence, the divine essence and the intellect would be made one. But this cannot be said of the divine essence, which cannot become the constitutive part of anything. Therefore, when an angel knows God, he sees Him through the medium of some other form, and, consequently, does not see Him through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectus debet esse proportionatus intelligibili, cum intelligibile sit perfectio intelligentis. Sed nulla potest esse proportio inter essentiam divinam et intellectum angelicum, cum in infinitum distent, et talium non sit proportio. Ergo Angelus non potest Deum per essentiam videre.
          <td>6. The intellect must be proportionate to the intelligible since the intelligible is a perfection of the one who understands. But there can be no proportion between the divine essence and an angelic intellect, for they are separated by an infinite distance, and there is no proportion between such widely separated things. Consequently, an angel cannot see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, nullus assimilatur alicui nisi secundum similitudinem eius receptam in ipso. Sed intellectus Angeli cognoscens Deum assimilatur ei, cum omnis cognitio sit per assimilationem. Ergo oportet quod cognoscat eum per similitudinem, et non per essentiam.
          <td>7. One thing can be made like another only in so far as it has received likeness of that other into itself. But by knowing God, an angelic intellect is made like God, for all knowledge takes place through assimilation. Consequently, an angel must know God through a likeness, and not through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quicumque cognoscit aliquid per essentiam, cognoscit de eo quid est. Sed, ut patet per Dionysium, et Damascenum, de Deo non potest sciri quid est, sed quid non est. Ergo intellectus nullus creatus potest Deum per essentiam videre.
          <td>8. Whoever knows a thing through its essence knows what that thing is. Now, as is clear from the writings of Dionysius and Damascene, one cannot know what God is, but only what He is not. No created intellect, therefore, can see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut dicit Dionysius in epistola ad Gaium, in Deo tenebrae describuntur propter superabundantem eius claritatem; et propter hoc occultatur omni lumini, et absconditur omni cognitioni. Sed claritas divina non solum excedit intellectum nostrum, sed etiam angelicum. Ergo eorum cognitioni claritas divinae essentiae absconditur.
          <td>9. As Dionysius says, darkness is said to be in God because of the superabundance of His brightness and because He is hidden from all lights and concealed from all knowledge. Now, God’s brightness exceeds not only our intellect but also the angelic intellect. Consequently, the brightness of the divine essence is hidden from the knowledge of angels.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Dionysius sic arguit in primo capite de Divin. Nomin. Omnis cognitio est existentium. Sed Deus non est existens, sed superexistens. Ergo non potest cognosci nisi a superessentiali cognitione, quae est cognitio divina.
          <td>10. Dionysius argues as follows: All cognition is about existing things. God, however, does not exist but is above existence. Therefore, He cannot be known except by transcendent knowledge, which is divine knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Dionysius dicit in epistola ad Gaium, si quis videns Deum intellexit quod vidit, non ipsum vidit, sed aliquid eorum quae sunt eius. Ergo Deus per essentiam a nullo intellectu creato videri potest.
          <td>i 1. Dionysius says: “If a person seeing God understood what he saw, he did not see God but only one of the things belonging to Him.” Therefore, no created intellect can see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quanto visus est fortior, tanto aliquid maius remotum videre potest. Ergo infinite distans videri non potest nisi a visu infinitae virtutis. Sed essentia divina in infinitum distat a quolibet intellectu creato. Cum ergo nullus intellectus creatus sit infinitae virtutis, nullus intellectus creatus poterit videre Deum per essentiam.
          <td>12. The stronger sight is, the more it can see something at a distance. Consequently, what is infinitely distant cannot be seen except by a sight that has infinite power. Now, the divine essence stands at an infinite distance from any created intellect. Therefore, since no created intellect has unlimited power, no created intellect can see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, ad cognitionem quamlibet requiritur iudicium. Sed iudicium non est nisi superioris de inferiori. Cum ergo nullus intellectus sit superior divina essentia, nullus creatus intellectus poterit Deum per essentiam videre.
          <td>13. For any kind of knowledge, a judgment is necessary. A judgment, however, is made only by a superior about something inferior. Therefore, since no intellect is superior to the divine essence, no created intellect will be able to see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea iudicium, ut Boetius dicit, est actus iudicantis. Ergo iudicatum se habet ad iudicium ut passum. Sed essentia divina non potest se habere ut passum respectu alicuius intellectus creati. Ergo intellectus creatus non potest Deum per essentiam videre.
          <td>14. Boethius says: “A judgment is the act of one who judges.” Consequently, what is judged is related to the judgment as something passive. But the divine essence cannot be in the relation of passivity with respect to any created intellect. Therefore, a created intellect cannot see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne illud quod per essentiam videtur, intellectu attingitur. Sed nullus potest attingere ad id quod in infinitum distat ab eo. Ergo intellectus Angeli non potest videre essentiam Dei, quae in infinitum distat ab eo.
          <td>15. Whatever is seen through its essence is reached by the intellect. But no intellect can reach that which stands at an infinite distance from it. Consequently, an angelic intellect cannot see God’s essence, which stands at an infinite distance from it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra.
          <td><b>To the Contrary</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est quod dicitur Matth., cap. XVIII, 10: Angeli eorum (...) semper vident faciem patris et cetera. Sed faciem patris videre, est videre essentiam ipsius. Ergo Angeli vident Deum per essentiam.
          <td>1. In the Gospel according to St. Matthew (18:10) we read: “Their angels always see the face of my Father.” Now, to see the face of the Father is to see His essence. Angels, therefore, see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Angeli beati hoc modo vident Deum, sicut promittitur nobis in statu beatitudinis. Sed nos videbimus Deum per essentiam, ut patet per illud Lib. I Ioan., III, 2: cum apparuerit similes ei erimus et videbimus eum sicuti est. Ergo et Angeli vident Deum per essentiam.
          <td>2. Beatified angels see God in the way in which we have been promised to see Him when we are beatified. But we will see God through His essence, as is clear from the first Epistle of St. John (3:2): “When he shall appear, we shall be like to him; because we shall see him as he is.” Therefore, angels see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Angeli cognoscunt eum a quo facti sunt. Sed ipsa essentia divina est Angelorum causa. Ergo essentiam divinam vident.
          <td>3. Angels know the one who has made them. But the divine essence itself is the cause of angels. Therefore, angels see the divine essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod videtur, videtur per similitudinem vel per essentiam. Sed in Deo non est aliquid aliud similitudo ipsius et essentia eius: quia quidquid est in Deo est Deus. Ergo Angeli vident eum per essentiam.
          <td>4. Whatever is seen is seen either through its essence or through a likeness. But God’s likeness is not something other than His essence, because whatever is in God is God. Consequently, angels see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectus est fortior in cognoscendo quam affectus in diligendo; unde dicit Augustinus: praecedit intellectus, sequitur tardus aut nullus affectus. Sed Angeli diligunt essentiam divinam. Ergo multo magis vident eam.
          <td>5. The intellect is stronger when it knows than the will when it loves. Consequently, Augustine says: “The intellect goes first; the will act follows later or not at all.” Now, angels love the divine essence. Therefore, they see it in a much higher degree.

          <td><b>REPLY</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum, quod circa hanc quaestionem quidam erraverunt, dicentes, Deum per essentiam a nullo unquam intellectu creato videri posse, attendentes distantiam quae est inter divinam essentiam et intellectum creatum. Sed haec positio sustineri non potest, cum sit haeretica.
          <td>Treating this question, some philosophers have erred by saying that no created intellect can see God through His essence; for they concentrated only on the distance lying between a created intellect and the divine essence. Since this position is heretical, it cannot be held.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Constat enim quod cuiuslibet intellectualis creaturae beatitudo consistit in sua perfectissima operatione. Illud autem quod est supremum in qualibet creatura rationali, est intellectus. Unde oportet quod beatitudo cuiuslibet creaturae rationalis in nobilissima visione intellectus consistat. Nobilitas autem intellectivae visionis est ex nobilitate intellecti; sicut etiam dicit philosophus in X Ethicorum, quod perfectissima operatio visus, est visus bene dispositi ad pulcherrimum eorum quae cadunt sub visu. Si ergo creatura rationalis in sua perfectissima visione non perveniret ad videndum divinam essentiam, beatitudo eius non esset ipse Deus, sed aliquid sub Deo; quod esse non potest: quia ultima perfectio cuiuslibet rei est, quando pertingit ad suum principium. Ipse autem Deus immediate omnes creaturas rationales condidit, ut fides vera tenet. Unde oportet secundum fidem, ut omnis creatura rationalis quae ad beatitudinem pervenit, per essentiam Deum videat.
          <td>It is clear that the beatitude of any intellectual creature consists in its most perfect operation. Now, the supreme element of any rational creature is his intellect. Consequently, the beatitude of any rational creature consists in the most noble act of his intellectual vision. The nobility of intellectual vision, however, comes from the nobility of what is understood, just as the Philosopher says that the most perfect operation of sight takes place when it is in good condition and is directed to the most beautiful of all those things that fall under its view. If in its most perfect vision a rational creature would not see the divine essence, then its beatitude would not be God Himself but something inferior to Him. This, however, is not possible, for the ultimate perfection of all things consists in their reaching their principle; and our faith tells us” that God Himself immediately created all rational creatures. Hence, according to faith, all rational creatures who attain beatitude should see God through His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed oportet nunc considerare et intelligere quis sit modus videndi Deum per essentiam. In omni siquidem visione oportet ponere aliquid quo videns visum videat; et hoc est vel essentia ipsius visi, sicut cum Deus cognoscit seipsum; vel aliqua similitudo eius, sicut homo videt lapidem. Et hoc ideo, quia ex intelligente et intelligibili oportet aliquo modo in intelligendo unum fieri. Non autem potest dici quod essentia Dei videatur ab intellectu creato per aliquam similitudinem. In omni enim cognitione quae est per similitudinem, modus cognitionis est secundum convenientiam similitudinis ad id cuius est similitudo; et dico convenientiam secundum repraesentationem, sicut species in anima convenit cum re quae est extra animam, non secundum esse naturale. Et ideo, si similitudo deficiat a repraesentatione speciei, non autem a repraesentatione generis, cognoscetur res illa secundum rationem generis, non secundum rationem speciei. Si vero deficeret etiam a repraesentatione generis, repraesentaret autem secundum convenientiam analogiae tantum; tunc nec etiam secundum rationem generis cognosceretur, sicut si cognoscerem substantiam per similitudinem accidentis.
          <td>Now, however, we must consider or understand how we can see God through His essence. In all vision there must be posited something by which the one who sees beholds what is seen. This medium is either the very essence of the thing seen, as is true in the case of God’s knowledge of Himself, or some likeness of the thing seen, as is true in the case of a man seeing a stone. This is necessary, because the person who knows and the known should in some manner become one in the act of knowing. God’s essence, however, cannot be seen by a created intellect by means of a likeness. For, in all cognition taking place through a likeness, the perfection of cognition is determined by the conformity which the likeness has with that thing whose likeness it is; and I mean a conformity in representation, such as a species in the soul has with the thing outside the soul even though it does not have a conformity with it in real existence. Consequently, if a likeness represents a genus, but not a species, the thing is known according to the intelligible character of the genus but not according to that of the species. If the likeness were to fail to represent even the genus, however, it would represent the thing only according to a likeness which is merely analogous. In such a case, the thing would not be known even according to the intelligible character of the genus. This would happen, for example, if I were to know a substance through the likeness of an accident.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Omnis autem similitudo divinae essentiae in intellectu creato recepta, non potest habere aliquam convenientiam cum essentia divina nisi analogiae tantum. Et ideo cognitio quae esset per talem similitudinem non esset ipsius Dei per essentiam, sed multo imperfectior quam si cognosceretur substantia per similitudinem accidentis. Et ideo illi qui dicebant quod Deus per essentiam non videtur, dicebant quod videbitur quidam fulgor divinae essentiae, intelligentes per fulgorem illam similitudinem lucis increatae, per quam Deum videri ponebant, deficientem tamen a repraesentatione divinae essentiae, sicut deficit lux recepta in pupilla a claritate quae est in sole; unde non potest defigi acies videntis in ipsam solis claritatem, sed videt inspiciens quosdam fulgores. Restat ergo ut illud quo intellectus creatus Deum per essentiam videt, sit ipsa divina essentia.
          <td>Now, any likeness of the divine essence that is received into a created intellect can have no proportion with the divine essence other than that of analogy. Consequently, knowledge which is had through such a likeness is not knowledge of God Himself through His essence. In fact, it is more imperfect than that which would be had if a substance were known through the likeness of an accident. Consequently, those persons who said that God is not seen through His essence taught that only a certain brightness of the divine essence will be seen, meaning by <i>brightness</i> a likeness of the uncreated light through which, they affirmed, God could be seen but which was unable to represent the divine essence—just as the light received by our eyes fails to represent the brightness of the sun, with the result that we cannot fix our vision upon the sun’s brightness but can see only some of its brilliant rays. It remains, therefore, that that by which a created intellect sees God through His essence is the divine essence itself.

          <td>Non autem oportet quod ipsa essentia divina fiat forma ipsius intellectus, sed quod se habeat ad ipsum ut forma; ut sicut ex forma, quae est pars rei, et materia efficitur unum ens actu, ita licet dissimili modo, ex essentia divina et intellectu creato fit unum in intelligendo, dum intellectus intelligit, et essentia per seipsam intelligitur.
          <td>It is not necessary, however, for the divine essence to become the form of the intellect but only to become related to the intellect after the manner of a form. Consequently, just as one actual being results from matter and a form which is a part of the thing; so, with the necessary differences, the created intellect and the divine essence become one in the act of understanding when the intellect understands and the divine essence is understood through itself.

          <td>Qualiter autem essentia separata possit coniungi intellectui ut forma, sic ostendit Commentator in III de anima. Quandocumque in aliquo receptibili recipiuntur duo quorum unum est altero perfectius, proportio perfectioris ad minus perfectum, est sicut proportio formae ad suum perfectibile; sicut lux est perfectio coloris, cum ambo recipiuntur in diaphano. Et ideo, cum intellectus creatus, qui inest substantiae creatae, sit imperfectior divina essentia in eo existente, comparabitur divina essentia ad illum intellectum quodammodo ut forma. Et huius exemplum aliquale in naturalibus inveniri potest. Res enim per se subsistens non potest esse alicuius materiae forma, si in ea aliquid de materia inveniatur, sicut lapis non potest esse alicuius materiae forma; sed res per se subsistens quae materia caret, potest esse forma materiae, sicut de anima patet. Et similiter quodammodo essentia divina, quae est actus purus, quamvis habeat esse omnino distinctum ab intellectu, efficitur tamen ei ut forma in intelligendo. Et ideo dicit Magister in II, dist. 2, sententiarum, quod unio corporis ad animam rationalem est quoddam exemplum beatae unionis rationalis spiritus ad Deum.
          <td>How it is possible for a separated essence to be joined to the intellect as a form has been shown by the Commentator. Whenever two things are received in something that can receive, and one of them is more perfect than the other, the proportion of what is more perfect to that which is less perfect is like the proportion of a form to what it perfects—just as light is the perfection of color when both are received in a transparent medium. Consequently, since a created intellect, because present in a created substance, is less perfect than the divine essence, the divine essence bears to it in some way the relation of a form as long as it exists in it. We can find some sort of example of this among natural things. A self-subsistent thing cannot be the form of any matter if it contains matter itself. For example, a stone cannot be the form of any matter. A self-subsistent thing lacking matter, however, can be the form of matter, as is clear in the case of the soul. Similarly and in some way or other, and even though it is pure act and has an act of being entirely distinct from the intellect, the divine essence becomes related to the intellect as its form in the act of understanding. For this reason, Peter Lombard says that the union of the body with a rational soul is, in a way, an example of the beatifying union of a rational spirit with God.

          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod cum dicitur: hoc videtur ut est; potest hoc intelligi dupliciter. Uno modo ut modus quo res visa est, cadat sub visione; hoc est dictu, ut videatur in re visa ipse modus quo res est; et hoc modo Deus, ut est, ab Angelis videtur, et videbitur a beatis, quia videbunt essentiam eius habere illum modum quem habet. Et sic intelligitur quod habetur I Ioan., III, 2: videbimus eum sicuti est. Alio modo potest intelligi ut modus praedictus determinet visionem videntis; ut scilicet, talis modus sit visionis ipsius, qualis est modus essentiae rei visae: et sic a nullo intellectu creato potest Deus videri ut est; quia impossibile est ut modus visionis intellectus creati sit ita sublimis sicut modus quo Deus est; et hoc modo intelligendum est verbum Chrysostomi.
          <td>1. The statement, “This is seen as it is,” can be understood in two ways. First, it can mean that the very mode of the thing’s existence comes within one’s vision, that is to say, the very mode of the thing’s existence is seen along with the thing. It is in this way that God, as He is, is seen by angels and will be seen by the blessed; for they will see that His essence has that manner of being which it has. That verse in the first Epistle of John, “We shall see him as he is” (3:2), is to be understood in this sense. Second, however, it can mean that the manner mentioned determines the vision of the one who sees. In other words, the manner of the vision itself is the same as the manner of the essence of the thing seen. In this sense, no created intellect can see God as He is; for it is impossible for the mode of a created intellect’s vision to be as sublime as the mode of God’s existence. The statement of Chrysostom should be understood in this sense.

          <td>5. The form by which an intellect sees God when it sees Him through His essence is the divine essence itself. From this, however, it follows, not that the essence is that form which is a part of a thing in its existence, but only that in the act of knowing it has a relation similar to that of a form which is a part of a thing in its existence.

Et similiter intellectus creatus est proportionatus ad videndam divinam essentiam, inquantum se habet ad ipsam quodammodo ut ad formam intelligibilem; quamvis secundum quantitatem virtutis nulla possit esse proportio, propter distantiam infinitam.
          <td>6. Properly speaking, a proportion is nothing else but a relation of a quantity to a quantity, such as arises when one quantity is equal to or three times another. The term proportion was ~hen transferred to signify the relation of one reality to another. For example, even though no relation of quantity is involved, matter is said to be proportioned to form inasmuch as it is related to form as its matter. Similarly, a created intellect is proportionate to the sight of the divine essence inasmuch as, in some way, it is related to the latter as to an intelligible form, even though the perfections of the two are incommensurable because an infinite distance lies between them.

Et ideo, quia essentia divina unitur intellectui Angeli ut forma, non requiritur quod ad eam cognoscendam aliqua eius similitudine informetur, qua mediante cognoscat.
          <td>7. Assimilation is required for knowledge for this reason only, that the knower be in some way united to what is known. However, when the thing itself is united through its own essence to the intellect, the union is more perfect than if it had taken place through a likeness. Consequently, since the divine essence is united to the angelic intellect as its form, there is no need that the angelic intellect be informed by some likeness which would serve as a medium for knowing the divine essence.

          <td>Ad octavum dicendum, quod auctoritas illa Dionysii et Damasceni intelligenda est de visione viae, qua intellectus viatoris videt Deum per aliquam formam; quia illa forma deficit a repraesentatione divinae essentiae, et ideo per eam non potest videri, sed tantum cognoscitur quod Deus est super id quod de ipso intellectui repraesentatur; unde id quod est, remanet occultum. Et hic est nobilissimus modus cognitionis ad quem pervenire possumus in via; et ideo de eo non cognoscimus quid est, sed quid non est. Sed ipsa divina essentia sufficienter repraesentat seipsam; et ideo quando fit intellectui ut forma, de ipso Deo videtur non solum quid non est, sed etiam quid est.
          <td>8. The statements of Dionysius and of Damascene should be understood as referring to the vision had in this life, in which a person sees God through some form or other. Since this form falls short of representing the divine essence, the latter cannot be seen through it. All that is known is that God transcends this intellectual representation of Him. Consequently, that which God is remains hidden; and this is the most exalted mode of knowledge that we can attain while we are in this life. Hence, we do not know u hat God is, but only what He is not. Nevertheless, the divine essence represents itself sufficiently. But when it becomes, as it were, the form of the intellect, the intellect knows not only what God is not but also what He is.

Excedit etiam formam qua intellectus noster nunc intelligit; et ideo Deus nunc per essentiam non videtur, ut ex dictis, in corp. art., patet. Sed in visione beata Deus excedet quidem virtutem intellectus creati, unde non ita perfecte videbitur sicut perfecte est; non autem excedet formam qua videbitur, et ideo ipsum quod est Deus, videbitur.
          <td>9. God’s splendor proves too much for the intellects of persons in this life for two reasons. First, it lies beyond the grasp of their intellectual power. From this it follows that the perfection of our vision is not equal to the perfection of His essence, because what an action can accomplish is determined by the agent’s perfection. Second, it transcends the form by which our intellects now understand. Consequently, God is not seen now through His essence, as is clear from what has been said. In the beatific vision, however, while God still transcends the power of a created intellect, and the perfection of our vision still does not equal the perfection of His being, He does not lie beyond the form by which He is seen. Consequently, that which is God will be seen.

          <td>10. Dionysius’s argument proceeds from the knowledge had while in this life. This is had from forms in existing creatures, and, consequently, it cannot attain to what is transcendent. Such is not the case, however, of the vision had in heaven. His argument, therefore, is not pertinent to the problem at hand.

          <td>Ad duodecimum dicendum, quod ideo oportet esse maiorem efficaciam visus ad hoc quod a remotiori videatur, quia visus potentia passiva est. Potentia autem passiva quanto est perfectior, tanto a minori potest moveri; sicut e contrario potentia activa quanto est perfectior, tanto maius potest movere. Tanto enim est magis calefactibile, quanto a minori calore calefit; quanto autem aliquid a remotiori videtur, tanto sub minori angulo videtur, et ita minus est quod ad visum de visibili pervenit; sed si aequalis forma perveniret a propinquo et remoto, non minus videretur remotum quam propinquum. Ipse autem Deus quamvis in infinitum distet ab intellectu angelico, tamen tota essentia sua intellectui coniungitur; et ideo non est simile.
          <td>12. A sense of sight must be very strong if it sees what is at some distance from it; for sight is a passive power, and the more perfect a passive potency is, the less is required to move it. Conversely, the more perfect an active power is, the more it can move. Again, a thing is more susceptible to being heated, the less heat it requires to become hot. But the more distant a thing seen is, the smaller is the visual angle; consequently, less of the thing seen comes to the sense of sight. However, if an equal form were to come from what is near and from what is far, the near object would not be seen less than the distant object would be. Now, even though an infinite distance lies between God and an angelic intellect, He is nevertheless joined to that intellect by His entire essence. Consequently, the cases are not similar.

In the second, we judge how things are; and this kind of judgment can be both about what is superior and about what is equal, for I am equally able to judge if one is standing or sitting, whether he be a king or a peasant. This second kind of judgment is found in cognition.

          <td>14. A judgment is not an action which passes out from the agent into an exterior thing which is then changed by it. Instead, it is an operation that remains as a perfection in the one who judges. Consequently, that about which the intellect or the sense judges need not be passive, even though it may be signified as passive. As a matter of fact, what is sensed and what is understood (the object of a judgment) are related to intellect and sense more like agents, inasmuch as the operations of sensation and understanding are in a certain sense passive.

Haec autem ad quantitatem pertinent; unde secundum duplicem quantitatem est duplex modus comprehensionis; scilicet secundum quantitatem dimensivam et virtualem. Secundum dimensivam quidem, ut dolium comprehendit vinum: secundum virtualem autem, ut materia dicitur comprehendere formam, quando nil materiae remanet imperfectum a forma. Et per hunc modum dicitur aliqua vis cognitiva comprehendere suum cognitum, in quantum scilicet cognitum perfecte substat cognitioni ipsius; tunc autem a comprehensione deficit, quando cognitum cognitionem excedit.
          <td>Properly speaking, one thing is said to be comprehended by another if it is included within it, for to comprehend means to apprehend something in all its parts simultaneously.

Consequently, there are two modes of comprehension according to the two kinds of quantity, namely, dimensional (or extensive) quantity and virtual (or intensive) quantity. According to dimensional quantity, a cask <i>comprehends</i> wine; according to virtual quantity, matter is said to <i>comprehend</i> form when, nothing remains in the matter which has not been perfected by the form. It is in this latter manner that a knowing power is said to comprehend its object, namely, in so far as what is known lies perfectly under its cognition. When the thing known exceeds its grasp, then the knowing power falls short of comprehension.

Unde comprehensio sensus potest impediri dupliciter. Uno modo ex excessu sensibilis secundum quantitatem virtualem; sicut impeditur oculus a comprehensione solis, quia virtus claritatis solis, quae est visibilis, excedit proportionem virtutis visivae quae est in oculo.

          <td>This <i>excess</i> must be considered differently in the different powers. To the sensitive powers, the object is related not merely according to virtual quantity but also according to dimensional quantity; for, inasmuch as a sense is in space, the sensibles move it, not only in virtue of the quality of the proper sensibles, but also according to dimensional quantity. This is clear in the case of the common sensibles. As a result, comprehension by sense can be impeded in two ways. First, it can be impeded by an excess in the object considered from the standpoint of virtual quantity. For example, the eye is kept from comprehending the sun because the intensity of the sun’s brightness, by which it is visible, exceeds the proportion of the eye’s ability to see it. Second, it can be impeded by an excess according to dimensional quantity. For example, the eye is kept from comprehending the entire mass of the earth. Part of it the eye sees, part of it it does not. this, however, is not true of the first example given, for we see all the parts of the sun alike, but none of them as perfectly as they might be seen.

Et ideo in his quae per se intelliguntur sine coniunctione ad sensum, non impeditur comprehensio intellectus nisi propter excessum quantitatis virtualis; quando scilicet id quod intelligitur, habet modum intelligendi perfectiorem quam sit modus quo intellectus intelligit; sicut si aliquis cognoscat hanc conclusionem: triangulus habet tres angulos aequales duobus rectis, per probabilem rationem utpote per auctoritatem, vel quia ita communiter dicitur, non comprehendet ipsam; non quod unam partem eius ignoret, alia scita, sed quia ista conclusio est scibilis per demonstrationem, ad quam cognoscens nondum pervenit, et ideo non comprehendit ipsam, quia non stat perfecte sub cognitione eius.
          <td>Now, the intelligible is related to intellect only indirectly according to dimensional or natural quantity, that is, only inasmuch as the intellect receives something from sense. Consequently, our intellect is similarly kept from comprehending what is infinite according to dimensional quantity, so that some of the infinite comes into the intellect, but some of it remains outside. The intelligible is not, however, directly related to the intellect according to dimensional quantity, since the intellect is a power that does not use a physical organ. Instead, the intelligible is related to intellect according to virtual quantity. Consequently, the intellectual comprehension of those things which are understood in themselves without dependence on sense is impeded only because of an excess according to virtual quantity. This occurs, for example, when what is known can be understood in a more perfect way than the intellect understands it. For example, a person can understand the following conclusion: “A triangle has three angles equal to two right angles,” merely because of a probable reason, namely, the authority of another or because the proposition is commonly accepted. Such a person does not comprehend the proposition, not because he is ignorant of one part of it and knows another, but because that conclusion can be known by a demonstration which he does not yet know. Consequently, he does not comprehend the proposition simply because he has not grasped it perfectly.

          <td>Now, it is clear that there is no place for dimensional quantity in an angelic intellect, especially in its relation to the vision of God. Consequently, any equality or excess occurring here must be taken as involving virtual quantity only. Moreover, the perfection of the intelligibility of the divine essence lies beyond the grasp of angelic and all created intellects in so far as they have the power of knowing, because the truth by which the divine essence is knowable surpasses the light by which any created intellect knows. Consequently, it is impossible for any created intellect to comprehend the divine essence, not because it does not know some part of the essence, but because it cannot attain the perfect manner of knowing it.

Consequently, the term <i>entire is</i> to be explained in a privative sense, not in a sense that would suppose parts. He does not, however, see the essence perfectly. Therefore, it does not follow that he comprehends it.

Alius modus est ipsius rei visae; et hic modus nihil est aliud quam qualitas rei. Cum autem in Deo non sit aliud qualitas quam substantia, modus eius est ipsa essentia; et sic totaliter vident Deum, quia vident totum modum Dei eodem modo quo totam essentiam. Tertius est ipsius visionis, quae est media inter videntem et rem visam; et ideo dicit modum videntis per comparationem ad rem visam; ut tunc dicatur aliquis totaliter alterum videre, quando scilicet visio habet modum totalem. Et hoc est quando ita est perfectus modus visionis, sicut est modus visibilitatis ipsius rei. Et hoc modo non totaliter videtur divina essentia, ut ex dictis, in corp. art., patet; sicut aliquis qui scit aliquam propositionem esse demonstrabilem, cuius demonstrationem ignorat, scit quidem totum modum cognitionis eius, sed nescit eam secundum totum modum quo cognoscibilis est.
          <td>2.We can consider three modes in any vision. The first mode is that of the person who sees, taken absolutely; and it means the extent of his capacity. According to this, the intellect of an angel sees God entirely; for this statement means simply that an angel uses all the force of his intellect in seeing God. The second mode is that of the thing seen; and this mode is nothing other than the thing’s quality. But, since quality in God is nothing other than His substance, His mode is His very essence. Consequently, angels see God entirely in this sense, too, for they see God’s entire mode in the same way in which they see the entire essence. The third mode is that of the vision itself, which is a medium between the one seeing and the thing seen; and therefore it signifies the mode of the one seeing in his relation to the thing seen In this sense, one person is said to see another entirely when his vision is total, as occurs when the mode of the vision is as perfect as the mode of the thing’s visibility. As is clear from what was said above, one cannot see the divine essence entirely in this sense. In this respect, we are like one who knows that a proposition can be demonstrated but does not know the demonstration. Such a person knows the entire mode of its cognition, but he does not know it according to the complete mode in which it is knowable.

Such a union is necessarily true of all non-subsistent forms, whose very existence is to be in another. But, even though the divine essence is, in some way, like a form of the intellect, still, because it is seized by the intellect only according to the manner of the intellect seizing it, and because the action here is not only that of the form but also that of the agent, the action cannot be as perfect as the form which is the principle of the action, because of the defect on the part of the agent.

Sed hoc esse non potuisset, nisi verbum vidissent. Ergo per naturalia pura intellectus Angeli vidit Deum per essentiam.
          <td>1. According to Augustine,” in their initial state in which, as many say, the angels had only natural powers, they saw in the Word all the creatures that were to be made. Now, this would not have been possible unless they saw the Word. Therefore, by means of its purely natural powers, an angelic intellect saw God in His essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quod potest minus intelligibile intelligere, potest intelligere et maius.

          <td>2. Whatever can understand what is less intelligible can understand what is more intelligible. Now, the divine essence is most intelligible, because it is most free of matter; and it is because of this condition that a thing becomes actually intelligible. Therefore, since an angelic intellect can by means of its purely natural powers understand other intelligible objects, it can with even greater reason also know the divine essence by means of its purely natural powers.

Ergo illud quod est magis in se intelligibile, est magis intelligibile Angelo.
          <td>3. But it was said that, even though the divine essence if taken in itself is most intelligible, it is not most intelligible to an angelic intellect.—On the contrary, the fact that what is more visible in itself is not more visible to us is due to a defect in our sight. There is no defect, however, in an angelic intellect; for, as Dionysius says, an angel is “a pure, clean and spotless mirror.” Consequently, that which is more intelligible in itself is more intelligible to an angel.

          <td>4. According to the Commentator, the principle laid down by Themistius, “This is more intelligible; therefore it is more understood,” is applicable to intellects completely separated from matter.

          <td>5. Surpassing visible brilliancy is less visible to our sense of sight because its very brilliancy harms sight. But surpassing intelligible brilliancy does not harm our intellect; indeed, it strengthens it. Consequently, that which is more intelligible in itself is more understood by the intellect.

          <td>6. To see God in His essence is an act of the intellect. But grace lies in the affective power. Grace, therefore, is not needed in order to see God through His essence. Consequently, angels were able to reach the vision of God merely through natural powers.

          <td>7. According to Augustine, since faith by its essence is present in the soul, it is also seen through its essence by the soul. Now, God by His essence is present to the soul and is present similarly to an angel and to all creatures whatsoever. Consequently, in his purely natural state an angel could see God in His essence.

          <td>Praeterea, secundum Augustinum X confessionum, tripliciter est aliquid praesens in anima: scilicet per imaginem, per notionem, et per praesentiam essentiae suae. Si ergo ista divisio est conveniens, oportet haec esse opposita; et ita, cum Deus sit praesens intellectui angelico per essentiam, non erit ei praesens per similitudinem; et ita non potest Deus ab Angelo per similitudinem videri. Si ergo ex naturalibus puris potest eum cognoscere aliquo modo, videtur quod cognoscat eum per essentiam naturaliter.
          <td>8. According to Augustine, a thing is present in the soul in three ways: through union, through a notion, and through the presence of its essence. Now, if this division is consistent, it must have been made through opposites. Consequently, since God is present to an angelic intellect through His essence, He is not present to it through a likeness. Hence, God cannot be seen by an angel by means of a likeness. If an angel, therefore, can know God in some way merely by means of his natural powers, it seems that he knows Him through His essence naturally.

Si ergo existentes in gratia gratis data vel gratum faciente potuerunt videre Deum per essentiam, pari ratione et in statu naturalium existentes.
          <td>10. But it was said that the angels were created not in a purely natural condition but with grace—either with sanctifying grace or with charisms.—On the contrary, just as the light of nature falls short of the light of glory, so also does the light of grace given in sanctifying grace and in charisms. Consequently, if persons possessing either of these graces could see God through His essence, they could, for a like reason, do the same in the state of pure nature.

          <td>11. Things are seen only where they are. Now, before things were created, they existed only in the Word. Consequently, when the angels came to know the things that were to be made, they knew them in the Word and thus saw the Word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">

Consequently, each and every nature has been provided for in such a way that it can attain its end. Now, to see God through His essence is the end for which a rational creature exists. Therefore, by its own purely natural powers a rational creature can attain this vision.

          <td>13. Superior powers are more perfect than inferior. Now, by means of their own natures, inferior powers can attain their objects. For example, senses can attain sensibles; the imagination, objects of imagination. Consequently, since God is the object of the intelligence, as is said in <i>Spirit and Soul</i>, it seems that an angelic intelligence can see God through its own natural powers.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed dicebat, quod non est simile: quia obiecta aliarum potentiarum non excedunt suas potentias; sed Deus excedit omnem intelligentiam creatam.- Sed contra, quantumcumque perficiatur intelligentia creata lumine gloriae, semper Deus ipsam in infinitum excedit. Si ergo iste excessus impedit visionem Dei per essentiam, nunquam intellectus creatus poterit pervenire in statu gloriae ad videndum Deum per essentiam; quod est absurdum.
          <td>14. But it was said that such a comparison cannot be made, because the objects of other powers do not exceed the powers themselves, but God exceeds all created intelligences.—On the contrary, no matter how much a created intelligence is perfected by the light of glory, God always infinitely surpasses it. Consequently, if “excess” prevented one from seeing God through His essence, no created intellect would ever be able to attain a state of glory in which it would see God through His essence. This, however, is absurd.

          <td>Praeterea, in Lib. de spiritu et anima, dicitur, quod anima est similitudo totius sapientiae, et eadem ratione Angelus. Sed res naturaliter cognoscitur per suam similitudinem. Ergo naturaliter Angelus cognoscit ea de quibus est sapientia. Sed sapientia est de divinis, ut Augustinus dicit. Ergo Angelus naturaliter pervenit ad videndum Deum per essentiam.
          <td>15. In <i>Spirit and Soul</i>, we read: “The soul is a likeness of all wisdom,” but so is an angel, for the same reason. Now, things are known naturally by means of their likenesses. Consequently, an angel naturally knows those things which belong to wisdom. But, as Augustine says, wisdom is about divine matters. An angel, therefore, can come to see God through His essence by means of his natural powers.

          <td>Praeterea, ad hoc quod intellectus creatus videat Deum per essentiam, non requiritur nisi quod intellectus Deo conformetur. Sed intellectus Angeli per naturam suam est deiformis. Ergo ex naturalibus propriis potest videre Deum per essentiam.
          <td>16. In order that a created intellect see God through His essence, all that is required is that it be made like God. Now, by its very nature, the intellect of an angel is godlike. Consequently, it can see God through His essence by means of its own natural powers.

Sed Angeli in naturalibus suis existentes non cognoverunt Deum sicut in speculo; quia, ut Augustinus dicit, ex quo creati sunt, aeterna verbi visione perfruuntur, non invisibilia Dei per ea quae facta sunt conspicientes; quod est in speculo videre. Ergo Angeli naturaliter vident Deum per essentiam.
          <td>17. All knowledge of God is either as through a mirror or through His essence. This is clear from the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:12): “We see now through a glass in a dark manner, but then face to face.” Now, in their natural condition angels do not know God as through a mirror, because, as Augustine says: “From the time they were created they enjoyed the eternal vision of the Word. They did not know the invisible things of God through things that are made.” (This latter type of knowledge is “seeing through a glass.”) Consequently, angels naturally see God through His essence.

          <td>18. We see a thing without a medium if we can think of it without thinking about something else. An angel, however, can by his natural knowledge think of God without thinking about any creature. Consequently, he can see God without any medium; and this is to see Him through His essence.

          <td>Praeterea, illud quod non videtur per essentiam, videtur per speciem, si videatur. Sed divina essentia non potest videri per speciem, quia species est simplicior eo cuius est. Cum ergo naturaliter cognoscatur ab Angelo, per essentiam cognoscitur ab eo.
          <td>20. That which is not seen through its essence is seen through a species if it is seen at all. Now, the divine essence cannot be seen through a species, for a species is more simple than that of which it is the species. Consequently, since the divine essence is known naturally by an angel, it is known by him through its essence.

Semper enim dispositio ultima ad formam et forma sunt unius ordinis, in hoc quod si unum est naturale, et reliquum. Essentia autem divina non est naturalis forma intelligibilis intellectus creati;
          <td>In order that God be seen through His essence, the divine essence must be united with the intellect in some way as an intelligible form. However, what is to be perfected can be united with a form only after a disposition is present which makes the subject to be perfected capable of receiving such a form, because a definite act takes place only in a potency suitable for it. For example, a body is united with a soul as with its form only after it has been organized and disposed. Similarly, there must be some disposition produced in the intellect by which it is made perfectible by this form, the divine essence. This disposition is brought about by an intellectual light; and, were this light natural, an intellect could see God in His essence by its purely natural powers. It is impossible, however, for it to be natural, because the ultimate disposition for a form and the form itself must belong to one order. Consequently, if one is natural, so is the other. The divine essence, however, is not the natural intelligible form of a created intellect.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>quod sic patet. Actus enim et potentia semper sunt unius generis; unde potentia in genere quantitatis non respicit actum qui est in genere qualitatis: unde forma naturalis intellectus creati non potest esse nisi sit illius generis in quo est potentia creati intellectus: unde forma sensibilis, quae est alterius generis, non potest esse forma ipsius, sed forma immaterialis tantum, quae est generis sui. Sicut autem forma sensibilis est infra genus intellectivae potentiae creatae, ita essentia divina est supra ipsam; unde essentia divina non est forma ad quam se extendat naturalis facultas intellectus creati. Et ideo lumen illud intelligibile, per quod intellectus creatus fit in ultima dispositione ut coniungatur essentiae divinae ut formae intelligibili, non est naturale, sed supra naturam; et hoc est lumen gloriae, de quo in Ps. XXXV, 10, dicitur: in lumine tuo videbimus lumen.
          <td>This is clear from the principle that act and potency always belong to one genus. Hence, potency in the genus of quantity has no relation to an act in the genus of quality; and, similarly, the natural form of a created intellect can belong only to that genus in which the potency of a created intellect exists. As a result, the form of the intellect cannot be a sensible form, since it belongs to another genus, but can be only an immaterial form belonging to the same genus as the intellect. Now, just as a sensible form lies below the genus of created intellectual powers, so does the divine essence lie above it. Consequently, the divine essence is not a form within the ambit of the natural power of the intellect. Therefore, that intellectual light by which a created intellect receives the ultimate disposition for union with the divine essence as with an intelligible form is not a natural light, but a supernatural light. And this is the light of glory of which the Psalmist speaks when he says (35:10): “In your light we shall see light.”

          <td>Naturalis igitur facultas cuiuslibet intellectus determinatur ad aliquam formam creatam intelligibilem; aliter tamen in homine et in Angelo: quia in homine ad formam intelligibilem a sensu abstractam, cum omnis eius cognitio a sensu oriatur; in Angelo autem ad formam intelligibilem non a sensu acceptam, et praecipue ad formam quae est essentia sua. Et ideo cognitio Dei, ad quam Angelus naturaliter pervenire potest, est ut cognoscat ipsum per substantiam ipsius Angeli videntis; et ideo dicitur in libro de causis, quod intelligentia intelligit quod est supra se per modum substantiae suae, quia inquantum est causata a Deo, substantia sua est similitudo quaedam divinae essentiae. Sed cognitio Dei ad quam homo potest naturaliter pervenire, est ut cognoscat ipsum per formam sensibilem, quae lumine intellectus agentis est a sensibilibus abstracta; et ideo Rom. cap. I, 20, super illud, invisibilia Dei etc., dicit Glossa, quod homo iuvabatur ad cognoscendum Deum per creaturas sensibiles per lumen naturalis rationis. Cognitio autem Dei quae est per formam creatam, non est visio eius per essentiam: et ideo neque homo neque Angelus potest pervenire ad videndum Deum per essentiam ex naturalibus puris.
          <td>Therefore, the natural capacity of any intellect has a determinate relation to some created intelligible form. This relationship, however, differs in man and in angels, since in man it is to an intelligible form abstracted from sense (all man’s knowledge has its origin in sense); however, in angels it is to an intelligible form not received from sense, and especially to that form which is their own essence. Consequently, the knowledge of God that an angel can naturally attain is simply that which he gets when he sees Him through his own substance. Hence, we read in <i>The Causes</i>: “An intelligence understands what lies above it through the mode of its own substance,” because, inasmuch as it is caused by God, its substance is a certain likeness of the divine essence. The knowledge of God that man can naturally attain, however, is had through knowing Him by means of sensible form which, by the light of the active intellect, is abstracted from sensible conditions. Hence, in its commentary on the first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans(1:20), “For the invisible things of him, etc.,” the Gloss states that men were given help toward knowing God by sensible creatures and by the natural light of reason. However, knowledge of God had by means of a created form is not vision of Him through His essence. Consequently, neither man nor angel can attain the vision of God through His essence by their own purely natural powers.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod hoc quod dicit Augustinus, quod Angeli viderunt res in verbo, potest intelligi non a principio conditionis, sed ex tunc ex quo beati fuerunt. Vel dicendum, quod quamvis verbum per essentiam non viderint in statu naturalium, viderunt tamen aliquo modo per similitudinem in eis existentem; et ex tali cognitione potuerunt creaturas cognoscere, quas tamen postmodum in verbo multo plenius cognoverunt, quando verbum per essentiam viderunt; secundum enim quod cognoscitur causa, cognoscitur effectus per ipsam.
          <td>1. This statement of Augustine, that angels saw things in the Word, can be understood as referring to angels, not as they were immediately after their creation, but as they were when they were beatified. Or the reply might be given that, even though they did not see the Word through His essence when they were in a natural state, they saw Him in some way by means of a likeness existing within them, and it was from this knowledge that they were able to know creatures. Later, however, they knew them much more fully in the Word when they saw the Word through His essence, since, in so far as a cause is known, its effects are known by means of the cause.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod quamvis essentia divina sit in se maxime cognoscibilis, tamen non est maxime cognoscibilis intellectui creato, quia est extra genus ipsius.
          <td>2. Even though the divine essence, taken in itself, is most knowable, it is not most knowable to a created intellect, because it lies outside the order of the latter.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod intellectus angelicus dicitur esse speculum purum et incontaminatum et sine defectu, quia non patitur defectum intelligibilis luminis, considerata natura sui generis, sicut patitur intellectus humanus, in quo intelligibile lumen obumbratur in tantum ut necesse sit a phantasmatibus accipere, et cum continuo, et tempore, et discurrendo de uno in aliud; propter quod Isaac dicit, quod ratio oritur in umbra intelligentiae: et ideo potentia intellectiva eius potest intelligere omnem formam intelligibilem creatam quae est sui generis. Sed intellectus angelicus comparatus ad essentiam divinam, quae est extra genus suum, invenitur defectivus et tenebrosus; et ideo deficit a visione divinae essentiae, quamvis ipsa sit in se maxime intelligibilis.
          <td>3. The angelic intellect is said to be a pure and spotless mirror without defect because in view of its genus it does not suffer from a defect of intelligible light as the human intellect does. The intelligible light of the human intellect is obscured to such an extent that it must be passive in regard to phantasms under the limitations of space and time and progress discursively from one thing to another. This is why Isaac says: “Reason is born in the shadow of intelligence”16 and why its intellectual power can grasp the quiddities only of intelligible created forms belonging to its own genus. But the angelic intellect is also found to be “dark” and defective in its relation to the divine essence, which lies outside its genus. Therefore, it falls short of seeing’the divine essence, even though the latter in itself is most knowable.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod verbum Commentatoris intelligitur de cognitione intelligibilium creatorum, non de cognitione essentiae increatae. Pro tanto enim substantia intelligibilis, quae in se est maxime intelligibilis, fit nobis minus intelligibilis quia excedit formam a sensu abstractam, qua naturaliter intelligimus; et similiter, immo multo amplius, essentia divina excedit formam intelligibilem creatam, qua intellectus Angeli intelligit. Et ideo intellectus Angeli minus intelligit essentiam divinam, quamvis sit magis intelligibilis, sicut et intellectus noster minus intelligit essentiam Angeli, quamvis sit magis intelligibilis, quam res sensibiles.
          <td>4. This statement of the Commentator is understood as referring to knowledge of created intelligibles, not to knowledge of the uncreated essence. A created intelligible substance is in itself most intelligible, but is less intelligible to us for this reason, that it exceeds forms abstracted by sense, our natural means of knowledge. Similarly—in fact, even to a much greater extent—the divine essence exceeds the created intelligible form by which angelic intellects know. Consequently, an angelic intellect understands the divine essence less [than created things] even though it is more intelligible in itself, just as our intellect knows less about an angelic essence than it does about sensible things, even though an angelic essence is more intelligible in itself.

Et secundum hoc est verum quod dicitur in II Metaph., quod intellectus se habet ad manifestissima naturae sicut oculus vespertilionis ad lucem solis.
          <td>5. Even though surpassing intelligible brilliancy does not harm the intellect but strengthens it, it sometimes lies beyond the representation of the form by which the intellect understands; and, for this reason, it hinders the intellect. Consequently, the following statement in the <i>Metaphysics</i> that the intellect is related to what is most manifest in nature “as the eye of the bat is to the light of the sun” is true.

          <td>7. Faith is known through its essence in so far as its essence is joined to the intellect as an intelligible form, and not for any other reason. But, the divine essence is not joined to a created intellect in this manner during life. It merely sustains the intellect in its act of existence.

          <td>8. That division is made, not through opposing things, but through opposing formal concepts. Consequently, there is no reason why something cannot be in the soul in one manner, say, through its essence, and in another manner also, as through its likeness or image. For an image and likeness of God exist in the soul, even though God is also present there through His essence.

Secundus gradus est eius quod potest consequi perfectam bonitatem cum modico auxilio et parvo motu, sicut eius qui habet sanitatem cum modico exercitio. Tertius gradus est eius quod acquirit perfectam bonitatem cum multis motibus, sicut ille qui acquirit perfectam sanitatem cum multis exercitiis.

          <td>12. As the Philosopher says, many degrees of perfection are found in things. The first and most perfect degree is that wherein a thing has its own goodness without the motion or the help of another, just as the most perfect health exists in one who is healthy by himself without the help of medicine. This is the degree proper to divine perfection. The second degree is that wherein one can attain perfect goodness with slight help or with a little motion, like a man who can keep his health with only a little exercise. The third degree is that wherein one acquires perfect goodness only through many motions, like a man who acquires perfect health only after much exercise. The fourth degree belongs to him who can never acquire perfect goodness, but can acquire only some goodness by means of many motions. The fifth degree belongs to him who cannot acquire any goodness at all and has no movement towards goodness. He is like a man who has an incurable disease and, consequently, does not take any medicine.

Et ideo quamvis sint nobiliores, non tamen sequitur quod ex propriis naturalibus possint attingere ad finem suum, sicut naturae inferiores.

          <td>Now, irrational natures can in no way attain perfect goodness, which is beatitude. They can attain only some imperfect goodness, their natural end, which they achieve through the force of their own natures. Rational creatures, however, can attain perfect goodness, that is, beatitude. Yet, in order to attain this, they need more things than lower natures need in order to obtain their ends. Consequently, even though rational creatures are more noble, it does not follow that they can attain their end by means of their own natural powers as lower natures do. For, to attain beatitude through one’s own power belongs exclusively to God.

          <td>14. Even though a created intellect is never elevated by the light of glory to such an extent that the distance between it and the divine essence is no longer infinite, yet, as a result of this light, the intellect is united with the divine essence as with an intelligible form; and this union can happen in no other way.

          <td>16. The natural conformity which an angelic intellect has with God is not such that it is proportioned to the divine essence as to an intelligible form. It consists rather in this, that an angelic intellect does not receive its knowledge of sensible things from sense as we do; and in other respects, too, the angelic intellect resembles God more than it resembles the human intellect.

Second, it is seen through a species, as takes place when the likeness of a thing is impressed on my sense of sight when I see a stone. Third, it is seen “through a mirror”; and this takes place when the thing’s likeness, through which it is known, is not caused in the sight by the thing itself directly but by that in which the likeness of the thing is represented, just as sensible species are caused in a mirror.

To see God in the third manner, however, is natural to man himself, for he can come to know God from creature inasmuch as they represent Him somehow or other. Consequently, the statement that all knowledge is either through an essence or through a mirror should be taken as referring to human knowledge. The knowledge which an angel naturally has of God lies between these two types.

          <td>18. An image of a thing can be considered in two ways. First, it can be considered in so far as it is a certain thing; and since as a thing it is distinct from that of which it is an image, under this aspect the motion of the cognitive power to the image will be other than its motion toward that of which it is an image. Second, it can be considered in so far as it is an image. Under this aspect, the motion toward the image will be the same as the motion toward that of which it is an image. Consequently, when a thing is known by means of a resemblance existing in its effect, the cognitive motion can pass over immediately to the cause without thinking about any other thing. This is the way in which the intellect of a person still in this life can think of God without thinking of any creature.

Ergo Angelus videns Deum omnia videt.
          <td>3. If an angel does not know all things, this is because of a defect in his faculty of knowing or in its objects or in the medium of his cognition. But his lack of knowledge is not due to any defect in the angel’s intellect, for, as Dionysius says, an angel “is a pure and spotless mirror.” Nor is it due to any defect in the objects of this faculty, for all things are knowable in the divine essence. Finally, it is not due to any defect in the medium by which angels know, for the divine essence represents all things perfectly. Consequently, seeing God, an angel sees all things.

Ergo Angelus videns essentiam divinam, omnia cognoscit.
          <td>4. An angel’s intellect is more perfect than the intellect possessed by a human soul. But the human soul has the power to know all things; for as is said in <i>The Soul</i>, it is “all things in some manner” since it is natural for it to know all things. Consequently, an angelic intellect can also know all things. Now, nothing is more effective in bringing an angelic intellect to the act of cognition than the divine essence. Therefore, when an angel sees the divine essence he knows all things.

Now, all things can be revealed to one still on earth. That all things present can be revealed is clear from the case of Benedict, who, as Gregory says, was shown the whole world at once. That all future things can be revealed is also clear, since God reveals some future events to prophets; and, in the same way, He could reveal all of them to a prophet—and all past things, too. For an even better reason, therefore, an angel seeing God in the heavenly vision knows all things.

In both he will find glorious refreshment.” Now, our external sight will nourish itself perfectly upon the humanity of our Saviour, because nothing in His body will be hidden from it.

Images reflected in a mirror, however, are actually distinct; consequently, the way in which all things are in the divine essence is more like the way in which effects are in a cause than that in which images are in a mirror. Moreover, one who knows a cause will know all the effects which that cause can produce only if he comprehends that cause, but such comprehension is impossible for a created intellect with regard to the divine essence. Hence, in seeing His essence God alone necessarily knows all the things that He can make. The same is true of the effects that can be produced by the divine essence: one knows more of these the more fully he sees God’s essence. Consequently, the soul of Christ, which sees God more perfectly than all other creatures do is said to know all things, present, past, and future. Other creatures however, do not have this knowledge. Each one of them sees more or fewer effects of God in proportion to the knowledge he has of Him.

          <td>1. As Peter Lombard points out, when one says that angels see all things in the Word before they come into being, his statement should not be understood as referring to all angels, but possibly only to the higher angels. Nor do these see all things perfectly, but, perhaps, only in general. Some things they know, as it were, only implicitly. Or one could also reply that many concepts can be drawn from one object, just as many demonstrations can be made about a triangle; and it is possible for one to know the definition of a triangle and still not know all the things that can be known about a triangle. Therefore, it is one thing to know all things, and another to know all that can be known about things.

Et de his rationibus inferiores Angeli a supremis illuminantur. Et hoc est quod dicit Dionysius, cap. IV de Divin. Nomin., quod superiores Angeli docent inferiores rerum scibiles rationes.
          <td>However, it is sufficiently probable that all who see God through His essence know all creatures at least according to their species. This is what Isidore means when he says angels “know all things in the Word before they come into existence,” for coming into existence pertains to things, not to intelligible characters. It is not necessary, however, that an angel know all the intelligible characters of a thing when he knows it; and, even if he were to know all the natural properties which can be known by comprehending its essence, he would not know it according to all the formalities by which it falls under the ordering of divine providence, which ordains one thing to many events. It is about such things that the highest angels enlighten the lower. And this is what Dionysius means when he says that higher angels teach the lower about the intelligible characters of things.

Similarly, the natural power of an angelic intellect includes only those objects that are manifested to it by its own natural light, which is not, however, sufficient to manifest all the things hidden in the wisdom of God. Moreover, the soul receives knowledge of those things which it can know naturally only through a medium that is proportioned to itself. Consequently, even though two persons may apprehend a conclusion by one and the same medium, one will come to know it when the other, with a slower intellect, will not. Similarly, when angels see God’s essence, a higher angel will know many things which a lower angel will not. However, the lower angel gets knowledge of these things through a medium that is more proportioned to him, namely, the light of the higher angel. Hence, it is necessary for one angel to enlighten another.

Consequently, these concepts are understood but not loved. They can, however, be the principle of love or the reason for it. But, properly speaking, what is loved is the thing itself. Therefore, since the angels who see God through His essence know all creatures, they can love all creatures. But, because they do not apprehend all the intelligible aspects of creatures, they do not love creatures under all the aspects under which they can be loved.

          <td>6. Even though God is at an infinite distance from the angelic intellect, angels do not know God according to the mode of His infinity, because they do not know Him infinitely. Consequently, it is not necessary that they know all the infinite things that He knows.

Similarly, God could reveal to a person in a lower place in heaven as many things as one in a higher place knows—or even more things. But this is not the point of our present inquiry. The point is: Does it follow that a created intellect knows all things from the fact that it sees God’s essence?

          <td>8. Gregory’s statement can be understood as referring to things that pertain to the substance of beatitude. Or one can reply that Gregory is speaking about the sufficiency of the medium, because the divine essence is a medium that is sufficient to make all things known. Gregory accordingly holds that it is not strange if one who sees the divine essence knows future things; but that he does not know all things comes from a defect in the intellect which does not comprehend it.

          <td>12. Although the knowledge of creatures does not belong to the substance of beatitude as something that beatifies, nevertheless, some knowledge of creatures pertains to beatitude as being in a way necessary for some act which the beatified person has to perform. For example, to know all who have been placed under his care belongs t the beatitude of an angel. Similarly, it belongs to the beatitude of the saints to know those persons who implore their help and even to know those other creatures from which they ought to rise to the praise of God.

Similiter est etiam cognitio rationum intelligibilium de effectibus respectu essentiae divinae; quia quaedam sunt latentiores, quaedam manifestiores; et ideo ex visione divinae essentiae quaedam cognoscuntur, quaedam non.
          <td>Or it might be said that, even if the knowledge of creatures pertain in no way at all to beatitude, it does not follow that all knowledge of creatures is equally related to the beatific vision. For, when a cause is known, some effects are known immediately in it while others still remain rather hidden. For example, some conclusions can be drawn immediately from principles of demonstration while others cannot be except by means of numerous media; and one cannot come to know the latter by himself but must be led to them by someone else. The same is true of knowing the intelligible reasons of effects in their relation to the divine essence: some are hidden but others are manifest. Consequently, when one sees the divine essence he sees some effects but not others.

Quaedam vero potentia est obedientiae tantum, sicut dicitur aliquid esse in potentia ad illa quae supra naturam Deus in eo potest facere; et si talis potentia non reducatur ad actum, non erit potentia imperfecta: et ideo intellectus Angeli beati non est imperfectus, si non cognoscit omnia quae Deus potest ei revelare.
          <td>13. A thing can be in potency to something else in two ways. First, it can be in natural potency; and it is in this way that a created intellect is in potency to knowing all those things that can be manifested to it by its own natural light. A beatified angel is ignorant of none of these things, for were he ignorant of these his intellect would be imperfect. Secondly, a thing can be in merely obediential potency; and it is in this way that a thing is said to be in potency to those things above its nature which God can nevertheless cause in it. If such things are not reduced from potency to act, the potency is not imperfect. Consequently, the intellect of a beatified angel is not imperfect if it does not know all the things which God could reveal to it.

Nec etiam intellectus videns Deum, qui plures creaturas cognoscit, ex cognitione creaturarum (perfectior est); sed ex hoc quod perfectius Deum cognoscit: unde dicit Augustinus, in libro confessionum: infelix homo qui scit omnia illa, scilicet creata, te autem nescit: beatus autem qui te scit, etiam si illa nesciat. Si autem te et illa novit, non propter illa beatior, sed propter te solum beatus.
          <td>Or one could reply that if a potency is ordered to two perfections, and if the second is the final cause of the first, then that potency would not be imperfect if it should have the second without the first—for example, if one were to have health without the help of medicine which causes health. Now, all knowledge of created things is ordered to the knowledge of God. Consequently, granted the impossible position that a created intellect did not know creatures but still knew God, it would not be imperfect. Moreover, an intellect that sees God and knows more creatures is not more perfect because of this knowledge of creatures but rather by the fact that it knows God more perfectly. For this reason, Augustine says: “Unhappy the man who knows all things,” that is, created things, “but does not know You. Happy is he who knows You, even if he does not know creatures. Moreover, if he knows You and creatures, he is not happier on account of them, but his happiness comes from You alone.”

Alio modo volubilitas potest referri ad successionem eorum quae cogitantur. Et sic sciendum est, quod quantum ad illam cognitionem qua Angeli cognoscunt res in verbo, non potest esse successio, quia per unum diversa cognoscunt. Sed quantum ad ea quae cognoscunt per species innatas, vel per illuminationes superiorum, est ibi successio; unde Augustinus dicit, VIII super Genes. ad Litt., quod Deus movet creaturam spiritualem per tempus: quod est per affectiones mutari.
          <td>14. Change in thought, which is not had in beatified angels, can be understood in two different senses. First, thought is said to change as a result of reasoning from effects to causes or from causes to effects. Now, this discursive thinking is proper to reason and is beneath the clarity of angelic intellects. Second, change in thought can mean succession in the things that are thought about; and here we should note that there cannot be any succession in the knowledge by which angels know things in the Word, because they know many different things in one medium. But there is succession with respect to those things which they know through innate species or through the illuminations of higher angels. Hence, Augustine says: “God moves spiritual creatures through time;” that is, they are changed in their affections.

Et quantum ad hoc, visio illa non mensuratur aeternitate, sed tempore; non quidem tempore quod est mensura motus primi mobilis, de quo philosophus loquitur, sed tempore non continuo, quali creatio rerum mensuratur; quod nihil est aliud quam numeratio prioris et posterioris in creatione rerum vel in successione angelicorum intellectuum.
          <td>15. The beatific vision is that by which God is seen through His essence and things are seen in God. There is no succession in this vision, nor do angels make any progress in it or in beatitude. But they can progress in their vision of things through innate species or through the illumination of superior angels; and this vision is measured, not by eternity, but by time—not by that time which is the measure of the first mobile thing’s motion, about which the Philosopher speaks, but by non-continuous time, such as that by which creation is measured. This is nothing other than the difference between “before” and “after” in the creation of things or in the succession of acts of understanding had by angels.

It is clear from the second Epistle to the Corinthians (12:4) that Paul in rapture saw the essence of God and there saw “secret words which it is not granted to man to utter.” Now, he did not forget those words when he no longer saw the Word through His essence. Hence, he must have known them by means of some likenesses, which remained in his intellect.

Now, one thing can be made like another in two ways: it can get this likeness immediately from the other, or it can get it by being assimilated to a third thing which is like the second. Cognition is had in two ways, also: we can know Socrates by seeing him either because our sense of sight is made like Socrates himself or because it is made like a picture of Socrates. In either case, the assimilation is sufficient for us to know Socrates.

This can be explained as follows.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Aliqua vero potentia est quae non solum cognoscit, secundum quod recipit; sed etiam ex his quae recipit, potest aliquam aliam speciem formare; sicut patet in imaginatione, quae ex forma auri recepta et forma montis, format quoddam phantasma aurei montis. Et similiter est in intellectu, quia ex forma generis et differentiae comprehensis format quidditatem speciei. In huiusmodi igitur potentiis quando una res cognoscitur per similitudinem alterius rei, quandoque contingit quod praeter similitudinem illam formatur alia species, quae est rei immediate; sicut ex statua Herculis visa potest formare quamdam aliam similitudinem quae sit ipsius Herculis immediate; sed haec cognitio iam est alia ab illa qua cognoscebam Herculem in statua sua. Si enim esset eadem, tunc oporteret hoc accidere in qualibet alia potentia; quod manifeste falsum apparet.

For example, the senses know merely those things whose species they receive and nothing more. Other powers, however, not only know what they receive, but can also form some other species from it. This is clearly the case of the imagination, which, having received the forms of gold and of mountain, forms a phantasm of a golden mountain. The same is true of the intellect, which, having comprehended the forms of genus and difference, forms the definition of a species. Consequently, when these powers know a thing through its likeness existing in another thing, it sometimes happens that a species other than that likeness is formed a species which belongs immediately to the thing. For example, when I have seen a statue of Hercules, I can form another likeness which will belong immediately to Hercules; but this second act of knowing will be other than that by which I knew Hercules by his statue. If it were the same, then the same thing would happen in all other powers—which is manifestly absurd, because, when my external sense of sight sees Hercules in a statue, that knowledge, does not take place through any other likeness than that of the statue.

But the act of knowledge by which it knows things through their likenesses is other than the act by which it knows things through the Word, even though those likenesses are caused by a conjunction of the angelic intellect to the Word either through operations of the angelic intellect (similar to those of the imagination) or, as seems more probable, through an outpouring from the Word.

          <td>1. As Dionysius says, angels do not know their own power. Now, if they knew themselves by means of their essence, they would know their power. Consequently, angels do not know their own essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si Angelus cognoscit seipsum, hoc non est per aliquam similitudinem, sed per essentiam suam: quia in his quae sunt sine materia, idem est intellectus et quod intelligitur, ut dicitur in III de anima. Sed per essentiam suam se cognoscere non potest, quia illud quo intelligitur, est forma intellectus. Essentia autem Angeli non potest esse forma intellectus eius, cum magis intellectus insit essentiae ut proprietas quaedam, sive forma. Ergo Angelus nullo modo cognoscit se.
          <td>2. If an angel knows himself, he knows himself, not through a likeness, but through his own essence; for, as is said in <i>The Soul,</i> “in those beings which exist without matter, the knower and the known are one and the same.” But an angel cannot know himself by means of his own essence, since a thing is understood by means of a form within the intellect. Now, the essence of an angel cannot be the form of his own intellect, because the intellect itself inheres in his essence as its property or form. Consequently, an angel cannot know himself at all.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, idem non potest esse agens et patiens, movens et motum, nisi hoc modo quod una pars eius sit movens vel agens, et alia mota vel passa; ut patet in animalibus, ut probatur in VIII Physic. Sed intelligens et intellectum se habent ut agens et patiens. Ergo non potest esse quod Angelus totum se intelligat.
          <td>3. The same thing cannot be both active and passive, mover and moved, unless one of its parts is a mover or active and its other part is moved or passive. This is clear in the case of animals, as is shown in the Physics. But the knower and the known are related as active and passive. Consequently, it is impossible for an angel to know all of himself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si Angelus intelligit se per essentiam suam, oportet quod essentia sua sit actus intellectus eius. Sed nulla essentia per se subsistens potest esse actus alicuius, nisi sit actus purus: res enim materialis non potest esse alicuius forma; esse autem actum purum nulli essentiae convenit nisi divinae. Ergo Angelus non potest se per essentiam suam cognoscere.
          <td>4. If an angel understands himself through his own essence, his essence must be the act of his intellect. But, unless it is pure act, no subsisting essence can be the act of anything else, for a material thing cannot be the form of another thing. Now, pure act of being belongs only to the divine essence. Consequently, an angel cannot know himself through his own essence.

          <td>5. A thing is understood only if it is stripped of matter and of the conditions of matter. But to be in potency is, in a way, a material condition which cannot be stripped from an angel. Consequently, an angel cannot understand himself.

          <td>6. If an angel understands himself through his own essence, his essence must be in his intellect. This, however, is impossible; for, as a matter of fact, his intellect is in his essence, and if one thing is in another, this other cannot be in it. Consequently, an angel does not know himself by means of his own essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectus Angeli habet potentiam admixtam. Nihil autem de potentia in actum reducitur a seipso. Cum ergo intellectus reducatur in actum cognitionis per ipsum cognoscibile, impossibile erit quod Angelus intelligat seipsum.
          <td>7. The intellect of an angel is mixed with potentiality. Now, nothing is reduced from potency to act by itself. Consequently, since an intellect is reduced to the act of knowing by the known, it will be impossible for an angel to understand himself.

          <td>8. Every potency has the perfection of its activity determined by the essence in which it is rooted. Consequently, an angelic intellect can understand because of the power of its essence. Now, the same thing cannot be a principle of acting and of being acted upon; and, since that which is understood is, in a way, acted upon, it seems that an angel cannot know his own essence.

          <td>10. There is the same reason for holding that the will reflects upon itself as that the intellect does. But the will of an angel reflects upon itself only by means of its natural love, which is a kind of natural habit. Consequently, an angel can know himself only by means of some habit, and, therefore, he cannot know himself by means of his essence.

          <td>11. Operation lies as a medium between what is active and what is passive. But the knower and the known are related as active and passive. Now, since there is nothing intermediate between a thing and itself, it seems impossible that an angel could know himself.

An example of this type is illumination, which can properly be called an action. The second type of action does not go out to an exterior thing but remains in the agent as its perfection. Properly speaking, this is called operation. Shining is an example of this type.

          <td>Actio autem appetitus et sensus et intellectus non est sicut actio progrediens in materiam exteriorem, sed sicut actio consistens in ipso agente, ut perfectio eius; et ideo oportet quidem quod intelligens, secundum quod intelligit, sit actu; non autem oportet quod in intelligendo intelligens sit ut agens, et intellectum ut passum. Sed intelligens et intellectum, prout ex eis est effectum unum quid, quod est intellectus in actu, sunt unum principium huius actus quod est intelligere.
          <td>The action of appetite, sense, and intellect is not, however, like the action that goes out to exterior matter; it is like the action that remain in the agent as its perfection. Consequently, in so far as he knows, a knower must be in act. It is not necessary, however, for the knower in knowing to become an efficient cause and for the known to become something passive; but inasmuch as one thing results from the knower and known, namely, an intellect in act, these two are but one principle of this act, which is understanding.

Sed hoc quod est intelligere, consequitur ad hanc passionem vel actionem, sicut effectus ad causam. Sicut ergo corpus lucidum lucet quando est lux actu in ipso, ita intellectus intelligit omne illud quod est actu intelligibile in ipso.
          <td>I say that one thing results from them inasmuch as what is understood is joined to the understanding either through its essence or through a likeness. Hence, a knower is not related as active or as passive except for another consideration; that is, activity or passivity is required to some extent in order that the intelligible be united to the intellect. Efficient causality is required, because the active intellect makes species actually intelligible; change is required because the possible intellect receives intelligible species, and the senses, sensible species. But understanding follows upon this change or efficient causality as an effect follows upon a cause. Consequently, just as a bright body shines when light actually exists in it, so also does the intellect understand everything that is actually intelligible in it.

Omnes autem substantiae angelicae sunt mediae, habentes aliquid de potentia et actu, non solum in genere entium, sed etiam in genere intelligibilium.
          <td>We must note, however, that there is no reason why a thing cannot be one thing actually and another potentially. For example, a transparent body is actually a body, but it is colored only potentially. Similarly, it is possible for a thing to be in act in the order of existence but only in potency in the order of intelligibility. Now, in beings there are grades of act and potency. One being, prime matter, is in potency only. Another, God, exists only actually. All other intermediate beings exist both actually and potentially. Similarly, in the genus of intelligibles, one being, the divine essence, is in act only; another, the possible intellect, is only in potency, and for this reason the Commentator says that the possible intellect in the order of intelligibles is like prime matter in the order of sensibles. All the angelic substances lie in between; for they have something of potency and of act, not only in the genus of being, but also in the genus of intelligibility.

Tunc enim intelligit rem cuius est illa forma; nec potest se intelligere nisi per formam intelligibilem actu in se existentem. Intellectus vero Angeli, quia habet essentiam suam quae est ut actus in genere intelligibilium, sibi praesentem, potest intelligere id quod est intelligibile apud ipsum, id est essentiam suam, non per aliquam similitudinem, sed per seipsam.
          <td>Now, prime matter cannot perform any action unless it is perfected by some form (and even then that action is a kind of emanation from the form rather than from the matter); because things that actually exist can perform actions only in so far as they are in act. Similarly, our possible intellect can understand nothing before it is brought into act by an intelligible form. Only then can it understand that thing to which this form belongs. Moreover, it can understand itself only by means of an intelligible form that actually exists in itself. But, since the essence of an angel, which is in act in the genus of intelligibility, is present to it, an angelic intellect can understand this intelligible reality within itself, namely, its own essence—and not through any likeness of it but through the essence itself.

This is true only when it is in essential potency, as a person is before he learns something.

Then the cause of knowledge is that which makes the intelligible to be present actually in the knower. Taken in this way, there is no reason why a thing cannot be known by means of itself.

As is said in <i>The Causes</i>: “An intelligence knows what is above it in so far as that is its cause, and it knows what is below it in so far as that is its effect.” But our faith does not teach that one angel is the cause of another.

          <td>1. It seems that an angel does not know another angel by means of the latter’s essence, because that by which the intellect understands must be within the intellect. But the essence of one angel cannot come into the intellect of another; only God can be substantially present in the mind of an angel.

          <td>1. It seems that one angel cannot know another by knowing through his own essence, because the lower angels lie below the higher, as sentient creatures also do.

          <td>1. It seems that one angel does not know another by means of a likeness or species existing within himself, because, as Dionysius says, angels are lofty intelligible lights.

This is evident from Origen’s commentary on that verse in the Gospel of St. John (1:5): “And the darkness [shadows] did not comprehend it.” Now, a likeness of a shadow must itself be a shadow; a shadow, however, is not a principle that manifests but one that conceals. Hence, since an angel is a creature and is therefore a shadow, he cannot be known by means of a likeness. If he is known, he must be known by means of a God-given light existing within him.

Ergo multo fortius Angelus non cognoscit alium Angelum per similitudinem eius, sed per rationem aeternam.

Now, according to Augustine, the soul knows all things and judges about all things, not by means of any arts which the soul may have brought with it to the body, but by means of the connection it has with the eternal intelligible representations. Much more so, then, will one angel know another, not indeed by means of a likeness, but by means of an eternal intelligible representation.

          <td>1. It seems that one angel cannot know another even through an innate likeness. For an innate likeness is similarly related to what is present and to what is absent.

Quod enim apud nos forma domus quae est in mente artificis, sit aliud a forma domus quae est extra, procedit ex hoc quod forma exterior est in materia, forma autem artis est sine materia: et secundum hoc, cum Angeli sint substantiae et formae immateriales, ut Dionysius dicit, videtur sequi quod forma qua unus Angelus intelligitur ab alio, sit idem quod essentia eius, qua in se subsistit. Sed istud non videtur esse possibile universaliter. Forma enim qua intellectus intelligit, cum sit intellectus perfectio, est nobilior intellectu; et propter hoc philosophus in XI Metaph., probat quod Deus non intelligit aliquid extra se, quia illud perficeret intellectum eius et esset eo nobilius. Si igitur superiores Angeli intelligerent inferiores per essentiam inferiorum, sequeretur quod inferiorum essentiae essent perfectiores intellectibus superiorum, et eis nobiliores; quod est impossibile.

Now, in the case of men the form of a house existing in the mind of an architect is other than the form of the house existing outside his mind; however, this is because the exterior form is in matter, while the form of the artistic conception is without matter. But, since angels are substances and immaterial forms, as Dionysius says, it seems to follow that the form by which one angel is known by another is the same as the essence by which the former substantially exists. This mode of knowledge, however, does not seem to be possible in all cases. For the form by which an intellect understands is more noble than that intellect, since it is its perfection. With this in mind, the Philosopher proves that God does not know anything outside Himself, since its form would perfect His intellect and consequently be more noble than’ God Himself. Therefore, if higher angels were to know lower angels by means of the essences of the latter, it would follow that these essences were more perfect and more noble than the intellects of the higher angels. This, however, is impossible.

For he also taught that the higher angels are “like food” to the lower, and this statement can be understood as meaning that the essences of the higher angels are forms by which the lower angels understand.

We, however, can ascribe such action only to God, who is substantially present in the minds of men and of angels. Moreover, the form by which an intellect understands should be within an intellect that is in act.

Quod non potest esse verum nisi quantum ad id quo uterque intelligit. Et hoc non esset, si uterque intelligeret motorem orbis superioris per essentiam eius. In commento etiam libri de causis, dicitur, quod intelligentia inferior scit quod est supra se, per modum substantiae suae, et non per modum substantiae superioris. Avicenna etiam in sua metaphysica dicit, quod intelligentias esse in nobis nihil est aliud quam impressiones earum in nobis esse; non quod per essentiam suam sint in intellectu.
          <td>That other philosophers did not think one angel could be seen by another by means of his essence is clear to anyone reading their works. For example, the Commentator says that that which the mover of Saturn understands about the mover of the first sphere is different from that which the mover of Jupiter understands about him. Now, this could be true only if that by which each of them understands [is different]. And this would not be possible if each of them knew t mover of the higher sphere by means of the latter’s essence. Moreover, we read in <i>The Causes</i> that “a lower intelligence knows what is above it according to the manner of its own substance,” not according to the manner of the higher substance; and Avicenna says that “the presence of the intelligences within us” means merely the effects they have caused within us, not that they are in the intellect through their own essence.

When a substance separated from matter know itself, it is not necessary that the form in its intellect be other than the form by which it substantially subsists, since the form by which such a thing substantially subsists is actually intelligible because of its complete freedom from matter.

          <td>Ex aliorum autem dictis videtur quod Angelus per essentiam suam, id est videntis, alium Angelum videat. Et hoc videtur ex verbis Augustini, X de Trinitate, ubi dicit sic: mens ipsa sicut corporearum rerum notitias per corporis sensus colligit, ita et incorporearum per semetipsam. Ex quo videtur etiam similiter de mente Angeli, quod cognoscendo seipsam, cognoscat alios Angelos. Huic etiam videtur attestari quod dicitur in libro de causis, quod intelligentia intelligit quod est supra se et infra se, per modum substantiae suae.
          <td>From what others have written, however, it seems that one angel sees another by means of his essence, that is, by means of his own essence. This is what Augustine seems to have intended when he wrote: “As the mind collects notions of physical things through the physical senses, so also does it collect notions of spiritual things through itself.” This seems to be true of an angelic mind, for, by knowing itself, it knows other angels. In support of this, one could cite <i>The Causes</i> where it is said, “An intelligence understands what is above and below itself by means of the mode of its own substance.”

          <td>Sed istud non videtur sufficere: cum enim omnis cognitio sit per assimilationem, Angelus per essentiam suam non potest de alio Angelo plus cognoscere quam hoc in quo essentiae suae est similis. Unus autem Angelus alteri Angelo non similatur nisi in natura communi: et sic sequeretur quod unus alium non cognosceret cognitione completa, et praecipue quantum ad illos qui ponunt plures Angelos esse unius speciei. Quantum enim ad illos qui ponunt omnes Angelos specie ab invicem differre, forte posset aliquo modo sustineri modus iste. Quilibet enim Angelus cognoscendo essentiam suam, cognoscit perfecte intellectualem naturam. Cognita autem natura intellectuali perfecte, cognoscuntur omnes gradus naturae intellectualis. Diversae autem species in Angelis non distinguuntur nisi secundum gradus perfectionis intellectualis naturae. Et secundum hoc, unus Angelus essentiam suam videns, concipit singulos gradus naturae intellectualis, et per huiusmodi conceptiones de omnibus aliis Angelis completam cognitionem habet.
          <td>This explanation does not seem to be sufficient, however; for, since all knowledge takes place through assimilation, by knowing his own essence one angel would know only as much about another angel as his essence resembled the latter’s. Now, one angel resembles another only according to their common nature. Hence, it would follow that the knowledge one angel would have about another would not be complete; and it would be very incomplete according to the opinion of those who hold that there are many angels in one species. This view, however, might be supported to some extent by those who hold that each angel is specifically different; for, by knowing his own essence, each angel would know perfectly what an intellectual nature is, and, having known this perfectly, he would know all the grades an intellectual nature could have. Now, the different species of angels are distinguished only according to grades of perfection found in intellectual natures; consequently, by seeing his own essence, one angel could conceive of the individual grades of perfection found in intellectual natures, and, by means of these conceptions, have complete knowledge of all other angels.

          <td>Et sic potest salvari quod alii quidam dicunt, quod unus cognoscit alium per formam acquisitam, ut praedicta conceptio forma acquisita dicatur; sicut si albedo seipsam intelligeret, perfecte cognosceret naturam coloris, et per consequens omnes species colorum secundum gradus coloris distincte, et ulterius etiam omnes individuos colores, si in una specie non esset nisi unum individuum.
          <td>In this way, we could save the opinion of those who say that one angel knows another by means of a form he has acquired—if, indeed, the afore-mentioned conceptions could be called acquired forms. It would be as though whiteness understood itself, and, by knowing perfectly the nature of color, knew all species of color distinctly, according to their grades—even all individual colors, too, supposing that there were only one member to a species.

          <td>Sed adhuc etiam hic modus non videtur sufficere.

Auctoritas autem Augustini, non sonat quod mens per seipsam sicut per medium cognoscendi cognoscat alia, sed sicut per potentiam cognoscitivam: sic enim et per sensus corporalia cognoscit.

According to this theory, these special operations could in no way be known by another angel. Moreover, the words of Augustine do not mean that a mind can know other things through itself as through a medium, but merely as through a knowing power, as material things are known through the senses.

This can be weaker than light, like color, which in a certain sense is a similitude of light, or one more perfect than light, like the light in a substance that illumines. Moreover, since angels are called lights inasmuch as they are forms which are actually intelligible, it is not inconsistent to say that the likenesses they have of other angels exist in a more sublime manner in the higher angels and in a less sublime manner in the lower.

When one says that every creature, taken in itself, is a shadow or false or nothing, this is not because its essence is dark or false, but because whatever act of existence, light, or truth it has it has from another being.

          <td>2. From what we have said previously, it is clear that the knower and the known are related not as active and passive but as two things from which arises one principle of knowing. Consequently, for knowledge it is not enough that contact take place between the knower and the known. It is necessary, rather, that the intelligible be united to the knower like a form, either by means of its own essence or by means of a likeness.

          <td>3. Even though the essence of one angel has more in common with the intellect of another angel than with the likeness of a material thing, because they both participate in one nature, nevertheless, they do not have more in common in regard to that relationship which must exist between a perfection and what is to be perfected. Similarly, a soul has more in common with another soul than it has with a body; yet one soul is not the form of another soul, though it is the form of a body.

          <td>4. This statement of Augustine can be explained in two ways. It can mean that Augustine is talking about that intellectual vision by which a created spirit sees himself or God or other things which are within him through their essences. For it is evident that, even though a stone is known by the soul, it is not present in the soul by its essence.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Alio modo potest exponi ut referatur ad obiectum cognitionis, non ad formam qua cognoscitur. Sensus enim et imaginationis obiectum sunt exteriora accidentia, quae sunt similitudines rei, et non res ipsa. Sed obiectum intellectus est quod quid est, id est ipsa essentia rei, ut dicitur in III de anima. Et sic similitudo rei quae est in intellectu, est similitudo directe essentiae eius; similitudo autem quae est in sensu vel imaginatione, est similitudo accidentium eius.
          <td>Or this statement can be taken as referring to the thing known, not to the form by which it is known. Now, exterior accidents, which are the object of sense and of imagination, are merely likenesses of a thing, not the thing itself. The object of the intellect, however, is “the quiddity of a thing,” that is, its essence, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>. Consequently, the likeness of the thing in the intellect is a direct likeness of the thing’s essence, but the likeness which is in a sense or in the imagination is merely that of its accidents.

          <td>1. A thing can be known sufficiently by knowing what it is modeled upon. Now, in the opinion of Clement, a philosopher mentioned in <i>The Divine Names,</i> lower beings are modeled upon higher. Consequently, the essences of material things are modeled upon angels. Angels, therefore, know material things by means of their own essences.

          <td>2. Material things are known better in the divine essence than they are in their own natures, because there they shine forth more brightly. Now, the essence of an angel is closer to the divine essence than material things are. Consequently, material things can be known better in the essences of angels than in their own nature; and since we human beings know material things in their own nature, still truer is it that angels know them all simply by looking at their own essences.

Ergo per essentiam suam cognoscit res materiales.
          <td>4. Since an angel knows material things, he must know them either by their species or by knowing his own essence. However, he does not know them through species—not through particular species, because an angel is completely free from matter; and not through universal species, because then he would not have perfect knowledge of things in their individuality. Consequently, he knows material things by means of his own essence.

          <td>6. An angel’s intellect lies halfway between the divine and the human intellect.

          <td>7. Dionysius says: “Scripture asserts that angels have knowledge of things that are on earth, by seeing them, not through sense, but through the power and nature of their godlike minds.” Hence, it seems that they know material things by knowing their own power and nature.

But species of material things are not reflected in the intellect of angels, as is evident from the writings of Dionysius. And since an angel, as Dionysius also says, is a kind of mirror, if he knows material things, he must know them by means of his own essence.

          <td>9. The knowing power of angels is more perfect than the natural power of material things. Now, many of the powers of material things can attain their objects by their own means, without anything being added to them. It is much more true, therefore, to say that the intellect of an angel knows material things by means of his essence and without any species.

Cum autem unitas effectus unitatem causae demonstret, et sic in genere cuiuslibet formae ad unum primum principium illius formae redire oporteat, impossibile est aliqua duo esse ad invicem similia, nisi altero duorum modorum: vel ita quod unum sit causa alterius, vel ita quod ambo ab una causa causentur, quae eamdem formam utrique imprimat; et secundum hoc diversimode ponimus Angelos materialia cognoscere ab eo quod philosophi posuerunt.
          <td>All knowing takes place by means of assimilation, and likeness existing between two things is caused by their agreement in a form. Now, since unity in an effect shows unity in a cause, and, since, in consequence, no matter what genus any form may belong to, one must get back to the one first principle of that form, two things can resemble each other for two reasons only: either one is the cause of the other or both have been caused by one cause that has imprinted the same form upon both. Using this principle, we say that angels know material things in a manner different from that in which philosophers say that angels know them.

          <td>Nos enim non ponimus, Angelos esse causas materialium rerum, sed Deum creatorem omnium visibilium et invisibilium; et ideo non potest in Angelo esse similitudo materialium rerum nisi ab eo qui est materialium rerum causa. Omne autem quod aliquid non habet a seipso, sed ab altero, est ei praeter essentiam suam. Et per hunc modum probat Avicenna, quod esse cuiuslibet rei praeter primum ens est aliquid praeter essentiam ipsius, quia omnia ab alio esse habent. Unde oportet quod similitudines rerum materialium in Angelo existentes, sint aliud ab essentia ipsius, impressae in ipsum a Deo. Rationes enim rerum materialium in mente divina existentes sunt quidem lux et vita; vita quidem sunt, inquantum procedunt ad rerum constitutionem in esse, sicut forma artis procedit in artificiatum; lux vero sunt, inquantum eaedem impressiones quasdam efficiunt sibi similes in mentibus Angelorum.
          <td>For we do not say that angels cause material things. God is the creator of all things, visible and invisible. Consequently, a likeness of the things of nature cannot be within an angel unless it comes from Him who is the cause of material things. Now, whatever one does not have from himself but from another is over and above his own essence. For this reason, Avicenna proves” that the act of being of anything except the First Being is something other than its essence, because all things have their act of existence from another. Consequently, the likenesses of material things existing within an angel must be other than his essence and must be imprinted there by God. Now, the intelligible representations of material things existing in the divine mind are life and light: they are life inasmuch as they come forth to constitute things in their act of existence, as the form of an artistic conception comes forth to constitute a product of art; they are light inasmuch as they cause impressions, resembling themselves, on the minds of angels.

Et sic huiusmodi virtus est ei praeter essentiam suam. Unde et similitudines materialium rerum si ponantur eius effectus, erunt praeter essentiam ipsius Angeli.
          <td>Philosophers, however, have asserted that angels are the creators of material things. But logically, according to this position, angels should know material things, not by means of their own essences, but by means of forms added to them. For the likeness of an effect is in its cause only in the manner in which the power to produce that effect is there. Now, as is said in <i>The Causes,</i> “An intelligence gives existence to inferior things only by means of God’s power existing within it”; and for that reason the author calls this operation divine. Consequently, this power does not belong to the intelligence as flowing from the principles of its essence, but is something over and above its essence. Therefore, even if material things were caused by an angel, their likenesses would be over and above his essence.

Unde et Dionysius, ibidem, Clementis sententiam improbat, volens exemplaria rerum dici rationes in Deo existentes. Si tamen exemplar large dicatur omne illud quod aliquo modo ab alio repraesentatur, sic etiam Angelorum essentiae possunt dici exemplaria materialium rerum. Sed sicut essentia divina est proprium exemplar uniuscuiusque rei per rationem idealem eius, quam apud se habet; ita et essentia Angeli est propria similitudo rei materialis secundum formam eius quam apud se habet, quamvis forma ista non sit idem quod essentia, sicut erat idea in Deo.
          <td>1. According to its formal nature, an archetype implies a relation of causality to the things modeled upon it; for an archetype is a thing that something else is made to imitate. Consequently, in the passage cited, Dionysius finds fault with Clement’s opinion, and holds that the archetypes of things should be called intelligible representations of things, existing in God. However, if an archetype is taken in a broader sense as meaning a thing that is represented in some way by another thing, then angels’ essences can also be called the archetypes of material things. But the divine essence is the archetype of each and every thing in its individuality, because it contains the exemplary ideas of all things. Similarly, an angelic essence is a likeness of a material thing in its individuality because of the form which the angel possesses of it; though this form is not the same as his essence, as is true of the idea in God.

Et ita potest esse per seipsam propria rerum omnium similitudo, et sic per ipsam possunt omnia perfecte cognosci. Essentia autem Angeli est determinata ad aliquod genus; unde non habet in se unde sit similitudo omnium materialium, nisi ei aliquid superaddatur, quo res in propria natura cognoscat.
          <td>2. The divine essence is infinite. Hence, far from being included in any genus, it contains, as Dionysius,” Aristotle, and Averroes say, the perfections of all genera. Consequently, it can be a likeness of all things in their individuality, and through it all things can be known perfectly. The essence of an angel, however, is confined within a particular genus. Consequently, it cannot be, in itself, a likeness of all material things. Hence, to know a thing with all its individual characteristics, an angel must be given a likeness of it, which is over and above his essence.

          <td>7. This statement of Dionysius should not be understood as meaning that an angel’s power and nature are the medium by which he knows other things, but that his manner of knowing follows the characteristics of his nature and power and not the characteristics of the natures of the things he knows. This is clear from the fact that he knows material things in an immaterial manner, and sense-objects without the aid of any senses.

          <td>4. Angels have distinct knowledge of material things. Now, distinct knowledge of things can be had only through that which is a principle of distinction, because the principle of being and that of knowing are the same.

Now, our soul, which is inferior to angels, can conform itself to things by producing forms within itself that are neither innate nor received from things. For example, our imagination can form a phantasm of a golden mountain, which it has never seen. For a much better reason, therefore, an angel can conform himself to things present to him and know them in this manner. Thus, there will be no need for him to know material things by means of innate species; he can know them by means of species which he will make within himself.

          <td>Some say that the forms by which angels know material things are received from them. This, however, is impossible; for an intellect that receives forms from things is related to them in two ways, as something active and as something passive—taking <i>active</i> and <i>passive</i> in their broad meaning. Now, forms of material things are only potentially, not. actually, intelligible when they are in the senses or in the imagination, because they are not entirely stripped of matter. Consequently, an intellectual action is required in order that they become actually intelligible. For this reason, we must necessarily affirm the existence of an active intellect within ourselves.

          <td>Moreover, even when these forms have been made intelligible, we cannot understand things through them unless they are truly united to our intellect in such a way that the knower and the known become one.

Unde oportet quod agens et patiens sint unius generis, cum potentia et actus unumquodque genus entis dividant: non enim album patitur a dulci nisi per accidens, sed a nigro tantum.
          <td>Now, just as a form is related to matter as act is to potency, so also is something active similarly related to something passive, because a thing acts in so far as it is in act, and is passive in so far as it is in potency. Moreover, since a definite act has a definite relation to a definite potency, a definite passivity corresponds to a definite agent and vice versa—just as matter and form are mutually related. Consequently, what is active and what is passive must belong to the same class, for potency and act divide every class of being that there is. For example, “the white” is not passive with respect to “the sweet” (except indirectly) but only with respect to “the black.”

Consequently, it is not possible for a material thing to be passive immediately in relation to the intellect or to act upon the intellect. The Creator of our nature has therefore provided us with powers of sensation, in which forms exist in a mode between intelligibility and materiality. They have this in common with intelligible forms, that they are forms without matter, and this in common with material forms, that they are not yet stripped of material conditions.

          <td>Et ideo alii dicunt, quod Angelus non acquirit formas quibus cognoscit accipiendo a rebus, neque tamen intelligit per formas innatas; sed quod in potestate eius est conformare essentiam suam cuilibet rei apud eius praesentiam; et ex tali conformitate dicunt sequi rei cognitionem. Sed hoc iterum nihil esse videtur. Non enim potest aliquid alteri conformari nisi secundum quod forma eius apud ipsum fit. Nec potest dici quod ipsa essentia Angeli, eo faciente, fiat forma rei materialis, quia essentia eius est semper unius rationis: unde oportet quod illa forma qua se rei conformat, sit addita essentiae, et quae fuerit primo in potentia in ipso Angelo; non enim conformaret se, nisi prius conformabilis esset. Nihil autem reducitur de potentia in actum nisi per id quod est actu. Unde oporteret apud Angelum praeexistere aliquas formas secundum quas esset potens se reducere de potentia conformabilitatis in actum conformationis, sicut videmus quod imaginatio nostra format novam speciem, ut montis aurei, ex speciebus quas prius apud se habebat, scilicet montis et auri: et similiter intellectus ex formis generis et differentiae format definitionem speciei. Unde oportet redire in hoc quod aliquae formae praeexistant in Angelo; et has oportet esse vel acceptas a rebus, vel innatas.
          <td>Consequently, others say that angels do not know by means of forms received from things or by means of innate forms, but angels are able to conform their essence to anything present to them. These persons hold that knowledge of a thing follows from a conformity of this kind. Their opinion, however, seems to be of little value, because one thing can be conformed to another only if the form of the latter becomes present within it. Now, it cannot be said that the essence of an angel by its own activity becomes the form of a material thing, because its essence retains a single formal character. Hence, the form by which an angel conforms himself to a thing is something added to his essence and was previously in him potentially, because an angel could not have conformed himself to a thing unless he was previously in potency to such a conformity. Indeed, nothing is reduced from potency to act except by that which is in act. Consequently, in an angel, we should assume that forms must pre-exist by which he can reduce himself from being potentially conformable to being actually J conformed, as our imagination forms a new species, say, of a mountain of gold, from species it had previously, namely, of mountain and of gold, and as our intellect forms the definition of a species from the forms it has of genus and of differentia. Hence, we must return to the position holding that forms pre-exist in angels; and these are either innate or received from things.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo dicendum videtur, secundum quod tertia opinio dicit, quae communior est et verior, quod Angeli res materiales per formas innatas cognoscunt. Sicut enim ex rationibus aeternis in mente divina existentibus procedunt formae materiales ad rerum substantiam, ita procedunt a Deo formae rerum omnium in mentes angelicas ad rerum cognitionem; ut sic intellectus Angeli nostrum intellectum excedat, sicut res formata excedit materiam informem. Unde intellectus noster comparatur tabulae in qua nihil est scriptum; intellectus autem Angeli tabulae depictae, vel speculo, in quo rerum rationes resplendent.
          <td>As a result, it seems that we must say what the third opinion says is an opinion more widespread and closer to the truth—namely, that angels know material things by means of innate forms. Therefore, just as from the eternal archetypes existing in the mind of God come the material forms by which things subsist, so also do the forms of all things come from God to the minds of angels in order that they may know things. Hence, an angelic intellect excels our intellect as a thing possessing a form excels matter that is formless. Our intellect may be compared to a tablet on which nothing has been written, but that of an angel, to a painted tablet or to a mirror in which the intelligible characters of things shine forth.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod differentia illa speculativae et practicae scientiae non est per se, sed per accidens, inquantum scilicet sunt humanae: homo enim de rebus quas ipse non facit, non habet cognitionem nisi per formas a rebus acceptas. Secus autem est de Angelo, qui habet a sui creatione formas rerum sibi inditas.
          <td>1. That difference between speculative and practical knowledge is not essential but accidental; that is, it arises only in so far as these knowledges are human. Man knows things which he has not made only by means of forms received from things. The case is otherwise with angels, however, because they have the forms of things given them from the moment of their creation.

IV caelestis Hierar. Ipsi enim incarnationis mysterium in Deo absconditum a saeculis cognoverunt; et per Angelorum Ecclesiam, quae est in caelestibus, principibus et potestatibus huius mundi mysterium praedictum innotuit; et quod ibi dicitur de Ecclesia, referendum est ad Ecclesiam Angelorum, ut Augustinus exponit, V super Genesim ad litteram, quamvis Hieronymus contrarium dicere videatur.
          <td>2. The mystery of the Incarnation was known by angels before it was known by men. Indeed, as Dionysius says, men learned of it from angels, who knew this mystery of the Incarnation, hidden from the world for ages; and, as Augustine explains, God revealed this mystery to the princes and powerful ones of this world through the church of the angels, which is in heavenly places. What is said there about the Church should therefore be taken as referring to the church of angels, as Augustine explains—even though Jerome seems to say the contrary.

          <td>Sed tamen verba eius non sunt hoc modo intelligenda, quod Angeli ab hominibus scientiam acceperint; sed quia apostolis praedicantibus res iam completas, quae prius fuerant per prophetas praedictae, Angeli eas plenius cognoverunt, sicut plenius sciunt praesentia quam futura, ut infra, articulo 12 huius quaestionis, patebit.
          <td>However, Jerome’s words are not to be understood in the sense that angels acquire knowledge from men. He meant that while the Apostles were announcing the things that had taken place and had been previously predicted by the prophets, the angels understood them more fully, just as they know the present more fully than the future—a point that will be clarified later.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod Angeli, quamvis futura non cognoscant aliqua, quae tamen, dum sunt praesentia, sciant, non tamen sequitur ex hoc quod species aliquas a rebus accipiunt quas cognoscunt. Cum enim cognitio sit per assimilationem cognoscentis ad cognitum, hoc modo contingit novam cognitionem de aliquo accipere, quomodo contingit de novo aliquid alicui assimilari. Quod quidem contingit dupliciter: uno modo per motum suum; alio modo per motum alterius ad formam quam ipse iam habet.
          <td>3. Even though the angels do not know any future events, they know events when they take place. From this it does not follow, however, that they receive species from the things which they know. For knowing takes place through an assimilation of the knower to the known. Hence, a person will receive new knowledge of a thing in so far as he is assimilated to it in a new manner. This happens in two ways: either through his own motion or through the motion of another with respect to a form which he already possesses.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et similiter aliquis incipit aliquid de novo cognoscere uno modo per hoc quod cognoscens de novo accipit formam cogniti, sicut in nobis accidit; alio modo per hoc quod cognitum de novo pervenit ad formam quae est in cognoscente. Et hoc modo Angeli de novo cognoscunt praesentia quae prius fuerunt futura; ut puta si aliquid nondum erat homo, ei non assimilabatur intellectus angelicus per formam hominis quam habet apud se, sed cum incipit esse homo, secundum eamdem formam incipit intellectus angelicus sibi assimilari sine aliqua mutatione facta circa ipsum.
          <td>Similarly, he begins to know something new in one way by newly receiving a form for the first time from an object which he now knows. This happens with us. Or the object known <u>arrives</u> for the first time at a form already in the knower; and this is how angels have new knowledge of present things that previously were future. For example, if a man did not yet exist, an angelic intellect would not yet be assimilated to him by means of the form of man which it has within itself; but, when he comes into existence, the angelic intellect begins to assimilate itself to him by means of this form, without any change being made within itself with respect to that object.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod sicut in intellectu non est ipsa forma qua res existit, sed similitudo eius: ita distincta cognitio aliquarum rerum non requirit ut apud cognoscentem sint ipsa distinctionis principia; sed sufficit quod apud ipsum sint eorum similitudines: nec differt, undecumque illae similitudines accipiantur, quantum ad cognitionem distinctam.
          <td>4. just as it is not the form by which a thing exists but only a likeness of it that is in the intellect, so also distinct knowledge of things does not demand that the very principles of distinction themselves be in the knower but that their likenesses be there. Moreover, as far as distinct knowledge is concerned, it makes no difference where these likenesses come from.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod intellectus Angeli sine hoc quod acquirit novas formas intelligibiles, potest aliquid de novo intelligere dupliciter: uno modo per hoc quod aliquid de novo assimilatur illis formis, ut iam dictum est, in corp. art.; alio modo per hoc quod intellectus confortatur aliquo fortiori lumine ad plures cognitiones ex eisdem formis eliciendas: sicut ex eisdem formis in phantasia existentibus, superveniente lumine prophetiae, aliqua cognitio accipitur, quae accipi non poterat per lumen naturale intellectus agentis.
          <td>5. Without acquiring new intelligible forms, an angelic intellect can have new understanding in two ways. First, as was mentioned before, it can have new understanding by something being newly assimilated to those forms [which it already has]. Second, it can be strengthened by some stronger light, enabling it to draw more knowledge from the same forms. Similarly, when the light of prophecy operates from forms already existing in the imagination, knowledge is received which could not be received by means of the natural light of the active intellect.

Et similiter per rationes aeternas Deus producit creaturas, a quibus effluunt formae in intellectu angelico. Unde non sequitur quod formae intellectus angelici sint posteriores rebus, sed quod sint posteriores rationibus aeternis.
          <td>6. The Philosopher’s statement should be taken as referring to the universal as it exists in the understanding, by which we understand things in nature. This universal is received from things. But even the universal existing in our understanding is prior, not posterior, to artificial things, because we produce artificial things by means of universal forms of art already existing within us. In a similar way, God produces creatures by means of eternal archetypes; and, from these, forms flow down into the angels’ intellects. Hence, it follows that the forms in angels’ intellects are posterior, not to things, but only to the eternal archetypes.

Ergo superiorum Angelorum cognitio non est magis universalis.
          <td>2. If the knowledge of the higher angels is more universal than that of the lower angels, this universality pertains either to their causal operations or to the object of their knowledge. It does not, however, pertain to their operations, for, as Damascene says, the higher angels do not make things; nor does it pertain to the object of their knowledge, for both higher and lower angels know the things of nature. Consequently, the higher angels’ knowledge is not more universal.

          <td>3. If the higher angels know all that the lower do but through more universal forms, these forms in the higher angels’ intellects must extend to more things. However, one and the same thing cannot represent the individual characteristics of many things. Therefore, the higher angels would not know things in their individual natures, and so their knowledge would be less perfect than that had by lower angels. This, however, is absurd.

Ergo superiores Angeli cognoscunt res per formas minus universales.
          <td>4. As Dionysius says, the knowledge of angels is determined by the power and nature of the knower. Now, the nature of a higher angel is more in act than a lower angel’s nature is. Consequently, his knowledge is also more in act. But universal knowledge is in potency, and particular knowledge is in act. Therefore, higher angels know through forms that are less universal.

Et quia efficacia rei in operando est ex hoc quod est in actu, inde est quod omnis virtus quanto est magis unita, tanto est efficacior ad operandum; et ideo quanto aliqua virtus est altior, tanto invenitur ex paucioribus operari, quae tamen ad plura se extendunt. Et hoc videmus communiter in operativis et cognitivis virtutibus. Ars enim architectonica, utpote aedificatoris, per unam formam artis dirigitur in omnibus quae ad artem suam spectant; in quibus tamen inferiores artifices, utpote coementarii et caesores lignorum, et alii huiusmodi, per diversa artificia diriguntur. Similiter etiam in cognitivis aliquis qui est elevatioris intellectus, ex paucis principiis penes se retentis habet in promptu procedere ad varias conclusiones, ad quas pervenire non possunt qui sunt hebetioris ingenii, nisi per varias inductiones, et per principia particulariter coaptata conclusionibus.
          <td>That which is in potency to many is made determinate to one by act. Consequently, form and act are found to be principles of union, but potency is found to be the principle of multiplicity and division. Now, since the ability of a thing to operate comes from its being in act, the more united a power is, the more it is able to act. Consequently, the higher a power is, the fewer the things it needs for its operation, even though it extends to many things. We see that this is generally true of productive and knowing powers. For, even though a master art, such as architecture, by one form directs all the operations coming within its scope, in these operations the subordinate workmen are directed by diverse arts. The same is true of the cognoscitive powers. A person with a higher intelligence is ready, from a few principles he has within himself, to proceed to various conclusions which those with a less acute intelligence cannot reach without considerable illustrated explanation and without knowing the proximate principles of these conclusions.

          <td>Unde, cum in Deo sit perfectissima virtus, et puritas actus, ipse per unum, quod est essentia sua, omnia operatur et omnia cognoscit efficacissime.

Unde quanto in Angelo fuerit plus de actu, et minus de potentia, tanto emanatio huiusmodi rationum minus in ipso multiplicatur, et virtus eius cognitiva, erit efficacior. Et secundum hoc superiores Angeli cognoscunt res per formas magis universales quam inferiores.
          <td>Now, since in God there is pure act and a most perfect power, He can do all things, and know all things most perfectly by means of one thing, His own essence. Moreover, as was previously explained, the representations of intelligible things flow from God into the angels, not in order that the angels may cause things, but in order that they may know them. Consequently, the more act and less potency there is in an angel, the fewer are the emanations he receives, and the stronger is his power to know. According to this principle, therefore, the higher angels know through forms more universal than those by which the lower know.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod cognoscere aliquid in universali, potest intelligi dupliciter. Uno modo ut referatur ad cognitionem ex parte cogniti; et sic cognoscere aliquid in universali est cognoscere naturam universalem cogniti. Et sic propositio veritatem habet, quia quando cognoscitur de aliquo natura universalis tantum, imperfectius cognoscitur quam si cognoscantur cum hoc propria ipsius. Alio modo ut referatur ad cognitionem ex parte eius quo cognoscitur; et sic cognoscere aliquid in universali, id est per medium universale, est perfectius dummodo cognitio usque ad propria deducatur.
          <td>1. To know something “by universal knowledge” can be understood in two ways. First, it can refer to what is known. If taken this way, then to know something by universal knowledge means to know the universal nature of an object. In this sense, the argument is true, because, if only the universal nature of a thing is known, the thing is known less perfectly than it would be were it known in its individuality. Secondly, the phrase can refer to the medium of cognition. Then to know a thing by universal knowledge, that is, by a medium which is universal, is more perfect, as long as this knowledge extends to the individuality of the thing.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod dicuntur esse formae magis universales quantum ad cognitionem, non quia plurium rerum cognitionem causent, sed quia per pauciores formas ad eadem cognoscenda superior intellectus perficitur, et etiam ad perfectius cognoscendum; utpote si superior Angelus per unam formam animalis omnes species animalium cognoscat, inferior autem non nisi per multas species. Et praeter hoc superior Angelus plures rationes intelligibiles ex eisdem rebus cognoscat.
          <td>2. These forms are said to be more universal with respect to knowledge, not because they cause the knowledge of more things, but because a higher intellect, perfected by a few of them, can nevertheless know the same number of things—even more perfectly. For example, a higher angel might know all species of animals by means of one form of animal, but a lower angel would not know them except through many forms. Besides this, a higher angel can draw out many more intelligible characters from the same things.

Et hoc modo essentia divina est propria ratio rerum omnium, quia in ipsa uniformiter praeexistit quidquid divisim in omnibus creaturis invenitur, ut Dionysius dicit.
          <td>3. What is one cannot be the intelligible representation of many in their individuality if it is merely equal to them. However, if it excels them, then it can represent their individual characteristics, because, within its own one form, it contains the individual characteristics of each of the elements which these objects have separately. In a similar manner, God’s essence is the intelligible representation of all things in their individuality, for, as Dionysius says, in this one form there preexists all that is found separately in creatures.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et similiter, cum formae intellectus angelici sint excellentiores rebus ipsis, utpote divinae essentiae propinquiores, non est inconveniens, si una forma intellectus angelici sit ratio propria plurium secundum diversas eius habitudines ad diversas res, sicut et divina essentia est propria ratio plurium secundum diversas habitudines eius ad res, ex quibus habitudinibus consurgit pluralitas idearum. Sed formae intellectus nostri accipiuntur ex rebus; unde non sunt superexcedentes rebus, sed quasi adaequatae quantum ad repraesentationem, licet sint excedentes quantum ad modum essendi, inquantum habent esse immateriale. Unde una forma intellectus nostri non potest esse ratio propria plurium.
          <td>Similarly, since the forms in the intellects of angels, being closer to God, excel things, it is not inconsistent to say that one form within an angelic intellect is an intelligible representation of many things in their individuality, according as this form has different relationships to different things, just as the divine essence is the proper representation of many things in their individuality according to its different relationships to things; and from these relationships an angel can have many ideas. The forms in our intellects, however, are received from things. Hence, they do not excel things, and are, as it were, equal to them as far as representation goes, even though they may excel them in mode of being because their act of existence is immaterial. Consequently, one form in our intellect cannot be the intelligible representation of many things in their individuality.

But then there would be an infinite number of forms in an angel’s intellect; and this is impossible. Likewise, an angel cannot know singulars by means of universals, because in that case he would not have distinct knowledge of individuals, and this would mean that he knew them imperfectly.

First of all, as is clear from Dionysius and Augustine, as well as from what has been said above, angels do not receive their knowledge from things. Second, even granting that they do receive it from things, the forms received would be in an angelic intellect immaterially according to the manner of the intellect receiving them.

          <td>Avicenna proposed another theory and said that God and angels know singulars universally, not individually—meaning that a thing is known <i>individually</i> when it is known as it is here and now, and under all its individuating conditions, and <i>universally,</i> when it is known merely according to its universal principles and universal causes. For example, one knows this eclipse <i>individually</i> when he perceives it with his senses, <i>universally</i> when he foretells it from the motions of the heavens. According to this theory, angels would know singulars universally in a similar fashion; and, because they knew all the universal causes, they would be ignorant of nothing in individual effects. This manner of knowing, however, does not seem to be sufficient; for we assert that angels know singulars even with respect to those things which belong to their singularity, just as they also know men’s individual actions and other things of this sort that pertain to the care of a guardian.

In Angelis autem non est alia cognitio quam intellectiva, in qua singularium cognitio praeexistat, ut sic universales formae intellectus ipsorum possint singularibus applicari.

These forms were given angels at the moment of creation, and they apply them to this or to that singular. In this way, they know singulars by means of universal forms. But this theory also seems to be inconsistent, because one thing cannot be applied to another unless that other has been already known previously in some way. For example, we can apply our universal knowledge to singulars which pre-exist in our sensitive knowledge. In angels, however, there is no knowledge other than intellectual in which the knowledge of singulars could pre-exist and so make it possible for the universal forms of their intellect to be applied to singulars. From this it is clear that the application of the universal to the particular demands intellectual knowledge of singulars in angels as a prerequisite; it cannot cause such knowledge.

This, however, is not true of our intellectual forms, which are related to things in two ways: first, as the cause of things, like the forms of the practical intellect; second, as caused by things, like the forms of the speculative intellect, by which we speculate about natural things. By means of the forms of the practical intellect, however, an artisan makes only a form. Hence, the forms of the practical intellect are likenesses merely of forms; and because every form as a form is universal, an artisan can have only universal knowledge of his product by means of the form of his artistic conception. Knowledge of it as a singular he acquires by means of his senses, just as anyone else does. But were he to make both the matter and the form by means of the forms of his artistic conception, then the latter would be an archetype of both form and matter, and, by its means, he could know the products of his art, not only universally, but also individually, because matter is the principle of individuation.

True, it is also a likeness of material conditions, but this is because it is received in a material organ, which receives in a material way; consequently, it retains some conditions of matter.

Moreover, just as natural things come from the divine intellect according to both their form and matter, which constitute them in being, so do the forms within the angelic intellects come from God in order that angels might know both. Consequently, angels know things both in their singularity and universality by means of innate forms since these are similar to the creative forms, namely, the archetypes existing in the divine mind; yet these innate ideas do not create things.

          <td>Ad nonum dicendum, quod intellectus Angeli per speciem quam apud se habet, cognoscit singulare non solum in sua substantia, sed etiam secundum omnia accidentia eius; et ideo cognoscit cuicumque accidenti singulare variatum subsit; et sic variatio singularis certitudinem cognitionis angelicae non tollit.
          <td>9. By means of the species which it has within itself, an angelic intellect knows a singular, not only according to its substance, but also according to all its accidents. Therefore, it can know a singular no matter how many its accidental variations may be. Consequently, the fact that a singular may vary does not take certitude away from angelic cognition.

          <td>Ad undecimum dicendum, quod mensura, inquantum est principium cognoscendi mensuratum est unius generis cum mensurato, sed non simpliciter; sicut patet quod ulna est mensura panni, et non convenit cum eo nisi in quantitate: sic enim est mensura eius. Sic etiam et forma intellectus angelici non oportet quod conveniat cum singulari extra animam existente, secundum modum existendi; cum singulare sit materialiter, et forma praedicta sit immaterialis.
          <td>11. In so far as a measure is a principle for knowing the thing measured, it must belong to the same genus as the latter does, but not in all respects. It is evident, for example, that an elbow length is a measure for cloth, but all it has in common with the cloth is quantity; however, this is enough for it to be a measure for cloth. Similarly, the form in an angelic intellect need not have the same mode of existence that a singular existing outside the soul has, since the singular has a material existence, and the afore-mentioned form is immaterial.

          <td>12. Saints in glory know in the Word the things that are happening here. This is very clear from what Gregory has written. Moreover, this statement of Augustine should be taken as referring to the natural state. Nor is there any parallel between an angel and a soul, because an angel naturally has forms given to him at creation, and, by means of these, he knows singulars.

          <td>13. Forms in an angelic intellect are neither singular, like the forms in imagination or sense, because they are entirely separated from matter, nor universal, as our intellectual forms are, which can represent only a universal nature. Although they exist immaterially in themselves, they nevertheless indicate and express a universal nature and particular conditions.

          <td>Praeterea, Boetius, in V de consolatione, hanc causam assignat quare Deus futura contingentia infallibiliter praescire potest, quia eius visio est tota simul, cum aeternitate mensuretur. Sed visio beata est tota simul, cum aeternitate participata mensuretur. Ergo Angeli beati futura contingentia cognoscunt.
          <td>2. Boethius says that God is able to foreknow future contingent events infallibly, because His vision, being measured by eternity, is entirely simultaneous. But the beatific vision is likewise entirely simultaneous, since it is measured by participated eternity. Consequently, beatified angels know future contingent events.

          <td>Praeterea, Gregorius IV dialogorum dicit, quod anima cum recedat a nexibus corporis, vi subtilitatis naturae cognoscit futura. Sed Angelus est maxime a nexibus corporis absolutus, et est subtilissimae naturae. Ergo cognoscunt futura.
          <td>3. According to Gregory, when the soul severs its connection with the body, it knows the future by means of its own subtle nature. Now, an angel is completely free of any connection with a body, and its nature is most subtle. Therefore, they can know the future.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectus possibilis animae nostrae est in potentia ad omnia cognoscenda, et ita ad cognoscenda futura. Sed potentia intellectus angelici est tota terminata per formas innatas, ut supra, art. 4 et 8 huius quaest., dictum est. Ergo ipsi habent notitiam de futuris.
          <td>4. The possible intellect in our soul is in potency to the knowledge of all things, and hence to the knowledge of the future. Now, as was said above, the potentialities of an angelic intellect are completely actuated by means of innate forms. Angels, therefore, have knowledge about future events.

          <td>Praeterea, quicumque habet providentiam super aliquem, debet habere et praescientiam eorum quae ad ipsum spectant. Sed Angeli habent curam et providentiam de nobis per officium custodiae. Ergo ipsi cognoscunt ea quae nobis sunt futura.
          <td>5. Those who have providence over a person should also have foreknowledge of the things affecting that person. But, as our guardians, the angels have been entrusted with our providence and care. Consequently, they must know things in the future that affect us.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectus angelicus excedit intellectum humanum. Sed intellectus humanus cognoscit futura quae habent causas determinatas in natura. Ergo angelicus cognoscit futura contingentia ad utrumlibet quae non habent aliquas causas determinatas; ergo, et cetera.
          <td>6. The angelic intellect excels the human. Now, a human intellect can know future events which have determined causes in nature. Therefore, an angelic intellect can know even those future contingent events which, not having any determined causes, can happen in either of two ways.

Sed Angeli non accipiunt cognitionem a rebus. Ergo aequaliter se habent ad cognoscenda praesentia et futura; et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>7. We are differently related to knowing the future than we are to knowing the present, because we receive our knowledge from things, and, consequently, things must exist before we can know them. Angels, however, do not receive their knowledge from things. Therefore, they are equally related to knowing the future and the present. Consequently, our original thesis stands.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, intellectiva cognitio non concernit aliquod tempus, quia abstrahit ab hic et nunc, et sic aequaliter se habet ad omne tempus. Sed Angelus non habet cognitionem nisi intellectivam. Ergo aequaliter se habet ad cognoscenda praesentia et futura; et sic idem quod prius.
          <td>8. Intellectual knowledge does not include time, because it abstracts from the “here and now,” and so is equally related to all time. Now the only knowledge an angel has is intellectual. Consequently, an angel is equally related to knowing the present, past, and future. Hence, we conclude as before.

          <td>9. An angel knows more than a man does. But in the state of innocence man knew future events. This is clear from Genesis (2:24) “Adam said... ‘Wherefore a man shall leave father and mother. Therefore, angels also know the future.

          <td>1. In Isaiah (41:23) we read: “Show the things that are to come hereafter: and we shall know that ye are gods.” Thus, knowledge of the future is a sign of divinity. However, angels are not gods. Therefore, they do not know the future.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cognitio certitudinalis haberi non potest nisi eorum quae habent veritatem determinatam. Sed futura contingentia non sunt huiusmodi, ut patet in I Periher. Ergo Angeli futura contingentia non cognoscunt.
          <td>2. Knowledge with certitude can be had only of those things which have determinate truth. But, as is clear from <i>Interpretation</i>, future contingent events do not belong to this class of things. Consequently, they are not known by angels.

Ergo Angeli nullo modo futura contingentia cognoscunt.
          <td>3. Future events can be known only through a species of an artistic conception like that by which an artist knows the things he is going to make, or in their causes, as a future cold spell is known in the signs and positions of the stars. But angels do not know the future by means of artistic conceptions, because they do not make anything, nor do they know future things in their causes, since future contingent events are not determined in their causes. If they were, they would be necessary. There are no means, therefore, by which angels know future contingent events.

Quidam vero futuri effectus in causis suis non sunt determinate, ut aliter evenire non possit; sed tamen eorum causae magis se habent ad unum quam ad alterum; et ista sunt contingentia, quae ut in pluribus vel paucioribus accidunt; et huiusmodi effectus in causis suis non possunt cognosci infallibiliter, sed cum quadam certitudine coniecturae. Quidam autem effectus futuri sunt quorum causae indifferenter se habent ad utrumque; haec autem vocantur contingentia ad utrumlibet, ut sunt illa praecipue quae dependent ex libero arbitrio.
          <td>Anything that is known in another thing is known according to the manner in which it exists in that other. Now, some future events are determined in their proximate causes in such a way as to happen necessarily from them, for example, tomorrow’s rising of the sun. Future effects of this sort can be known in their causes. Other future effects, however, do not exist so determinately in their causes that something else might not happen; their causes are merely disposed more to one effect than to another; and these effects are contingent events, which happen more or less often as the case may be. As a consequence, effects of this type cannot be known in their causes with infallibility, but only with conjectural certitude. Moreover, other future effects come from causes that are indifferently related to opposite effects; and these effects, especially those that depend upon free choice, are called “contingent to opposites.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed quia ex causa ad utrumlibet, cum sit quasi in potentia, non progreditur aliquis effectus, nisi per aliquam aliam causam determinetur magis ad unum quam ad aliud, ut probat Commentator in II Phys.; ideo huiusmodi effectus in causis quidem ad utrumlibet nullo modo cognosci possunt per se acceptis. Sed si adiungantur causae illae quae causas ad utrumlibet inclinant magis ad unum quam ad aliud, potest aliqua certitudo coniecturalis de effectibus praedictis haberi: sicut de his quae ex libero arbitrio dependent, aliqua futura coniicimus ex consuetudinibus et complexionibus hominum, quibus inclinantur ad unum.
          <td>Now, as the Commentator proves, an effect cannot come from a cause indifferent to opposites and in a certain respect in potency, unless this cause is determined to one cffcct more than to another by means of another cause. Consequently, an effect of this sort cannot be known in any way through causes indifferent to opposites if these causes be taken merely by themselves. Yet, if we consider these causes, which are indifferent to opposites, together with those things that incline them more to one effect than to another, we can get some conjectural certitude about their effects. For example, we can conjecture about future effects depending upon free choice by considering men’s habits and temperaments, which incline them to one course of action.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Omnes autem huiusmodi effectus, qualescumque sint eorum causae proximae, tamen in causa prima omnes sunt determinati, quae sua praesentia omnia intuetur, et sua providentia omnibus modum apponit. Angeli autem et divinam essentiam intuentur, et per formas innatas cognitionem omnium rerum et causarum naturalium habent. Cognitione igitur naturali quae est per formas innatas illa tantum futura praescire possunt quae in causis naturalibus sunt determinata, vel in una tantum causa, vel in collectione plurium; quia aliquid est contingens respectu unius causae quod respectu concursus plurium causarum est necessarium. Angeli autem omnes naturales causas cognoscunt; unde quaedam quae contingentia videntur, aliquibus causis eorum pensatis, Angeli ut necessaria cognoscunt, dum omnes causas ipsorum cognoscunt. Si autem divinam providentiam comprehenderent, omnes futuros eventus certitudinaliter scirent. Sed quia quidam perfectius aliis divinam providentiam intuentur, quamvis nullus eorum perfecte comprehendat, ideo quidam in verbo plura futura etiam de contingentibus ad utrumlibet, aliis sciunt.
          <td>But all these future effects, no matter what their proximate causes may be, exist determinately in the first cause, which by its presence sees them all, and by its providence gives a determinate character to each. Now, the angels see the divine essence and, by means of innate forms, know all thing§ and all natural causes. By their natural knowledge, therefore, they can foreknow by their innate forms only those future events which have determinate existence in a natural cause, whether this cause be merely one thing or a collection of many things —for an effect may be contingent with respect to one cause but necessary with respect to a concurrence of many. And since angels know all natural causes, some effects that seem contingent to us, who consider only a few causes, are known as necessary by the angels, who consider all their causes. Indeed, if angels could comprehend God’s providence, they would know all future events with certainty. None of them, however, comprehends His providence perfectly; but because some of them see it more perfectly than others do, they know more future events in the Word, even those coming from causes indifferent to opposites, than others know.

          <td>1. Species within an angelic intellect are not related equally to the present and future, because things that are present are actually similar to the forms existing within the angels and, consequently, can be known by their means. Things that are future, however, are not yet similar to these forms and thus, as explained earlier, cannot be known through them.

          <td>2. Angels are related indifferently to the knowledge of the present and future as far as the vision by which they see things in the Word is concerned. Yet it does not follow that they know all future events in the Word, because they do not comprehend the Word.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod sicut Augustinus narrat, XII super Genes. ad litteram, quidam posuerunt quod anima in seipsa quamdam vim divinationis habet. Sed hoc Augustinus ibidem reprobat, quia si per seipsam posset futura praedicere, semper esset praescia futurorum. Nunc autem videmus, quod non est in potestate sua cognitionem futurorum habere quandocumque voluerit, quamvis aliquando praesciat; unde oportet quod adiutorio alicuius eveniat quod futura cognoscit. Adiuvatur autem aliquo superiori spiritu, increato vel creato, bono vel malo. Et quia mole corporis aggravatur, et dum sensibilibus intendit, minus est intelligibilium capax; ideo quando a sensibus abstrahitur vel per somnum vel per aegritudinem, vel quocumque alio modo, fit ex hoc magis idonea ad impressionem superioris spiritus recipiendam. Et ideo dum praedicto modo a nexibus corporis absolvitur, futura praenoscit, aliquo spiritu revelante, qui ea futura revelare potest quae praescit vel naturali cognitione, vel in verbo, ut dictum est.
          <td>3. As Augustine tells us, some asserted that “the soul has powers of divination in itself.” He refuted this opinion on the grounds that, if the soul could foretell the future by its own means, it would always know future events; but we know that, even if the soul does have foreknowledge at some times, it is unable to know the future whenever it wishes. Consequently, it must need some help in order to know the future. It can be helped by a higher spirit, created or uncreated, good or evil. Moreover, while it is burdened with the weight of a body and fixes its attention on sense-objects, it is less capable of receiving such thoughts. Hence, when it withdraws from the senses, either in sleep or in sickness or by any other way, it thereby becomes more susceptible to the influence of the higher spirit. So, being severed in this manner from its physical connections, the soul foreknows the future with the help of a revelation by a higher spirit, who can reveal these future things, because, as has been said, he knows them either by his natural knowledge or in the Word.

Est autem alia potentia obedientiae, secundum quam in creatura fieri potest quidquid in ea fieri voluerit creator; et sic intellectus possibilis est in potentia ad futura quaelibet cognoscenda, inquantum ei scilicet possunt divinitus revelari. Talis autem potentia intellectus angelici non est totaliter completa per formas innatas.
          <td>4. There are two kinds of potency. One is natural and can be reduced to act by a natural agent. This potency in angels is completely actuated by innate forms. It is not according to this kind of potency, however, that our possible intellect is in potency to knowing all future things. But there is another potency, obediential potency, according to which the Creator can cause whatever He wants to cause in a creature. The possible intellect is in this kind of potency to the knowledge of all future things, that is, all things can be divinely revealed to it. However, the obediential potency of the angelic intellect is not totally actuated by means of innate forms.

Ergo Angeli cogitationes nostras cognoscunt.
          <td>4. Man never knows without a phantasm. But angels know the phantasms in our imagination. Consequently, Augustine says: “The spiritual likenesses of material things existing within our soul are known to spirits, even to unclean spirits.” Therefore, angels know our thoughts.

          <td>6. Augustine says: “Demons sometimes learn men’s dispositions with the greatest ease, not only when they are expressed by speech, but even when conceived in thought and expressed by the soul through certain signs in the body.” Now, there is no thought that does not leave a trace on the body. Consequently, the demons know all our thoughts, and much more so do the angels.

          <td>7. Commenting on that verse in the Epistle to the Romans (2:15), “...their thoughts between themselves accusing or also defending one another,” Origen says that this passage should be understood as referring to thoughts which, during their existence, left marks on those who had them. Consequently, every thought leaves some mark on the soul. Now, this mark cannot be unknown to an angel, because he sees the whole soul. Hence, angels know our thoughts.

Ad hoc enim quod mens aliquid actu cogitet, requiritur intentio voluntatis, qua mens convertatur actu ad speciem quam habet, ut patet per Augustinum in Lib. de Trin. Motus autem voluntatis alterius non potest Angelo notus esse naturali cognitione, quia Angelus naturaliter cognoscit per formas sibi inditas, quae sunt similitudines rerum in natura existentium; motus autem voluntatis non habet dependentiam nec connexionem ad aliquam causam naturalem, sed solum ad causam divinam, quae in voluntatem sola imprimere potest. Unde motus voluntatis et cordis cogitatio non potest cognosci in aliquibus similitudinibus rerum naturalium, sed solum in essentia divina, quae in voluntatem imprimit. Et sic Angeli non possunt cognoscere cogitationes cordium directe, nisi in verbo ei reveletur.
          <td>Of themselves angels cannot see the thoughts of the heart directly; for, in order that the mind actually think something, the will must make an intention moving the mind to act with respect to its mental species. This is clear from what Augustine has said. Now, an angel cannot naturally know the motion in the will of another person, because he naturally knows by means of forms that have been given him, and these are likenesses of things existing in nature. The motion of the will, however, has no dependence on or connection with any natural cause. It is the divine cause alone that can influence the will. Consequently, the will’s motion and the heart’s thoughts can be known, not by any likenesses of natural things, but only in the divine essence, which leaves its imprint on the will. Thus, angels cannot know the thoughts of the heart directly, but only if they are revealed to them in the Word.

Per hunc enim modum etiam medici quandoque possunt passionem cordis cognoscere. Alio modo inquantum ex actuali cogitatione aliquis meretur vel demeretur; et sic mutatur quodammodo status agentis vel cogitantis in bonum vel in malum. Et hanc dispositionum mutationem Angeli cognoscunt. Sed tamen ex hoc non cognoscitur cogitatio nisi in generali; ex multis enim diversis cogitationibus eodem modo aliquis meretur vel demeretur, gaudet vel tristatur.
          <td>Sometimes, however, an angel can indirectly come to know the heart’s thoughts, and this can happen in two ways. First, it happens inasmuch as a motion in the body results from an actual thought, as when one is affected by joy or sadness from what he thinks, and his heart is moved in some way or other. By this means, even doctors can sometimes know what a heart is experiencing. Second, an angel can know thoughts in so far as a person gains or loses merit from what he is actually thinking; for thus the doer’s or thinker’s condition is somehow changed for good or for evil, and angels can know this change in his condition. But this gives only a general knowledge of what was thought, because, as a result of many different thoughts, a person can merit or demerit, be joyful or sorrowful, in the same way.

Unde etsi Angelus videat intellectum nostrum figurari secundum speciem hominis, non sequitur quod cogitationem cordis determinate cognoscat.
          <td>2. From one species which the intellect has within itself, many distinct thoughts arise—just as we can think many different things about man from the one species we have of man. Consequently, even if an angel sees our intellect shaped to the species of man, it does not follow that he knows determinately what the heart is thinking about.

          <td>3. We do not actually think of all the things whose species we have within us, because sometimes species are in us only in the state of habit. Consequently, from the fact that the species in our intellects are seen by angels it does not follow that they know our thoughts.

Unde et ibidem, Augustinus subdit: si Daemones internam virtutum speciem possent in hominibus cernere, non tentarent.
          <td>4. By means of the same phantasms, our reason can direct its thought to different objects. Consequently, even should one know the phantasms by which the soul thinks, it would not follow that he knew the thoughts themselves. Thus, Augustine says: “If demons could see clearly a man’s internal thought, arising from his virtues, they would not tempt him.”

          <td>5. As a consequence of an angel’s action, we may be made capable of thinking certain things; but in order to think something actually, we must make an act of the will, and this by no means depends upon an angel. Consequently, even though angels can know our intellect’s power, that is, the power by which we can speculate about intelligible things, it does not follow that they know our actual thoughts.

          <td>6. Bodily motion, found in the passions of the soul, does not follow all knowledge but only practical knowledge. For, as is said in <i>The Soul</i>, when we consider something speculatively, we are related to the things we are considering “as though we were looking at them in pictures.” Moreover, even when bodily motion does take place, it indicates thought only in a general way, as we have said.

          <td>3. An angel’s intellect is stronger than the common sense. But the common sense apprehends many things at the same time, because its object is number, whose parts are many unities. Consequently, it is even truer to say that an angel can know many things simultaneously.

Ergo sive cognoscat res in verbo, sive per species proprias, potest simul multa cognoscere.
          <td>4. That which belongs to an angel by reason of his natural power belongs to him no matter by what medium he understands. Now, in virtue of his nature it belongs to an angel to understand many things. For this reason, Augustine says: “The spiritual power of an angelic mind can with ease intellectually comprehend at the same time all that it wills. Therefore, no matter whether an angel knows things in the Word or through individual species, he still can know many things at one time.

Ergo multo fortius intellectus Angeli potest simul formari diversis formis; et ita potest simul multa intelligere.
          <td>8. An angel’s mind is much more spiritual than air. But because of air’s spirituality, many distinct forms, such as black and white, can exist in it simultaneously. For example, a black thing and a white thing can be so situated that lines drawn from the eyes of different people to these things will intersect at one point, through which the species of black and of white will pass simultaneously. Therefore, it is even truer to say that an angelic intellect can be simultaneously actuated by distinct forms. Hence, it can know many things at once.

          <td>9. The intellect is reduced to the act of understanding by means of species which it has within itself. Now, many species exist simultaneously in an angelic intellect, for, as is said in <i>The Causes</i>: “an intelligence is filled with forms.” Consequently, an angel understands many things at the same time.

          <td>11. More distance lies between the divine essence and created forms than between one created form and another. Now, angels understand simultaneously through the divine essence and through a created form, because they always see things in the Word, and, unless they knew things at the same time through innate species, they would never understand them by means of these species. Much more possible is it, then, for an angel to understand by means of different created innate forms at the same time and in this way understand many things simultaneously.

But every action in which <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> are found involves time; and, therefore, the characteristic action of an angel would be circumscribed by time. This is contrary, however, to <i>The Causes,</i> where we read: “An intelligence is a thing whose substance and operation are above time.”

          <td>13. The reason for our intellect’s not being able to know many things simultaneously seems to be this, that it understands things dependently on time and space. Neither of these, however, belongs to an angelic intellect, because it does not receive from the senses. Consequently, it can understand many things at the same time.

          <td>14. Since forms in the intellect are second perfections, they are accidental forms. Now, many accidental forms can exist in the same subject if they are not contraries, as whiteness and blackness are. Therefore, an angel’s intellect can also be informed by many different forms at the same time, as long as they are not contraries. Thus, it can know many things at the same time.

Formae quidem quae sunt diversorum generum, diversas potentias respiciunt; cum unitas generis ex unitate materiae sive potentiae procedat secundum philosophum. Unde possibile est idem subiectum simul perfici diversis formis diversorum generum: quia tunc una potentia non determinabitur ad diversos actus, sed diversae; sicut si aliquod corpus est simul album et dulce, albedo inest ei secundum quod participat de natura diaphani, dulcedo autem secundum naturam humidi. Formae vero quae sunt unius generis, unam potentiam respiciunt; sive sint contrariae, ut albedo et nigredo; sive non, ut triangulus et quadratum.
          <td>It should be observed, therefore, that some forms belong to one genus, others belong to different genera, and the forms belonging to different genera are related to different potencies. Now, as the Philosopher says, the unity of a genus is determined by the unity of matter or of potency. Consequently, it is possible for the same subject to be perfected simultaneously by forms belonging to different genera, because then the one potency would not be terminating in different acts but differently. For example, if a body is both white and sweet at the same time, it has whiteness in it in so far as it shares the nature of the transparent medium, and sweetness in so far as it shares the nature of the moist. But forms belonging to one genus are related to one potency, whether they be contraries (as blackness and whiteness) or not contraries (as triangle and square).

          <td>Hae igitur formae in subiecto tripliciter esse dicuntur. Uno modo in potentia tantum; et sic sunt simul, quia una potentia est contrariorum, et diversarum formarum unius generis.

Tertio modo ut in actu perfecto, ut cum iam albedo est in termino dealbationis; et sic impossibile est duas formas unius generis esse simul in eodem subiecto. Oporteret enim eamdem potentiam ad diversos actus terminari: quod est impossibile, sicut et unam lineam ex una parte terminari ad diversa puncta.
          <td>Now, these forms are said to be in a subject in three ways. In the first, they exist only potentially and, consequently, simultaneously, because one potency has for its object different forms of one genus and their contraries. In the second, they exist in imperfect act, so that they are coming into being. In this manner, they can also exist simultaneously. This is evident in the case of one who becomes white; for, during the whole period of alteration, whiteness inheres in him as something coming into being, and blackness as something going out of being. In the third, they exist in perfect act, as whiteness does when the whitening process is finished. In this manner, it is impossible for two forms belonging to the same genus to be present simultaneously in the same subject, because the same potency would have to terminate in different acts; and this is just as impossible as it is for one line, beginning from one point, to be terminated at different points.

          <td>We should understand, therefore, that all intelligible forms belong to one genus, even if the things, whose forms they are, belong to different genera, because all intelligible forms are related to an intellectual potency. Consequently, in the intellect they can all simultaneously exist in potency, as well as in incomplete act—a mean between potency and perfect act. This latter condition is that had by a species which is present habitually, for habit is a mean between potency and act.

Hence, it is impossible for the intellect to understand actually according to different forms taken together at one time. Therefore, all the different things which it understands by different forms cannot be understood at one time, but all that is understood by the same form will be understood at one time. Consequently, an angelic intellect can understand simultaneously all that it understands through the one essence of the Word, but the things it understands through innate forms (which are numerous) it cannot understand simultaneously if its understanding is through different forms. Any angel, however, through the same form, can understand many things, at least all the singulars of a species by means of one form of that species. Indeed, the higher angels can understand more through one species than the lower angels can. Hence, they are more able to understand many things at one time.

Et sic etiam intellectus quando considerat propositionem, considerat multa ut unum; et ideo inquantum sunt unum, simul intelliguntur, dum intelligitur una propositio quae ex eis constat; sed inquantum sunt multa, non possunt simul intelligi, ut scilicet intellectus simul se convertat ad rationes singulorum secundum se intuendas. Unde philosophus dicit in VI Metaph. dico autem simul et separatim intelligere affirmationem vel negationem, quasi non deinde, sed unum quid sit. Non enim simul intelliguntur inquantum habent ordinem distinctionis ad invicem, sed inquantum uniuntur in una propositione.
          <td>We should remember, however, that a thing can be one in one respect and many in another. For example, a continuum is actually one but potentially many. Now, if the intellect or sense is directed to a thing of this sort in so far as it is one, it is seen at one time, but if the same powers are directed to it in so far as it is many (and this would be to consider each part by itself), then the whole could not be seen simultaneously. Similarly, when our intellect considers a proposition, it considers many things as one. Hence, in so far as the things are one, many things are understood at one time when the one proposition made up of them is understood; but, in so far as they are many, they cannot be understood at one time, because this would mean that the intellect can simultaneously turn itself to understanding the intelligible characters of each one of them taken in itself. Consequently, the Philosopher says: “I mean, however, by understanding things ‘together’ or ‘apart’ in an affirmation or negation that they are not understood in succession but as one thing.” For they cannot be understood simultaneously in so far as a relation of distinctness exists between them, but they can be understood simultaneously in so far as they are united in one proposition.

Unde anima nostra non semper actualiter se intelligit; sed mens Angeli semper actualiter se intelligit: quod ideo contingit, quia mens Angeli intelligit se per essentiam suam, qua semper informatur, mens autem nostra forte intelligit quodammodo per intentionem. Nec tamen cum mens Angeli se intelligit et aliquid aliud, intelligit simul multa nisi ut unum; quod sic patet.
          <td>6. Augustine himself later explains” that his statement, “Our mind always remembers, understands, and wills itself,” refers to internal memory. Consequently, our soul does not always actually understand itself. An angelic mind, however, always understands itself actually. This is due to the fact that an angelic mind understands itself through its essence, which always informs it. Our act of understanding, however, might be said to depend in a certain sense on the intention of our will. Nevertheless, even though an angel’s mind in some way understands itself and some other thing, it does not simultaneously understand many things except as they are one. This will be clear from the following.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si enim aliqua duo ita se habeant quod unum sit ratio intelligendi aliud, unum eorum erit quasi formale, et aliud quasi materiale; et sic illa duo sunt unum intelligibile, cum ex forma et materia unum constituatur. Unde intellectus quando intelligit aliquid per alterum, intelligit unum tantum intelligibile, sicut patet in visu: lumen enim est quo videtur color, unde se habet ad colorem ut formale; et sic color et lumen sunt unum tantum visibile, et simul a visu videntur. Essentia autem Angeli est ei ratio cognoscendi omne quod cognoscit, quamvis non perfecta, propter quod formis superadditis indiget: cognoscit enim omnia per modum substantiae suae, ut dicitur in Lib. de causis, et secundum propriam virtutem et naturam, ut dicit Dionysius, cap. VII de Divin. Nomin. Unde cum intelligit se et alia, non intelligit simul multa nisi ut unum.
          <td>If any two things are so related that one of them is the reason why the other can be understood, one of them will be, as it were, formal, the other, as it were, material. Thus, those two constitute one intelligible, because matter and form constitute one thing. Consequently, when the intellect understands one thing through another, it understands only one intelligible. This is evidently the case with sight. For light is that by which color is seen, and so is related to color, in a manner of speaking, as its formal element. Thus, color and light constitute only one visible thing and are seen simultaneously by sight. Now, an angel’s essence is his means for knowing all that he knows, even though it is not a perfect means and, for this reason, needs forms to be given it. For he knows all things according to the mode of his substance, as <i>The Causes</i> states, and according to his power and nature, as Dionysius says. Consequently, when he understands himself and other things, he cannot understand many things except as they are one.

Operationes vero quae statim habent suam speciem completam, non mensurantur tempore, nisi per accidens, sicut intelligere, sentire, et huiusmodi; unde philosophus dicit in X Ethic., quod delectari non est in tempore. Per accidens autem in tempore possunt esse tales operationes, inquantum motui coniunguntur in natura tempori subiecta existentes, quae est natura corporea generabilis et corruptibilis, qua ut organo potentiae sensitivae utuntur, a quibus etiam noster intellectus accipit. Unde patet, quod ipsum intelligere Angeli neque per se neque per accidens cadit sub tempore. Unde in una eius operatione qua intelligit unum intelligibile, non est prius et posterius. Sed hoc non prohibet quin plures operationes possint esse ordinatae secundum prius et posterius.
          <td>12. Any operation essentially involves time if it needs some future thing to complete its species. This is evidently the case with motion, which does not have a complete species until it is carried through to a term, because the motion which would end at mid-point would be specifically different from that which would terminate at the extreme. On the other hand, operations which have their complete species immediately are not measured by time except for another reason. Examples of such are understanding, sensing, and the like. For this reason, the Philosopher says14 that delight is not in time. By exception, however, these operations can be in time, in so far as they are joined to motion by existing in natures subject to time, namely, physical natures which come into and go out of existence. Our sensitive powers use organs, which are of this nature, and our intellect receives from them. But it is clear that an angel’s act of understanding involves time neither intrinsically nor extrinsically. Therefore, there is no <i>before</i> and <i>after</i> in an act by which he understands one intelligible. Nevertheless, this does not prevent a number of operations from being ordered accor ing to <i>before</i> and <i>after.</i>

The angelic intellect is not similarly related to all the forms it has within itself, because sometimes it is in perfect act with regard to one form but not with regard to the others.

Similarly, an intellect perfected by a form can be simultaneously directed to the different things to which that form’s representative power extends.

Consequently, discourse takes place here,. as it evidently takes place in demonstrations. For the intellect is first directed only to principles, then it is directed through the principles to conclusions. From the moment of their creation, however, the intellects of angels are perfected by innate forms giving them all the natural knowledge to which their intellectual powers extend, just as the matter of celestial bodies is completely terminated by its form, with the result that it no longer remains in potency to another form. For this reason, <i>The Causes</i> states: “An intelligence is filled with forms.” Now, it would not be filled with forms unless its entire potentialities were actuated by forms. Therefore, an intelligence is ignorant of none of the things that it can know naturally.

Unde oportet quod in intellectu nostro sint quaedam quae intellectus naturaliter cognoscit, scilicet prima principia, quamvis etiam ista cognitio in nobis non determinetur nisi per acceptionem a sensibus.

It remains perfectible, nor could it reduce itself from potency to act had not its knowledge with respect to some things been actuated by nature. Consequently, there necessarily are some things in our intellect which it knows naturally, namely, first principles—even though in us this knowledge is not caused unless we receive something through our senses. Therefore, the relation of our intellect to those principles is similar to that which an angel has to all that he knows naturally. And since the knowledge we have of principles is the highest form of our knowledge, it is evident that on this summit of our nature we reach to some extent the lowest point of an angel’s. For, as Dionysius says: “The divine wisdom has linked the boundaries of the first creatures to the place where the second begin.” Consequently, just as we know principles by simple intuition without discourse, so do the angels know all they know in the same fashion. This is why they are called “intellectual,” and why our habit of principles has the same name.

Et sic triplicem motum et in Angelis et in animabus distinguit Dionysius, quantum ad cognitionem divinam: scilicet circularem, obliquum et rectum, secundum hanc similitudinem. Circularis enim motus est totaliter uniformis, tum propter aequidistantiam omnium partium circuli a centro, tum propter hoc quod in motu circulari non est assignare magis ex una parte quam ex altera principium et finem. Motus autem rectus est difformis, tum ex proprietate lineae (cum partes non aequaliter distant ab uno puncto signato), tum ex parte motus qui habet principium et finem signatum.

          <td>3. The motion of which Dionysius speaks is not taken to mean the passage from one thing to another. It is motion merely in that sense in which all operations are called motions, just as understanding and sensing are called motions. Consequently, Dionysius distinguishes three kinds of motions in souls and in angels as regards their knowledge of God:circular, oblique, and straight—using these as metaphors. Now, circular motion is perfectly uniform, because all the parts of a circle are equidistant from its center, and because it cannot be said that one part of a circular motion is its beginning or end more than any other. Straight motion, however, is not uniform, because as a line its parts are not equidistant from a designated point, and as motion it has a designated beginning and end. Oblique motion possesses uniformity in so far as it agrees with circular motion, but lacks uniformity in so far as it agrees with straight motion.

          <td>Non est autem idem motus uniformitatis et difformitatis in Angelo et anima; unde diversimode hos motus in utroque distinguit.

Et ideo dicit quod Angeli moventur circulariter, unite, sine principiis, et interminabilibus illuminationibus pulchri et boni;
          <td>Now, there is not the same manner of uniformity and non-uniformity in an angel and in a soul. Consequently, Dionysius distinguishes between these motions as found in each. In the act of knowing God, an angel does not direct his cognition to many different things but fixes it on God alone. In this regard, he is said to be moved about God, as it were, in a circular motion, because he does not arrive at God as at the end of cognition that had its beginning from some principle of cognition, but [his knowledge is] like a circle, without a beginning or end. Hence Dionysius says that angels are moved “in a circular motion which is simple, without beginnings, and rich with everlasting illuminations of the good and the beautiful.”

          <td>These divine illuminations coming into the minds of the angels are to be understood as though they were lines coming from the center of a circle to its circumference and in some way constituting the substance of the circumference. Then, the knowledge which God has of Himself is compared to the center of the circle, and the knowledge which the angel has of God is compared to the circle itself, which imitates the unity of its center but falls short of achieving it.

Obliquum vero motum ponit quasi compositum ex utroque: inquantum scilicet, ipsi in unitate divinae cognitionis permanentes exeunt per actionem in alios reducendos in Deum; unde dicit quod oblique moventur, quando providentes minus habentibus, inegressibiliter manent in identitate circa identitatis causam.
          <td>Non-uniformity in an angel’s knowledge of God is not to be found in the knowledge itself but only in its communication, that is, in so far as he passes on his knowledge of God to others. This action Dionysius assigns to the angels’ straight movement, saying: “Their motion is straight when, passing directly over all things, they go forth to provide for all who are entrusted to them.” Moreover, he calls that motion of theirs oblique which is, as it were, made up of both of the afore-mentioned motions—the motion which occurs when, remaining united to God in knowledge, they go forth in action to lead others back to Him. Hence, he says: “They are moved obliquely when, while caring for those who have less, they nevertheless remain unmoved in uninterruptible union with the cause of union.”
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed in anima etiam quantum ad ipsam divinam cognitionem invenitur uniformitas et difformitas. Tribus enim modis anima movetur in Deum.

Unde dicit, quod in directum movetur anima, quando ad ea quae sunt circa seipsam progreditur, et ab exterioribus, sicut a quibusdam signis variatis et multiplicatis ad simplices et unitas sursum agitur contemplationes. Alio modo movetur in Deum ex illuminationibus a Deo receptis; quas tamen recipit secundum modum suum sensibilibus figuris velatas, sicut Isaias vidit dominum sedentem super solium excelsum et elevatum: et hic motus est obliquus, habens aliquid de uniformitate ex parte divinae illuminationis, et aliquid de difformitate ex parte sensibilium figurarum. Unde dicit, quod oblique movetur anima, inquantum secundum proprietatem suam divinis illuminatur cognitionibus, non intellectualiter et singulariter, sed rationaliter et diffuse. Tertius modus est quando anima a se omnia sensibilia abiicit, supra omnia Deum cogitans, et etiam supra seipsam; et sic ab omni difformitate separatur; unde est motus circularis. Unde dicit, quod animae circularis motus est introitus ad seipsam ab exterioribus, et intellectualium virtutum ipsius convolutio; et quod deinde, iam uniformis facta, unitur unitis virtutibus, et sic manuducitur ad id quod est super omnia.
          <td>However, uniformity and non-uniformity are also found in the soul’s knowledge of God, because a soul is moved towards God in three ways. In the first, by looking upon the visible things that have been made, the soul sees the invisible things of God. This motion is straight. Consequently, Dionysius says: “The motion of the soul is straight when the soul goes forth to the things which lie around it, and from external things, as from varied and multiple signs, is lifted up to simple and unified contemplation.” The soul is moved toward God in a second way by the illuminations it receives from Him. These, however, it receives in accordance with its own manner of existence, that is, they are veiled in sensible figures. For example, Isaiah saw “the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated” (Isaiah 6:1). This motion is oblique, having something of uniformity from God’s illumination and something of non-uniformity from the sensible figures. Hence, Dionysius says: “The soul is moved obliquely in so far as it is illumincd by divine thoughts according to its nature—not, indeed, intellectually and intuitively, but rationally and discursively.” Moreover, the soul is moved in a third way when it turns away from all sense objects by thinking of God as being above all things, even above itself. In this way, it is separated from any non-uniformity, and therefore it is circular motion. Hence, Dionysius says: “The circular motion of the soul takes place when, withdrawing from external things, the soul enters into itself and reflects by its intellectual powers. Finally, it is made uniform and enters into union with its united powers. In this way, it is led to that which is above all things.”

          <td>3. Evening knowledge is that by which things are known in their own nature.

Therefore, knowledge of things in the Word cannot properly be called morning knowledge.

          <td>6. Knowledge of things that are to be created comes before that of things that are already created. Now, evening knowledge comes before morning knowledge, as is clear from the words of Genesis (1:5): “There was evening and morning one day.” Consequently, it is not proper to distinguish evening knowledge from morning knowledge so that the former means knowledge of things already made, and the latter, of things to be made.

          <td>7. Augustine compares the knowledge of things in the Word to the knowledge had from an artistic concept, and that of them in their own nature to the knowledge had from the work of art itself. He also compares these two types of knowledge to the knowledge had of a line which is mentally conceived and to that which is had of a line written in dust. But these distinctions do not involve different genera of knowledge. Consequently, knowledge of things in the Word and in their proper nature are not two types of knowledge. Hence, morning and eveninLy knowledue are not distinct.

          <td>8. As soon as he was created, an angel knew with morning knowledge. However, he did not know the Word, because he was not created in the state of beatitude, and the sight of the Word is the act of beatitude.

          <td>10. Augustine says: “When a mind, strong and vigorous, sees that first truth, it forgets all other things.” Therefore, when it sees the Word, it sees nothing else in it. Consequently, the morning knowledge of angels cannot be called the knowledge of things in the Word.

But knowledge of things had in the Word is less clear than that of things in their own nature, because things are in the Word only in a certain respect, but in their own nature without any qualification.

Sicut enim praesentatio lucis corporalis super haec inferiora diem facit temporalem, sic praesentatio vel comparatio luminis intellectus angelici ad res creatas diem spiritualem facit. Et secundum hoc multi dies distinguuntur, quod intellectus Angeli diversis rerum generibus cognoscendis comparatur, ut sic ordo dierum non sit ordo temporis, sed ordo naturae, qui in cognitione Angeli attenditur secundum ordinem cognitorum ad invicem, prout alterum altero est prius natura. Sicut autem in die temporali mane est diei principium, vespere vero finis, ita in cognitione Angeli respectu eiusdem rei est considerare principium et finem secundum ordinem rei cognitae. Principium autem cuiuslibet rei est in sua causa a qua fluit; terminus autem esse ipsius est in ipsa re ad quam actio causae producentis terminatur. Unde primitiva alicuius rei cognitio est secundum quod consideratur in causa sua, quae est verbum aeternum; unde cognitio rerum in verbo dicitur cognitio matutina. Ultima autem rei cognitio est secundum quod cognoscitur in seipsa; et talis cognitio dicitur vespertina.
          <td>The expression “morning and evening knowledge” was introduced by Augustine so that he could hold that the things we read about as having been made in the first six days were really completed without any succession of time. Consequently, he wanted those days to be understood as referring, not to distinct times, but to distinct angelic cognitions. For, just as the presence of physical light on things here below makes a day in the temporal sense, so does the presence or operation of light from an angelic intellect on created things make a day in the spiritual sense. Consequently, as many days can be distinguished as there are relations from angelic intellects to the different classes of things to be known. Taken in this way, the order of a day would not be an order of time but an order of nature, and this would be found in angelic knowledge according to the order that the known things have to each other, that is, according as one thing is prior by nature to another. Moreover, just as morning is the beginning of a temporal day and evening its end, so the beginning and end of an angel’s knowledge of some one thing would be determined by the order in that thing. Now, the beginning of anything is to be found in the cause from which it issues; its end, in the thing itself, because it is in this that the action of the productive cause terminates. Hence, the first knowledge to be had of a thing is that in which it is considered in its cause, the eternal Word. For this reason, the knowledge of things in the Word is called morning knowledge. The last knowledge to be had of a thing is that in which it is known in itself. This is called evening knowledge.

Et ideo oportet hanc distinctionem intelligi ex parte medii cognoscendi; ut dicatur res cognosci in verbo, quando per verbum ipsa res in propria natura cognoscitur; in propria vero natura, quando cognoscitur per formas aliquas creatas rebus creatis proportionatas, sicut cum cognoscit per formas sibi inditas; vel etiam si per formas acquisitas cognosceret, quantum ad hoc pertinet, nihil differret.
          <td>It should be understood, however, that that distinction can have two meanings. First, it can refer to a distinction in the thing known; second, it can refer to a distinction in the medium of knowledge. Taking the distinction in the first way, we can say that a thing is said to be known in the Word when the being it has in the Word is known; and it is said to be known in its own nature in so far as the being which it has in itself is known. But this way of understanding causes Difficulties, because the being which it has in the Word is not other than that of the Word itself, since, as Anselm says, the creature in the Creator is simply the creative essence. Hence, to know a creature in the Word in this manner is to know, not the creature, but rather the Creator Consequently, this distinction between morning and evening knowl edge must be referred to the medium of knowledge. Accordingly, a thing will be said to be known in the Word when it is known in its own nature through the Word; and it will be said to be known in its own nature when it is known by means of some created forms proportioned to created things, as things are known [to angels] by innate forms or by acquired forms—if, indeed, angels did know by acquired forms, but it would make no difference as far as the present problem is concerned.

          <td>1. The figure of evening and morning in angelic knowledge is not based on the fact that there are shadows in the morning and evening of a temporal day, but, as has been said, on the fact that these two have the nature of a beginning and end. Or it can be said that all intellects, being created from nothing, are shadowy in comparison with the brightness of God’s intellect. They do, however, have some brightnes in so far as they imitate His intellect.

          <td>2. In the Word the angels know in the same way the things that are to be created and the things already created. But the way in which they know in the Word the things to be created differs from the way in which they know the individual natures of things already created when they know these latter by means of a similitude within them selves. It is according to this difference that their morning and evening knowledge are distinguished.

          <td>3. Even though things are more expressly represented in the Word than they are by the forms within an angel’s intellect, nevertheless, these forms are more proportioned to things and, in a way, conformed to them.

          <td>4. Just as one general science contains within itself different particular sciences by which different conclusions can be known, so also all the knowledge an angel has, being in some sense a whole, contains within itself morning and evening knowledge as, in a way, its parts—as a temporal day has morning and evening for its parts.

          <td>5. It is not necessary that spiritual things be like material things in all respects. Hence, knowledge of things in the Word is not called morning knowledge because it grows into greater knowledge, but, as has been said, because of its relation to an inferior knowledge.

Et ideo Genesi I vespere ante mane ponitur hac necessitate, quia opus primae diei est lux, quam Augustinus intelligit spiritualem, quae illuminatur per conversionem ad verbum. Angelus autem seipsum primo in seipso cognovit naturali cognitione; et se cognito, non in seipso permansit, quasi seipso fruens et in se finem ponens (sic enim nox factus esset, ut Angeli qui peccaverunt), sed cognitionem suam in Dei laudem retulit; et sic ex sui contemplatione conversus est in verbi contemplationem, in quo est mane sequentis diei, secundum quod in verbo accepit cognitionem sequentis creaturae, scilicet firmamenti. Sicut autem videmus in tempore continuo, quod idem nunc est duorum temporum, prout est finis praeteriti et principium futuri; ita matutina cognitio secundae diei est primae diei terminus, et secundae diei initium, et sic deinceps usque ad diem septimam.
          <td>6. Morning knowledge comes before evening knowledge if we consider the natural ordering found in one and the same thing. But, if we consider different things, evening knowledge of what is prior precedes morning knowledge of what is posterior, that is, as long as knowledge is considered from the viewpoint of what is prior and posterior in the things known. Consequently, in Genesis, evening is put before morning, because the work of the first day was light, which Augustine understands as a spiritual light enkindled by knowledge of the Word. By their natural knowledge, however, angels first knew themselves in themselves, and, having known themselves, they did not remain there to enjoy their own selves and, as it were, make themselves their own ends (for then they would have become “night”—as angels who sinned); instead, they turned their knowledge back to the praise of God. Hence, from contemplation of themselves angels turned to a contemplation of the Word, in whom existed the morning of the following day, inasmuch as the angels received knowledge in the Word of the creature that was to follow, namely, the firmament. Therefore, just as we see that in continuous time the same now belongs to two times, that is, it is the end of the past and the beginning of the future, so morning knowledge of the second day is the end of the first day and the beginning of the second, and so on until the seventh day is reached.

I, 5: factum est vespere et mane dies unus.
          <td>8. At the moment of his creation, an angel was not beatified and did not see the Word through His essence. Hence, he did not have morning knowledge, but first he had evening knowledge and from this progressed to morning. For this reason, the first day is expressly said not to have had a morning, but began as evening, and from evening passed into morning. The reason for this was that that spiritual light, namely, the angelic substance, made on the first day, knew himself as soon as he was made. This was his evening knowledge. Then he turned this knowledge to the praise of the Word, and in the Word his knowledge became morning knowledge. This is why Genesis (1:5) says: “And there was evening and morning one day.”

          <td>9. Evening and morning knowledge must be distinguished with respect to the medium of knowledge, not with respect to the thing that is known.

Uno modo ut habeant in se esse nobilius quam esse quod habent in verbo; quod falsum est: quia in seipsis habent esse creatum, in verbo autem increatum: et ita esse quod habent in seipsis, est secundum quid respectu illius quod habent in verbo. Alio modo ut res sit perfectius haec in seipsa quam in verbo; et hoc quodammodo verum est.

Cognitio autem sequitur formae repraesentationem; unde res, cum non sit in anima nisi secundum quid, per suam similitudinem, simpliciter tamen cognoscitur.
          <td>11. Knowledge of things in the Word is more perfect than that of them in their own nature, because the Word expresses each one of them more clearly than a created species does. Moreover, the statement that things exist more truly in themselves than they do in the Word can be understood in two ways. First, it can mean that the existence they have in themselves is more perfect than that which they have in the Word. But this is false, because in themselves they have a created act of existence, and in the Word, uncreated being. Consequently, the existence they have in themselves is existence only in a certain sense as compared with that which they have in the Word. Second, it can mean that the thing can be its individual self more perfectly in its own being than in the Word. This, to a certain extent, is true. For in itself a thing is material (at least materiality belongs to the’ nature of some things); in the Word, however, it is not material. There is merely a likeness of the thing’s matter and form in the Word. Although it is true that a thing in so far as it is such and such exists only in a certain fashion in the Word, nevertheless, it is known more perfectly through the Word than through itself, even in so far as it is such and.such a thing. The reason for this is that a thing’s own nature is more perfectly represented in the Word than it is in itself, and this despite the fact that it exists more truly in itself when it exists according to its own mode of existence. For knowledge follows the representation of the form. Hence, even though a thing is not in the soul except in a qualified sense, that is, by its likeness, it is known simply as a thing.

          <td>Ut enim dicit Augustinus, IV super Genesim ad litteram, cognitio vespertina est qua res cognoscitur in seipsa; matutina vero, cum refertur in laudem creatoris; et sic cognitio matutina videtur a vespertina distingui per relatum et non relatum. Sed praeter cognitionem creaturae in seipsa relatam ad verbum et non relatam, est accipere aliam creaturae cognitionem magis differentem ab eis quam altera istarum differat ab altera: scilicet cognitionem creaturarum in verbo. Ergo matutina et vespertina cognitio non sufficienter dividunt cognitionem angelicam.
          <td>1. Augustine says, that evening knowledge is that by which things are known in themselves, morning knowledge, that whereby things are referred to the praise of the Creator. Thus, morning knowledge seems to be distinguished from evening by means of distinguishing between related and non-related. But, besides this division of knowledge of creatures in themselves into knowledge related and not related to the Word, there is another knowledge of creatures—a knowledge that differs more from creatures than one of them differs from another—namely, the knowledge of creatures in the Word. Therefore, the division of angels’knowledge into morning and evening is not adequate.

          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus, II super Genes. ad litteram, ponit triplex esse creaturae: unum quod habet in verbo, aliud quod habet in propria natura, tertium quod habet in mente angelica. Sed penes primum esse et secundum accipitur cognitio matutina et vespertina. Ergo penes tertium debet accipi tertia eius cognitio.
          <td>2. Augustine says that a creature has three existences:one in the Word, a second in its own nature, a third in the mind of an angel. Now, the first two existences are included by morning and evening knowledge. Hence, the third should be included by a third type of knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, cognitio matutina et vespertina distinguitur per hoc quod est cognoscere res in verbo, et res in propria natura; et per hoc quod est cognoscere res factas et fiendas. Sed haec possunt quadrupliciter diversificari. Uno modo, ut dicantur cognoscere res fiendas in verbo; alio modo factas in verbo; tertio modo factas in propria natura; quarto fiendas in propria natura, quae quidem videtur esse inutilis coniugatio, quia in propria natura non cognoscitur aliquid antequam sit. Ergo saltem oportet tres esse cognitiones angelicas; et sic insufficienter distinguitur per duas.
          <td>3. Morning and evening knowledge are distinguished by this, that the first is knowledge of things in the Word, the second, knowledge of them in their own nature. They are also distinguished in so far as one is the knowledge of things to be created, the other, of things already created. This latter division, however, can be further divided in four ways. First, we can speak of knowing in the Word the things that will be created; second, of knowing in the Word things already created; third, of knowing in their own nature the things that are already created; fourth, of knowing in their own nature things that will be created. The last division, however, seems to be a useless addition, because a thing cannot be known in its own nature before it exists. At any rate, there should be at least three kinds of angelic knowledge. Hence, the twofold division is inadequate.

          <td>4. Angels’ morning and evening knowledge get their names from their resemblance to a temporal day. Now, in a temporal day, noon lies between morning and evening. Therefore, a noonday knowledge should be placed between morning and evening knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Angelus non solum cognoscit creaturas, sed etiam ipsum creatorem. Sed cognitio matutina et vespertina in Angelis distinguitur quantum ad cognitionem creaturae. Ergo praeter cognitionem vespertinam et matutinam est assignare cognitionem tertiam in Angelis.
          <td>5. Angels know not only creatures but the Creator Himself. But angels’ knowledge is divided into morning and evening only with reference to their knowledge of creatures. Consequently, we must assign a third knowledge to angels that is other than their morning and evening knowledge.

          <td>Praeterea, cognitio matutina et vespertina non pertinet nisi ad cognitionem gratiae; alias Angeli mali haberent cognitionem matutinam vel vespertinam: quod non videtur esse verum, cum in Daemonibus non sit dies, vespere autem et mane sint diei partes. Ergo, cum cognitio naturalis sit in Angelis praeter gratuitam, videtur quod sit in eis ponere tertiam cognitionem.
          <td>6. Morning and evening knowledge pertain only to knowledge had by grace; otherwise, bad angels would also have morning or evening knowledge. This does not seem true, however, because there is no day for demons, and evening and morning are parts of a day. Consequently, since angels’ natural knowledge is other than that which they have as a result of grace, it seems that we must assign a third type of knowledge to them.

          <td>Responsio. Dicendum, quod de cognitione matutina et vespertina dupliciter loqui possumus. Uno modo quantum ad id quod cognitionis est; et sic inter utramque cognitionem nihil cadit medium. Cognitio enim vespertina a matutina distinguitur, ut supra dictum est, per medium cognoscendi: quod quidem si creatum est, facit cognitionem vespertinam quocumque modo; si autem increatum, facit cognitionem matutinam. Non potest autem aliquid esse medium inter creatum et increatum.
          <td>We may speak of morning and evening knowledge in two ways First, we may speak of them simply in so far as they are knowledge. No mean can fall between the two types of knowledge, considered in this manner. For, as said previously, morning is distinguished from evening knowledge by means of the medium of knowing. If the medium is created, it causes evening knowledge, no matter how it is had. If the medium is uncreated, it causes morning knowledge. And there can be no mean between created and uncreated.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Si autem considerentur quantum ad rationem matutini et vespertini, sic cadit inter eas aliquod medium, duplici ratione. Primo, quia mane et vespere sunt partes diei; dies autem est in Angelis per illustrationem gratiae, secundum Augustinum: unde non se extendunt ultra cognitionem gratuitam bonorum Angelorum; et sic naturalis cognitio est praeter has duas. Secundo, quia vespere, inquantum huiusmodi, terminatur ad mane, et mane ad vespere; unde cognitio rerum in propria natura, non quaelibet potest dici vespertina, sed illa tantum quae refertur in laudem creatoris: sic enim vespere redit ad mane. Et sic cognitio Daemonum quam habent de rebus, nec est matutina, nec vespertina; sed solummodo cognitio gratuita, quae est in Angelis beatis.
          <td>On the other hand, if we consider the nature of morning and evening alone, then a mean can fall between the two for two reasons. First, morning and evening are parts of a day; and, according to Augustine, “day” exists in angels by means of the illuminating effects of grace. Consequently, morning. and evening do not extend beyond the knowledge good angels have because of grace. Hence, their natural knowledge will be a third type. Second, evening as evening ends with morning, and morning ends with evening. Hence, not any knowledge of things in their own nature can be called evening knowledge, but only that which is referred to the praise of the Creator, because, in this sense, evening returns to morning. Consequently, the knowledge demons have of things is neither morning nor evening. Therefore, these terms can be applied only to the knowledge angels have as a result of grace, and this knowledge is found only in the beatified angels.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod cognitio rerum in propria natura semper est vespertina; nec relatio eius ad cognitionem in verbo facit eam matutinam, sed facit eam terminari ad matutinam. Non ergo dicitur quod ex hoc Angelus matutinam cognitionem habeat quod cognitionem rerum in propria natura ad verbum referat, quasi ipsa cognitio relata sit cognitio matutina; sed quia ex hoc quod refert, meretur matutinam cognitionem accipere.
          <td>1. Knowledge of things in their own nature is always evening knowledge. Its relation to knowledge in the Word does not make it morning, but makes it merely terminate in morning knowledge. Consequently, it should not be said that an angel has morning knowledge because he refers the knowledge he has of things in their own natures to the Word, as though this knowledge, being thus related, is morning knowledge. Rather, it is because he refers this knowledge that he merits to receive morning knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod ratio illa procederet, si matutina cognitio et vespertina distinguerentur ex parte rei cognitae; sic enim esset triplex cognitio secundum triplex esse cognoscibile de rebus. Cum autem cognitio matutina distinguatur a vespertina penes medium cognoscendi, quod est creatum vel increatum, per utrumlibet istorum mediorum cognoscitur quodlibet illorum esse; et sic non oportet tertiam cognitionem ponere.
          <td>2. That argument proceeds as though morning were distinguished from evening knowledge on the part of the thing known. Then there would be three kinds of knowledge based on the three kinds of intelligible existence things have. However, morning is distinguished from evening knowledge entirely on the basis of the medium of knowledge, which is either created or uncreated, and the existence of things can be known through either of these mediums. Hence, there is no need for postulating a third kind of knowledge.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod omnis cognitio quae est in verbo, vocatur cognitio matutina, sive sit res iam facta, sive non sit facta; quia talis cognitio est conformis divinae cognitioni, qui cognoscit omnia similiter antequam fiant et postquam facta sunt.
          <td>3. All knowledge had in the Word is called morning knowledge, whether the thing known is already created or not. The reason for this is that such knowledge is similar to God’s knowledge who without difference of manner knows all things before they are created just as He knows them after they are created.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et tamen omnis cognitio rei in verbo est rei ut fiendae, sive res iam sit facta, sive non: ut ly fiendum non dicat tempus, sed exitum creaturae a creatore; sicut est cognitio artificiati in arte est eius secundum suum fieri, quamvis etiam ipsum artificiatum iam sit factum.
          <td>However, all knowledge of things in the Word is of them as they are to be created, whether they are already created or not. Consequently, <i>are to he created</i> does not signify time but merely the fact that a creature has to leave the hands of its Creator. It is like the knowledge had of a work of art by means of an artistic conception:it concerns the thing in its coming to be, even after the thing has been made.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod Augustinus nominat matutinam cognitionem quae est in plena luce, unde continet sub se meridianam; unde quandoque nominat eam diurnam, quandoque autem matutinam. Vel potest dici, quod omnis cognitio intellectus angelici habet tenebras admixtas ex parte cognoscentis. Unde nulla cognitio alicuius intellectus creati potest dici meridiana, sed sola cognitio qua Deus cognoscit omnia in seipso.
          <td>4. Augustine calls that knowledge <i>morning</i> which is in full light and, for this reason, includes noon. Consequently, he sometimes calls it <i>day knowledge,</i> sometimes <i>morning knowledge.</i> Or, one could reply that all the intellectual knowledge had by angels is mixed with shadows as far as the knower is concerned. Consequently, no knowledge had by an angelic intellect should be called <i>noonday knowledge,</i> but only that by which God knows all things in Himself.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod eadem cognitione verbum et res in verbo (cognoscuntur); unde etiam cognitio verbi dicitur matutina. Et hoc patet, quia septimus dies, qui significat quietem Dei in seipso, habet mane; unde matutina cognitio est secundum quod Angelus Deum cognoscit.
          <td>5. The Word and things in the Word are known by the same knowledge. Hence, knowledge of the Word is also called <i>morning knowledge.</i> This is evident, because the seventh day, which signifies the day when God rested in Himself, has a morning. Hence, morning knowledge is had in so far as an angel knows God.
