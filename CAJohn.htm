          <td><b>Eusebius, Ecclesiastical History</b>: Because Matthew and Luke described the birth of the Savior according to the flesh, John was silent about that, and begins with theology and from his divinity. That aspect no doubt was reserved for this outstanding man by the Holy Spirit.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Unde cum omnibus divinae Scripturae paginis Evangelium excellat, quia quod lex et prophetae futurum praedixerunt, hoc completum dicit Evangelium; inter ipsos autem Evangeliorum scriptores Ioannes eminet in divinorum mysteriorum profunditate: qui a tempore dominicae ascensionis per annos sexaginta quinque verbum Dei absque adminiculo scribendi usque ad ultima Domitiani tempora praedicavit; sed post occisionem Domitiani, cum, Nerva permittente, de exilio rediisset Ephesum, compulsus ab episcopis Asiae, de coaeterna patri divinitate Christi scripsit adversus haereticos, qui Christum ante Mariam fuisse negabant. Unde merito in figura quattuor animalium aquilae volanti comparatur, quae volat altius cunctis avibus, et solis radios irreverberatis aspicit luminibus.
          <td><b>Alcuin</b>: Since the Gospel isthe summit of all Scriptur, John excels among the writers of the gospels in treating the depths of the divine mysteries. He preached the word of God without any writing from the time of the Lord's Ascension for 65 years, until the endo of the reign of Domitian. But, after Domitian was killed, with the permission of Nerva, he returned from exile to Ephesus, the bishops of Asia compelled him to write against the heretics about the divinity of Christ which is coeternal with the Father, against the heretics who denied that Christ existed before Mary. Therefore, among the four animals, he is deservedly represented by the flying eagle, which flies higher than all birds, and looks at the sun's rays with unshaken vision.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Transcendit enim Ioannes omnia cacumina terrarum, transcendit omnes campos aeris, transcendit omnes altitudines siderum, transcendit omnes choros et legiones Angelorum: nisi enim transcenderet ista omnia quae creata sunt, non perveniret ad eum per quem facta sunt omnia.
          <td><b>Augustine, on John</b>: John transcends all corners of the earth, all fields of air, all hights of the stars, all choirs and legions of angels. For if he did not transcend all those things which are created, he wold not reach Him through whom all things were made.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Augustinus, de Cons. Evang. <i>Ex quo intelligi datur, si diligenter advertas, tres Evangelistas temporalia facta domini et dicta quae ad informandos mores vitae praesentis maxime valerent, prosecutos, circa activam virtutem fuisse versatos; Ioannem vero facta domini multo pauciora narrantem, dicta vero eius, praesertim quae Trinitatis unitatem et vitae aeternae felicitatem insinuarent, diligentius et uberius conscribentem, in virtute contemplativa commendanda suam intentionem praedicationemque tenuisse. Unde animalia tria, per quae tres alii Evangelistae designantur, sive leo, sive homo, sive vitulus, in terra gradiuntur: quia tres Evangelistae in his maxime occupati sunt quae Christus in carne operatus est, et quae praecepta mortalis vitae exercendae carnem portantibus tradidit; at vero Ioannes supra nubila infirmitatis humanae velut aquila volat, et lucem incommutabilis veritatis acutissimis atque firmissimis oculis cordis intuetur: ipsam enim maxime divinitatem domini, qua patri est aequalis, intendit, eamque praecipue suo Evangelio, quantum inter homines sufficere credidit, commendare curavit.</i>
          <td><b>Augustine, on the Consistency of the Gospels</b>: If you carefully observe, you can see that the other three Evangelists concentrated on those temporal deeds and sayings of the Lord which are most important for living the present life well; thus they were concerned with the active life. But John narrated many fewer events of the Lord, but put his energy into writing about his words, especially those that teach about the unity of the Trinity and the happiness of eternal life. Thus the three animals symbolizing the other three Evangelists, i.e., the lion, man, and bull, walk on the earth, because these three Evangelists are most concerned with what Christ did in the flesh, and about the commands which he gave mortal men for right living in this life. John, however, flies like an eagle above the clouds of human weakness, and looks at the light of unchangeable truth with the sharpest and firmest eyes of the heart. For he focused mostly on the divinity of the Lord, in which he is equal to the Father, and in his Gospel he preached that as fully as he thought necessary for people to understand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Potest igitur Evangelista Ioannes cum Isaia propheta dicere vidi dominum sedentem super solium excelsum et elevatum, inquantum acumine visus sui Christum in divinitatis maiestate regnantem inspexit; quae quidem etiam sua natura excelsa est, et super omnia alia elevata. Dicat etiam Evangelista Ioannes et plena erat domus a maiestate eius: quia per ipsum narrat omnia esse facta, et suo lumine omnes homines in hunc mundum venientes illustrari. Dicat etiam quod ea quae sub ipso erant, replebant templum; quia dicit verbum caro factum est; et vidimus gloriam quasi unigeniti a patre, plenum gratiae et veritatis, secundum quod de plenitudine eius nos omnes accepimus. Sic igitur praemissa verba materiam huius Evangelii continent, in quo ipse Ioannes dominum super solium excelsum sedentem insinuat, divinitatem Christi ostendens; et terram ab eius maiestate impleri ostendit, dum omnia per eius virtutem in esse producta ostendit, et propriis perfectionibus repleta; et inferiora eius, idest humanitatis mysteria, templum, idest Ecclesiam, replere docet, dum in sacramentis humanitatis Christi et gratiam et gloriam fidelibus repromittit.
          <td><b>Gloss</b>: The Evangelist John can say with Isaiah: "I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne," because by his insight he saw Christ reigning in the majesty of divinity, which is by nature most high and elevated above all else. The Evangelist John also could say: "And the house was full of his majesty", because he tells of Him through whom all things were made, and he says that all men coming into this world are enlightened by his light. He could also say: "His train filled the temple," because he says "The Word became flesh, and we saw his glory as of the onlybegotten of the Father, full of grace and truth, from whose fullness we all received." Thus the preceding words contain the matter of this Gospel. In it John himself points out the Lord sitting on a high throne, when he shows the divintiy of Ghrist. He shows that the earth was filled with his majesty, when he shows that all things were made through his power, and are filled with their own perfections. And he teaches that his train, that is the mysteries of his humanity, fill the temple, that is the Church, when he assures the faithful grace and glory in the sacraments of the humanity of Christ.

Quando igitur barbarus hic et indisciplinatus talia loquitur quae nullus eorum qui in terra sunt hominum novit unquam, si hic solus esset, miraculum magnum esset. Nunc autem cum his et aliud isto maius tribuit argumentum, quod a Deo inspirata sunt ei quae dicuntur hic, scilicet quod omnes audiunt, et suadet omnibus per omne tempus. Quis ergo non admirabitur habitantem in eo virtutem?
          <td><b>Chrysostom, on John</b>: If an uneducated barbarian speaks things that no one on earth ever knew, and he alone knows it, that would be a big miracle. But now we have a greater argument than that what is said here is inspired by God, and that is because all hear, and all believe, over all time. Who then would not admire one who has such power.

          <td><b>Origen</b>: John menas "grace of God", or one who has or has been given grace. Which theologian has ever been given the ability to penetrate the hidden mysteries of the Supreme Good, and teach them to human minds?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. While all the other Evangelists begin with the Incarnation, John, passing over the Conception, Nativity, education, and growth, speaks immediately of the Eternal Generation, saying, In the beginning was the Word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus Lib. 83 quaest</b>: Quod Graece logos dicitur, Latine et rationem et verbum significat; sed hoc melius verbum interpretatur, ut significetur non solum ad patrem respectus, sed ad illa etiam quae per verbum facta sunt operativa potentia. Ratio autem, etsi nihil per eam fiat, recte ratio dicitur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Greek word “logos” signifies both Word and Reason. But in this passage it is better to interpret it Word; as referring not only to the Father, but to the creation of things by the operative power of the Word; whereas Reason, though it produce nothing, is still rightly called Reason.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quotidie autem dicendo verba viluerunt nobis, quia sonando et transeundo viluerunt. Est verbum et in ipso homine quod manet intus: nam sonus procedit ex ore. Est verbum quod vere specialiter dicitur illud quod intelligis de sono, non ipse sonus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Words by their daily use, sound, and passage out of us, have become common things. But there is a word which remains inward, in the very man himself; distinct from the sound which proceeds out of the mouth. There is a word, which is truly and spiritually that, which you understand by the sound, not being the actual sound.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Quisquis autem potest intelligere verbum, non solum antequam sonet, verum etiam antequam sonorum eius imagines cogitatione volvantur, iam potest videre per hoc speculum atque in hoc aenigmate aliquam verbi similitudinem, de quo dictum est in principio erat verbum. Necesse est enim cum id quod scimus loquimur, ut ex ipsa scientia quam memoria tenemus, nascatur verbum, quod eiusmodi sit omnino cuiusmodi est illa scientia de qua nascitur. Formata quippe cogitatio ab ea re quam scimus, verbum est, quod in corde dicimus; quod nec Graecum est, nec Latinum, nec linguae alicuius. Sed cum id opus est in eorum quibus loquimur proferre notitiam, aliquod signum quo significetur assumitur. Proinde verbum quod foris sonat, signum est verbi quod intus latet, cui magis verbi competit nomen: nam illud quod profertur carnis ore, vox verbi est, verbumque et ipsum dicitur propter illud a quo ut foris appareat sumptum est.
          <td>Now whoever can conceive the notion of word, as existing not only before its sound, but even before the idea of its sound is formed, may see enigmatically, and as it were in a glass, some similitude of that Word of Which it is said, In the beginning was the Word. For when we give expression to something which we know, the word used is necessarily derived from the knowledge thus retained in the memory, and must be of the same quality with that knowledge. For a word is a thought formed from a thing which we know; which word is spoken in the heart, being neither Greek nor Latin, nor of any language, though, when we want to communicate it to others, some sign is assumed by which to express it... Wherefore the word which sounds externally, is a sign of the word which lies hid within, to which the name of word more truly appertains. For that which is uttered by the mouth of our flesh, is the voice of the word; and is in fact called word, with reference to that from which it is taken, when it is developed externally.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Hoc autem verbum non est humanum verbum. Quomodo enim erat in principio humanum verbum, ultimo loco accipiente homine generationis principium? Non igitur in principio verbum erat humanum, sed nec Angelorum: omnis enim creatura infra saeculorum terminos est, a creatore essendi sumens principium. Sed audi Evangelium decenter: ipsum enim, unigenitum verbum dixit.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; This Word is not a human word. For how was there a human word in the beginning, when man received his being last of all? There was not then any word of man in the beginning, nor yet of Angels; for every creature is within the limits of time, having its beginning of existence from the Creator. But what says the Gospel? It calls the Only-Begotten Himself the Word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Si autem quis dixerit: cur patrem dimittens, mox nobis de filio loquitur? Quoniam ille quidem manifestus omnibus erat, etsi non ut pater, sed ut Deus, unigenitus autem ignorabatur: ideo decenter eam, quae de isto est, cognitionem confestim initio studuit imponere his qui nesciebant eum; sed neque patrem in his quae de filio sunt sermonibus tacuit. Propter hoc autem et verbum eum vocavit. Quia enim docturus erat quod hoc verbum unigenitus est filius Dei; ut non passibilem aestimet quis generationem, praeveniens verbi nuncupatione, destruit perniciosam suspicionem, esse ex Deo filium impassibiliter ostendens. Secunda vero ratio est, quia ea quae sunt patris nobis annuntiare debebat. Non simpliciter vero eum verbum dixit, sed cum articuli adiectione, a reliquis ipsum separans. Consuetudo enim est Scripturae verba vocare leges Dei et praecepta: hoc autem verbum substantia quaedam est, hypostasis, ens, ex ipso proveniens impassibiliter patre.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why omitting the Father, does he proceed at once to speak of the Son? Because the Father was known to all; though not as the Father, yet as God; whereas the Only-Begotten was not known. As was meet then, he endeavors first of all to inculcate the knowledge of the Son on those who knew Him not; though neither in discoursing on Him, is he altogether silent on the Father. And inasmuch as he was about to teach that the Word was the Only-Begotten Son of God, that no one might think this a possible generation, he makes mention of the Word in the first place, in order to destroy the dangerous suspicion, and show that the Son was from God impassibly. And a second reason is, that He was to declare to us the things of the Father. But he does not speak of the Word simply, but with the addition of the article, in order to distinguish It from other words. For Scripture calls God’s laws and commandments words; but this Word is a certain Substance, or Person, an Essence, coming forth impassibly from the Father Himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Quare igitur verbum? Quia impassibiliter natum est; quia est generantis imago, totum in seipso generantem demonstrans, nihil inde separans, sed in seipso perfectum existens.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Wherefore then Word? Because born impassibly, the Image of Him that begat, manifesting all the Father in Himself; abstracting from Him nothing, but existing perfect in Himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Sicut enim scientia nostra illi scientiae Dei, sic nostrum verbum quod nascitur de nostra scientia, dissimile est illi verbo Dei, quod natum est de patris essentia. Tale est autem, ac si dicerem de patris scientia, de patris sapientia; vel, quod est expressius, de patre scientia, de patre sapientia. Verbum ergo Dei patris unigenitus filius, per omnia patri similis et aequalis: hoc enim est omnino quod pater, non tamen pater: quia iste filius, ille pater: ac per hoc novit omnia quae novit pater; sed ei nosse de patre est, sicut esse: nosse enim et esse ibi unum est; et ideo patri, sicut esse non est a filio, ita nec nosse. Proinde, tamquam seipsum dicens, pater genuit verbum sibi aequale per omnia: non enim seipsum integre perfecteque dixisset, si aliquid minus aut amplius esset in eius verbo quam in seipso. Nostrum autem verbum interius, quod invenimus esse utcumque illi simile, quantum sit etiam dissimile, non pigeat intueri. Est enim verbum mentis nostrae quandoque formabile, nondum formatum, quiddam mentis nostrae, quod hac atque hac volubili quadam motione iactamus, cum a nobis nunc id, nunc illud, sicut inventum fuerit vel occurrerit, cogitatur; et tunc fit verum verbum quando illud quod nos diximus volubili motione iactare, ad id quod scimus pervenit, atque inde formatur, eius omnimodam similitudinem capiens; ut quomodo res quaeque scitur, sic etiam cogitetur. Quis non videat quanta sit hic dissimilitudo ab illo Dei verbo, quod in forma Dei sic est ut non ante fuerit formabile, postea formatum, non aliquando possit esse informe, sed sit forma simplex, et simpliciter aequalis ei de quo est? Quapropter ita dicitur illud Dei verbum, ut Dei cogitatio non dicatur; ne aliquid esse quasi volubile dicatur in Deo, quod nunc habeat, nunc accipiat formam ut verbum sit, eamque possit amittere, atque informiter quodammodo volutari.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As our knowledge differs from God’s, so does our word, which arises from our knowledge, differ from that Word of God, which is born of the Father’s essence; we might say, from the Father’s knowledge, the Father’s wisdom, or, more correctly, the Father Who is Knowledge, the Father Who is Wisdom. The Word of God then, the Only-Begotten Son of the Father, is in all things like and equal to the Father; being altogether what the Father is, yet not the Father; because the one is the Son, the other the Father. And thereby He knows all things which the Father knows; yet His knowledge is from the Father, even as is His being: for knowing and being are the same with Him; and so as the Father’s being is not from the Son, so neither is His knowing. Wherefore the Father begat the Word equal to Himself in all things as uttering forth Himself. For had there been more or less in His Word than in Himself, He would not have uttered Himself fully and perfectly. With respect however to our own inner word, which we find, in whatever sense, to be like the Word, let us not object to see how very unlike it is also. A word is a formation of our mind going to take place, but not yet made, and something in our mind which we toss to and fro in a slippery circuitous way, as one thing and another is discovered, or occurs to our thoughts. When this, which we toss to and fro, has reached the subject of our knowledge, and been formed therefrom, when it has assumed the most exact likeness to it, and the conception has quite answered to the thing; then we have a true word. Who may not see how great the difference is here from that Word of God, which exists in the Form of God in such wise, that It could not have been first going to be formed, and afterwards formed, nor can ever have been unformed, being a Form absolute, and absolutely equal to Him from Whom It is. Wherefore; in speaking of the Word of God here nothing is said about thought in God; lest we should think there was any thing revolving in God, which might first receive form in order to be a Word, and afterwards lose it, and be canted round and round again in an unformed state.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Est enim verbum Dei forma quaedam non formata, sed forma omnium formarum, forma incommutabilis, sine lapsu, sine defectu, sine tempore, sine loco, superans omnia, existens in omnibus fundamentum quoddam, in quo sunt, et fastigium sub quo sunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now the Word of God is a Form, not a formation, but the Form of all forms, a Form unchangeable, removed form accident, from failure, from time, from space, surpassing all things, and existing in all things as a kind of foundation underneath, and summit above them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Basilius</b>: Habet autem et verbum nostrum exterius divini verbi similitudinem quamdam: nam nostrum verbum totam declarat mentis conceptionem: quae namque mente concepimus, ea verbo proferimus. Et quidem cor nostrum quasi fons quidam est: verbum vero prolatum quasi quidam rivulus manans ex ipso.
          <td><b>BASIL</b>; Yet has our outward word some similarity to the Divine Word. For our word declares the whole conception of the mind; since what we conceive in the mind we bring out in word. Indeed our heart is as it were the source, and the uttered word the stream which flows therefrom.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; There are many significations of this word beginning. For there is a beginning of a journey, and beginning of a length, according to Proverbs, The beginning of the right path is to do justice. There is a beginning too of a creation, according to Job, He is the beginning of the ways of God. Nor would it be incorrect to say, that God is the Beginning of all things. The preexistent material again, where supposed to be original, out of which any thing is produced, is considered as the beginning. There is a beginning also in respect of form: as where Christ is the beginning of those who are made according to the image of God. And there is a beginning of doctrine, according to Hebrews; When for the time you ought to be teachers, you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of God. For there are two kinds of beginning of doctrine: one in itself, the other relative to us; as if we should say that Christ, in that He is the Wisdom and Word of God, was in Himself the beginning of wisdom, but to us, in that He was the Word incarnate. There being so many significations then of the word, we may take it as the Beginning through Whom, i.e. the Maker; for Christ is Creator as The Beginning, in that He is Wisdom; so that the Word is in the beginning, i.e. in Wisdom; the Savior being all these excellences at once. As life then is in the Word, so the Word is in the Beginning, that is to say, in Wisdom. Consider then if it be possible according to this signification to understand the Beginning, as meaning that all things are made according to Wisdom, and the patterns contained therein; or, inasmuch as the Beginning of the Son is the Father, the Beginning of all creatures and existences, to understand by the text, In the beginning was the Word, that the Son, the Word, was in the Beginning, that is, in the Father.

Similitudines adhibent de creaturis; et nobis laborandum est ut et nos inveniamus similitudines earum rerum quas astruimus. Sed quomodo possumus in creatura invenire coaeternum, quando in creatura nil invenimus aeternum? Sed si possunt inveniri haec duo coaeva, generans et generatum, ibi intelligimus coaeterna. Ipsa quidem sapientia dicta est in Scripturis candor lucis aeternae, dicta est imago patris. Hinc capiamus similitudinem, ut inveniamus coaeva, ex quibus intelligamus coaeterna. Nemo autem dubitat, quod splendor de igne exit. Ponamus ergo ignem patrem illius splendoris: mox quidem ut lucernam accendo, simul cum igne et splendor existit. Da mihi hic ignem sine splendore, et credo tibi patrem sine filio fuisse. Imago existit de speculo, hominis intuentis speculum; existit imago mox ut aspector extiterit: sed ille qui inspicit erat antequam accederet ad speculum. Ponamus ergo aliquid natum super aquam, ut virgultum, aut herbam: nonne cum imagine sua nascitur? Si ergo semper esset virgultum, semper esset et imago de virgulto. Quod autem de alio est, utique natum est. Potest ergo semper esse generans, et semper cum illo quod de eo natum est. Sed dicet aliquis: ecce intellexi aeternum patrem, coaeternum filium; tamen sicut effusum splendorem minus igne lucentem, aut sicut effusam imaginem minus quam virgultum existentem dicimus. Non, sed aequalitas omnimoda est. Non credo, ait, quia non invenisti similitudinem. Fortassis autem invenimus in creatura quomodo intelligamus filium et coaeternum patri, et nequaquam minorem; sed non illud possumus invenire in uno genere similitudinum. Iungamus ergo ambo genera: unum unde ipsi dant similitudines, et alterum unde nos dedimus.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. They say, however, if He is the Son, He was born. We allow it. They rejoin: if the Son was born to the Father, the Father was, before the Son was born to Him. This the Faith rejects. Then they say, explain to us how the Son could; be born from the Father, and yet be coeval with Him from whom He is born: for sons are born after their fathers, to succeed them on their death. They adduce analogies from nature; and we must endeavor likewise to do the same for our doctrine. But how can we find in nature a coeternal, when we cannot find an eternal? However, if a thing generating and a thing generated can be found any where coeval, it will be a help to forming a notion of coeternals. Now Wisdom herself is called in the Scriptures, the brightness of Everlasting Light, the image of the Father. Hence then let us take our comparison, an from coevals form a notion of coeternals. Now no one doubts that brightness proceeds from fire: fire then we may consider the father of the brightness. Presently, when I light a candle, at the same instant with the fire, brightness arises. Give me the fire without the brightness, and I will with you believe that the Father was without the Son. An image is produced by a mirror. The image exists as soon as the beholder appears; yet the beholder existed before he came to the mirror. Let us suppose then a twig, or a blade of grass which has grown up by the water side. Is it not born with its image? If there had always been the twig, there would always have been the image proceeding from the twig. And whatever is from another thing, is born. So then that which generates may be coexistent from eternity with that which is generated from it. But some one will say perhaps, Well, I understand now the eternal Father, the coeternal Son: yet the Son is like the emitted brightness, which is less brilliant than the fire, or tile reflected image, which is less real than the twig. Not so: there is complete equality between Father and Son. I do not believe, he says; for you have found nothing whereto to liken it. However, perhaps we can find something in nature by which we may understand that the Son is both coeternal with the Father, and in no respect inferior also: though we cannot find any one material of comparison that will be sufficient singly, and must therefore join together two, one of which has been employed by our adversaries, the other by ourselves. For they have drawn their comparison from things which are preceded in time by the things which they spring from, man, for example, from man. Nevertheless, man is of the same substance with man. We have then in that nativity an equality of nature; an equality of time is wanting. But in the comparison which we have drawn from the brightness of fire, and the reflection of a twig, an equality of nature you cost not find, of time you lost. In the Godhead then there is found as a whole, what here exists in single and separate parts; and that which is in the creation, existing in a manner suitable able to the Creator.

For, forasmuch as your son is of the same nature with yourself, the Scripture wishing to show that the Substance of the Father and the Son is one, sets forth the Son of the Father, born of the Father, the Only-Begotten. Next, since the terms birth and son, convey the idea of passibleness, therefore it calls the Son the Word, declaring by that name the impassability of His Nativity. But inasmuch as a father with us is necessarily older shall his son, lest thou should think that this applied to the Divine nature as well, it calls the Only-Begotten the Brightness of the Father; for brightness, though arising from the sun, is not posterior to it. Understand then that Brightness, as revealing the co-eternity of the Son with the Father; Word as proving the impassability of His birth, and Son as conveying His consubstantiality.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Not asserting, as Plato does, one to be intelligence, the other soul; for the Divine Nature is very different from this... But you say, the Father is called God with the addition of the article, the Son without it. What say you then, when the Apostle writes, The great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; and again, Who is over all, God; and Grace be unto you and peace from God our Father; without the article? Besides, too, it were superfluous here, to affix what had been affixed just before. So that it does not follow, though the article is not affixed to the Son, that He is therefore an inferior God.

But, to quiet my apprehensions, the fisherman reveals the scheme of this so great mystery, and refers all to one, without dishonor, without obliterating [the Person], without reference to time, saying, The Same was in the beginning with God; with One Unbegotten God, from whom He its, the One Only-begotten God.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Again, to stop any diabolical suspicion, that the Word, because He was God, might have rebelled against His Father, as certain Gentiles fable, or, being separate, have become the antagonist of the Father Himself, he says, The Same was in the beginning with God; that is to say, this Word of God never existed separate from God.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel ne audiens in principio erat verbum, aeviternum quidem aestimes, seniorem vero spatio aliquo patris vitam suscipias, induxit hoc erat in principio apud Deum: non enim fuit unquam solitarius ab illo; sed semper Deus apud Deum erat.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, lest hearing that In the beginning was the Word, you should regard It as eternal, but yet understand the Father’s Life to have some degree of priority, he has introduced the words, The Same was in the beginning with God. For God was never solitary, apart from Him, but always God with God. Or forasmuch as he said, the Word was God, that no one might think the Divinity of the Son inferior, he immediately subjoins the marks of proper Divinity, in that he both again mentions Eternity, The Same was in the beginning with God; and adds His attribute of Creator, All things were made by Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Vel aliter. Postquam praemiserat tres propositiones Evangelista, resumit tria in unum, dicens hoc erat in principio apud Deum. In primo enim trium didicimus in quo erat verbum, quia in principio erat; in secundo apud quem, quia apud Deum; in tertio quid erat verbum, quia Deus. Velut ergo demonstrans verbum praedictum, Deum, per hoc quod dicit hoc, et colligens in propositionem quartam hoc quod est in principio erat verbum, et verbum erat apud Deum, et Deus erat verbum, ait hoc erat in principio apud Deum. Quaerat autem aliquis, cur non est dictum: in principio erat verbum Dei, et verbum Dei erat apud Deum, et Deus erat verbum Dei. Quisquis autem unicam veritatem fatebitur esse; palam est quoniam et demonstratio eius, quae est sapientia, una est. Sed si veritas una, et sapientia una, verbum quoque quod veritatem enuntiat, et sapientiam expandit in his qui susceptibiles sunt, unum siquidem erit. Nec hoc dicimus inficiantes verbum Dei fore, sed ostendentes utilitatem omissionis huius vocabuli Dei. Ipse quoque Ioannes in Apocalypsi dicit: et nomen eius verbum Dei.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or thus, the Evangelist having begun with those propositions, reunites them into one, saying, The Same was in the beginning with God. For in the first of the three we learnt in what the Word was, that it was in the beginning; in the second, with whom, with God; in the third who the Word was, God. Having, then, by the term, The Same, set before us in a manner God the Word of Whom he had spoken, he collects all into the fourth proposition, viz. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God; into, the Same was in the beginning with God. It may be asked, however, why it is not said, In the beginning was the Word of God, and the Word of God was with God, and the Word of God was God? Now whoever will admit that truth is one, must needs admit also that the demonstration of truth, that is wisdom, is one. But if truth is one, and wisdom is one, the Word which enuntiates truth and develops wisdom in those who ho are capable of receiving it, must be One also. And therefore it would have been out of place here to have said, the Word of God, as if there were other words besides that of God, a word of angels, word of men, and so on. We do not say this, to deny that It is the Word of God, but to show the use of omitting the word God. John himself too in the Apocalypse says, And his Name is called the Word of God.

Evangelista vero haec omnia excedens uno verbo comprehendit, ut cognita auditoribus, ad altiorem festinans materiam, totum hunc librum instituens non de operibus, sed de conditore.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Moses indeed, in the beginning of the Old Testament, speaks to us in much detail of the natural world, saying, In the beginning God made the heaven and the earth; and then relates how that the light, and the firmament, and the stars, and the various kinds of animals were created. But the Evangelist sums up the whole of this in a word, as familiar to his hearers; and hastens to loftier matter, making the whole of his book to bear not on the works, but on the Maker.

          <td><b>Augustinus super Genesim</b>: Cum enim dicitur omnia per ipsum facta sunt, satis ostenditur et lux per ipsum facta, cum dixit Deus: fiat lux; et similiter de aliis. Quod si ita est, aeternum est, quod ait Deus: fiat lux, quia verbum Dei, Deus apud Deum, patri coaeternus est, quamvis creatura temporalis facta sit. Cum enim verba sint temporis, cum dicimus: quando et aliquando; aeternum tamen est in verbo Dei, quando aliquid fieri debeat; et tunc fit quando fieri debuisse in illo verbo est, in quo non est quando et aliquando: quoniam totum illud verbum aeternum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Since all things were made by him, it is evident that light was as also, when God said, Let there be light. And in like manner the rest. But if so, that which God said, viz. Let there be light, is eternal. For the Word of God, God with God, is coeternal with the Father, though the world created by Him be temporal. For whereas our when and sometimes are words of time, in the Word of God, on the contrary, when a thing ought to be made, is eternal; and the thing is then made, when in that Word it is that it ought to be made, which Word has in It neither when, or at sometime, since It is all eternal.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. How then can the Word of God be made, when God by the Word made all things? For if the Word Itself were made, by what other Word was It made? If you say it was the Word of the Word by Which That was made, that Word I call the Only-Begotten Son of God. But if thou cost not call It the Word of the Word, then grant that that Word was not made, by which all things were made.

Nos autem ad huiusmodi fictores mendacii simpliciter respondemus. Si enim, ut dicitis, pater creasset ad hoc filium ut eo tamquam organo uteretur, videretur quod inhonorabilior sit filius quam quae facta sunt; sicut ea quae per serram sunt facta, ipso organo nobiliora existunt; nam serra propter ipsa facta est. Sic et propter ipsa quae facta sunt, ut aiunt, pater creavit filium; tamquam si non deberet Deus cuncta creare, nequaquam filium produxisset. Quid his verbis insanius? Sed aiunt: quare non dixit quod omnia verbum fecit; sed usus est hac praepositione per? Ne filium ingenitum intelligeres, et sine principio, et Dei conditorem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Arians are wont to say, that all things are spoken of as made by the Son, in the sense in which we say a door is made by a saw, viz. as an instrument; not that He was Himself the Maker. And so they talk of the Son as a thing made, as if He were made for this purpose, that all things might be made by Him. Now we to the inventors of this lie reply simply: If, as you say, the Father had created the Son, in order to make use of Him as an instrument, it would appear that the Son were less honorable than the things made, just as things made by a saw are more noble than the saw itself; the saw having been made for their sake. In like way do they speak of the Father creating the Son for the sake of the things made, as it; had He thought good to create the universe, neither would He have produced the Son. What can be more insane than such language? They argue, however, why was it not said that the Word made all things, instead of the preposition by being used. For this reason, that you might not understand an Unbegotten and Unoriginate Son, a rival God.

If the preposition by perplex you, and you would learn from Scripture that the Word Itself made all thin as, hear David, You, Lord, in the beginning has laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of Your hands. That he spoke this of the Only-Begotten, you learn from the Apostle, who in the Epistle to the Hebrews applies these words to the Son.
            <p><b>CHRYS</b>. But if you say that the prophet spoke this of the Father, and that Paul applied it to the Son, it comes to the same thing. For he would not have mentioned that as applicable to the Son, unless he fully considered that the Father and the Son were of equal dignity. If again you dream that in the preposition by any subjection is implied, why does Paul use of the Father? as, God is faithful, by Whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son; and again, Paul an Apostle by the will of God.

Now ‘nothing’ and ‘a thing which is not,’ mean the same. And the Apostle seems to call wicked things, things which are not, God calls those things which be not, as though they were. All wickedness then is called nothing, forasmuch as it is made without the Word. Those who say however ever that the devil is not a creature of God, err. In so far as he is the devil, he is not a creature of God; but he, whose character it is to be the devil, is a creature of God.

But neither was there sin, when there was no Word, for our Lord says, If I had not come and spoken to them, they had not had sin. For every excuse is without drawn from the sinner, if, with the Word present, and enjoining what is to be done, he refuses to obey Him. Nor is the Word to be blamed on this account; any more than a master, whose discipline leaves no excuse open to a delinquent pupil on the ground of ignorance. All things then were made by the Word, not only the natural world, but also whatever is done by those acting without reason.

          <td><b>Beda in Ioannem</b>: Quia Evangelista dixit omnem creaturam factam esse per verbum, ne quis forte crederet mutabilem eius voluntatem, quasi qui subito vellet facere creaturam quam ab aeterno nunquam ante fecisset, ideo docere curavit, factam quidem creaturam in tempore; sed in aeterna creatoris sapientia, quando et quos crearet semper fuisse dispositum; unde dicit quod factum est in ipso, vita erat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The Evangelist having said that every creature was made by the Word, lest perchance any one might think that His will was changeable, as though He willed on a sudden to make a creature, which from eternity he had not made; he took care to show that, though a creature was made in time, in the Wisdom of the Creator it had been from eternity arranged what and when He should create.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Potest autem sic punctari: quod factum est in ipso; et postea dicatur vita erat. Ergo totum vita est, si sic pronuntiaverimus: quid enim non in illo factum est? Ipse est enim sapientia Dei, et dicitur in Psalmo 103, 24: omnia in sapientia fecisti. Omnia igitur sicut per illum, ita et in illo facta sunt. Si ergo quod in illo factum est, vita est, ergo et terra vita est, et lapis vita est. Inhonestum est sic intelligere, ne nobis subrepat secta Manichaeorum, et dicat quia habet vitam lapis, et habet vitam paries: solent enim ista delirantes dicere; et cum reprehensi fuerint ac repulsi, quasi de Scripturis proferunt dicentes: ut quid dictum est: quod factum est in ipso, vita erat? Pronuntia ergo sic quod factum est: hic subdistingue; et deinde infer in ipso vita erat. Facta est enim terra; sed ipsa terra quae facta est non est vita. Est autem in ipsa Dei sapientia spiritualiter ratio quaedam qua terra facta est; haec vita est. Sicut arca in omni opere non est vita; arca in arte vita est, quia vivit anima artificis. Sic ergo quia sapientia Dei, per quam facta sunt omnia, secundum artem continet omnia quae fiunt per ipsam artem, non haec continuo sunt vita; sed quidquid factum est, vita est in illo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. ‘The passage can be read thus: What was made in Him was life. Therefore the whole universe is life: for what was there not made in Him? He is the Wisdom of God, as is said, In Wisdom have You made them all. All things therefore are made in Him, even as they are by Him. But, if whatever was made in Him is life, the earth is life, a stone is life. We must not interpret it so unsoundly, lest the sect of the Manicheans creep in upon us, and say, that a stone has life, and that a wall has life; for they do insanely assert so, and when reprehended or refuted, appeal as though to Scripture, and ask, why was it said, That which was made in Him. was life? Read the passage then thus: make the stop after What was made, and then proceed, In Him was life. The earth was made; but, the earth itself which was, as made is not life. In the Wisdom of God however there is spiritually a certain Reason after which the earth is made. This is Life. A chest in workmanship is not life, a chest in art is, inasmuch as the mind of the workman lives wherein that original pattern exists. And in this sense the Wisdom of God, by Which all things are made, contains in art ‘all things which are made, according to that art.’ And therefore whatever is made, is not in itself life, but is life in Him.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Potest autem et sic distingui sine errore: quod factum est in ipso, et postea dicatur vita erat; ut sit sensus: omnia quae per ipsum et in ipso facta sunt, in ipso vita sunt, et unum sunt. Erant enim, hoc est in ipso subsistunt causaliter, priusquam sint in seipsis effective. Sed si quaeris, quomodo et qua ratione omnia quae per verbum facta sunt, in ipso vitaliter et uniformiter et causaliter subsistunt, accipe exempla ex creaturarum natura. Conspice quomodo omnium rerum quas mundi huius sensibilis globositas comprehendit, causae simul et uniformiter in isto sole, qui est maximum mundi luminare, subsistunt; quomodo numerositas herbarum et fructuum in singulis seminibus simul continetur; quomodo multiplices regulae in arte artificis unum sunt, et in animo disponentis vivunt; quomodo infinitus linearum numerus in uno puncto unum subsistit; et huiusmodi varia perspice exempla, ex quibus velut physicae theoriae pennis poteris arcana verbi mentis acie inspicere, et quantum datur humanis rationibus, videre quomodo omnia quae per verbum sunt facta, in ipso vivunt et facta sunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; It may also be divided thus: That which was made in him; and then, was life; the sense being, that all things that were made by Him and in Him, are life in Him, and are one in Him. They were, that is, in Him; they exist as the cause, before they exist in themselves as effects. If you ask how and in what manner all things which were made by the Word subsist in Him vitally, immutably, causally, take some examples from the created world. See how that all things within the arch of the world of sense have their causes simultaneously and harmoniously subsisting in that sun which is the greatest luminary of the world: how multitudinous crops of herbs and fruits are contained in single seeds: how the most complex variety of rules, in the art of the artificer, and the mind of the director, are a living unit, how an infinite number of lines coexist in one point. Contemplate these several instances, and you will be able as it were on the wings of physical science, to penetrate with your intellectual eye the secrets of the Word, and as far as is allowed to a human understanding, to see how all things which were made by the Word, live in Him, and were made in Him.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Vel aliter potest legi: in eo quod dixerat sine ipso factum est nihil, posset aliquis perturbatus dicere: est ergo aliquid per alterum factum, quod tamen non sit sine eo factum; et si aliquid per alterum, licet non sine eo, iam non per eum omnia; quia aliud est fecisse, aliud est intervenisse facienti. Enarrat ergo Evangelista quid non sine eo factum sit, dicens quod factum est in eo. Hoc igitur non sine eo quod in eo factum est: nam id quod in eo factum est, etiam per eum factum est: omnia enim per ipsum et in ipso creata sunt. In ipso autem creata, quia nascebatur creator Deus; sed ex hoc sine eo nihil factum est, quod tamen in eo factum est, quia nascens Deus vita erat, et qui vita erat, non posteaquam natus erat, factus est vita. Nihil ergo sine eo fiebat ex his quae in eo fiebant, quia vita est in quo fiebant; et Deus qui ab eo natus est, non posteaquam natus est, sed nascendo quoque extitit.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>; Or it can be understood thus. In that he had said, without Him was not anything thing made, one might have been perplexed, and have asked, Was then any thing made by another, which yet was not made without Him? if so, then though nothing is made without, all things are not made by Him: it being one thing to make, another to be with the maker. On this account the Evangelist declares what it was which was not made without Him, viz. what was made in Him. This then it was which was not made without Him, viz. what was made in Him. And that which was made in Him, was also made by Him. For all things were created in Him and by Him. Now things were made in Him, because He was born God the Creator. And for this reason also things that were made in Him, were not made without Him, viz. that God, in that He was born, was life, and He who was life, was not made life after being born. Nothing then which was made in Him, was made without Him, because He was life, in Whom they were made; because God Who was born of God was God, not after, but in that He was born.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Non apponemus finale punctum, ubi dicitur sine ipso factum est nihil, secundum haereticos. Illi enim volentes spiritum sanctum creatum dicere, aiunt quod factum est in ipso, vita erat. Sed ita non potest intelligi. Primum quidem neque tempus erat hic spiritus sancti meminisse; sed si de sancto spiritu hoc dictum est, age, secundum eorum interim legamus modum: ita enim nobis hoc inconveniens erit; cum enim dicitur quod factum est in ipso, vita erat, spiritum sanctum dicunt dictum esse vitam; sed vita haec et lux invenitur esse; inducit enim vita erat lux hominum. Quocirca, secundum eos, lucem omnium hunc spiritum dicit. Quod autem superius verbum dicit, hic consequenter et Deum et vitam et lucem nominat. Verbum autem caro factum est: erit igitur spiritus sanctus incarnatus, non filius. Ideo dimittentes hunc modum legendi, ad decentem veniamus lectionem et expositionem; hoc autem est cum dicitur omnia per ipsum facta sunt, et sine ipso factum est nihil quod factum est; ibi quiescere fac sermonem; deinde ab ea quae deinceps est dictione incipe, quae dicit in ipso vita erat; ac si dicat sine eo factum est nihil quod factum est, idest factibilium. Vides qualiter hac brevi adiectione omnia correxit supervenientia inconvenientia. Inducens enim sine eo factum est nihil, et adiciens quod factum est, et intelligibilia comprehendit, et spiritum sanctum excepit: spiritus enim sanctus factibilis non est. Haec igitur quae dicta sunt, de conditione rerum dixit Ioannes. Inducit autem et eum qui est de providentia sermonem, dicens in ipso vita erat. Quemadmodum in fonte qui generat abyssos, et in nullo minoratur fons; ita et in operatione unigeniti quaecumque credas per eum facta esse, non minor ipse factus est. Nomen autem vitae hic non solum conditionis est, sed et providentiae rerum, quae est secundum permanentiam earum. Cum autem audis quoniam in ipso vita erat, ne compositum aestimes: sicut enim pater habet vitam in seipso, ita dedit et filio vitam habere. Ergo sicut patrem non utique dices compositum esse, ita nec filium.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Or to give another explanation. We will not put the stop at without Him was not any thing made, as the heretics do. For they wishing to prove the Holy Ghost a creature, read, That which was made in Him, was life. But this cannot be so understood. For first, this was not the place for making mention of the Holy Ghost. But let us suppose it was; let us take the passage for the present according to their reading, we shall see that it leads to a difficulty. For when it is said, That which was made in Him, was life; they say the life spoken of is the Holy Ghost. But this life is also light; for the Evangelist proceeds, The life was the light of men. Wherefore according to them, he calls the Holy Ghost the light of all men. But the Word mentioned above, is what he here calls consecutively, God, and Life, and Light. Now the Word was made flesh. If follows that the Holy Ghost is incarnate, not the Son. Dismissing then this reading, we adopt a more suitable one, with the following meaning: All things were made by Him, and without Him was not any thing made which was made: there we make a stop, and begin a fresh sentence: In Him was life. Without Him was not any thing made which was as made; i.e. which could be made. You see how by this short addition, he removes any difficulty which might follow. For by introducing without Him was not any thing made, and adding, which was made, he includes all things invisible, and excepts the Holy: Spirit: for the Spirit cannot be made. To the mention of creation, succeeds that of providence. In Him was life. As a fountain which produces vast depths of water, and yet is nothing diminished at the fountain head; so works the Only-Begotten. How great soever His creations be, He Himself is none the less for them. By the word life here is meant not only creation, but that providence by which the things created are preserved. But when you are told that in Him was life, do not suppose Him compounded; for, as the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself. As then you would not call the Father compounded, so neither should you the Son.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Oportet scire, quod salvator quaedam dicit non sibi esse, sed aliis; quaedam vero et sibi et aliis. In hoc ergo quod dicitur quod factum est in verbo, vita erat, scrutandum est an sibi et aliis vita est, vel aliis tantum; et si aliis, quibus aliis. Idem autem est vita et lux; lux autem hominum est: fit itaque hominum vita, quorum est lux; et sic in eo quod dicitur vita, salvator dicitur non sibi, sed aliis. Haec quidem vita verbo praeexistenti aderit, ex eo quod expiata a peccatis anima sit serena, et vita inseratur ei qui verbi Dei se susceptibilem statuit. Unde verbum quidem in principio non dixit factum: non enim erat quando principium verbo careret. Vita autem hominum non semper erat in verbo; sed haec vita hominum facta est, eo quod vita est lux hominum: cum enim homo non erat, nec lux hominum erat, luce secundum habitudinem ad homines intellecta; et ideo dicit quod factum est in verbo, vita erat; non autem: quod erat in verbo, vita erat. Invenitur autem alia littera non incongrue habens: quod factum est in eo, vita est. Si autem intelligamus vitam hominum quae in verbo fit, eum esse qui dixit: ego sum vita, fatebimur neminem infidelium Christi vivere, sed cunctos esse mortuos qui non vivunt in Deo.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or thus: Our Savior is said to be some things not for Himself, but for others; others again, both for Himself and others. When it is said then, That which was as made in Him was life; we must inquire whether the life is for Himself and others, or for others only; and if for others, for whom? Now the Life and the Light are both the same Person: He is the light of men: He is therefore their life. The Savior is called Life here, not to Himself, but to others; whose Light He also is. This life is inseparable from the Word, from the time it is added on to it. For Reason or the Word must exist before in the soul, cleansing it from sin, till it is pure enough to receive the life, which is thus engrafted or inborn in every one who renders himself fit to receive the Word of God. Hence observe, that though the Word itself in the beginning was not made, the Beginning never having been without the Word; yet the life of men was not always in the Word. This life of men was made, in that It was the light of men; and this light of men could not be before man was; the light of men being understood relatively to men. And therefore he says, That which was made in the Word was life; not That which was in the Word was life. Some copies read, not amiss, “That which was made, in Him is life.” If we understand the life in the Word, to be He who says below, ‘I am the life,’ we shall confess that none who believe not. in Christ live, and that all who live not in God, are dead.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He said not, the Light of the Jews only, but of all men: for all of us, in so far as we have received intellect and reason, from that Word which created us, are said to be illuminated by Him. For the reason which is given to us, and which constitutes us the reasonable beings we are, is a light directing us what to do, and what not to do.

Non igitur quidquid dicitur aliquorum, illorum solum est: scriptum est enim de Deo, quod sit Deus Abraham, Isaac et Iacob; non tamen istorum tantum patrum dictus est Deus.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; We must not omit to notice, that he puts the life before the light of men. For it would be a contradiction to suppose a being without life to be illuminated; as if life were an addition to illumination. But to proceed: if the life was the light of men, meaning men only, Christ is the light and the life of men only; an heretical supposition. It does not follow then, when a thing is predicated of any, that it is predicated of those only; for of God it is written, that He is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; and yet He is not the God of those fathers only. In the same way, the light of men is not excluded from being the light of others as well. Some moreover contend from, Genesis, Let us make man after our image, that man means whatever is made after the image and similitude of God. If so, the light of men is the light of any rational creature whatever.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or thus, The light shines in the darkness of faithful souls, beginning from faith, and drawing onwards to hope; but the deceit and ignorance of undisciplined souls did not comprehended the light of the Word of God shining in the flesh. That however is an ethical meaning. The metaphysical signification of the words is as follows. Human nature, even though it sinned not, could not shine by its own strength simply; for it is not naturally light, but only a recipient of it; it is capable of containing wisdom, but is not wisdom itself. As the air, of itself, shines not, but is called by the name of darkness, even so is our nature, considered in itself; a dark substance, which however admits of and is made partaker of the light of wisdom. And as when the air receives the sun’s rays, it is not said to shine of itself, but the sun’s radiance to be apparent in it; so the reasonable part of our nature, while possessing the presence of the Word of God, does not of itself understand God, and intellectual things, but by means of the divine light implanted in it. Thus, The light shines in darkness: for the Word of God, the life and the light of men, ceases not to shine in our nature; though regarded in itself, that nature is without form and darkness. And forasmuch as pure light cannot be comprehended by any creature, hence the text: The darkness comprehended it not.

For we must distinguish the external and false life, from the desirable and true. We are first made partakers of life: and this life with some is light potentially only, not in act; with those, viz. who are not eager to search out the things which appertain to knowledge: with others it is actual light, those who, as the Apostle said, covet earnestly the best gifts, that is to say, the word of wisdom.

Tenebras mortem et errorem dicit: nam lux quidem sensibilis non in tenebris lucet, sed sine illis; praedicatio vero Christi in medio erroris regnantis fulsit; et eum disparere fecit, et in vitam mortem fecit mortuus Christus, ita eam superans ut eos qui detinebantur reduceret. Quia igitur neque mors eam superavit, neque error; sed fulgida est eius praedicatio ubique, et lucet cum propria fortitudine; propterea subdit et tenebrae eam non comprehenderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Life having come to us, the empire of death is dissolved; a light having shone upon us, there is darkness no longer: but there remains ever a life which death, a light which darkness cannot overcome. Whence he continues, And the light shines in darkness: by darkness meaning death and error, for sensible light does not shine in darkness, but darkness must be removed first; whereas the preaching of Christ shone forth amidst the reign of error, and caused it to disappear, and Christ by dying changed death into life, so overcoming it, that, those who were already in its grasp, were brought back again. Forasmuch then as neither death nor error has overcome his light, which is every where conspicuous shilling forth by its own strength; therefore he adds, And the darkness comprehended it not.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Est etiam sciendum, quod sicut lux hominum nomen est duarum spiritualium rerum, sic et tenebrae: dicimus enim hominem lucem possidentem, opera lucis perficere, et etiam cognoscere quasi illustratum lumine scientiae; et e contrario tenebras dicimus illicitos actus, et eam quae videtur scientia, non est autem. Sicut autem pater lux est, et in eo tenebrae non sunt ullae, sic et salvator. Sed quia similitudinem carnis peccati subiit, non incongrue de eo dicitur, quod tenebrae in eo sunt aliquae, ipso in se suscipiente nostras tenebras ut eas dissiparet. Haec igitur lux, quae facta est vita hominum, radiat in tenebris animarum nostrarum, et venit ubi princeps tenebrarum harum cum genere bellat humano. Hanc lucem persecutae sunt tenebrae: quod patet ex his quae salvator et eius filii sustinent, pugnantibus tenebris contra filios lucis. Verum quia Deus patrocinatur, non invalescunt; unde non apprehendunt lucem, vel quia celeritatem cursus lucis subsequi non valent propter propriam tarditatem, vel quia si supervenientem expectant, fugantur luce appropinquante. Oportet autem id considerare, quod non semper tenebrae in sinistra parte sumuntur, sed quandoque in bona, posuit tenebras latibulum suum, dum ea quae sunt erga Deum, ignota et imperceptibilia sunt. De hac ergo laudata caligine dicam, quoniam versus lucem pergit, illamque apprehendit: quia quod erat caligo, dum ignorabatur, in lucem cognitam vertitur ei qui didicit.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; As the light of men is a word expressing two spiritual things, so is darkness also. To one who possesses the light, we attribute both the doing the deeds of the light, and also true understanding, inasmuch as he is illuminated by the light of knowledge: and, on the other hand, the term darkness we apply both to unlawful acts, and also to that knowledge, which seems such, but is not. Now as the Father is light, and in Him is no darkness at all, so is the Savior also. Yet, inasmuch as he underwent the similitude of our sinful flesh, it is not incorrectly said of Him, that in Him there was some darkness; for He took our darkness upon Himself, in order that He might dissipate it. This Light therefore, which was made the life of man, shines in the darkness of our hearts, when the prince of this darkness wars with the human race. This Light the darkness persecuted, as is clear from what our Savior and His children suffer; the darkness fighting against the children of light. But, forasmuch as God takes up the cause, they do not prevail; nor do they apprehend the light, for they are either of too slow a nature to overtake the light’s quick course, or, waiting for it to come up to them, they are put to flight at its approach. We should bear in mind, however, that darkness is not always used in a bad sense, but sometimes in a good, as in Psalm xvii. He made darkness His secret place: the things of God being unknown and incomprehensible. This darkness then I will call praiseworthy, since it tends toward light, and lays hold on it: for, though it were darkness before, while it was not known, yet it is turned to light and knowledge in him who has learned.

Angeli enim virtus est nihil proprium dicere. Hoc autem quod dicit fuit missus, non eius qui ad esse processus ostensivum est. Sicut autem Isaias missus fuit non aliunde quam a mundo, sed a statu quo vidit dominum sedentem super solium excelsum et elevatum, ad plebem; sic et Ioannes a deserto ad baptizandum mittitur; ait enim: qui misit me baptizare, ille mihi dixit: super quem videris spiritum descendentem et manentem super eum, hic est qui baptizat in spiritu sancto.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. After this esteem nothing that he says as human; for he speaks not his own, but his that sent him. And therefore the Prophet calls him a messenger, I send My messenger, for it is the excellence of a messenger, to say nothing of his own. But the expression, was sent, does not mean his entrance into life, but to his office. As Esaias was sent on his commission, not from any place out of the world, but from where he saw the Lord sitting upon His high and lofty throne; in like manner John was sent from the desert to baptize; for he says, He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon Whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.

Siquidem et Moyses credi meruit per verbum et virtutes, non egens praeviis testibus. Ad hoc dicendum est, quod multis existentibus causis inducentibus ad credendum, plerumque quidam ex hac demonstratione non admirantur, ex alia vero habent causam ut credant. Deus autem est qui pro cunctis hominibus homo factus est. Constat igitur quosdam ex dictis propheticis ad Christi admirationem coactos, mirantes tot prophetarum ante eius adventum voces, constituentes nativitatis eius locum, et alia huiusmodi. Illud quoque advertendum, quod prodigiosae virtutes ad credendum provocare poterant eos qui tempore Christi erant, non autem post longa tempora: nam fabulosa quaedam aestimata fuerunt: plus enim peractis virtutibus facit ad credulitatem quae cum virtutibus quaeritur prophetia. Est autem et tale quid dicere, quod quidam in hoc quod testimonium perhibent Deo, honorati sunt. Privare vult ergo chorum prophetarum ingenti gratia qui dicit, illos non oportere de Christo testimonium exhibere. Accessit autem his Ioannes, ut testimonium de luce perhibeat.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Some try to undo the testimonies of the Prophets to Christ, by saying that the Son of God had no need of such witnesses; the wholesome words which He uttered and His miraculous acts being sufficient to produce belief; just as Moses deserved belief for his speech and goodness, and wanted no previous witnesses. To this we may reply, that, where there are a number of reasons to make people believe, persons are often impressed by one kind of proof; and not by another, and God, Who for the sake of all men became man, can give them many reasons for belief in Him. And with respect to the doctrine of the Incarnation, certain it is that some have been forced by the Prophetical writings into an admiration of Christ by the fact of so many prophets having, before His advent, fixed the place of His nativity; and by other proofs of the same kind. It is to be remembered too, that, though the display of miraculous powers might stimulate the faith of those who lived in the same age with Christ, they might, in the lapse of time, fail to do so; as some of them might even get to be regarded as fabulous. Prophecy and miracles together are more convincing than simply past miracles by themselves. We must recollect too that men receive honor themselves from the witness which they bear to God. He deprives the Prophetical choir of immeasurable honor, whoever denies that it was their office to bear witness to Christ. John when he comes to bear witness to the light, follows in the train of those who went before him.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Non ea indigente testimonio, sed propter quid, ipse Ioannes docet, dicens ut omnes crederent per illum. Sicut enim carnem induit, ne omnes perderet; ita et praeconem hominem misit, ut cognatam audientes vocem, facilius advenirent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Not because the light wanted the testimony, but for the reason which John himself self gives, viz. that all might believe on Him. For as He put on flesh to save all men from death; so He sent before Him a human preacher, that the sound of a voice like their own, might the readier draw men to Him.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Though some however might not believe, he is not accountable for them. When a man shuts himself up in a dark room, so as to receive no light from the sun’s rays, he is the cause of the deprivation, not the sun. In like manner John was sent, that all men might believe; but if no such result followed, he is not the cause of the failure.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia vero multum apud nos maior qui testatur, eo cui testimonium perhibet, et dignior fide esse videtur; ne quis et de Ioanne hoc suspicetur, hanc suspicionem destruit, dicens non erat ille lux; sed ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine. Si vero non huic instans opinioni hoc resumpsit ut testimonium perhiberet de lumine, superfluum esset quod dicitur, et magis iteratio sermonis quam explanatio doctrinae.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Forasmuch however as with us, the one who witnesses, is commonly a more important, a more trustworthy person, than the one to whom he bears witness, to do away with any such notion in the present case the Evangelist proceeds; He was not that Light, but was sent to bear witness of that Light. If this were not his intention, in repeating the words, to bear witness of that Light, the addition would be superfluous, and rather a verbal repetition, than the explanation of a truth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sed dicet aliquis: ergo neque Ioannem, neque sanctorum quempiam lucem esse vel fuisse dicemus. Sed si sanctorum aliquem lucem velimus dicere, ponemus lucem absque articulo; ut si interrogatus fueris utrum Ioannes est lux sine articulo, secure concedas; si vero cum articulo, non concedas. Non enim est ipsa lux principalior; sed lux dicitur quia secundum participationem lucem habeat a vero lumine.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But it will be said, that we do not allow John or any of the saints to be or ever to have been light. The difference is this: If we call any of the saints light, we put light without the article. So if asked whether John is light, without the article, you may allow without hesitation that he is: if with the article, you alloy it not. For he is not very, original, light, but is only called so, on account of his partaking of the light, which comes from the true Light.

Si omnem hominem, ergo et ipsum Ioannem. Ipse ergo illuminabat, a quo se demonstrari volebat. Quomodo enim plerumque fit ut in aliquo corpore radiato cognoscatur ortus esse sol quem oculis videre non possumus; quia etiam qui saucios habet oculos, idonei sunt videre parietem illuminatum, aut aliquid huiusmodi; sic omnes ad quos venerat Christus, minus erant idonei eum videre. Radiavit Ioannem, et per illum confitentem se illuminatum cognitus est ille qui illuminat. Dicit autem venientem in hunc mundum, nam si illinc non recederet, non esset illuminandus; sed ideo hic illuminandus, quia illinc recessit ubi homo poterat esse illuminatus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Wherefore is there added, true? Because man enlightened is called light, but the true Light is that which lightens. For our eyes are called lights, and yet, without a lamp at night, or the sun by day, these lights are open to no purpose. Wherefore he adds: which lightens every man: but if every man, then John himself. He Himself then enlightened the person, by whom He wished Himself to be pointed out. And just as we may often, from the reflection of the sun’s rays on some object, know the sun to be risen, though we cannot fool; at the sun itself; as even feeble eyes can look at an illuminated wall, or some object of that kind: even so, those to whom Christ came, being too weak to behold Him, He threw His rays upon John; John confessed the illumination, and so the illuminator Himself was discovered. It is said, that comes into the world. Had man not departed from Him, he had not had to be enlightened; but therefore is he to be here enlightened, because he departed thence, when the might have been enlightened.

But if He lightens every man that comes into the world, how is it that so many have gone on without light? For all have not known the worship of Christ. The answer is: He only enlightens every man, so far as pertains to Him. If men shut their eyes, and will not receive the rays of this light, their darkness arises not from the fault of the light, but from their own wickedness, inasmuch as they voluntarily deprive themselves of the gift of grace. For grace is poured out upon all; and they, who will not enjoy the gift, may impute it to their own blindness.

You must not suppose however, that He was in the world in tile same sense in w which the earth, cattle, men, are in the world; but in the sense in which an artificer controls his own work; whence the text, And the world was made by Him. Nor again did He make it after the manner of all artificer; for whereas an artificer is external to what he fabricates, God pervades the world, carrying on the work of creation in every part, and never absent from any part: by the presence of His Majesty He both makes and controls what is made. Thus He was in the world, as He by Whom the world was made.

Num enim caeli, aut Angeli, aut sidera non cognoverunt creatorem, quem confitentur Daemonia, omnia undique testimonium perhibuerunt? Sed qui non cognoverunt eum? Qui amando mundum, dicti sunt mundus: amando enim mundum, habitamus corde in mundo: nam qui non diligunt mundum, carne versantur in mundo, sed corde inhabitant caelum; sicut apostolus dicit: nostra conversatio in caelis est. Amando igitur mundum, hoc appellari meruerunt ubi habitant.

For did the sky, or Angels, not know their Creator, Whom the very devils confess, Whom the whole universe has borne witness to? Who then did not know Him? Those who, from their love of the world, are called the world; for such live in heart in the world, while those who do not love it, have their body in the world, but their heart in heaven; as said the Apostle, our conversation is in heaven. By their love of the world, such men merit being called by the name of the place where they live. And just as in speaking of a bad house, or good house, we do not mean praise or blame to the walls, but to the inhabitants; so when we talk of the world, we mean those who live there in the love of it.

When the Gentiles then interrupt us with the question, Why has He come in these last times to work our salvation, having neglected us so long? we reply, that He was in the world before, superintending what He had made, and was known to all who were worthy of Him; and that, if the world knew Him not, those of whom the world was not worthy knew Him. The reason follows, why the world knew Him not. The Evangelist calls those men the world, who are tied to the world, and savor of worldly things; for there is nothing that disturbs the mind so much, as this melting with the love of present things.

Manifestationem vero hanc et condescensionem adventum vocat. Misericors autem existens Deus omnia facit, ut nos secundum virtutem splendeamus; et propter hoc quidem nullum necessitate, suasione vero et beneficiis volentes ad se attrahit; et propterea venientem eum hi quidem susceperunt, alii vero non receperunt.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He came then to His own, not for His own good, but for the good of others. But whence did He Who fills all things, and is every where present, come? He came out of condescension to us, though in reality He had been in the world all along. But the world not seeing Him, because it knew Him not, He deigned to put on flesh. And this manifestation and condescension is called His advent. But the merciful God so contrives His dispensations, that we may shine forth in proportion to our goodness, and therefore He will not compel, but invites men, by persuasion and kindness, to come of their own accord: and so, when He came, some received Him, and others received Him not. He desires not an unwilling and forced service; for no one who comes unwillingly devotes himself wholly to Him. Whence what follows, And his own received him not. He here calls the Jews His own, as being his peculiar people; as indeed are all men in some sense, being made by Him. And as above, to the shame of our common nature, he said, that the world which was made by Him, knew not its Maker: so here again, indignant at the ingratitude of the Jews, he brings a heavier charge, viz. that His own received Him not.

Now, if the delegates of worldly governments have often nearly as much power as those governments themselves, much more is this the case with us, who derive our dignity from God. But at the same time the Evangelist wishes to show that this grace comes to us of our own will and endeavor: that, in short, the operation of grace being supposed, it is in the power of our free will to make us the sons of God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And because in the matter of these ineffable benefits, the giving of grace belongs to God, but the extending of faith to man, He subjoins, even to those who believe on his name. Why then declare you not, John, the punishment of those who received Him not? Is it because there is no greater punishment than that, when the power of becoming the sons of God is offered to men, they should not become such, but voluntarily deprive themselves of the dignity? But besides this, inextinguishable fire awaits all such, as will appear clearly farther on.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. To be made then the sons of God, and brothers of Christ, they must of course be born; for if they are not born, how can they be sons? Now the sons of men are born of flesh and blood, and the will of man, and the embrace of wedlock; but how these are born, the next words declare: Not of bloods; that is, the male’s and the female’s. Bloods is not correct Latin, but as it is plural in the Greek, the translator preferred to put it so, though it be not strictly grammatical, at the same time explaining the word in order not to offend the weakness of one’s hearers.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. In that which follows, Nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, the flesh is put for the female; because, when she was made out of the rib, Adam said, This is now bone of my bone, and flesh of my flesh. The flesh therefore is put for the wife, as the spirit sometimes is for the husband; because that the one ought to govern, the other to obey. For what is there worse than a house, where the woman has rule over the man? But these that we speak of are born neither of the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Evangelist makes this declaration, that being taught the vileness and inferiority of our former birth, which is through blood, and the will of the flesh, and understanding the loftiness and nobleness of the second, which is through grace, we might hence receive great knowledge, worthy of being bestowed by him who begat us, and after this show forth much zeal.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus, After saying that they were born of God, who received Him, he sets forth the cause of this honor, viz. the Word being made flesh, God’s own Son was made the son of man, that he might make the sons of men the sons of God. Now when you hear that the Word was made flesh, be not disturbed, for He did not change His substance into flesh, which it were indeed impious to suppose; but remaining what He was, took upon Him the form of a servant. But as there are some who say, that the whole of the incarnation was only in appearance, to refute such a blasphemy, he used the expression, was made, meaning to represent not a conversion of substance, but an assumption of real flesh. But if they say, God is omnipotent; why then could He not be changed into flesh? we reply, that a change from an unchangeable nature is a contradiction.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. As our word becomes the bodily voice, by its assumption of that voice, as a means of developing itself externally, so the Word of God was made flesh, by assuming flesh, as a means of manifesting Itself to the world. And as our word is made voice, yet is not turned into voice; so the Word of God was made flesh, but never turned into flesh. It is by assuming another nature, not by consuming themselves in it, that our word is made voice, and the Word, flesh.

          <td><b>EX GESTIS CONC. EPH</b>. The discourse which we utter, which we use in conversation with each other, is incorporeal, imperceptible, impalpable; but clothed in letters and characters, it becomes material, perceptible, tangible.

Sic itaque dictum est verbum caro factum est; ac si diceret: verbum homo factum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If men are disturbed however by its being said that the Word was made flesh, without mention of a soul; let them know that the flesh is put for the whole man, the part for the whole, by a figure of speech; as in the Psalms, Unto you shall all flesh come; and again in Romans, By the deeds of the law there shall no flesh be justified. In the same sense it is said here that the Word was made flesh; meaning that the Word was made man.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Evangelista volens ostendere inenarrabilem Dei condescensum, carnem commemorat, ut illius admiremur misericordiam, quoniam propter nostram salutem quod omnino remotum et distans est ab eius natura, assumpsit, scilicet carnem; anima namque habet aliquam propinquitatem ad Deum. Si autem verbum incarnatum est, et humanam animam non assumpsit; sequeretur quod adhuc animae nostrae curatae non essent: quod enim non assumpsit, non sanctificavit. Et qualis derisio, cum anima prius peccaverit, ut carnem assumendo sanctificaverit, id quod est principalius infirmum reliquerit? Subvertitur ex hoc dicto Nestorius, qui dicebat quod non Deus verbum ipse idem factus est homo ex sacro conceptus sanguine virginis; sed virgo peperit hominem qui omnis virtutis dotatus erat specie, et Dei verbum illi erat coniunctum: et ex hoc duos filios asserebat: unum natum de virgine, scilicet hominem; alterum de Deo, scilicet Dei filium, homini illi coniunctum secundum gratiae habitudinem et amorem. Contra quem Evangelista dixit, quod ipsum verbum factum est homo, non quod verbum inveniens hominem virtuosum, se sibi coniunxerit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Evangelist intends by making mention of the flesh, to show the unspeakable condescension of God, and lead us to admire His compassion, in assuming for our salvation, what was so opposite and incongenial to His nature, as the flesh: for the soul has some propinquity to God. If the Word, however, was made flesh, and assumed not at the same time a human soul, our souls, it would follow, would not be yet restored: for what He did not assume, He could not sanctify. What a mockery then, when the soul first sinned, to assume and sanctify the flesh only, leaving the weakest part untouched! This text overthrows Nestorius, who asserted that it was not the very Word, even God, Who the Self-same was made man, being conceived of the sacred blood of the Virgin: but that the Virgin brought forth a man endowed with every kind of virtue, and that the Word of God was united to him: thus making out two sons, one born of the Virgin, i.e. man, the other born of God, that is, the Son of God, united to that man by grace, and relation, and love. In opposition to him the Evangelist declares, that the very Word was made Man, not that the Word fixing upon a righteous man united Himself to him.

          <td><b>CYRIL</b>; The Word uniting to Himself a body of flesh animated with a rational soul, substantially, was ineffably and incomprehensibly made Man, and called the Son of man, and that not according to the will only, or good-pleasure, nor again by the assumption of the Person alone. The natures are different indeed which are brought into true union, but He Who is of both, Christ the Son, is One; the difference of the natures, on the other hand, not being destroyed in consequence of this coalition.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. From the text, The Word was made flesh, we learn this farther, that the Word Itself is man, and being the Son of God was made the Son of a woman, who is rightly called the Mother of God, as having given birth to God in the flesh.

Et arguere nos solent, quod Christum dicamus esse natum non nostri corporis atque animae hominem, cum nos verbum carnem factum, nostrae similitudinis natum hominem praedicemus, ut vere Dei filius vere filius hominis natus sit; et ut per se sibi assumpsit ex virgine corpus, ita ex se sibi animam assumpsit; quae utique ab homine numquam gignentium originibus praebetur: et cum ipse ille filius hominis sit, quam ridicule praeter Dei filium, qui verbum caro factum est, alium nescio quem tamquam prophetam verbo Dei animatum praedicabimus, cum dominus Iesus Christus et Dei filius et hominis filius sit?

And they are accustomed to charge us with holding, that Christ was born a Man, not of our body and soul; whereas we preach the Word made flesh, and after our likeness born Man, so that He Who is truly Son of God, was truly born Son of man; and that, as by His own act He took upon Him a body of the Virgin, so of Himself He took a soul also, which in no case is derived from man by mere parental origin. And seeing He, The Self-same, is the Son of man, how absurd were it, besides the Son of God, Who is the Word, to make Him another person besides, a sort of prophet, inspired by the Word of God; whereas our Lord Jesus Christ is both the Son of God, and the Son of man.

Irruerat enim homini quasi pulvis in oculum de terra: oculus iste sauciatus erat, et terra illuc mittitur ut sanetur: caro te obcaecaverat, caro te sanat.

Or thus; in that the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us, His birth became a kind of ointment to anoint the eyes of our heart, that we might through His humanity discern His majesty; and therefore it follows, And we saw His glory. No one could see His glory, who was not healed by the humility of the flesh. For there had flown upon man’s eye as it were dust from the earth: the eye had been diseased, and earth was sent to heal it again; the flesh had blinded you, the flesh restores you. The soul by consenting to carnal affections had become carnal; hence the eye of the mind had been blinded: then the physician made for thee ointment. He came in such wise, as that by the flesh He destroyed the corruption of the flesh. And thus the Word was made flesh, that you might be able to say, We saw His glory.

Ab omnibus his nos abducens Evangelista, et supra omnem naturam et conservorum nostrorum claritatem erigens mentem, ad ipsum nos perducit verticem; quasi dicat: non ut prophetae aut alterius hominis, vel Angeli, aut Archangeli, aut alicuius superiorum virtutum, est gloria quam vidimus; sed quasi ipsius regis, ipsius naturalis filii unigeniti.

But the Evangelist withdrawing our minds from these, and raising them above all nature, and every preeminence of fellow servants, leads us up to the summit Himself; as if he said, Not of prophet, or of any other man, or of Angel, or Archangel, or any of the higher powers, is the glory which we beheld; but as that of the very Lord, very King, very and true Only-Begotten Son.

So too John says, We saw His glory, the glory as of the Only Begotten of the Father. For Angels, when they appeared, did every thing as servants who had a Lord, but He as the Lord appearing in humble form. Yet did all creatures recognize their Lord, the star calling the Magi, the Angels the shepherds, the child leaping in the womb acknowledged Him: yes the Father bore witness to Him from heaven, and the Paraclete descending upon Him: and the very universe itself shouted louder than any trumpet, that the King of heaven had come. For devils fled, diseases were healed, the graves gave up the dead, and souls were brought out of wickedness, to the utmost height of virtue.

Multoties autem Evangelista revolvit eius testimonium, quia multam admirationem huius viri habebant Iudaei. Et alii quidem Evangelistae antiquorum meminerunt prophetarum, dicentes: hoc factum est ut impleatur quod dictum est per prophetam; hic autem altiorem et recentiorem testem inducit, non intendens a servo dominatorem facere fide dignum, sed auditorum imbecillitati condescendens. Quemadmodum enim nisi servi formam assumpsisset, non ita facile susceptibilis factus esset; ita nisi servi voce auditum conservorum praeexcitasset, nequaquam multi Iudaeorum verbum Christi suscepissent.

Quemadmodum enim matres avium, non confestim pullos suos volationem docent; sed primo quidem extra nidum educunt, postea vero aliam multo velociorem volationem apponunt; sic et Ioannes non confestim Iudaeos ad alta duxit, sed interim paululum a terra eos evolare docuit, dicens, quod Christus melior eo erat; quod non parum interim erat. Et vide qualiter sapienter inducit testimonium: non enim solum apparentem Christum monstrat; sed et antequam apparuisset eum praedicat; quod significatur in hoc quod dicit hic erat de quo dixi. Hoc autem fecit ut facile susceptibilis esset Christus, hominum mente iam praedetenta ab aliis quae de eo dicta erant, et nihil ad hoc humilitas habitus noceret. Ita enim humili et communi omnibus forma Christus utebatur, ut si simul et verba haec audissent de eo, et eum considerassent, Ioannis testimonium derisissent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or he introduces this, as if to say, Do not suppose that we bear witness to this out of gratitude, because we were with Him a long time, and partook of His table; for John who had never seen Him before, nor tarried with Him, bore witness to Him. The Evangelist repeats John’s testimony many times here and there, because he was held in such admiration by the Jews. Other Evangelists refer to the old prophets, and say, This was done that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet. But he introduces a loftier, and later witness, not intending to make the servant vouch for the master, but only condescending to the weakness of his hearers. For as Christ would not have been so readily received, had He not taken upon Him the form of a servant; so if he had not excited the attention of servants by the voice of a fellow-servant beforehand, there would not have been many Jews embracing the word of Christ. It follows, And cried; that is, preached with openness, with freedom, without reservation. He did not however begin with asserting that this one was the natural only-begotten Son of God, but cried, saying, This was He of whom I spoke, He that comes after me is preferred before me, for He was before me. For as birds do not teach their young all at once to fly, but first draw them outside the nest, and afterwards try them with a quicker motion; so John did not immediately lead the Jews to high things, but began with lesser flights, saying, that Christ was better than he; which in the mean time was no little advance. And observe how prudently he introduces his testimony; he not only points to Christ when He appears, but preaches Him beforehand; as, This is He of whom I spoke. This would prepare men’s minds for Christ’s coming: so that when He did come, the humility of His garb would be no impediment to His being received. For Christ adopted so humble and common an appearance, that if men had seen Him without first healing John’s testimony to His greatness, none of the things spoken of Him would have had any effect.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Sermo iste in persona Baptistae de Christo testantis prolatus est; quod plurimos fallit, ex hic usque illuc ille enarravit, credentes in persona Ioannis apostoli recitari, inconsequens autem est putare, subito et quasi intempestive interrumpi Baptistae sermonem ex verbo discipuli; et cuique scienti percipere dictorum collationem, in propatulo constat series dicti; dixerat enim ob hoc ante me factus est, qui prior me erat. Ex hoc autem coniecto priorem me fore, quod ex eius plenitudine ego quidem, et ante me prophetae accepimus gratiam secundam pro prima. Pertigerunt enim et illi post figuras per spiritum ad veritatis speculationem. Hinc etiam perpendimus ex plenitudine eius accipientes, legem quidem per Moysen fore datam, gratiam autem et veritatem per Iesum Christum, nedum fore datam, sed factam; patre quidem legem dante per Moysen, gratiam et veritatem faciente per Iesum. Sed si Iesus est qui dicit: ego sum veritas, quomodo veritas fit per Iesum? Sed intelligendum est, quod ipsa veritas substantialis (ex qua prima veritate et eius imagine sculptae sunt multae veritates in his qui veritatem tractant) nequaquam per Iesum Christum facta est, nec prorsus per aliquem; sed veritas, puta quae consistit in Paulo et apostolis, per Iesum Christum facta est.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; This is to be considered a continuation of the Baptist’s testimony to Christ, a point which has escaped the attention of many, who think that from this to, He has declared Him, St. John the Apostle is speaking. But the idea that on a sudden, and, as it would seem, unseasonably, the discourse of the Baptist should be interrupted by a speech of the disciple’s, is inadmissible. And any one, able to follow the passage, will discern a very obvious connection here. For having said, He is preferred before me, for He was before me, he proceeds, From this I know that He is before me, because I and the Prophets who preceded me have received of His fullness, and grace for grace, (the second grace for the first.) For they too by the Spirit penetrated beyond the figure to the contemplation of the truth. And hence receiving, as we have done, of his fullness, we judge that the law was given by Moses, but that grace and truth were made, by Jesus Christ - made, not given: the Father gave the law by Moses, but made grace and truth by Jesus. But if it is Jesus who says below, I am the Truth, how is truth made by Jesus? We must understand however that the very substantial Truth, from which First Truth and Its Image many truths are engraver on those who treat of the truth, was not made through Jesus Christ, or through any one; but only the truth which is in individuals, such as in Paul, e.g. or the other Apostles, was made through Jesus Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Coniungit hic testimonio Ioannis Baptistae suum testimonium Ioannes Evangelista, dicens et de plenitudine eius nos omnes accepimus. Non praecursoris est verbum, sed discipuli; quasi dicat: etiam nos omnes duodecim, et omnis plenitudo fidelium, et qui nunc sunt, et futurorum, de plenitudine eius accepimus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus; John the Evangelist here adds this testimony to that of John the Baptist, saying, And of his fullness have we all received. These are not the words of the forerunner, but of the disciple; as if he meant to say, We also the twelve, and the whole body of the faithful, both present and to come, have received of His fullness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid autem accepistis? Et gratiam pro gratia: ut nescio quid nos voluerit intelligere de plenitudine eius accepisse, et insuper gratiam pro gratia: accepimus enim de plenitudine eius primo gratiam, et rursus accepimus gratiam pro gratia. Quam gratiam primo accepimus? Fidem. Vocatur enim gratia, quia gratis datur. Hanc ergo accepit gratiam primam peccator, ut eius peccata dimitterentur; et iterum gratiam pro gratia; idest, pro hac gratia in qua ex fide vivimus, recepturi sumus aliam, idest vitam aeternam: vita enim aeterna quasi merces est fidei: sed quia ipsa fides gratia est, vita aeterna gratia est pro gratia. Non erat ista gratia in veteri testamento: quia lex minabatur, non opitulabatur; iubebat, non sanabat: languorem ostendebat, non auferebat, sed praeparabat medico venturo cum gratia et veritate; unde sequitur quia lex per Moysen data est; gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum facta est. Mortem enim temporalem et aeternam occidit mors domini tui: ipsa est gratia quae promissa et non habita erat in lege.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But whet have you received? Grace for grace. So that we are to understand that we have received a certain something from His fullness, and over and above this, grace for grace; that we have first received of His fullness, first grace; and again, we have received grace for grace. What grace did we first receive; Faith: which is called grace, because it is given freely. This is the first grace then which the sinner receives, the remission of his sins. Again, we have grace for grace; i.e. instead of that grace in which we live by faith, we are to receive another, viz. life eternal: for life eternal is as it were the wages of faith. And thus as faith itself is a good grace, so life eternal is grace for grace. There was not grace in the Old Testament; for the law threatened, but assisted not, commanded, but healed not, showed our weakness, but relieved it not. It prepared the way however for a Physician who was about to come, with the gifts of grace and truth: whence the sentence which follows: For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth were made by Jesus Christ. The death of your Lord has destroyed death, both temporal and eternal; that is the grace which was promised, but not contained, in the law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel accepimus gratiam pro gratia; idest, pro veteri novam. Sicut enim est iustitia et iustitia, adoptio et adoptio, circumcisio et circumcisio, ita gratia et gratia; sed illa quidem ut typus, haec vero ut veritas. Hoc autem induxit, ostendens quoniam et Iudaei gratia salvabantur, sed et nos omnes gratia salvi sumus: misericordiae autem et gratiae fuit legem suscipere. Propterea cum dixisset gratiam pro gratia, ostendens magnitudinem eorum quae data sunt, subdit quia lex per Moysen data est, gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum facta est. Et supra quidem Ioannes ad seipsum comparans Christum, ait ante me factus est: hic autem Evangelista ad eum qui illo tempore magis in admiratione apud Iudaeos erat quam Ioannes, Christi comparationem facit, scilicet ad Moysen. Et considera prudentiam. Non personarum, sed rerum comparationem facit, gratiam et veritatem legi opponens; et huic addit data est, quod ministrantis erat; huic autem facta est, quod est regis cum potestate omnia operantis: cum gratia quidem, quia cum potestate omnia dimittebat peccata. Et gratiam quidem eius Baptismatis donum, et adoptio quae per spiritum nobis datur, et alia multa ostendunt: veritatem autem plenius sciemus si figuras veteris legis didicerimus: ea enim quae in novo testamento perficienda erant, in veteri testamento figurae praescripserunt, quas Christus veniens adimplevit. Unde figura data est per Moysen, veritas per Christum facta est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or we have received grace for grace; that is, the new in the place of the old. For as there is a justice and a justice besides, an adoption and another adoption, a circumcision and another circumcision; so is there a grace and another grace; only the one being a type, the other a reality. He brings in the words to show that the Jews as well as ourselves are saved by grace: it being of mercy and grace that they received the law. Next, after he has said, Grace for grace, he adds something to show the magnitude of the gift; For the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth were made by Jesus Christ. John when comparing himself with Christ above had said, He is preferred before me: but the Evangelist draws a comparison between Christ, and one much more in admiration with the Jews than John, viz. Moses. And observe his wisdom. He does not draw the comparison. between the persons, but the things, contrasting grace and truth to the law: the latter of which he says was given, a word only applying to an administrator; the former made, as we should speak of a king, who does every thing by his power: though in this King it would be with grace also, because that with power He remitted all sins. Now His grace is shown in His gift of Baptism, and our adoption by the Holy Spirit, and many other things; but to have a better insight into what the truth is, we should study the figures of the old law: for what was to be accomplished in the New Testament, is prefigured in the Old, Christ at His Coming filling up the figure. Thus was the figure given by Moses, but the truth made by Christ.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Vel gratiam referamus ad scientiam, veritatem ad sapientiam: in rebus enim per tempus ortis illa summa gratia est, quod homo in unitate personae coniunctus est Deo: in rebus vero aeternis summa veritas recte tribuitur Dei verbo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, we may refer grace to knowledge, truth to wisdom. Amongst the events of time the highest grace is the uniting of man to God in One Person; in the eternal world the highest truth pertains to God the Word.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Heracleon asserts, that this is a declaration of the disciple, not of the Baptist: an unreasonable supposition; for if the words, Of His fullness have we all received, are the Baptist’s, does not the connection run naturally, that he receiving of the grace of Christ, the second in the place of the first grace, and confessing that the law was given by Moses, but grace and truth came by Jesus Christ; understood here that no man had seen God at any time, and that the Only Begotten, who was in the bosom of the Father, had committed this declaration of Himself to John, and all who with him had received of His fullness? For John was not the first who declared Him; for He Himself who was before Abraham, tells us, that Abraham rejoiced to see His glory.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Evangelista ostendens multam eminentiam donorum Christi ad ea quae per Moysen dispensata sunt, vult de reliquo causam rationalem differentiae dicere: nam ille quidem famulus existens, minorum rerum factus est minister; hic vero dominator et regis filius existens, multo maiora nobis attulit coexistens semper patri, et videns eum: propter hoc ita intulit, dicens Deum nemo vidit unquam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus; the Evangelist after showing the great superiority of Christ’s gifts, compared with those dispensed by Moses, wishes in the next place to supply an adequate reason for the difference. The one being a servant was made a minister of a lesser dispensation: but the other Who was Lord, and Son of the King, brought us far higher things, being ever coexistent with the Father, and beholding Him. Then follows, No man has seen God at any time, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Sed patenter datur intelligi quod quamdiu hic mortaliter vivitur, videri per quasdam imagines potest Deus; sed per ipsam naturae suae speciem non potest; ut anima gratia spiritus afflata, per figuras quasdam Deum videat; sed ad ipsam vim eius essentiae non pertingat. Hinc est enim quod Iacob, qui Deum se vidisse testatur, nonnisi Angelum vidit: hinc est quod Moyses, qui cum Deo facie ad faciem loquitur, dicit: ostende mihi temetipsum manifeste, ut videam te. Ex qua eius petitione colligitur, quia eum sitiebat per incircumscriptae naturae suae claritatem cernere, quem iam coeperat per quasdam imagines videre.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. It is plainly given us to understand here, that while we are in this mortal state, we see God only through the medium of certain images, not, in the reality of His own nature. A soul influenced by the grace of the Spirit may see God through certain figures, but cannot penetrate into his absolute essence. And hence it is that Jacob, who testifies that he saw God, saw nothing but an Angel: and that Moses, who talked with God face to face, says, Show me Your way, that I may know You: meaning that he ardently desired to see in the brightness of His own infinite Nature, Him Whom he had only as yet seen reflected in images.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si autem antiqui patres ipsam viderunt naturam, nequaquam differenter considerassent: simplex enim quaedam est et infigurabilis; non sedet, neque stat, neque ambulat; haec enim corporum sunt: unde et per prophetam dicit: ego visionem multiplicavi eis, et in manibus prophetarum assimilatus sum; hoc est, condescendi eis, non quod eram apparui: quia enim filius Dei per veram carnem appariturus erat nobis, primo excitavit eos videre Deum, sicut possibile erat eis videre.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. If the old fathers had seen That very Nature, they would not have contemplated It so variously, for It is in Itself simple and without shape; It sits not, It walks not; these are the qualities of bodies. Whence he said through the Prophet, I have multiplied visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the Prophets: i.e. I have condescended to them, I appeared that which I was not. For inasmuch as the Son of God was about to manifest Himself to us in actual flesh, men were at first raised to the sight of God, in such ways as allowed of their seeing Him.

Ipsi enim Deum videbunt, dictum est, non viderunt; et non vidimus, sed: videbimus eum sicuti est: Deum enim nemo vidit unquam: vel in hac vita sicuti ipse est, vel etiam in Angelorum vita, sicut visibilia ista quae corporali visione cernuntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now it is said, Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God; and again, When He shall appear, we shall be like to Him, for we shall see Him as He is. What is the meaning then of the words here: No man has seen God at any time? The reply is easy: those passages speak of God, as to be seen, not as already seen. They shall see God, it is said, not, they have seen Him: nor is it, we have seen Him, but, we shall see Him as He is. For, No man has seen God at any time, neither in this life, nor yet in the Angelic, as He is; in the same way in which sensible things are perceived by the bodily vision.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. If however any, while inhabiting this corruptible flesh, can advance to such an immeasurable height of virtue, as to be able to discern by the contemplative vision, the eternal brightness of God, their case affects not what we say. For whoever sees wisdom, that is, God, is dead wholly to this life, being no longer occupied by the love of it.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. For unless any in some sense die to this life, either by leaving the body altogether, or by being so withdrawn and alienated from carnal perceptions, that he may well not know, as the Apostle says, whether he be in the body or out of the body, he cannot be carried away, and borne aloft to that vision.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Some hold that in the place of bliss, God is visible in His brightness, but not in His nature. This is to indulge in over much subtlety. For in that simple and unchangeable essence, no division can be made between the nature and the brightness.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. If we say, that the text, No one has seen God, at any time, applies only to men; so that, as the Apostle more plainly interprets it, Whom no man has seen nor can see, no one is to be understood here to mean, no one of men: the question may be solved in a way not to contradict what our Lord says, Their Angels do always behold the face of My Father; so that we must believe that Angels see, what no one, i.e. of men, has ever seen.

Which indeed is true so far, that no bodily or even mental vision of man has ever embraced the fullness of God; for it is one thing to see, another to embrace the whole of what you see.

That we might not be led by the identity of the name, to confound Him with the sons made so by grace, the article is annexed in the first place; and then, to put an end to all doubt, the name Only-Begotten is introduced.

For he who sees simply, has not the knowledge thoroughly of that which he sees; but he who dwells in the bosom, knows every thing. When you hear then that no one knows the Father save the Son, do not by any means suppose that he only knows the Father more than any other, and does not know Him fully. For the Evangelist sets forth His residing in the bosom of the Father on this very account: viz. to show us the intimate converse of the Only-Begotten, and His co-eternity with the Father.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Farther, if the word declared have reference to the past, it must be considered that He, being made man, declared the doctrine of the Trinity in unity, and how, and by what acts we should prepare ourselves for the contemplation of it. If it have reference to the future, then it means that He will declare Him, when He shall introduce His elect to the vision of His brightness.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Fuerunt autem homines qui dicerent, vanitate cordis sui decepti: pater invisibilis est, filius autem visibilis est. Si ergo propter carnem filius visibilis dicitur, et nos concedimus, et est Catholica fides; si autem, ut ipsi dicunt, antequam incarnaretur, multum delirant, si Christus sapientia Dei et virtus Dei est: sapientia enim Dei videri oculis non potest. Si verbum hominis oculis non videtur, verbum Dei sic videri potest?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Yet have there been men, who, deceived by the vanity of their hearts, maintained that the Father is invisible, the Son visible. Now if they call the Son visible, with respect to His connection with the flesh, we object not; it is the Catholic doctrine. But it is madness in them to say He was so before His incarnation; i.e. if it be true that Christ is the Wisdom of God, and the Power of God. The Wisdom of God cannot be seen by the eye. If the human word cannot be seen by the eye, how can the Word of God?

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non igitur soli ipsi proprium est Deum nemo vidit unquam, sed et filio: quia, ut Paulus dicit, est imago Dei invisibilis; qui vero invisibilis imago est, et ipse invisibilis est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The text then, No man has seen God at any time, applies not to the Father only, but also to the Son: for He, as Paul said, is the Image of the invisible God; but He who is the Image of the Invisible, must Himself also be invisible.

Ioannem itaque quaerunt cum tanta veneratione; erga Christum autem nihil huiusmodi factum legitur a Iudaeis. Sed quod erga Ioannem Iudaei, hoc Ioannes erga Christum prosequitur, per proprios discipulos interrogans: tu es qui venturus es, an alium expectamus?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; The Jews of Jerusalem, as being of kin to the Baptist, who was of the priestly stock, send Priests and Levites to ask him who he is; that is, men considered to hold a superior rank to the rest of their order, by God’s election, and coming from that favored above all cities, Jerusalem. Such is the reverential way in which they interrogate John. We read of no such proceeding towards Christ: but what the Jews did to John, John in turn does to Christ, when he asks Him, through His disciples, Are you He that should come, or look we for another?

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Ioannes autem, ut videtur, discernebat ex quaestione, sacerdotum et Levitarum dubitationem, ne forte Christus esset baptizans; apertius tamen illud profiteri cavebant, ne temerarii putarentur. Quapropter merito, ut eorum opinio fallax de eo primitus aboleretur, ac subinde veritas propalaretur, quod non sit Christus ante omnia manifestat; unde sequitur et confessus est, et non negavit: et confessus est: quia non sum ego Christus. Hic etiam adiciamus, quia tempus adventus Christi populum recreabat quodammodo iam praesens existens, legisperitis ex sacris Scripturis illius tempus speratum colligentibus: propter quod Theodas non modicam multitudinem quasi Christus congregavit, et post illum Iudas Galilaeus in diebus professionis. Cum ergo ferventius Christi expectaretur adventus, Iudaei transmittunt ad Ioannem, per hoc quod est tu quis es? Conicere volentes si ipse se Christum fateretur. Non autem ex eo quod dicit non sum ego Christus, negavit: ex hoc enim ipso confessus est veritatem.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; John, as it appears, saw from the question, that the Priests and Levites had doubts whether it might not be the Christ, who was baptizing; which doubts however they were afraid to profess openly, for fear of incurring the charge of credulity. He wisely determines therefore first to correct their mistake, and then to proclaim the truth. Accordingly, he first of all shows that he is not the Christ: And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. We may add here, that at this time the people had already begun to be impressed with the idea that Christ’s advent was at hand, in consequence of the interpretations which the lawyers had collected out of the sacred writings to that effect. Thus Theudas had been enabled to collect together a considerable body, on the strength of his pretending to be the Christ; and after him Judas, in the days of the taxation, had done the same. Such being the strong expectation of Christ’s advent then prevalent, the Jews send to John, intending by the question, Who are you? to extract from him whether he were the Christ.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Negavit plane quod non erat, sed non negavit quod erat, ut veritatem loquens, eius membrum fieret cuius sibi nomen fallaciter non usurparet.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Passi erant Iudaei quamdam humanam passionem ad Ioannem. Indignum enim aestimabant, subici eum Christo propter multa quae Ioannis claritatem demonstrabant: quorum primum erat genus illustre, principis enim sacerdotum filius erat; deinde dura educatio, humanorum despectio. In Christo autem contrarium videbatur: genus humile, quod ei exprobrabant dicentes: nonne hic est fabri filius? Dieta communis, et vestimenta nihil plus multis habentia. Quia igitur Ioannes continue ad Christum mittebat, volentes magis Ioannem habere magistrum, mittunt ad eum, opinantes per blanditias eum allicere ad confitendum se Christum esse. Non ergo quosdam contemptibiles mittunt, ut ad Christum, ministros et Herodianos, sed sacerdotes et Levitas; et non quoscumque, sed eos qui erant ex Hierosolymis, hoc est honorabiliores; et ad hoc mittunt ut interrogarent tu quis es? Non quasi ignorantes, sed volentes eum inducere ad hoc quod dixi: unde Ioannes ad mentem et non ad interrogationem eis respondit et confessus est, et non negavit; et confessus est: quia non sum ego Christus. Et vide sapientiam Evangelistae. Tertio quasi idem dicit, et virtutem Baptistae indicans, et malitiam et amentiam Iudaeorum. Devoti enim famuli est, non solum non rapere gloriam domini, sed oblatam a multis respuere. Turbae quidem ex ignorantia ad hanc venerunt suspicionem ut Ioannem Christum aestimaret; hi vero a maligna mente, ex qua interrogabant eum, aestimantes per blanditias attrahere ad hoc quod volebant: nisi enim excogitassent hoc, respondenti non sum ego Christus, dixissent: non hoc suspicati sumus, non hoc venimus interrogaturi. Sed capti et manifesti effecti ad aliud veniunt; unde sequitur et interrogaverunt eum: quid ergo? Elias es tu?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or take this explanation: The Jews were influenced by a kind of human sympathy for John, whom they were reluctant to see made subordinate to Christ, on account of the many marks of greatness about him; his illustrious descent in the first place, he being the son of a chief priest; in the next, his hard training, and his contempt of the world. Whereas in Christ the contrary were apparent; a humble birth, for which they reproach Him; Is not this the carpenter’s son? an ordinary way of living; a dress such as every one else wore. As John then was constantly sending to Christ, they send to him, with the view of having him for their master, and thinking to induce him, by blandishments, to confess himself Christ. They do not therefore send inferior persons to him, ministers and Herodians, as they did to Christ, but Priests and Levites; and not of these an indiscriminate party, but those of Jerusalem, i.e. the more honorable ones; but they send them with this question, to ask, Who are you? not from a wish to be informed, but in order to induce him to do what I have said. John replies then to their intention, not to their interrogation: And he confessed, and denied not; but confessed, I am not the Christ. And observe the wisdom of the Evangelist: he repeats the same thing three times, to show John’s virtue, and the malice and madness of the Jews. For it is the character of a devoted servant, not only to forbear taking to himself his lord’s glory, but even, when numbers offer it to him, to reject it. The multitude indeed believed from ignorance that John was the Christ, but in these it was malice; and in this spirit they put the question to him, thinking, by their blandishments to bring him over to their wishes. For unless this had been their design, when he replied, I am not the Christ, they would have said, We did not suspect this; we did not come to ask this. When caught, however, and discovered in their purpose, they proceed to another question: And they asked him, What then? Are you Elias?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Noverant enim quod praecessurus erat Elias Christum: non enim alicui ignotum erat nomen Christi apud Hebraeos; sed non putabant illum esse Christum; nec tamen omnino putaverunt Christum non esse venturum; et cum sperarent futurum, offenderunt in praesentem. Sequitur et dixit: non sum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For they knew that Elias was to preach Christ; the name of Christ not being unknown to any among the Jews; but they did not think that our Lord was the Christ: and yet did not altogether imagine that there was no Christ about to come. In this way, while looking forward to the future, they mistook at the present. And he said, I am not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Ex his verbis nobis quaestio valde implexa generatur. Alio quippe in loco inquisitus a discipulis dominus de Eliae adventu, respondit: si vultis scire, Ioannes ipse est Elias. Requisitus autem Ioannes dicit non sum Elias. Quomodo ergo propheta veritatis est si eiusdem veritatis sermonibus concors non est?
          <td><b>GREG</b>. These words gave rise to a very different question. In another place, our Lord, when asked by His disciples concerning the coming of Elias, replied, If you will receive it, this is Elias. But John says, I am not Elias. How is he then a preacher of the truth, if he agrees not with what that very Truth declares?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Dicet aliquis quod se ignorabat Ioannes esse Eliam; et hoc nimirum utentur documento qui assistunt iteratae incorporationis rationi, tamquam anima denuo induente corpora. Quaerunt enim Iudaei per Levitas ac sacerdotes, an esset Elias, cum iteratae corporis assumptionis documentum verax arbitrantur, quasi paternum existens, nec alienum ab arcanorum suorum doctrina. Ob hoc itaque dicit Ioannes: Elias non sum; nam nescit primaevam vitam propriam. Qualiter autem videtur rationabile, si tamquam propheta spiritu illuminatus est, et de Deo et unigenito tanta narravit, ignorasse de seipso an unquam eius anima fuerit in Elia?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Some one will say that John was ignorant that he was Elias; as those say, who maintain, from this passage the doctrine of a second incorporation, as though the soul took up a new body, after leaving its old one. For the Jews, it is said, asking John by the Levites and priests, whether he is Elias, suppose the doctrine of a second body to be already certain; as though it rested upon tradition, and were part of their secret system. To which question, however, John replies, I am not Elias: not being acquainted with his own prior existence. But how is it reasonable to imagine, if John were a prophet enlightened by the Spirit, and had revealed so much concerning the Father, and the Only-Begotten, that he could be so in the dark as to himself, as not to know that his own soul had once belonged to Elias?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Sed si subtiliter veritas ipsa requiratur, hoc quidem quod inter se contrarium sonat, quomodo contrarium non sit invenitur. Ad Zachariam namque de Ioanne Angelus dixit: ipse praecedet ante illum in spiritu et virtute Eliae, quia scilicet sicut Elias secundum domini adventum praeveniet, ita Ioannes praevenit primum; sicut ille praecursor venturus est iudicis, ita iste praecursor factus est redemptoris. Ioannes igitur in spiritu Elias erat, in persona Elias non erat. Quod autem dominus fatetur de spiritu, hoc Ioannes denegat de persona: quia et iustum sic erat ut discipulis dominus spiritalem de Ioanne sententiam diceret, et Ioannes turbis carnalibus non de suo spiritu, sed de corpore responderet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But if we examine the truth accurately, that which sounds inconsistent, will be found not really so. The Angel told Zacharias concerning John, He shall go before Him in the spirit and power of Elias. As Elias then will preach the second advent of our Lord, so John preached His first; as the former will come as the precursor of the Judge, so the latter was made the precursor of the Redeemer. John was Elias in spirit, not in person: and what our Lord affirms of the spirit, John denies of the Person: there being a kind of propriety in this; viz. that our Lord to His disciples should speak spiritually of John, and that John, in answering the carnal multitude, should speak of his body, not of his spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Respondit ergo Levitis et sacerdotibus: non sum, coniectans propositum quaestionis eorum: non enim sapiebat praemissa examinatio, si idem spiritus esset in utroque; sed si Ioannes esset ipse Elias qui assumptus est, nunc apparens, secundum quod a Iudaeis expectabatur, absque nativitate. Primus autem arbitrans resumptionem corporum, dicet, quod inconsequens est filium Zachariae tanti sacerdotis in senio natum, super omnem humanam expectationem, ignorari a sacerdotibus et Levitis ipsum natum fuisse; maxime Luca testante quod factus est timor in omnibus habitantibus circa eos. Sed forsan quoniam prope finem Eliam expectabant ante Christum, quasi tropice sciscitari videntur: an es tu qui praenuntias Christum venturum? Et caute respondit: non sum. Sed nihil mirabile. Sicut in salvatore, pluribus scientibus ex Maria nativitatem eius, quidam fallebantur putantes eum Ioannem Baptistam vel Eliam, aut aliquem prophetarum; sic et in Ioanne quosdam ortus eius ex Zacharia non latebat; et quidam dubitabant, si forsan qui expectabatur Elias apparuit in Ioanne. Quoniam vero cum plures in Israel editi fuerint prophetae, unus de quo Moyses prophetaverat, praesertim expectabatur, iuxta illud: prophetam vobis suscitabit Deus ex fratribus vestris: sicut mihi, illi parebitis; tertio sciscitantur, non si foret propheta simpliciter, sed cum articulo, ut in Graeco ponitur; unde sequitur propheta es tu? Per singulos enim prophetas noverat populus Israel neminem eorum fore hunc quem Moyses prophetaverat, qui sicut Moyses medius staret inter Deum et homines, et accepto testamento a Deo traderet discipulis. Hoc autem illis nomen non Christo attribuentibus, sed arbitrantibus alium a Christo ipsum fore, Ioannes scivit quoniam et Christus ille propheta esset; unde subditur et respondit: non.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; He answers then the Levites and Priests, I am not, conjecturing what their question meant: for the purport of their examination was to discover, not whether the spirit in both was the same, but whether John was that very Elias, who was taken up, now appearing again, as the Jews expected, without another birth. But he whom we mentioned above as holding this doctrine of a reincorporation, will say that it is not consistent that the Priests and Levites should be ignorant of the birth of the son of so dignified a priest as Zacharias, who was born too in his father’s old age, and contrary to all human probabilities: especially when Luke declares, that fear came on all that dwelt round about them. But perhaps, since Elias was expected to appear before the coming of Christ near the end, they may seem to put the question figuratively, Are you he who announces the coming of Christ at the end of the world? to which he answers, I am not. But there is in fact nothing strange in supposing that John’s birth might not have been known to all. For as in the case of our Savior many knew Him to be born of Mary, and yet some wrongly imagined that He was John the Baptist, or Elias, or one of the Prophets; so in the case of John, some were not unacquainted with the fact of his being son of Zacharias, and yet some may have been in doubt whether he were not the Elias who was expected. Again, inasmuch as many prophets had arisen in Israel, but one was especially looked forward to, of whom Moses had prophesied The Lord your God will raise up unto you a Prophet from the midst of you, of your brethren, like to me; to Him shall you hearken: they ask him in the third place, not simply whether he is a prophet, but with the article prefixed, Are you that Prophet? For every one of the prophets in succession had signified to the people of Israel that he was not the one whom Moses had prophesied of; who, like Moses, was to stand in the midst between God and man, and deliver a testament, sent from God to His disciples. They did not however apply this name to Christ, but thought that He was to be a different person; whereas John knew that Christ was that Prophet, and therefore to this question, he answered, No.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel quia Ioannes maior erat quam propheta: quia prophetae longe praenuntiaverunt, Ioannes praesentem demonstrabat. Sequitur dixerunt ergo ei: quis es, ut responsum demus his qui miserunt nos? Quid dicis de teipso?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or because John was more than a prophet: for that the prophets announced Him afar off, but John pointed Him out actually present. Then said they to him, Who are you? that we may give an answer to them that sent us. What say you of yourself?

          <td><b>GREG</b>. You know that the only-begotten Son is called the Word of the Father. Now we know, in the case of our own utterance, the voice first sounds, and then the word is heard. Thus John declares himself to be the voice, i.e. because he precedes the Word, and, through his ministry, the Word of the Father is heard by man.

Scrutamini Scripturas. Dicit autem Ioannes se esse vocem non clamantem in deserto, sed clamantis in deserto, eius scilicet qui stabat et clamabat: si quis sitit, veniat ad me, et bibat. Clamat enim ut distantes auditu percipiant, et gravem habentes auditum sentiant immensitatem eorum quae dicuntur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Heracleon, in his discussion on John and the Prophets, infers that because the Savior was the Word, and John the voice, therefore the whole of the prophetic order was only sound. To which we reply, that, if the trumpet gives an uncertain sound, who shall prepare himself for the battle? If the voice of prophecy is nothing but sound, why does the Savior send us to it, saying, Search the Scriptures? But John calls himself the voice, not that cries, but of one that cries in the wilderness; viz. of Him Who stood and cried, If any man thirst, let him come to Me and drink. He cries, in order that those at a distance may hear him, and understand from the loudness of the sound, the vastness of the thing spoken of.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; There is need of the voice crying in the wilderness, that the soul, forsaken by God, may be recalled to making straight the way of the Lord, following no more the crooked paths of the serpent. This has reference both to the contemplative life, as enlightened by truth, without mixture of falsehood, and to the practical, as following up the correct perception by the suitable action. Wherefore he adds, Make straight the way of the Lord, as said the prophet Esaias.

Non quasi scire volentes, sed prohibere eum a Baptismo. Deinde vero nescio quo pacto proni ad Baptismum iverunt ad Ioannem.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; The questions of the priests and Levites being answered, another mission comes from the Pharisees: And they that were sent were of the Pharisees. So far as it is allowable to form a conjecture from the discourse itself here, I should say that it was the third occasion of John’s giving his witness. Observe the mildness of the former question, so befitting the priestly and levitical character, Who are you? There is nothing arrogant or disrespectful, but only what becomes true ministers of God. The Pharisees however, being a sectarian body, as their name implies, address the Baptist in an importunate and contumelious way. And they said, Why baptize you then, if you be not that Christ, neither Elias, neither that Prophet? not caring about information, but only wishing to prevent him baptizing. Yet the very next thing they did, was to come to John’s baptism. The solution of this is, that they came not in faith, but hypocritically, because they feared the people.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, those very same priests and Levies were of the Pharisees, and, because they could not undermine him by blandishments, began accusing, after they had compelled him to say what he was not. And they asked him, saying, Why baptize you then, if you are not the Christ, neither Elias, neither that Prophet? As if it were an act of audacity in him to baptize, when he was neither the Christ, nor His precursor, nor His proclaimer, i.e. that Prophet.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. John baptizes not with the Spirit, but with water; not being able to remit sins, he washes the bodies of the baptized with water, but not their souls with pardon. Why then cloth he baptize, when he cloth not remit sins by’ baptism? To maintain his character of forerunner. As his birth preceded our Lord’s, so cloth his baptism precede our Lord’s baptism. And he who was the forerunner of Christ in His preaching, is forerunner also in His baptism, which was the imitation of that Sacrament. And withal he announces the mystery of our redemption, saying that He, the Redeemer, is standing in the midst of men, and they know it not: There stands one among you, whom you know not: for our Lord, when He appeared in the flesh, was visible in body, but in majesty invisible.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Or thus; Having said, I indeed baptize with water,. in answer to the question, Why baptize you then? - to the next, If you be not Christ? he replies by declaring the preexistent substance of Christ; that it was of such virtue, that though His Godhead was invisible, He was present to every one, and pervaded the whole world; as is conveyed in the words; There stands one among you. For He it is, Who has diffused Himself through the whole system of nature, insomuch that every thing which is created, is created by Him; All things were made by Him. Whence it is evident that even those who inquired of John, Why baptize you then? had Him among them. Or, the words, There stands one among you, are to be understood of mankind generally. For, from our character as rational beings, it follows that the word g exists in the center of us, because the heart, which is the spring of motion within us, is situated in the center of the body. Those then who carry the word within them, but are ignorant of its nature, and the source and beginning and the way in which it resides in them; these, hearing the word within them, know it not. But John recognized Him, and reproached the Pharisees, saying, Whom you know now not. For, though expecting Christ’s coming, the Pharisees had formed no lofty conception of Him, but supposed that He would only be a holy man: wherefore he briefly refutes their ignorance, and the false ideas that they had of His excellence. He said, stand; for as the Father stands, i.e. exists without variation or change, so stands the Word ever in the work of salvation, though It assume flesh, though It be in the midst of men, though It stand invisible. Lest any one however should think that the invisible One Who comes to all men, and to the universal world, is different from Him Who was made man, and appeared on the earth, he adds, He that comes after me, i.e. Who will appear after me. The after however here has not the same meaning that it has, when Christ calls us after Him; for there we are told to follow after Him, that by treading in His steps, we may attain to the Father; but here the word is used to intimate what should follow upon John’s teaching; for he came that all may believe, having by his ministry been fitted gradually by lesser things, for the reception of the perfect Word. Therefore he said, He it is Who comes after me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Ac si diceret: ne aestimetis totum in meo consistere Baptismate; si enim meum Baptisma perfectum esset, alius non veniret post me, aliud Baptisma daturus. Sed haec praeparatio est illius, et transibit in proximo, ut umbra et imago; sed oportet eum qui veritatem imponet, venire post me: si enim hoc esset perfectum, nequaquam secundi locus quaereretur; et ideo subdit qui ante me factus est, hic est honorabilior et clarior.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if he said, Do not think that every thing is contained in my baptism; for if my baptism were perfect, another would not come after me with another baptism. This baptism of mine is but an introduction to the other, and will soon pass away, like a shadow, or an image. There is One coming after me to establish the truth: and therefore this is not a perfect baptism; for, if it were, there would be no room for a second: and therefore he adds, Who is made before me: i.e. is more honorable, more lofty.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But lest you should think this to be the result of comparison, he immediately shows it to be a superiority beyond all comparison; Whose shoe latchet I am not worthy to unloose: as if He said, He is so much before me, that I am unworthy to be numbered among the lowest of His attendants: the unloosing of the sandal being the very lowest kind of service.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Vel aliter. Mos apud veteres fuit ut si quis eam quae sibi competeret, accipere uxorem nollet, ille ei calceamentum solveret qui ad hanc sponsus iure propinquitatis veniret. Quid igitur inter homines Christus, nisi sanctae Ecclesiae sponsus apparuit? Recte ergo Ioannes se indignum esse ad solvendam corrigiam eius calceamenti denuntiat; ac si aperte dicat: redemptoris vestigia non denudare valeo; quia sponsi nomen mihi immeritus non usurpo. Quod tamen intelligi et aliter potest. Quis enim nesciat quod calceamenta ex mortuis animalibus fiant? Incarnatus vero dominus veniens, quasi calceatus apparuit, qui in divinitate sua morticina nostrae corruptionis assumpsit. Corrigia ergo calceamenti est ligatura mysterii. Ioannes ergo solvere corrigiam calceamenti eius non valet: quia incarnationis mysterium nec ipse investigare sufficit; ac si patenter dicat: quid mirum si mihi ille praelatus est quem post me quidem natum considero, sed nativitatis eius mysterium non comprehendo?
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or thus: It was a law of the old dispensation, that, if a man refused to take the woman, who of right came to him, to wife, he who by right of relationship came next to be the husband, should unloose his shoe. Now in what character did Christ appear in the world, but as Spouse of the Holy Church? John then very properly pronounced himself unworthy to unloose this shoe’s latchet: as if he said, I cannot uncover the feet of the Redeemer, for I claim not the title of spouse, which I have no right to. Or the passage may be explained in another way. We know that shoes are made out of dead animals. Our Lord then, when He came in the flesh, put on, as it were, shoes; because in His Divinity He took the flesh of our corruption, wherein we had of ourselves perished. And the latchet of the shoe, is the seal upon the mystery. John is not able to unloose the shoe’s latchet; i.e. even he cannot penetrate into the mystery of the Incarnation. So he seems to say: What wonder that He is preferred before me, Whom, being born after me, I contemplate, yet the mystery of Whose birth I comprehend not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Et quia Ioannes cum decenti libertate ea quae de Christo sunt, omnibus praedicabat, propterea Evangelista et locum designat, dicens haec in Bethania facta sunt trans Iordanem, ubi erat Ioannes baptizans. Non enim in domo, neque in angulo Christum praedicabat, sed Iordanem transiens in media multitudine, praesentibus omnibus qui ab eo baptizabantur. Quaedam vero exemplariorum certius habent in Bethabora: Bethania enim non ultra Iordanem, neque in deserto erat, sed prope Hierosolymam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. John having preached the thing concerning Christ publicly and With becoming liberty, the Evangelist mentions the place of His preaching: These things were done in Bethany beyond Jordan, where John was baptizing. For it was in no house or corner that John preached Christ, but beyond Jordan, in the midst of a multitude, and in the presence of all whom He had baptized. Some copies read more correctly Bethabara: for Bethany was not beyond Jordan, or in the desert, but near Jerusalem.

Quis autem erit hic fluvius nisi salvator noster, per quem ingredientem in hunc mundum mundari convenit, non suum descendentem descensum, sed humani generis? Hic segregat donatas a Moyse, ab his quae per Iesum donantur, sortes; huius rivuli laetificant civitatem Dei. Sicut autem draco latitat in Aegyptiaco fluvio, ita Deus in isto. Pater enim est in filio; et qui proficiscuntur illuc ubi se lavent, opprobrium Aegypti deponunt, ac apti ad perceptionem hereditatis parantur, necnon a lepra mundantur, et duplicis capaces sunt gratiae, ac prompti fiunt ad susceptionem spiritus almi, in aliud flumen nequaquam descendente spiritali columba. Trans Iordanem vero Ioannes baptizat, ut praecursor venientis non innocentes sed peccatores vocaret.
          <td><b>ORIG</b>. Bethabara means house of preparation; which agrees with the baptism of Him, who was making ready a people prepared for the Lord. Jordan, again, means, “their crescent.” Now what is this river but our Savior, through Whom coming into this earth all must be cleansed, in that He came down not for His own sake, but for theirs. This river it is which separates the lots given by Moses, from those given by Jesus; its streams make glad the city of God. As the serpent lies hid in the Egyptian river, so does God in this; for the Father is in the Son. Wherefore whosoever go thither to wash themselves, lay aside the reproach of Egypt, are made meet to receive the inheritance, are cleansed form leprosy, are made capable of a double portion of grace, and ready to receive the Holy Spirit; nor does the spiritual dove light upon any other river. John again baptizes beyond Jordan, as the precursor of Him Who came not to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.

Wherefore it is said, The next day John sees Jesus coming to him. Long before this, the Mother of Jesus, as soon as she had conceived Him, went to see the mother of John then pregnant; and as soon as the sound of Mary’s salutation reached the ears of Elisabeth, John leaped in the womb: but now the Baptist himself after his testimony sees Jesus coming. Men are first prepared by hearing from others, and then see with their own eyes. The example of Mary going to see Elisabeth her interior, and the Son of God going to see the Baptist, should teach us modesty and fervent charity to our inferiors.

Or; Matthew relates directly Christ’s coming to His baptism, John His coming a second time subsequent to His baptism, as appears from what follows: I saw the Spirit descending, &amp;c. The Evangelists have divided the periods of the history between them; Matthew passing over the part before John’s imprisonment, and hastening to that event; John chiefly dwelling on what took place before the imprisonment. Thus he says, The next day John sees Jesus coming to him. But why did He come to him the next day after His baptism? Having been baptized with the multitude, He wished to prevent any from thinking that He came to John for the same reason that others did, viz. to confess His sins, and be washed in the river to repentance. He comes therefore to give John an opportunity of correcting this mistake; which John accordingly did correct; viz. by those words, Behold the Lamb of God, which takes away the sin of the world. For He Who was so pure, as to be able to absolve other men’s sins, evidently could not have come thither for the sake of confessing His own; but only to give John an opportunity of speaking of Him. He came too the next day, that those who had heard the former testimonies of John, might hear them again more plainly; and other besides. For he said, Behold the Lamb of God, signifying that He was the one of old sought after, and reminding them of the prophecy of Isaiah, and of the shadows of the Mosaic law, in order that through the figure he might the easier lead them to the substance.

Quaenam autem oblatio alia potest esse quotidiana a rationali natura comprehendenda, nisi verbum vigens, agnus typice nuncupatum? Hoc nempe censebitur oblatio matutina ad frequentiam intellectus in divinis relatum: neque enim anima pati potest ut summis iugiter insistat, eo quod corporis terrestris et gravis coniugium est sortita. Ex hoc etiam verbo quod Christus est agnus, coniectare de pluribus poterimus: et quodammodo vespere pertingemus ad corporalia procedentes. Qui autem hunc obtulit agnum ad immolandum, Deus fuit in homine reconditus, magnus sacerdos, qui dixit: nemo tollit animam meam a me, sed ego pono eam; unde dicitur agnus Dei: ipse enim nostros languores accipiens, totius mundi tollens peccata, mortem quasi Baptismum suscepit.

But what other daily offering can there be, that can be meant to be offered by a reasonable nature, except the perfect Word, typically called the Lamb? This sacrifice, which is offered up as soon as the soul begins to be enlightened, shall be accounted as a morning sacrifice, referring to the frequent exercise of the mind in divine things; for the soul cannot continually apply to the highest objects because of its union with an earthly and gross body. By this Word too, Which is Christ the Lamb, we shall be able to reason on many things, and shall in a manner attain to Him in the evening, while engaged with things of the body. But He Who offered the lamb for a sacrifice, was God hid in human form, the great Priest, He who said below, No man takes it (My life) from Me, but I lay it down of Myself: whence this name, the Lamb of God: for He carrying our sorrows, and taking away the sins of the whole world, has undergone death, as it were baptism. For God suffers no fault to pass uncorrected; but punishes it by the sharpest discipline.

And whereas that typical lamb did not take away any man’s sin, this one has taken away the sin of the whole world, rescuing it from the danger it was in from the wrath of God. Behold Him Who takes away the sin of the world: he said not, who will take, but, Who takes away the sin of the world; as if He were always doing this. For He did not then only take it away when He suffered, but from that time to the present, He takes it away; not by being always crucified, for He made one sacrifice for sins, but by ever washing it by means of that sacrifice.

In medio vero tempore ignotus omnibus existebat; propter quod subdit sed ut manifestetur in Israel, propterea veni ego in aqua baptizans. Hinc enim manifestum est quoniam et illa signa quae quidam dicunt a Christo in pueritia facta, mendacia et fictiones sunt. Si enim a prima aetate miracula fecisset Iesus, nequaquam neque Ioannes eum ignorasset, nec reliqua multitudo indiguisset magistro ad manifestandum eum. Non igitur ipse Christus Baptismate indigebat, neque aliquam aliam causam habebat illud lavacrum quam praemonstrationem facere eius fidei quae est in Christum. Non enim dixit: ut mundem eos qui baptizantur, neque: ut liberem a peccatis, veni baptizans; sed ut manifestetur in Israel. Sed numquid sine Baptismate non licebat praedicare et inducere turbas?

That He might not seem however to give His testimony from any motive of friendship or kindred, in consequence of his being related to our Lord according to the flesh, he says, I knew Him not. John could not of course know Him, having lived in the desert. And the miraculous events of Christ’s childhood, the journey of the Magi, and such like, were now a long time past; John having been quite an infant, when they happened. And throughout the whole of the interval, He had been absolutely unknown: insomuch that John proceeds, But that He should, be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I come baptizing with water. (And hence it is clear that the miracles said to have been performed by Christ in His childhood, are false and fictitious. For if Jesus had performed miracles at this early age, he would not have been unknown to John, nor would the multitude have wanted a teacher to point Him out.) Christ Himself then did not want baptism; nor was that washing for any other reason, than to give a sign beforehand of faith in Christ. For John said not, in order to change men, and deliver from sin, but, that he should be made manifest in Israel, have I come baptizing. But would it not have been lawful for him to preach, and bring crowds together, without baptizing? Yes: but this was the easier way, for he would not have collected such numbers, had he preached without baptizing.

Its descent upon Him at His baptism; herein He condescended to prefigure His body, the Church, wherein those who are baptized receive preeminently the Holy Spirit. For it would be absurd to suppose that at thirty years old, (which was His age, when He was baptized by John,) He received for the first time the Holy Spirit: and that, when He came to that baptism, as He was without sin, so was He without the Holy Spirit. For if even of His servant and forerunner John it is written, He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost, even from His mother’s womb; if He, though sprung from His father’s seed, yet received the Holy Ghost, when as yet He was only formed in the womb; what ought we to think and believe of Christ, whose very flesh had not a carnal but spiritual conception?

In ista Trinitate missi sunt apostoli baptizare in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Holy Ghost was made to appear visibly in two ways: as a dove, upon our Lord at His baptism; and as a flame upon His disciples, when they were met together: the former shape denoting simplicity, the latter fervency. The dove intimates that souls sanctified by the Spirit should have no guile; the fire, that in that simplicity there should not be coldness. Nor let it disturb you, that the tongues are cloven; fear no division; unity is assured to us in the dove. It was meet then that the Holy Spirit should be thus manifested descending upon our Lord; in order that every one who had the Spirit might know, that he ought to be simple as a dove, and be in sincere peace with the brethren. The kisses of doves represent this peace. Ravens kiss, but they tear also; but the nature of the dove is most alien to tearing. Ravens feed on the dead, but the dove eats nothing but the fruits of the earth. If doves moan in their love, marvel not that He Who appeared in the likeness of a dove, the Holy Spirit, makes intercession for us with groanings that cannot be uttered. The Holy Spirit however groans not in Himself, but in us: He makes us to groan. And he who groans, as knowing that, so long as He is under the burden of this mortality, he is absent from the Lord, groans well: it is the Spirit that has taught him to groan. But many groan because of earthly calamities; because of losses which disquiet them, or bodily sickness which weigh heavily on them: they groan not, as does the dove. What then could more fitly represent the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of unity, than the dove? as He said Himself to His reconciled Church, My dove is one. What could better express humility, than the simplicity and moaning of a dove? Wherefore on this occasion it was that there appeared the very most Holy Trinity, the Father in the voice which said, You are My beloved Son; the Holy Spirit in the likeness of the dove. In that Trinity the Apostles were sent to baptize, i.e. in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

But when the disciples are told of the same Spirit, He shall dwell with you, how is the abiding of the Spirit a peculiar sign of Christ? This will appear if we distinguish between the different gifts of the Spirit. As regards those gifts which are necessary for attaining to life, the Holy Spirit ever abides in all the elect; such are gentleness, humility, faith, hope, charity: but with respect to those, which have for their object, not our own salvation, but that of others, he does not always abide, but sometimes withdraws, and ceases to exhibit them; that men may be more humble in the possession of His gifts.

Should any however think that Christ really wanted the Holy Spirit, in the way that we do, he corrects this notion also, by informing us that the descent of the Holy Ghost took place only for the purpose of manifesting Christ: And I knew Him not: but He that sent me to baptize with water, the same said to me, Upon whom you shall see the Spirit descending, and remaining on Him, the same is He which baptizes with the Holy Ghost.

How then knew he not Him, by Whom he was sent? For if he knew not Him, by Whom he wished to be baptized, it was rash in him to say, I have need to be baptized by You. So then he knew Him; and why said he, I knew Him not?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed legantur alii Evangelistae, qui planius illud dixerunt; et inveniemus apertissime tunc descendisse columbam cum dominus ab aqua ascendit. Si ergo post Baptisma descendit columba, et antequam baptizaretur dixit illi Ioannes ego a te debeo baptizari; ante Baptismum illum noverat: quomodo ergo dixit ego nesciebam eum; sed qui misit me baptizare? et cetera. Hoc audivit Ioannes, ut nosceret eum quem non noverat, an forte ut plenius nosset quem iam noverat? Noverat quidem dominum, noverat filium Dei, noverat quia ipse baptizaret in spiritu sancto. Ante enim quam veniret ad fluvium Christus, cum multi ad Ioannem concurrerent, ait illis qui post me venit, maior me est: ipse vos baptizabit in spiritu sancto et igne. Sed quid? Non noverat, potestatem Baptismi ipsum dominum habiturum et sibi retenturum (ne Paulus aut Petrus diceret: Baptismus meus, sicut invenis dixisse: Evangelium meum), sed ministerium plane transiturum in bonos et malos? Quid tibi faciat malus minister, ubi bonus est dominus? Ecce post Ioannem baptizatum est, post homicidam non est baptizatum: quia Ioannes dedit Baptismum suum, homicida dedit Baptismum Christi; quod sacramentum tam sanctum est ut nec homicida ministrante polluatur. Potuit autem dominus, si vellet, potestatem dare alicui servo suo ut daret Baptismum suum tamquam vice sua, et constituere tantam vim in Baptismate translato in servum, quantam vim haberet Baptisma datum a domino. Hoc noluit ut in illo esset spes baptizatorum a quo baptizatos se agnoscerent; et noluit servum ponere spem in servo. Si autem daret hanc potestatem servis, tot essent Baptismata quot essent servi; et quomodo dictum est Baptisma Ioannis, sic diceretur Baptisma Petri vel Pauli. Per hanc ergo potestatem, quam solum sibi Christus retinuit, stat unitas Ecclesiae, de qua dictum est: una est columba mea. Potest autem fieri ut aliquis habeat Baptismum praeter columbam; ut prosit ei Baptismus praeter columbam, non potest.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Let us turn to the other Evangelists, who relate the matter more clearly, and we shall find most satisfactorily, that the dove descended when our Lord ascended from the water. If then the dove descended after baptism, but John said before the baptism, I have need to be baptized of You, he knew Him before His baptism also. How then said he, I knew him not, but He which sent me to baptize? Was this the first revelation made to John of Christ’s person, or was it not rather a fuller disclosure of what had been already revealed? John knew the Lord to be the Son of God, knew that He would baptize with the Holy Ghost: for before Christ came to the river, many having come together to hear John, he said unto them, He that comes after me is mightier than I: He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. What then? He did not know that our Lord (lest Paul or Peter might say, my baptism, as we find Paul did say, my Gospel,) would have and retain to Himself the power of baptism, the ministering of it however passing to good and bad indiscriminately. What hindrance is the badness of the minister, when the Lord is good? So then we baptize again after John’s baptism; after a homicide’s we baptize not: because John gave his own baptism, the homicide gives Christ’s; which is so holy a sacrament, that not even a homicide’s ministration can pollute it. Our Lord could, had He so willed, have given power to any servant of His to give baptism as it were in His own stead; and to the baptism, thus transferred to the servant, have imparted the same power, that it would have had, when given by Himself. But this He did not choose to do; that the hope of the baptized might be directed to Him, Who had baptized them; He wished not the servant to place hope in the servant. And again, had He given this power to servants, there would have been as many baptisms as servants; as there had been the baptism of John, so should we have had the baptism of Paul and of Peter. It is by this power then, which Christ retains in His own possession exclusively, that the unity of the Church is established; of which it is said, My dove is one. A man may have a baptism besides the dove; but that any besides the dove should profit, is impossible.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et quia pater vocem emisit praedicans filium, superveniet spiritus sanctus vocem trahens super caput Christi, ne quis praesentium existimaret dici de Ioanne quod dictum est de Christo. Sed dicet aliquis: qualiter non crediderunt Iudaei, si viderunt spiritum? Sed talia non solum indigent oculis corporis, sed magis visione mentis. Si namque miracula facientem videntes, intantum ebrii erant a livore ut contraria his quae videbantur, enuntiarent; qualiter solo adventu spiritus sancti in specie columbae expulissent incredulitatem? Quidam vero dicunt, non omnes vidisse spiritum, sed solum Ioannem, et eos qui devotius dispositi erant. Etsi enim sensibilibus oculis possibile erat videre in specie columbae spiritum descendentem; non tamen propter hoc necesse est omnibus hoc fuisse manifestum. Etenim Zacharias in specie sensibili multa consideravit, et Daniel, et Ezechiel; sed et Moyses multa vidit, qualia aliorum nullus: unde subdit Ioannes et ego vidi, et testimonium perhibui, quia hic est filius Dei. Agnum quidem eum vocaverat; et quoniam in spiritu baptizare debebat, dixit, filium autem ante hoc nusquam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Father having sent forth a voice proclaiming the Son, the Holy Spirit came besides, bringing the voice upon the head of Christ, in order that no one present might think that what was said of Christ, was said of John. But it will be asked: How was it that the Jews believed not, if they saw the Spirit? Such sights however require the mental vision, rather than the bodily. If those who saw Christ working miracles were so drunken with malice, that they denied what their own eyes had seen, how could the appearance of the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove overcome their incredulity? Some say however that the sight was not visible to all, but only to John, and the more devotional part. But even if the descent of the Spirit, as a dove, was visible to the outward eye, it does not follow that because all saw it, all understood it. Zacharias himself, Daniel, Ezechiel, and Moses saw many things, appealing to their senses, which no one else saw: and therefore John adds, And I saw and bore record that this is the Son of God. He had called Him the Lamb before, and said that He would baptize with the Spirit; but he had no where called Him the Son before.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Oportebat enim ut ille baptizaret qui est filius Dei unicus, non adoptatus. Adoptati filii ministri sunt unici; unicus autem habet potestatem, adoptati ministerium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It was necessary that the Only Son of God should baptize, not an adopted son. Adopted sons are ministers of the Only Son: but though they have the ministration, the Only one alone has the power.

Because he wished this to be done by the works of Christ Himself. And observe how much greater an effort was produced; He struck a small spark, and suddenly it rose into a flame. Again, if John had gone about and preached, it would have seemed like human partiality, and great suspicion would have been excited. Now the Prophets and Apostles all preached Christ absent; the former before His appearance in the flesh, the latter after His assumption. But He was to be pointed out by the eye, not by the voice only; and therefore it follows: And looking upon Jesus as He walked, he said, Behold the Lamb of God!

And so, undertaking to follow Christ, through this instruction common to all, they remained thenceforth firm, following Christ for their own advantage, not as an act of favor to their master. John does not exhort: he simply gazes in admiration on Christ, pointing out the gift He came to bestow, the cleansing from sin: and the mode in which this would be accomplished: both of which the word Lamb testifies to.

Ita Christus venit copulaturus sibi Ecclesiam, nihil ipse dixit; sed accessit solum amicus eius Ioannes, dexteram ei sponsae imposuit, per sermones suos animas hominum in manus ei ponens; quos accipiens ita disposuit ut ultra ad Ioannem non redirent. Sed aliud hic observandum est: sicut enim in nuptiis non puella ad sponsum vadit, sed ipse ad eam festinat, ita hic contingit: non enim in caelum ascendit hominum natura; sed ad eam filius Dei accessit, et ad domum duxit paternam. Et quidem alii discipuli Ioannis erant qui non solum secuti non sunt, sed et zelotype ad Christum dispositi erant; qui autem meliores erant, simul audierunt et secuti sunt, non quasi magistrum priorem contemnentes, sed ab eo persuasi, promittente quod baptizaret in spiritu sancto Christus.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe; when he said, He that comes after me is made before me, and, Whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose, he gained over none; but when he made mention of the economy, and gave his discourse a humbler turn, saying, Behold the Lamb of God, then his disciples followed Christ. For many persons are less influenced by the thoughts of God’s greatness and majesty, than when they hear of His being man’s Helper and Friend; or any thing pertaining to the salvation of men. Observe too, when John says, Behold the Lamb of God, Christ says nothing. The Bridegroom stands by in silence; others introduce Him, and deliver the Bride into His hands; He receives her, and so treats her that she no longer remembers those who gave her in marriage. Thus Christ came to unite to Himself the Church; He said nothing Himself; but John, the friend of the Bridegroom, came forth, and put the Bride’s right hand in His; i.e. by his preaching delivered into His hands men’s souls, whom receiving He so disposed of, that they returned no more to John. And observe farther; As at a marriage the maiden goes not to meet the bridegroom, (even though it be a king’s son who weds a humble handmaid,) but he hastens to her; so is it here. For human nature ascended not into heaven, but the Son of God came down to human nature, and took her to His Father’s house. Again; There were disciples of John who not only did not follow Christ, but were even enviously disposed toward Him; but the better part heard, and followed; not from contempt of their former master, but by his persuasion; because he promised them that Christ would baptize with the Holy Ghost. And see with what modesty their zeal was accompanied. They did not straightway go and interrogate Jesus on great and necessary doctrines, nor in public, but sought private converse with Him; for we are told that Jesus turned, and saw them following, and said to them, What seek you? Hence we learn, that when we once begin to form good resolutions, God gives us opportunities enough of improvement. Christ asks the question, not because He needed to be told, but in order to encourage familiarity and confidence, and show that He thought them worthy of His instructions.

And, in a mystical sense too, they wish to know in whom Christ dwells, that profiting by their example they may themselves become fit to be His dwelling. Or, their seeing Jesus walking, and straightway inquiring where He resides, is an intimation to us, that we should, remembering His Incarnation, earnestly entreat Him to show us our eternal habitation. The request being so good a one, Christ promises a free and full disclosure. He said to them, Come and see: that is to say, My dwelling is not to be understood by words, but by works; come, therefore, by believing and working, and then see by understanding.

Qualiter ergo alibi ait: filius hominis non habet ubi caput reclinet, hic autem dicit venite et videte ubi habito? Sed per hoc quod dixit: non habet ubi caput suum reclinet demonstravit quod habitaculum proprium non habebat, non quod in domo non maneret; sequitur enim venerunt, et viderunt ubi maneret, et manserunt ibi die illo. Cuius autem gratia manserunt non adiungit Evangelista, quia manifestum erat quod propter doctrinam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ does not describe His house and situation, but brings them after Him, showing that he had already accepted them as His own. He says not, It is not the time now, tomorrow you shall hear if you wish to learn; but addresses them familiarly, as friends who had lived with him a long time. But how is it that He said in another place, The Son of man has no where to lay His head? when here He says, Come and see where I live? His not having where to lay His head, could only have meant that He had no dwelling of His own, not that He did not live in a house at all: for the next words are, They came and saw where He dwelt, and abode with Him that day. Why they stayed the Evangelist does not say: it being obviously for the sake of His teaching.

Ioannes vero, cuius isti erant discipuli, non erat talis: sed cum multo maiori sobrietate vespere degens quam nos mane.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It showed a strong desire to hear Him, since even at sunset they did not turn from Him. To sensual persons the time after meals is unsuitable for any grave employment, their bodies being overloaded with food. But John, whose disciples these were, was not such a one. His evening was a more abstemious one than our mornings.

Sequitur erat autem Andreas frater Simonis Petri unus ex duobus qui audierant a Ioanne, et secuti fuerant eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The number here signifies the law, which was composed of ten commandments. The time had come when the law was to be fulfilled by love, the Jews, who acted from fear, having been unable to fulfill it, and therefore was it at the tenth hour that our Lord heard Himself called, Rabbi; none but the giver of the law is the teacher of the law.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. One of the two which heard John speak and followed Him was Andrew, Simon Peter’s brother. Why is the other name left out?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Andrew kept not our Lord’s words to himself; but ran in haste to his brother, to report the good tidings: He first finds his own brother Simon, and said to him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Evangelist does not mention what Christ said to those who followed Him; but we may infer it from what follows. Andrew declares in few words what he had learnt, discloses the power of that Master Who had persuaded them, and his own previous longings after Him. For this exclamation, We have found, expresses a longing for His coming, turned to exultation, now that He was really come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Messias autem Hebraice, Graece Christus, Latine unctus dicitur: chrisma enim unctio est: ille autem singulariter unctus est: unde omnes Christiani unguntur, secundum quod in Psal. 44 dicitur: unxit te Deus Deus tuus oleo exultationis prae participibus tuis: participes enim eius sunt omnes sancti; sed ille est singulariter sanctus, et singulariter unctus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Messias in Hebrew, Christus in Greek, Unctus in Latin. Chrism is unction, and He had a special unction, which from Him extended to all Christians, as appears in the Psalm, God, even Your God, has anointed You with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. All holy persons are partakers with Him; but He is specially the Holy of Holies, specially anointed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et ideo non dixit Messiam simpliciter, sed cum adiectione articuli. Considera vero ex ipso principio obedientem Petri mentem: confestim enim cucurrit nihil tardans; unde sequitur et adduxit eum ad Iesum. Sed nullus facilitatem ei imponat, si non prius multa perquirens ita sermonem suscepit; conveniens enim est, et fratrem diligentius ei dixisse hoc, et per longa verba; sed Evangelistae ubique multa intermittunt, breviloquii curam habentes. Aliter autem neque dictum est quoniam credidit simpliciter, sed quoniam duxit eum ad Iesum, illum ei de quo dixerat traditurus, ut omnia ab illo discat. Ipse autem dominus incipit revelare ea quae deitatis sunt, et paulatim ea aperire praedicationibus. Non enim minus quam signa, prophetiae adducunt: hoc enim est maxime opus Dei, quod neque imitari Daemones possunt: nam in miraculis quidem et phantasia fit utique; futura autem praedicere cum certitudine, illius solius incorruptibilis est naturae; unde sequitur intuitus autem eum Iesus dixit: tu es Simon filius Ioanna; tu vocaberis Cephas (quod interpretatur Petrus).
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And therefore he said not Messias, but the Messias. Mark the obedience of Peter from the very first; he went immediately without delay, as appears from the next words: And he brought him to Jesus. Nor let us blame him as too yielding, because he did not ask many questions, before he received the word. It is reasonable to suppose that his brother had told him all, and sufficiently fully; but the Evangelists often make omissions for the sake of brevity. But, besides this, it is not absolutely said that he did believe, but only, He took him to Jesus; i.e. to learn from the mouth of Jesus Himself, what Andrew had reported. Our Lord begins now Himself to reveal the things of His Divinity, and to exhibit them gradually by prophecy. For prophecies are no less persuasive than miracles; inasmuch as they are preeminently God’s work, and are beyond the power of devils to imitate, while miracles may be fantasy or appearance: the foretelling future events with certainty is an attribute of the incorruptible nature alone: And when Jesus beheld him, He said, You are Simon the son of Jonas; you shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Intuitus autem est eum non exterioribus oculis solum, sed et aeterno divinitatis intuitu vidit cordis eius simplicitatem, animi sublimitatem, cuius merito cunctae esset praeferendus Ecclesiae. Neque autem in Petri vocabulo, quasi Hebraeo vel Syro, aliam interpretationem quaerere oportet: quia idem est Graece et Latine Petrus, quod Syriace Cephas; et in utraque lingua nomen a petra derivatur. Vocatur autem Petrus ob firmitatem fidei, qua illi petrae adhaesit de qua apostolus ait: petra autem erat Christus; qui sperantes in se ab hostis insidiis reddit tutos, et spiritualium charismatum fluenta ministrat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. He beheld him not with His natural eye only, but by the insight of His Godhead discerned from eternity the simplicity and greatness of his soul, for which he was to be elevated above the whole Church. In the word Peter, we must not look for any additional meaning, as though it were of Hebrew or Syriac derivation; for the Greek and Latin word Peter, has the same meaning as Cephas; being in both languages derived from petra. He is called Peter on account of the firmness of his faith, in cleaving to that Rock, of which the Apostle speaks, And that Rock was Christ; which secures those who trust in it from the snares of the enemy, and dispenses streams of spiritual gifts.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non est autem magnum quia dominus dixit cuius filius esset iste: omnia enim nomina sanctorum suorum sciebat, quos ante constitutionem mundi praedestinavit. Illud autem magnum quia mutavit ei nomen, et fecit de Simone Petrum. Petrus autem a petra; petra vero Ecclesia: ergo in Petri nomine figurata est Ecclesia. Et quis securus est, nisi qui aedificat supra petram? Intentum autem te fecit dominus: nam si antea Petrus vocaretur, non ita videres mysterium petrae, et putares casu eum sic vocari, non providentia Dei. Ideo eum voluit aliud prius vocari, ut ex ipsa commutatione nominis, sacramenti vivacitas commendaretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There was nothing very great in our Lord saying whose son he was, for our Lord knew the names of all His saints, having predestinated them before the foundation of the world. But it was a great thing for our Lord to change his name from Simon to Peter. Peter is from petra, rock, which rock is the Church: so that the name of Peter represents the Church. And who is safe, unless he build upon a rock? Our Lord here rouses our attention: for had he been called Peter before, we should not have seen the mystery of the Rock, and should have thought that he was called so by chance, and not providentially. God therefore made him to be called by another name before, that the change of that name might give vividness to the mystery.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ideo etiam nomen mutavit, ut ostendat quia ipse est qui vetus testamentum dedit et nomina transmutavit, qui Abram Abraham vocavit, et Sarai Saram, et Iacob Israelem. Igitur multis quidem et a nativitate nomina imposuit, ut Isaac et Samson; aliis autem post eam quae a progenitoribus est nuncupationem, ut Petro et filiis Zebedaei: nam quibus quidem a prima aetate debebat virtus clarescere, ex tunc nomina susceperunt; quibus autem postea debebat augeri, postea nuncupatio posita est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He changed the name too to show that He was the same who done so before in the Old Testament; who had called Abram Abraham, Sarai Sarah, Jacob Israel. Many He had named from their birth, as Isaac and Samson; others again after being named by their parents, as were Peter, and the sons of Zebedee. Those whose virtue was to be eminent from the first, have names given them from the first; those who were to be exalted afterwards, are named afterwards.

Non autem quis arbitretur quod tunc Petrus nomen accepit, ubi ait illi dominus: tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam; sed ubi commemoratur ei dictum esse tu vocaberis Cephas (quod interpretatur Petrus).
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The account A here of the two disciples on the Jordan, who follow Christ (before he had gone into Galilee) in obedience to John’s testimony; viz. of Andrew bringing his brother Simon to Jesus, who gave him, on this occasion, the name of Peter; disagrees considerably with the account of the other Evangelists, viz. that our Lord found these two, Simon and Andrew, fishing in Galilee, and then bid them follow Him: unless we understand that they did not regularly join our Lord when they saw Him on the Jordan; but only discovered who He was, and full of wonder, then returned to their occupations. Nor must we think that Peter first received his name on the occasion mentioned in Matthew, when our Lord says, You are Peter, and upon this rock will I build My Church; but rather when our Lord says, You shall be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel aliter. Nondum imponit ei nomen, sed praesignat quod postea fuit ei impositum, quando dixit ei Iesus: tu es Petrus, et super hanc petram aedificabo Ecclesiam meam. Mutaturus autem nomen Christus, voluit ostendere etiam nomen illud quod a parentibus datum erat, non carere virtutis significatione. Simon enim obediens interpretatur, Ioanna gratia, Iona columba; quasi dicat: tu es obediens, filius gratiae, vel filius columbae, idest spiritus sancti: quia humilitatem de spiritu sancto accepisti, ut vocante Andrea, videre me desiderares. Non enim dedignatus est maior minorem sequi: quia non est ordo aetatis ubi est meritum fidei.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or perhaps He does not actually give him the name now, but only fixes beforehand what He afterwards gave him when He said, You are Peter, and upon this rock will I build My Church. And while about to change his name, Christ wishes to show that even that which his parents had given him, was not without a meaning. For Simon signifies obedience, Joanna grace, Jona a dove: as if the meaning was; You are an obedient son of grace, or of the dove, i.e. the Holy Spirit; for you have received of the Holy Spirit the humility, to desire, at Andrew’s call, to see Me. The elder disdained not to follow the younger; for where there is meritorious faith, there is no order of seniority.

He was going too to call a disciple, and wished to go forth into Galilee, i.e. to a place of “transition” or “revelation,” that is to say, that as He Himself increased in wisdom or stature, and in favor with God and man, and as He suffered and rose again, and entered into His glory: so He would teach His followers to go forth, and increase in virtue, and pass through suffering to joy. He finds Philip, and said to him, Follow Me. Everyone follows Jesus who imitates His humility and suffering, in order to be partaker of His resurrection and ascension.

Philippum autem vocat, magis notum ei existentem, quia in Galilaea nutritus erat. Sed unde Philippus secutus est Christum? Nam Andreas quidem audiens a Ioanne Baptista, Petrus autem ab Andrea; hic autem a nullo aliquid discens, solum dicente Christo ad eum sequere me, confestim persuasus est. Conveniens est autem Philippum a Ioanne audientem sequi Christum, vel etiam vocem Christi hoc operatam esse.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe, He did not call them, before some had of their own accord joined Him: for had He invited them, before any had joined Him, perhaps they would have started back: but now having determined to follow of their own free choice, they remain firm ever after. He calls Philip, however, because he would be known to him, from living in Galilee. But what made Philip follow Christ? Andrew heard from John the Baptist, and Peter from Andrew; he had heard from no one, and yet on Christ saying, Follow Me, was persuaded instantly. It is not improbable that Philip may have heard John: and yet it may have been the mere voice of Christ which produced this effect.

Philip having been continually meditating on Christ, and reading the books of Moses, so confidently expected Him, that the instant he saw, he believed. Perhaps too he had heard of Him from Andrew and Peter, coming from the same district; an explanation which the Evangelist seems to hint at, when he adds, Now Philip was of Bethsaida, the city of Andrew and Peter.

See how zealous he is, and how constantly he is meditating on the books of Moses, and looking for Christ’s coming. That Christ was coming he had known before; but he did not know that this was the Christ, of whom Moses and the Prophets did write: He says this to give credibility to his preaching, and to show his zeal for the Law and the Prophets, and how that he had examined them attentively. Be not disturbed at his calling our Lord the Son of Joseph; this was what He was supposed to be.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He was bred up there: the place of His birth could not have been known generally, but all knew that He was bred up in Nazareth. And Nathanael said to him, Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth.

Veni et vide. Cum ergo sive illo modo, sive isto pronuntietur, non repugnent verba sequentia, nostrum est quaerere quid potius intelligamus in his verbis. Nathanael enim doctissimus legis, cum audisset Philippum dicentem invenimus Iesum, audito a Nazareth, erectus est in spem, et dixit a Nazareth potest aliquid boni esse. Scrutatus enim erat Scripturas, et sciebat, quod non facile alii Scribae et Pharisaei noverant, quia inde erat expectandus salvator.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. However you may understand these words, Philip’s answer wild suit. You may read it either as affirmatory, Something good can come out of Nazareth; to which the other says, Come and see: or you may read it as a question, implying doubt on Nathanael’s part, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Come and see. Since either way of reading agrees equally with what follows, we must inquire the meaning of the passage. Nathanael was well read in the Law, and therefore the word Nazareth (Philip having said that he had found Jesus of Nazareth) immediately raises his hopes, and he exclaims, Something good can come out of Nazareth. He had searched the Scriptures, and knew, what the Scribes and Pharisees could not, that the Savior was to be expected thence.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He who alone is absolutely holy, harmless, undefiled; of whom the prophet said, There shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and a branch (Nazaraus) shall grow out of his roots. Or the words may be taken as expressing doubt, and asking the question.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Audiverat enim Nathanael a Scripturis quod a Bethlehem oporteret Christum venire, secundum illud: et tu, Bethlehem terra Iuda, ex te exiet dux qui regat populum meum Israel. Cum igitur audivit a Nazareth, dubitavit, non inveniens convenire enuntiationem Philippi cum prophetica praedicatione. Nazaraeum autem vocant prophetae ab educatione et conversatione. Considera vero eius in inquirendo prudentiam et mansuetudinem: non enim dixit: decipis me, Philippe; sed interrogat dicens a Nazareth potest aliquid boni esse? Valde autem et Philippus prudens erat; non enim interrogatus frangitur, sed immoratur, virum volens ducere ad Christum; unde sequitur dicit ei Philippus: veni et vide. Trahit quidem eum ad Christum, sciens de reliquo eum non contradicturum, si verba et doctrinam illius gustaverit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nathanael knew from the Scriptures, that Christ was to come from Bethlehem, according to the prophecy of Micah, And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, - out of you shall come a Governor, that shall rule my people Israel. On hearing of Nazareth, then, he doubted, and was not able to reconcile Philip’s tidings with prophecy. For the Prophets call Him a Nazarene, only in reference to His education and mode of life. Observe, however, the discretion and gentleness with which he communicates his doubts. He does not say, You deceive me, Philip; but simply asks the question, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? Philip too in turn is equally discrete. He is not confounded by the question, but dwells upon it, and lingers in the hope of bringing him to Christ: Philip said to him, Come and see. He takes him to Christ, knowing that when he had once tasted of His words and doctrine, he will make no more resistance.

Sciebat enim quod poterat Philippus circa locum falli; unde sequitur vidit Iesus Nathanael venientem ad se, et dicit de eo: ecce vere Israelita, in quo dolus non est: quia nihil ad gratiam vel odium loquebatur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nathanael, in difficulty as to Christ coming out of Nazareth, showed the care with which he had read the Scriptures: his not rejecting the tidings when brought him, showed his strong desire for Christ’s coming. He thought that Philip might be mistaken as to the place. It follows, Jesus saw Nathanael coming to Him, and said of him, Behold an Israelite indeed, in whom is no guile! There was no fault to be found with him, though he had spoken like one who did not believe, because he was more deeply read in the Prophets than Philip. He calls him guileless, because he had said nothing to gain favor, or gratify malice.

Fatetur se peccatorem; si enim peccator est et iustum se dicit, dolus est in ore ipsius. Ergo in Nathanaele confessionem peccati laudavit, non indicavit non esse peccatorem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What means this, In whom is no guile? Had he no sin? Was no physician necessary for him? Far from it. No one was ever born, of a temper not to need the Physician. It is guile, when we say one thing, and think another. How then was there no guile in him? Because, if he was as a sinner, he confessed his sin; whereas if a man, being a sinner, pretends to be righteous, there is guile in his mouth. Our Lord then commended the confession of sin in Nathanael; He did not pronounce him not a sinner.

Vidi, inquit, te, idest morum tuorum mansuetudinem. Dicit autem cum esses sub ficu: quoniam nullus ibi erat, sed soli Philippus et Nathanael singulariter loquebantur: propter hoc dictum est quod videns eum a longe dixit ecce vere Israelita; ut scires quoniam antequam appropinquaret Philippus, haec loquebatur Christus, et insuspicabile fiat Christi testimonium. Noluit autem Christus dicere: non sum ex Nazareth, ut annuntiavit tibi Philippus; sed ex Bethlehem, ut non faceret altercabilem sermonem; neque etiam per hoc dedisset argumentum sufficiens quod ipse esset Christus; sed ostendit se Christum per hoc quod praesens erat loquentibus illis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He asks as man, Jesus answers as God: Jesus answered and said to him, Before that Philip called you, when you were under the fig tree, I saw you: not having, beheld him as man, but as God discerning him from above. I saw you, He says, that is, the character of the life, when you were under the fig tree: where the two, Philip and Nathanael, had been talking together alone, nobody, seeing them; and on this account it is said, that on seeing him a long way off, He said, Behold an Israelite indeed; whence it appears that this speech was before Philip came near, so that no suspicion could attach to Christ’s testimony. Christ would not say, I am not of Nazareth, as Philip told you, but of Bethlehem; in order to avoid an argument: and because it would not have been sufficient proof, had He mentioned it, of His being the Christ. He preferred rather proving this by His having been present at their conversation.

Erat autem Nathanael sub arbore fici, tamquam sub umbra mortis; ac si dominus ei dicat: o Israel, sine dolo quisquis es, o popule Iudaeus ex fide, antequam te per apostolos meos vocarem, et cum esses sub umbra mortis, et tu me non videres, ego te vidi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Has this fig tree any meaning? We read of one fig tree which was cursed, because it had only leaves, and no fruit. Again, at the creation, Adam and Eve, after sinning, made themselves aprons of fig leaves. Fig leaves then signify sins; and Nathanael, when he was under the fig tree, was under the shadow of death: so that our Lord seems to say, O Israel, whoever of you is without guile, O people of the Jewish faith, before that I called you by My Apostles, when you were as yet under the shadow of death, and saw Me not, I saw you.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nathanael remembered that he had been under the fig tree, where Christ was not present corporeally, but only by His spiritual knowledge. Hence, knowing that he had been alone, he recognized our Lord’s Divinity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sic ergo ab hac praedicatione, et ab eo quod mentem scrutatus est eius, et quia cum adversus eum dicere videretur, non culpavit, sed laudavit, cognovit quoniam vere est Christus; unde sequitur respondit ei Nathanael, et ait: Rabbi, tu es filius Dei, tu es rex Israel; quasi dicat: tu es qui expectabaris, tu es qui quaerebaris. Quia enim argumentum inaltercabile suscepit, venit ad confessionem, et in mora priori diligentiam ostendens, et in posteriori confessione devotionem. Multi autem legentium sermonem hunc anxiantur: Petrus enim qui post miracula et doctrinam confessus est, quoniam filius est Dei, beatificatur, ut a patre revelationem iam suscipiens; Nathanael autem ante signa et doctrinam hoc dicens, nihil tale audivit. Est igitur huius causa, quoniam verba quidem eadem locutus est Petrus et Nathanael, non autem eadem mente; sed Petrus quidem confessus est filium Dei ut Deum verum; hic autem ut hominem nudum; dicens enim ei tu es filius Dei, induxit tu es rex Israel; Dei autem filius non Israelis est rex solum, sed et orbis terrarum universi. Hoc etiam manifestum est ex his quae consequuntur. Nam Petro nihil postea addidit Christus: sed quasi perfecta eius existente fide, Ecclesiam se dixit in confessione illius fabricaturum esse. Nathanael autem, quasi multa parte et maiori confessionis deficiente, ad maiora educitur; nam sequitur et dixit ei: quia dixi tibi: vidi te sub ficu, credis: maius his videbis; quasi dicat: magnum tibi visum est hoc esse quod dixi, et propterea me regem Israelis confessus es: quid igitur dices cum maius videbis? Et quid sit istud maius, ostendit subdens et dicit eis: amen, amen dico vobis, videbitis caelum apertum, et Angelos Dei ascendentes et descendentes super filium hominis. Vide qualiter paulatim eum a terra abducit, et facit quod non ultra aestimet Christum esse hominem solum: cui enim Angeli ministrant, qualiter hic homo purus esset? Per hoc igitur suadet Angelorum se esse dominatorem: sicut enim in proprium regis filium descenderunt et ascenderunt in eum ministri regales; hoc quidem in tempore crucis, hoc vero in tempore resurrectionis et ascensionis; sed et ante hoc, quando accesserunt et ministrabant ei, et quando evangelizabant eius nativitatem. Futurum vero a praeterito probavit; qui enim in praeteritis virtutem eius agnoverat, et de futuris audiens facilius suscepit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That our Lord then had this knowledge, had penetrated into his mind, had not blamed but praised his hesitation, proved to Nathanael that He was the true Christ: Nathanael answered and said to Him, Rabbi, You are the Son of God, You are the King of Israel: as if he said, You are He who was expected, you are He who was sought for. Sure proof being obtained, he proceeds to make confession; herein showing his devotion, as his former hesitation had shown his diligence. ID. Many when they read this passage, are perplexed at finding that, whereas Peter was pronounced blessed for having, after our Lord’s miracles and teaching, confessed Him to be the Son of God, Nathanael, who makes the same confession before, has no such benediction. The reason is this. Peter and Nathanael both used the same words, l but not in the same meaning. Peter confessed our Lord to he the Son of God, in the sense of very God; the latter in the sense of mere man; for after saying, You are the Son of God, he adds, You are the King of Israel; whereas the Son of God was not the King of Israel only, but of the whole world. This is manifest from what follows. For in the case of Peter Christ added nothing, but, as if his faith were perfect, said, that he would build the Church upon his confession; whereas Nathanael, as if his confession were very deficient, is led up to higher things: Jesus answered and said to him, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? You shall see greater things than these. As if He said, What I have just said has appeared a great matter to you, and you have confessed Me to be King of Israel; what will you say when you see greater things than these? What that greater thing is He proceeds to show: And He said to him, Verily, verily, I say to you, Hereafter you shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. See how He raises him from earth for a while, and forces him to think that Christ is not a mere man: for how could He be a mere man, whom angels ministered to? It was, as, as it were, saying, that He was Lord of the Angels; for He must be the King’s own Son, on whom the servants of the King descended and ascended; descended at His crucifixion, ascended at His resurrection and ascension. Angels too before this came and ministered to Him, and angels brought the glad tidings of His birth. Our Lord made the present a proof of the future. After the powers He had already shown, Nathanael would readily believe that much more would follow.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Recolamus autem veterem historiam, quando Iacob in somniis vidit scalam a terra pertingentem usque in caelum, et dominus incumbebat super eam, et Angeli ascendebant et descendebant per eam. Denique ipse Iacob quia intellexit quid viderit, posuit lapidem et fudit oleum: dum unxit lapidem Iacob, numquid idolum fecit? Significavit, non adoravit. Agnoscitis chrisma, agnoscite et Christum. Ipse est lapis quem reprobaverunt aedificantes. Si ergo Iacob vidit scalam, qui est Israel appellatus, et Nathanael iste vere Israelita erat; convenienter somnium Iacob dominus dixit ei; quasi dicat: cuius nomine te appellavi, ipsius somnium in te apparuit: videbis enim caelum apertum, et Angelos Dei ascendentes et descendentes super filium hominis. Si autem ad illum descendunt, et ad illum ascendunt, et sursum est, et hic est: sursum in se, deorsum in suis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Let us recollect the Old Testament account. Jacob saw in a dream a ladder reaching from earth to heaven; the Lord resting upon it, and the angels ascending and descending upon it. Lastly, Jacob himself understanding what the vision meant, set up a stone, and poured oil upon it. When he anointed the stone, did he make an idol? No: he only set up a symbol, not an object of worship You see here the anointing; see the Anointed also. He is the stone which the builders refused. If Jacob, who was named Israel, saw the ladder, and Nathanael was an Israelite indeed, there was a fitness in our Lord telling him Jacob’s dream; as if he said, Whose name you are called by, his dream has appeared to you: for you shall see the heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man. If they descend upon Him, and ascend to Him, then He is both up above and here below at the same time; above in Himself, below in His members.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sunt autem Angeli Dei boni praedicatores praedicantes Christum; hoc est super filium hominis ascendunt et descendunt, sicut Paulus, qui ascenderat usque ad tertium caelum, descendit usque ad lac potum parvulis dandum. Dixit autem maius his videbis; quia plus est quod nos dominus vocatos iustificavit, quam quod vidit iacentes sub umbra mortis. Quid enim nobis proderat, si ibi mansissemus ubi nos vidit? Quaeritur autem quare Nathanael, cui tantum testimonium perhibuit filius Dei, inter duodecim apostolos non invenitur? Intelligere autem debemus, ipsum eruditum fuisse et peritum legis: propterea noluit illum dominus inter discipulos ponere, quia idiotas elegit, unde confunderet mundum. Volens enim superborum frangere cervices, non quaesivit per oratorem piscatorem; sed de piscatore lucratus est imperatorem. Magnus Cyprianus orator; sed prius Petrus piscator; per quem postea crederet non tantum orator, sed etiam imperator.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Good preachers, however, who preach Christ, are as angels of God; i.e. they ascend and descend upon the Son of man; as Paul, who ascended to the third heaven, and descended so far even as to give milk to babes. He said, We shall see greater things than these: because it is a greater thing that our Lord has justified us, whom He has called, than that He saw us lying under the shadow of death. For had we remained where He saw us, what profit would it have been? It is asked why Nathanael, to whom our Lord bears such testimony, is not found among the twelve Apostles. We may believe, however, that it was because he was so learned, and versed in the law, that our Lord had not put him among the disciples. He chose the foolish, to confound the world. Intending to break the neck of the proud, He sought not to gain the fisherman through the orator, but by the fisherman the emperor. The great Cyprian was an orator; but Peter was a fisherman before him; and through him not only the orator, but the emperor, believed.

Nunc autem quia bona est castitas coniugalis, melior continentia vidualis, optima perfectio virginalis, ad probandam omnium electionem graduum, discernendum tamen meritum singulorum, ex intemerato Mariae virginis utero nasci dignatus est; e prophetico viduae Annae ore mox natus benedicitur; a nuptiarum celebratoribus iam iuvenis invitatus, has praesentia suae virtutis honorat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. His condescension in coming to the marriage, and the miracle He wrought there, are, even considering them in the letter only, a strong confirmation of the a faith. Therein too are condemned the errors of Tatian, Marcion, and others who detract from the honor of marriage. For if the undefiled bed, and the marriage celebrated with due chastity, partook at all of sin, our Lord would never have come to one. Whereas now, conjugal chastity being good, the continence of widows better, the perfection of the virgin state best, to sanction all these degrees, but distinguish the merit of each, He deigned to be born of the pure womb of the Virgin; was blessed after birth by the prophetic voice of the widow Anna; and now invited in manhood to attend the celebration of a marriage, honors that also by the presence of His goodness.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid autem mirum, si in illam domum ad nuptias venit qui in hunc mundum ad nuptias venit? Habet enim hic sponsam, quam redemit sanguine suo, et cui pignus dedit spiritum sanctum, quam sibi coniunxerat in utero virginis. Verbum enim est sponsus, et sponsa caro humana; et utrumque unus filius Dei, et idem filius hominis. Ille uterus virginis Mariae thalamus eius est, unde processit tamquam sponsus de thalamo suo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What marvel, if He went to that house to a marriage, Who came into this world to a marriage. For here He has His spouse whom He redeemed with His own blood, to whom He gave the pledge of the Spirit, and whom He united to Himself in the womb of the Virgin. For the Word is the Bridegroom, and human flesh the bride, and both together are one Son of God and Son of man. That womb of the Virgin Mary is His chamber, from which he went forth as a bridegroom.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nec vacat a mysterio quod die tertia nuptiae factae referuntur. Primum quidem saeculi tempus ante legem, patriarcharum exemplo; secundum sub lege, prophetarum scriptis; tertium sub gratia, praeconiis Evangelistarum, quasi tertiae diei luce, mundo refulsit, in quo dominus in carne natus apparuit. Sed et hoc quod in Cana Galilaeae, idest in zelo transmigrationis, eaedem nuptiae factae perhibentur, typice denuntiat, eos maxime gratia Christi dignos existere qui zelo fervere piae devotionis, ac de vitiis ad virtutes, de terrenis ad aeterna norunt transmigrare. Discumbente autem ad nuptias domino, vinum defecit, ut vino meliore per ipsum facto manifestaretur gloria latentis in homine Dei; unde sequitur et deficiente vino, dicit mater Iesu ad eum: vinum non habent.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Nor is it without some mysterious allusion, that the marriage is related as taking place on the third day. The first age of the world, before the giving of the Law, was enlightened by the example of the Patriarchs; the second, under the Law, by the writings of the Prophets; the third, under grace, by the preaching of the Evangelists, as if by the light of the third day; for our Lord had now appeared in the flesh. The name of the place too where the marriage was held, Cana of Galilee, which means, desire of migrating, has a typical signification, viz. that those are most worthy of Christ, who burn with devotional desires, and have known the passage from vice to virtue, from earthly to eternal things. The wine was made to fail, to give our Lord the opportunity of making better; that so the glory of God in man might be brought out of its hiding place: And when they wanted wine, the mother of Jesus said to Him, They have no wine.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dignum autem est quaerere, unde venit in mentem matri magnum quid imaginari de filio: neque enim ante miraculum fecerat; sequitur enim hoc fecit initium signorum Iesus. Sed revelari incipiebat et a Ioanne, et ab his quae ad discipulos dixerat; sed ante haec omnia ipsa conceptio, et ea quae post nativitatem facta sunt maximam ei de puero imposuerunt aestimationem; unde Lucas dicit: Maria conservabat omnia verba haec, conferens in corde suo. Cuius igitur gratia non ante ad miraculum eum incitavit? Nam antea ut unus multorum ita conversabatur; unde non praesumebat ei mater tale quid dicere; quia vero audivit quod Ioannes ei testificatus est, et quod discipulos iam haberet, de reliquo confidenter rogat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But how came it into the mother’s mind to expect so great a thing from her Son? for he had done no miracle as yet: as we read afterwards This beginning of miracles did Jesus. His real nature, however, was beginning now to be revealed by John, and His own conversations with His disciples; besides that His conception, and the circumstances of His birth, had from the first given rise to high expectations in her mind: as Luke tells us, His mother kept all these sayings in her heart. Why then did she never ask Him to work a miracle before? Because the time had now come that He should be made known. Before He had lived so much like an ordinary person, that she had not had the confidence to ask Him. But now that she heard that John had borne witness to Him, and that He had disciples, she asks Him confidently.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. She represents here the Synagogue, which challenges Christ to perform a miracle. It was customary with the Jews to ask for miracles. Jesus said to her, Woman, what have I to do with you?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quidam derogantes Evangelio, et dicentes quod Iesus non fuit natus de Maria virgine, hinc argumentum sumere conantur erroris sui, ut dicant: quomodo erat mater eius cui dixit quid mihi et tibi, mulier? Sed quis hoc narravit, ut credamus quia hoc dominus dixit? Nempe Ioannes Evangelista. At ipse dixit et erat ibi mater Iesu. Quare hoc, nisi quia utrumque verum est? Sed numquid ideo venit ad nuptias, ut doceret matres contemni?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Some who derogate from the Gospel, and say that Jesus was not born of the Virgin Mary, try to draw an argument for their error from this place; for, how, say they, could she be His mother to whom He said, What have I to do with you? Now who is it who gives this account, and on whose authority do we believe it? The Evangelist John. But he himself says, The mother of Jesus was there. Why should He say it, unless both were true. But did He therefore come to the marriage to teach men to despise their mother?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed quod valde venerabatur matrem, audi Lucam enarrantem, qualiter subditus parentibus erat.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That He greatly venerated His mother, we know from St. Luke, who tells us that He was subject unto His parents. For where parents throw no obstacle in the way of God’s commands, it is our duty to be subject to them; but when they demand any thing at an unseasonable time, or cut us off from spiritual things, we should not be deceived into compliance.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed et propter aliam causam, ut non suspecta essent miracula quae fiebant (ab his enim qui indigebant, rogari oportuerat, non a matre), voluit ostendere quoniam omnia decenti tempore operatur, non simul omnia faciens: quia confusio quaedam esset; et ideo sequitur nondum venit hora mea; idest, nondum cognitus sum his qui adsunt. Sed neque sciunt quoniam defecit vinum: sine eos primum hoc sentire: qui enim necessitatem non praesentit, neque beneficii grandem suscipiet sensum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And for another reason, viz. to prevent any suspicion attaching to His miracles: for these it was proper should be asked for by those who wanted them, not by His mother. He wished to show them that He would perform all in their proper time, not all at once, to prevent confusion; for He said, Mine hour is not yet come; i.e. I am not yet known to the persons present; nay, they know not that the wine has failed; let them find out that first; he who perceives not his want beforehand, will not perceive when his want is supplied.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel ideo quia dominus noster, secundum quod Deus erat, matrem non habebat; secundum quod homo erat, habebat matrem. Miraculum autem quod facturus erat, secundum divinitatem facturus erat, non secundum infirmitatem humanam. Miraculum tamen exigebat mater; at ille tamquam non agnoscens viscera humana, operaturus facta divina, dixit quid mihi et tibi est, mulier? Tamquam dicat: quod in me facit miraculum, non tu genuisti, deitatem meam. Dicitur autem mulier secundum femineum sexum, non secundum corruptionem integritatis. Sed quia genuisti infirmitatem meam, tunc te cognoscam cum ipsa infirmitas pendebit in cruce; unde subdit nondum venit hora mea; quasi dicat: ibi te agnoscam cum pendere in cruce infirmitas coeperit, cuius et mater es. Commendavit enim matrem discipulo, prius matre moriturus, et ante mortem matris resurrecturus. Videte autem ne forte quomodo invenerunt Manichaei occasionem perfidiae suae, quia dixit dominus quid mihi et tibi est, mulier? Sic inveniant mathematici occasionem fallaciae, quia dixit nondum venit hora mea. Dicunt enim: vides quia sub fato erat Christus, quia dixit nondum venit hora mea. Credant autem Deo dicenti: potestatem habeo ponendi animam meam, et iterum sumendi eam; et quaerant quare sit dictum nondum venit hora mea: nec ideo iam sub fato ponant conditorem caeli: quia si esset fatum de sideribus, non poterat esse sub necessitate siderum conditor siderum. Adde quod non solum Christus non habuit quod appellas fatum; sed nec tu, aut ille, aut quisquam hominum. Quare ergo dixit nondum venit hora mea? Quia in potestate habebat quando moreretur; sed nondum videbat esse opportunum ut illa potestate uteretur. Vocandi erant discipuli, annuntiandum erat regnum caelorum, faciendae erant virtutes, commendanda erat divinitas domini in miraculis, commendanda erat humanitas domini in ipsa compassione mortalitatis. At ubi tantum fecit quantum sufficere iudicavit, venit hora, non necessitatis, sed voluntatis; non conditionis, sed potestatis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or it was because our Lord as God had not a mother, though as man He had, and the miracle He was about to work was the act of His Divinity, not of human infirmity. When therefore His mother demanded a miracle, He, as though not acknowledging a human birth, when about to perform a divine work, said, Woman, what have I to do with you? As if He said, You did not beget that in Me, which works the miracle, My Divinity. (She is called woman, with reference to the female sex, not to any injury of her virginity.) But because you brought forth My infirmity, I will acknowledge you then, when that very infirmity shall hang on the cross. And therefore He adds, Mine hour is not yet come: as if to say, I will acknowledge you when the infirmity, of which you are the mother, shall hang from the cross. He commended His mother to the disciple, when about to die, and to rise again, before her death. But note; just as the Manicheans have found an occasion of error and pretext for their faithlessness in our Lord’s word, What have I to do with you? in the same way the astrologers support theirs from the words, Mine hour is not yet come. For, say they, if Christ had not been under the power of fate, He would never have said this. But let them believe what hat God says below, I have power to lay it (my life) down, and I have power to take it again: and then let them ask, why He says, Mine hour is not yet come: nor let them on such a ground subject the Creator of heaven to fate; seeing that, even were there a fatality in the stars, the Maker of the stars could not be under the dominion of the stars. And not only had Christ nothing to do with fate, as you call it; but neither have you, or any other man. Wherefore said He then, Mine hour is not yet come? Because He had the power to die when He pleased, but did not think it expedient yet to exert the power He was to call the disciples; to proclaim the Kingdom of heaven, to do marvelous works, to approve His divinity by miracles, His humility by partaking of the sufferings of our mortal state. And when He had done all, then the hour was come, not of destiny, but of will, not of obligation, but of power.

Hoc quidem mirabilius est, sed non ita videtur credibile multis. Propterea enim multoties a miraculorum magnitudine abstinet, volens magis credibile esse quod fiebat.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why did He not world the miracle before they had filled the waterpots, which would have been much more wonderful; inasmuch as it is one thing to change the quality of some existing substance, another to make it that substance out of nothing? The latter miracle would be the more wonderful, but the former would be the more easy of belief. And this principle often acts as a check, to moderate the greatness of our Lord’s miracles: He wishes to make them more credible, therefore He makes them less marvelous; a refutation this of the perverse doctrine of some, that He was a different Being from the Maker of the world. For we see He performs most of His miracles upon subject-matter already existing, whereas were He contrary to the Creator of the world, He would not use a material thus alien, to demonstrate His own power. He did not draw out the water Himself which He made wine, but ordered the servants to do so. This was for the sake of having witnesses of the miracle; And He said to them, Draw out now, and bear unto the governor of the feast.

But this objection could not be brought against the attendants, who must have been sober, being occupied wholly in performing the duties of their service gracefully and in order. Our Lord therefore bid the attendants bear to the governor of the feast; who again would of course be perfectly sober. He did not say, Give to the guests to drink.

The pourer in thinks that water is drawn out; the drawer out thinks that wine was poured in. When the ruler of the feast had tasted the water that was made wine, and knew not whence it was, (but the servants who drew the water knew,) the governor of the feast called the bridegroom. It was not a mixture, but a creation: the simple nature of water vanished, and the flavor of wine was produced; not that a weak dilution was obtained, by means of some strong infusion, but that which was, was annihilated; and that which was not, came to be.

Non simpliciter autem Christus vinum, sed vinum optimum fecit; unde sequitur et dicit ei: omnis homo primum bonum vinum ponit, et cum inebriati fuerint, tunc id quod deterius est. Talia enim sunt Christi miracula, ut multo his quae per naturam fiunt, speciosiora et utiliora fiant. Igitur aqua vinum facta ministros testes habuit; boni vero vini factio architriclinum et sponsum. Probabile autem est et sponsum aliquid respondisse; sed Evangelista hoc praetermittit, tangens solum id quod necessarium est scire, scilicet quoniam vinum aquam fecit; unde statim subdit hoc fecit initium signorum Iesus in Cana Galilaeae. Tunc enim signa maxime necessarium erat facere, quando discipuli iam congregati erant devoti et attendentes his quae fiebant, manifeste aderant. Si vero dixerit quis non esse argumentum sufficiens ut hoc sit principium signorum, quia additur in Cana Galilaeae, quasi contingat alibi prius esse facta, dicemus, quod et antea diximus, quia Ioannes dicit: ut manifestetur Israeli, propterea veni baptizans. Si vero secundum primam aetatem miracula fecit, nequaquam indigebant Israelitae alio manifestante eum. Qui enim in brevi tempore ita per miraculorum multitudinem claruit, ut eius nomen manifestum fieret omnibus; multo magis si puer existens a prima aetate miracula fecisset: nam et ea quae fierent, inopinabiliora existimarentur ab infante facta, et tempus amplius esset. Decenter autem non incepit signa facere ex prima aetate: existimassent enim phantasiam esse incarnationem, et ante opportunum tempus cruci eum tradidissent livore liquefacti.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord wished the power of His miracles to be seen gradually; and therefore He did not reveal what He had done Himself, nor did the ruler of the feast call upon the servants to do so; (for no credit would have been given to such testimony concerning a mere man, as our Lord was supposed to be,) but He called the bridegroom, who was best able to see what was done. Christ moreover did not only make wine, but the best wine. And (the ruler of the feast) said to him, Every man at the beginning does set forth good wine, and when men have well drunk, then that which is worse; but you have kept the good wine until now. The effects of the miracles of Christ are more beautiful and better than the productions of nature. So then that the water was made wine, the servants could testify; that it was made good wine, the ruler of the feast and the bridegroom. It is probable that the bridegroom made some answer; but the Evangelist omits it, only mentioning what it was necessary for us to know, viz. the water being made wine. He adds, This beginning of of miracles did Jesus in Cana of Galilee. It was very necessary to work miracles just then, when His devoted disciples were all collected, and present at the place, attending to what was going on. ID. Should any say that there is not sufficient proof of this being the beginning of miracles, because it is added, in Cana of Galilee, as if some had been preferred elsewhere: we answer, as we did before, that John says below, That He might be made manifest to Israel, therefore have I come baptizing. Now if He had performed miracles in the earlier part of His life, the Jews would not have wanted another person to point Him out. If our Lord in a short time became so distinguished for the number of His miracles, that His Name was known to every one, would He not have been much more so, had He worked miracles from His earliest years? for the things themselves would have been the more extraordinary, being performed by a Child, and in so long a time must have become notorious. It was fit and proper however that He should not begin to work miracles at so early an age: for men would have thought the Incarnation a fantasy, and in the extremity of envy would have delivered Him to be crucified before the appointed time.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc autem miraculum domini quo de aqua vinum fecit, non est mirum eis qui noverunt quia Deus fecit. Ipse enim fecit vinum illo die in hydriis qui omni anno hoc facit in vitibus; sed hoc assiduitate amisit admirationem: itaque servavit sibi Deus inusitata quaedam quae faceret, ut tamquam dormientes homines ad se colendum mirabiliter excitaret; propter quod sequitur et manifestavit gloriam suam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This miracle of our Lord’s, turning the water into wine, is no miracle to those who know that God worked it. For the Same that day made wine in the waterpots, Who every year makes wine in the vine: only the latter is no longer wonderful, because it happens uniformly. And therefore it is that God keeps some extraordinary acts in store for certain occasions, to rouse men out of their lethargy, and make them worship Him. Thus it follows, He manifested forth His glory.

Novimus autem legem ex quibus temporibus narret, idest ab exordio mundi; inde usque ad hoc tempus quod nunc agimus, sexta aetas est: nam prima aetas computatur ab Adam usque ad Noe, secunda a Noe usque ad Abraham, tertia ab Abraham usque ad David, quarta a David usque ad transmigrationem Babylonis, quinta usque ad Ioannem Baptistam, sexta inde usque ad finem saeculi. Sex ergo illae hydriae sex aetates significant, quibus non defuit prophetia. Impletae sunt prophetiae, plenae sunt hydriae. Quid est autem quod capiebant metretas binas vel trinas? Si trinas tantum diceret, non curreret animus noster nisi ad mysterium Trinitatis. Sed forte nec sic debemus inde sensum avertere, quia dixit binas vel trinas: quia nominato patre et filio, consequenter et spiritus sanctus intelligendus est. Oportet enim intelligi caritatem invicem patris et filii, quod est spiritus sanctus. Sed est et alius intellectus non praetermittendus: binae enim metretae intelliguntur in duobus generibus hominum, idest Iudaeis et Graecis; tres autem propter Noe tres filios significandos.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now if He ordered the water to be poured out, and then introduced the wine from the hidden recesses of creation, He would seem to have rejected the Old Testament. But converting, as He did, the water into wine, He showed us that the Old Testament was from Himself; for it was as by His order that the waterpots were filled. But those Scriptures have no meaning, if Christ be not understood there. Now we know from what time the law dates, viz. from the foundation of the world. From that time to this are six ages; the first reckoning from Adam to Noah; the second, from Noah to Abraham; the third, from Abraham to David; the fourth, from David to the carrying away into Babylon; the fifth, from that time to John the Baptist; the sixth, from John the Baptist to the end of the world. The six waterpots then denote these six ages of prophecy. The prophecies are fulfilled; the waterpots are full. But what is the meaning of their holding two or three firkins apiece? Had He said three only, our minds would have run immediately to the mystery of the Trinity. Nor perhaps can we reject it, even though it is said, two or three: for the Father and the Son being named, the Holy Ghost may be understood by consequence; inasmuch as it is the love between the Father and the Son, which is the Holy Ghost. Nor should we pass over another interpretation, which makes the two firkins alluded to the two races of men, the Jews and the Greeks; and the three to the three sons of Noah.

Et bene in domo nuptiarum tres ordines discumbentium describuntur: quia Ecclesia tribus ordinibus fidelium constat: coniugatorum, continentium et doctorum.

The servants are the doctors of the New Testament, who interpret the holy Scripture to others spiritually; the ruler of the feast is some lawyer, as Nicodemus, Gamaliel, or Saul. When to the former then is committed the word of the Gospel, hid under the letter of the law, it is the water made wine, being set before the ruler of the feast. And the three rows of guests at table in the house of the marriage are properly mentioned; the Church consisting of three orders of believers, the married, the continent, and the doctors. Christ has kept the good wine until now, i.e. He has deferred the Gospel till this, the sixth age.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord being about shortly to go up to Jerusalem, proceeded to Capernaum, that He might not take His mother and brethren every where about with Him: After this he went down to Capernaum, He, and His mother, and His brethren, and His disciples, and they continued there not many days.

Fratres enim Scriptura nostra appellare consuevit non eos solos qui nascuntur ex eodem utero aut ex eodem patre; sed ex eodem gradu, velut compatrueles aut consobrinos. Unde ergo fratres domino? Num enim Maria iterum peperit? Absit: inde coepit dignitas virginum. Abraham patruus erat Lot, et Iacob Laban Syrum habebat avunculum; et utrique dicti sunt fratres.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Lord our God is He, high, that He might create us; low, that He might create us anew; walking among men, suffering what was human, hiding what was divine. So He has a mother, has brethren, has disciple: whence He has a mother, thence has He brethren. Scripture frequently gives the name of brethren, not to those only who are born of the same womb, or the same father, but to those of the same generation, cousins by the father’s or mother’s side. Those who are unacquainted with this were of speaking, ask, Whence has our Lord brothers? Did Mary bring forth again? That could not be: with her commenced the dignity of the virgin state. Abraham was uncle of Lot, and Jacob was nephew to Laban the Syrian. Yet Abraham and Lot are called brethren; and likewise Jacob and Laban.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod vero dicit et discipuli eius, incertum est utrum iam illi adhaeserant etiam Petrus, et Andreas, et filii Zebedaei. Matthaeus enim primo narrat quod venerit et habitaverit in Capharnaum, et postea quod eos de navibus piscantes vocaverit. An forte Matthaeus quod praetermiserat recapitulavit? Quia sine ulla consequentis temporis differentia dixit: ambulans iuxta mare Galilaeae, vidit duos fratres, an potius alii discipuli fuerunt? Scriptura enim evangelica et apostolica non solum illos duodenos appellat discipulos eius, sed omnes qui in Deum credentes ad regnum caelorum magisterio eius erudiebantur. Illud etiam requirendum est, quomodo hic dicit, antequam Ioannes Baptista missus esset in carcerem, Iesum venisse in Galilaeam: cum Matthaeus dicat: cum autem audisset quod Ioannes traditus esset, secessit in Galilaeam: similiter etiam et Marcus. Lucas etiam nihil quidem dicit de tradito Ioanne: sed post Baptismum et tentationem Christi dicit eum iisse in Galilaeam, sicut illi duo. Unde intelligitur tres Evangelistas non Ioanni Evangelistae contraria narrasse, sed praetermisisse primum domini adventum in Galilaeam posteaquam baptizatus est, quando illic aquam convertit in vinum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And His disciples; it is uncertain whether Peter and Andrew and the sons of Zebedee, were of their number or not at this time. For Matthew first relates that out Lord came and dwelt at Capernaum, and afterwards that He called those disciples from their boats, as they were fishing. Is Matthew perhaps supplying what he had omitted? For without any mention that it was at a subsequent time, he says, Jesus walking by sea of Galilee saw two brethren. Or is it better to suppose that these were other disciples? For the writings of the Evangelists and Apostles, call not the twelve only, but all who believing in God were prepared for the kingdom of heaven by our Lord’s teaching, disciples. How is it too that our Lord’s journey to Galilee is placed here before John the Baptist’s imprisonment, when Matthew says, Now when Jesus had heard that John was as cast into prison, he departed into Galilee: and Mark the same? Luke too, though he says nothing of John’s imprisonment, yet places Christ’s visit to Galilee after His temptation and baptism, as the two former do. We should understand then that the three Evangelists are not opposed to John, but pass over our Lord’s first coming into Galilee after his baptism; at which time it was that He converted the water into wine.

Et ideo rogatus dicitur Ioannes apostolus ut ea quae praeterierant priores ante traditionem Ioannis, salvatoris gesta conscriberet. Unde si quis diligenter consideret, inveniet Evangelia non dissonare; sed alterius temporis gesta esse quae scribit Ioannes, alterius vero quae ceteri.
          <td><b>EUSEBIUS</b>. When copies of the three Gospels had come to the Evangelist John, he is reported, while he confirmed their fidelity and correctness, to have at the same time noticed some omissions, especially at the opening of our Lord’s ministry. Certain it is that the first three Gospels seem only to contain the events of the year in which John the Baptist was imprisoned, and put to death. And therefore John, it is said, was asked to write down those acts of our Savior’s before the apprehension of the Baptist, which the former Evangelists had passed over. Any one then, by attending, will find that the Gospels do not disagree, but that John is relating the events of a different date, from that which the others refer to.

The Gospels mention two journeys of our Lord to Jerusalem, one in the first year of His preaching, before John was sent to prison, which is the journey now spoken of; the other in the year of His Passion. Our Lord has set us here an example of careful obedience to the Divine commands. For if the Son of God fulfilled the injunctions of His own law, by keeping the festivals, like the rest, with what holy zeal should we servants prepare for and celebrate them?

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; In a mystical sense, it was meet that after the marriage in Cana of Galilee, and the banquet and wine, our Lord should take His mother, brethren, and disciples to the land of consolation (as Capernaum signifies) to console, by the fruits that were to spring up and by abundance of fields, those who received His discipline, and the mind which had conceived Him by the Holy Ghost; and who were there to be holpen. For some there are bearing fruit, to whom our Lord Himself comes down with the ministers of His word and disciples, helping such, His mother being present. Those however who are called to Capernaum, do not seem capable of His presence long: that is, a land which admits lower consolation, is not able to take in the enlightenment from many doctrines; being capable to receive few only.

But His disciples seem to have been present afterwards. The zeal of Your house has eaten me up. But it is as though in every one of the disciples who went up, it was Jesus who went up.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Those however, who came from a distance, being unable to bring with them the animals required for sacrifice, brought the money instead. For their convenience the Scribes and Pharisees ordered animals to be sold in the temple, in order that, when the people had bought and offered them afterwards, they might sell them again, and thus make great profits. And changers of money sitting; changers of money sat at the table to supply change to buyers and sellers. But our Lord disapproving of any worldly business in His house, especially one of so questionable a kind, drove out all engaged in it.

Unum tamen refugium ad horum responsionem relinquitur divina potestas Iesu, ut cum volebat posset iracundiam hostium suffocare, quamvis essent innumeri, et sedare mentium turbines: dominus enim dissipat cogitationes gentium. Praesens autem historia in nullo minorem potestatem praetendit his quae ab eo miraculosius edita sunt: quinimmo constat hanc maiorem demonstrare potentiam miraculo quo aqua conversa est in vinum: eo quod illic inanimata subsistit materia, hic vero tot millium hominum domantur ingenia.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; Should it appear something out of the order of things, that the Son of God should make a scourge of small cords, to drive them out of the temple? We have one answer in which some take refuge, viz. the divine power of Jesus, Who, when He pleased, could extinguish the wrath of His enemies however innumerable, and quiet the tumult of their minds: The Lord brings the counsel of the heathen to nought. This act indeed exhibits no less power, than His more positive miracles; nay rather, more than the miracle by which water was converted into wine: in that there the subject-matter was inanimate, here, the minds of so many thousands of men are overcome.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; John says here that He drove out the sellers from the temple; Matthew, the sellers and buyers. The number of buyers was much greater than of the sellers: and therefore to drive them out was beyond the power of the carpenter’s Son, as He was supposed to be, had He not by His divine power put all things under Him, as it is said.

Et Matthaeus quidem dicit quod eiciens eos dicebat: nolite facere domum meam speluncam latronum: illud enim fecit ad passionem veniens, ideo durioribus sermonibus utebatur; hoc autem in principio signorum fecit; unde non ita aspera, sed remissa quodammodo increpatione utitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Lo, He speaks of God as His Father, and they are not angry, for they think He means it in a common sense. But afterwards when He spoke more openly, and showed that He meant equality, they were enraged. In Matthew’s account too, on driving them out, He says, You have made it (My Father’s house) a den of thieves. This was just: before His Passion, and therefore He uses severer language. But the former being at the beginning of His miracles, His answer is milder and more indulgent.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ecce templum illud figura adhuc erat, et eiecit inde dominus omnes qui ad nundinas venerant. Et quae ibi vendebant? Quae opus habebant homines in sacrificio illius temporis. Quid si ibi ebriosos inveniret? Si negotiationis non debet fieri domus Dei, potationis fieri debet?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So that temple was still a figure only, and our Lord cast out of it all who came to it as a market. And what did they sell? Things that were necessary for the sacrifice of that time. What if He had found men drunken? If the house of God ought not to be a house of merchandise, ought it to be a house of drunkenness?

Et propter hoc etiam subditur recordati vero sunt discipuli eius quia scriptum est: zelus domus tuae comedit me.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why did Christ use such violence? He was about to heal on the Sabbath day, and to do many things which appeared to them transgressions of the Law. That He might not appear therefore to be acting contrary to God, He did this at His own peril; and thus gave them to understand, that He who exposed Himself to such peril to defend the decency of the house, did not despise the Lord of that house. For the same reason, to show His agreement with God, He said not, the Holy house, but, My Father’s house. It follows, And His disciples remembered what was written; The zeal of your house has eaten me up.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Comeditur ergo zelus domus Dei, qui omnia quae videt ibi perversa cupit emendare: et si emendare non potest, tolerat et gemit.

In your house you busy yourself to prevent matters going wrong; in the house of God, where salvation is offered, ought you to be indifferent? Have you a friend? admonish him gently; a wife? coerce her severely; a maid-servant? even compel her with stripes. Do what you are able, according to your station.

Invenit igitur in templo, idest in sacris, vel in enuntiatione ecclesiastici sermonis, quosdam qui patris domum, domum negotiationis constituebant, qui scilicet venales exponunt boves, quos oportet servare ad aratrum, ne retrocedentes non disponantur ad regnum Dei; qui etiam praeferunt mammonam iniquitatis ovibus, ex quibus habent ornatus materiam; qui etiam solertiam columbarum privata qualibet amaritudine vilipendunt. Cum ergo hos invenerit salvator in domo sacrata, facto de funiculis flagello fugat illos una cum venalibus ovibus et bobus suis, et spargit aeris pondera velut indigna in domo Dei retineri, subvertitque constitutas tabulas in animabus avarorum, et mandat ne ulterius in domo Dei columbae vendantur. Arbitror autem et exemplum ipsum statuisse per praedicta secretius, ut intelligamus per hoc, si quid agi debeat erga sacram illam oblationem a sacerdotibus, non debere ritu sensibilium oblationum agi, nec legem observari debere, ut carnales Iudaei volebant: nam Iesu propellente boves et oves, iubente auferri columbas, quae ut plurimum offerebantur iuxta consuetudinem Iudaeorum, et subvertente mensas materialium nummorum non expresse, sed figuraliter continentium divinas impressiones, ea scilicet quae secundum legis Scripturam videbantur honesta, et utente eo in plebem flagellis, dissolvenda et dispergenda haec erant, translato regno ad eos qui ex gentibus crediderunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; It is possible even for the dweller in Jerusalem to incur guilt, and even the most richly endowed may stray. And unless these repent speedily, they lose the capacity wherewith they were endued. He finds them in the temple, i.e. in sacred places, or in the office of enunciating the Church’s truths, some who make His Father’s house an house of merchandise; i.e. who expose to sale the oxen whom they ought to reserve for the plough, lest by turning back they should become unfit for the kingdom of God: also who prefer the unrighteous mammon to the sheep, from which they have the material of ornament; also who for miserable gain abandon the watchful care of them who are called metaphorically doves, without all gall or bitterness. Our Savior finding these in the holy house, makes a scourge of small cords, and drives them out, together with the sheep and oxen exposed for sale, scatters the heaps of money, as unbeseeming in the house of God, and overthrows the tables set up in the minds of the covetous, forbidding them to sell doves in the house of God any longer. I think too that He meant the above, as a mystical intimation that whatsoever was to be performed with regard to that sacred oblation by the priests, was not to be performed after the manner of material oblations, and that the law was not to be observed as the carnal Jews wished. For our Lord, by driving away the sheep and oxen, and ordering away the doves, which were the most common offerings among the Jews, and by overthrowing the tables of material coins, which in a figure only, not in truth, bore the Divine stamp, (i.e. what according to the letter of the law seemed good,) and when with His own hand He scourged the people, He as much as declared that the dispensation was to be broken up and destroyed, and the kingdom translated to the believing from among the Gentiles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel vendentes in Ecclesia sunt qui quae sua sunt quaerunt, non quae Iesu Christi. Venale habent totum, quia volunt redimi. Simon ideo volebat emere spiritum sanctum, quia vendere volebat: erat enim de illis qui columbas vendunt: etenim in columba apparuit spiritus sanctus: columba autem non est venalis; gratis datur, quia gratis vocatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, those who sell in the Church, are those who seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ. They who will not be bought, think they may sell earthly things. Thus Simon wished to buy the Spirit, that he might sell Him: for he was one of those who sell doves. (The Holy Spirit appeared in the form of a dove.) The dove however is not sold, but is given of free grace; for it is called grace.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vendunt igitur columbas qui acceptam spiritus sancti gratiam non gratis, ut praeceptum est, sed ad praemium dant; qui manuum impositionem, qua spiritus sanctus accipitur, etsi non in quaestum pecuniae, ad vulgi tamen favorem tribuunt; qui sacros ordines non ad vitae meritum, sed ad gratiam largiuntur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; They then are the sellers of doves, who, after receiving the free grace of the Holy Spirit, do not dispense it freely, as they are commanded, but at a price: who confer the laying on of hands, by which the Holy Spirit is received, if not for money, at least for the sake of getting favor with the people, who bestow Holy Orders not according to merit, but favor.

Those who by these very Scriptures deceive the people, from whom they seek honor, sell the oxen; and they sell the sheep too, i.e. the people themselves; and to whom do they sell them, but to the devil? For that which is cut off from the one Church, who takes away, except the roaring lion, who goes about every where, and seeks whom he may devour?

          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Or, the sheep are works of purity and piety, and they sell the sheep, who do works of piety to gain the praise of men. They exchange money in the temple, who, in the Church, openly devote themselves to secular business. And besides those who seek for money, or praise, or honor from Holy Orders, those too make the Lord’s house a house of merchandise, who do not employ the rank, or spiritual grace, which they have received in the Church at the Lord’s hands, with singleness of mind, but with an eye to human recompense.

Quando ergo aliquid patiuntur homines propter iniquitates suas, agnoscant quia dominus facit flagellum de resticulis, et adhuc admonet eos ut mutent se: nam si se non mutaverint, audient in fine: ligate illi manus et pedes.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord intended a meaning to be seen in His making a scourge of small cords, and then scourging those who were carrying on the merchandise in the temple. Every one by his sins twists for himself a cord, in that he goes on adding sin to sin. So then when men suffer for their iniquities, let them be sure that it is the Lord making a scourge of small cords, and admonishing them to change their lives: which if they fail to do, they will hear at the last, Bind him hand and foot.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Facto igitur de funiculis flagello, illos eiecit de templo: quia de parte sortis sanctorum eiciuntur qui inter sanctos positi, vel ficte bona, vel aperte faciunt opera mala. Oves quoque et boves eiecit: quia talium vitam pariter et doctrinam ostendit esse reprobam. Nummulariorum quoque effudit aes, et mensas subvertit; quia damnatis in fine reprobis, etiam ipsarum quas dilexerunt rerum tollet figuram. Venditionem columbarum de templo auferri praecepit: quia gratia spiritus, quae gratis accipitur, gratis dari debet.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; With a scourge then made of small cords, He cast them out of the temple; for from the part and lot of the saints are cast out all, who, thrown externally among the Saints, do good works hypocritically, or bad openly. The sheep and the oxen too He cast out, to show that the life and the doctrine of such were alike reprobate. And He overthrew the change heaps of the money-changers and their tables, as a sign that, at the final condemnation of the wicked, He will take away the form even of those things which they loved. The sale of doves He ordered to be removed out of the temple, because the grace of the Spirit, being freely received, should be freely given.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>; By the temple we may understand too the soul wherein the Word of God dwells; in which, before the teaching of Christ, earthly and bestial affections had prevailed. The ox being the tiller of the soil, is the symbol of earthly affections: the sheep, being the most irrational of all animals, of dull ones; the dove is the type of light and volatile thoughts; and money, of earthly good things; which money Christ cast out by the Word of His doctrine, that His Father’s house might be no longer a market.

For this dilemma, they thought, would oblige Him either to work miracles, or give up His present course. But He refuses to give them the sign, as He did on a like occasion, when He answers, An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign, and there shall no sign be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet; only the answer is more open there than here. He however who even anticipated men’s wishes, and gave signs when He was not asked, would not have rejected here a positive request, had He not seen a crafty design in it.

Quamvis autem dissolvi lapidum videatur structura ac dissipari omnia ossa Christi adversitatibus tribulationum; instaurabitur tamen templum, ac resuscitabitur die tertia, quae in novo caelo et nova terra praesens erit. Sicut enim illud Christi corpus sensibile crucifixum est ac sepultum, et postea resurrexit; sic et totale sanctorum Christi corpus concrucifixum est Christo: quilibet enim eorum in nullo alio gloriatur nisi in cruce Christi, per quam ipse crucifixus est mundo. Sed et consepultus est Christo et resurrexit cum eo, quia in quadam novitate vitae ambulat.

Both those, i.e. both the Body of Jesus and the temple, seem to me to be a type of the Church, which with lively stones is built up into a spiritual house, into an holy priesthood; according to St. Paul, You are the body of Christ, and members in particular. And though the structure of stones seem to be broken up, and all the bones of Christ scattered by adversities and tribulations, yet shall the temple be restored, and raised up again in three days, and established in the new heaven and the new earth. For as that sensible body of Christ was crucified and buried, and afterward rose again; so the whole body of Christ’s saints was crucified with Christ, (each glorying in that cross, by which He Himself too was crucified to the world,) and, after being buried with Christ, has also risen with Him, walking in newness of life. Yet have we not risen yet in the power of the blessed resurrection, which is still going on, and is yet to be completed. Whence it is not said, On the third day I will build it up, but, in three days; for the erection is being in process throughout the whole of the three days.

David from that time was busy in collecting materials.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or it may be that this number fits in with the perfection of the Lord’s Body. For six times forty-six are two hundred and seventy-six days, which make up nine months and six days, the time that our Lord’s Body was forming in the womb; as we know by authoritative traditions handed down from our fathers, and preserved by the Church. He was, according to general belief, conceived on the eighth of the Kalends of April, the one which He suffered, and born on the eighth of the Kalends of January. The intervening time contains two hundred and seventy-six days, i.e. six multiplied by forty.

Sex autem et novem et duodecim et decem et octo in unum coacti, fiunt quadraginta quinque: addito ergo uno fiunt quadraginta sex; qui si fuerint multiplicati per ipsum senarium numerum, qui huius ordinationis caput tenet, fiunt ducenti septuaginta sex, idest novem menses, et sex dies. Non ergo absurde quadraginta sex annis dicitur fabricatum esse templum, quod corpus eius significabat; ut quot anni fuerint in fabricatione templi, tot dies fuerint in corporis dominici perfectione.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The process of human conception is said to be this. The first six days produce a substance like milk, which in the following nine is converted into blood; in twelve more is consolidated, in eighteen more is formed into a perfect set of limbs, the growth and enlargement of which fills up the rest of the time till the birth. For six, and nine, and twelve, and eighteen, added together are forty-five, and with the addition of one (which stands for the summing up, all these numbers being collected into one) forty-six. This multiplied by the number six, which stands at the head of this calculation, makes two hundred and seventy-six, i.e. nine months a and six days. It is no unmeaning information then that the temple was forty and six years building; for the temple prefigured His Body, and as many years as the temple was in building, so many days was the Lord’s Body in forming.

Si autem facias quatuor nomina Graeca, anatoli, quod est oriens, dysis, quod est occidens, Arctos, quod est Septemtrio, mesembria, quod est meridies, capita verborum Adam habent. A quatuor enim ventis dominus collecturum se dicit electos suos cum venerit ad iudicium. Habent autem litterae nominis Adam numerum secundum Graecos; et ibi invenitur quadragintasex annis aedificatum templum. Habet enim Adam alpha, quod est unum; et delta, quod quatuor; et alpha, quod est unum; et mi, quod est quadraginta: et sic habet quadragintasex. Sed Iudaei, quia caro erant, carnalia sapiebant; ille spiritualiter loquebatur, et de quo templo diceret, per Evangelistam nobis aperuit; sequitur enim ille autem dicebat de templo corporis sui.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus, if you take the four Greek words, anatole, the east; dysis, the west; arctos, the north; and mesembria, the south; the first letters of these words make Adam. And our Lord says that He will gather together His saints from the four winds, when He comes to judgment. Now these letters of the word Adam, make up, according to Greek figuring, the number of the years during which the temple was building. For in Adam we have alpha, one; delta, four; alpha again, one; and forty; making up together forty-six. The temple then signifies the body derived from Adam; which body our Lord did not take in its sinful state, but renewed it, in that after the Jews had destroyed it, He raised it again the third day. The Jews however, being carnal, understood carnally; He spoke spiritually. He tells us, by the Evangelist, what temple He means; But He spoke of the temple of His Body.

In this way you will prove the flesh of Christ to be wood and stone, because the temple is composed of these materials. Now if you refuse to allow what is said, Now is My soul troubled; and, I have power to lay it (My life) down, to be said of the rational soul, still how will you interpret, Into Your hands, O Lord, I commend My spirit? you cannot understand this of an irrational soul: or again, the passage, You shall not leave My soul in hell.

And thus it follows, When therefore He had risen from the dead, His disciples remembered that He had said this to them: and they believed the Scripture, and the word which Jesus had said.

And then they believed the prediction of the Prophets that Christ would rise the third day, and the word which Jesus had spoken to them: Destroy this temple, &amp;c.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Unde autem iste crediderat, patet per id quod subdit nemo enim potest haec signa facere quae tu facis, nisi fuerit Deus cum eo. Sic ergo Nicodemus de illis multis erat qui crediderant in nomine eius, videntes signa quae faciebat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What the ground of his belief was, is plain from what immediately follows: For no one can do these miracles that You do, except God be with him. Nicodemus then was one of the many who believed in His Name, when they saw the signs that He did.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed tamen neque a signis aliquid magnum existimabat de eo; sed adhuc humanam habens de eo mentem, ut de propheta loquitur, ad operationem eum missum dicens, et alieno auxilio indigentem haec agere quae agebat; cum tamen pater perfectum eum genuerit, et sufficientem sibi ipsi, et nihil habentem imperfectum. Quia vero Christi studium erat interim non ita dignitatem suam revelare, sicut persuadere quod nihil ex adverso agebat patri: propterea in verbis multoties humiliter loquens videtur, in rebus autem cum potestate omnia operatur. Ideoque et Nicodemo nunc manifeste quidem nihil excelsum loquitur de se ipso; occulte autem ab humili eum opinione reducit, docens quod sufficiens sibi ipse est in miraculorum operatione; unde subditur respondit Iesus, et dixit ei: amen, amen dico tibi: nisi quis renatus fuerit denuo, non potest videre regnum Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did not however conceive any great idea of them from His miracles; and attributed to Him as yet only a human character, speaking of Him as a Prophet, sent to execute a commission, and standing in need of assistance to do His work; whereas the Father had begotten Him perfect, self-sufficient, and free from all defect. It being Christ’s design however for the present not so much to reveal His dignity, as to prove that He did nothing contrary to the Father; in words He is often humble, while His acts ever testify His power. And therefore to Nicodemus on this occasion He says nothing expressly to magnify Himself; but He imperceptibly corrects his low views of Him, and teaches him that He was Himself all-sufficient, and independent in His miraculous works. Hence He answers, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a man be born again, the cannot see the kingdom of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Isti sunt ergo quibus se credit Iesus qui nati fuerint denuo, qui non in nocte veniunt ad Iesum, sicut Nicodemus; tales enim iam etiam profitentur. Dicit ergo nisi quis renatus fuerit denuo, non potest videre regnum Dei; quasi dicat: quia nondum es natus denuo, idest ex Deo, spirituali generatione, notitia quam habes de me, spiritualis non est, sed animalis et humana. Ego autem dico tibi, quod sive tu, sive alius quicumque, nisi ex Deo denuo natus fuerit, non poterit apprehendere gloriam quae circa me est; sed extra regnum erit; nam generatio quae per Baptismum fit, illuminationem animae tribuit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Those then are the persons to whom Jesus commits Himself, those born again, who come not in the night to Jesus, as Nicodemus did. Such persons immediately make profession.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel littera talis est: amen, amen dico tibi: nisi quis renatus fuerit, etc.; hoc est, si tu non natus fueris desuper, et dogmatum susceperis certitudinem alicubi, extra erras, et longe es a regno caelorum; seipsum hic ostendens, et indicans quoniam non est hoc tantum quod videtur: sed aliis oculis opus est ad videndum eum. Hoc autem quod dicit desuper, hi quidem, idest de caelo, exponunt; alii vero, a principio. Igitur Iudaei quidem si hoc audissent, deridentes utique discessissent; hic vero et in hoc amorem discipuli ostendit quod a Christo ulterius interrogat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He says therefore, Except a man be born again, be cannot see the kingdom of God: as if He said, You are not yet born again, i.e. of God, by a spiritual begetting; and therefore your knowledge of Me is not spiritual, but carnal and human. But I say to you, that neither you, nor any one, except he be born again of God, shall be able to see the glory which is around me, but shall be out of the kingdom: for it is the begetting by baptism, which enlightens the mind. Or the meaning is, Except you are born from above, and have received the certainty of my doctrines, you wander out of the way, and are far from the kingdom of heaven. By which words our Lord discloses His nature, showing that He is more than what He appears to the outward eye. The expression, From above, means, according to some, from heaven, according to others, from the beginning. Had the Jews heard it, they would have left Him in scorn; but Nicodemus shows the love of a disciple, by staying to ask more questions.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Veniens Nicodemus ad Iesum ut ad hominem, audiens maiora quam ab homine, erigitur ad altitudinem eorum quae dicuntur, non quidem excidens a fide; sed infert hanc impossibilitatem, ut in apertiorem provocet doctrinam. Duo autem erant quae admirabatur: scilicet nativitas talis et regnum: neque enim audita erant apud Iudaeos. Sed interim circa prius instat, et quod maxime eius mentem concutiebat; unde dicitur dicit ad eum Nicodemus: quomodo potest homo nasci, cum sit senex? Numquid potest in ventrem matris suae iterato introire, et renasci?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nicodemus coming to Jesus, as to a man, is startled on learning greater things than man could utter, things too lofty for him. His mind is darkened, and he does not stand firm, but reels like one on the point of falling away from the faith. Therefore he objects to the doctrine as being impossible, in order to call forth a fuller explanation. Two things there are which astonish him, such a birth, and such a kingdom; neither yet heard of among the Jews. First he urges the former difficulty, as being the greatest marvel. Nicodemus, said to him, How can a man be born when be is old? can he enter a second time into his mother’s womb, and be born?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sic verba ista sonare videntur, quasi puer queat iterato in ventrem matris introire et renasci. Sed sciendum, quod ipse senex erat; ideoque de se protulit exemplum; ac si diceret: ego sum senex et meam quaero salutem: quomodo possum in ventrem matris introire et renasci?
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The question put thus sounds as if a boy might enter a second time into his mother’s womb and be born. But Nicodemus, we must remember, was an old man, and took his instance from himself; as if he said, I am an old man, and seek my salvation; how can I enter again into my mother’s womb, and be born?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Rabbi eum vocas, et a Deo venisse dicis; et non suscipis quae dicuntur, sed loqueris ad magistrum dictionem quae multam perturbationem inducit; hoc enim, scilicet quomodo quaerere, eorum est qui non valide credunt, et multi sic quaerentes, a fide deciderunt; hi quidem dicentes: quomodo Deus est incarnatus? Alii: quomodo mansit impassibilis? Propterea et hic propter anxietatem modum exquirit. Sed cum aliquis cogitationibus propriis spiritualia evertit, derisibilia loquitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. You call Him Rabbi, and say that He comes from God, and yet receive not His sayings, but use to your master a word which brings in endless confusion; for that how, is the inquiry of a man who has no strong belief; and many who have so inquired, have fallen from the faith; some asking, how God became incarnate? others, how He was born? Nicodemus here asks from anxiety. But observe when a man trusts spiritual things to reasonings of his own, how ridiculously he talks.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Spiritus enim loquitur, et ille carnem sapit: non noverat iste nisi unam nativitatem, scilicet ex Adam et Eva; et ex Deo et Ecclesia nondum noverat. Sic tamen tu intellige nativitatem spiritus quomodo intellexit Nicodemus nativitatem carnis: quomodo enim uterus non potest repeti, sic nec Baptismus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is the Spirit that speaks, whereas he understands carnally; he knew of no birth save one, that from Adam and Eve; from God and the Church he knows of none. But do you so understand the birth of the Spirit, as Nicodemus did the birth of the flesh; for as the entrance into the womb cannot be repeated, so neither can baptism.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Nicodemo autem decidenti ad eam quae hic est nativitatem, Christus manifestius revelat spiritualis nativitatis modum; unde sequitur respondit Iesus: amen, amen dico tibi: nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu sancto, non potest introire in regnum Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. While Nicodemus stumbles, dwelling upon our birth here, Christ reveals more clearly the manner of our spiritual birth; Jesus answered, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a man be born of water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ac si dicat: tu carnalem generationem intelligis; sed ex aqua et spiritu oportet quod nascatur homo propter regnum Dei. Si propter haereditatem patris hominis temporalem nascitur aliquis ex visceribus matris carnalis; et propter haereditatem patris Dei sempiternam nascatur ex visceribus Ecclesiae. Cum autem ex duobus homo consistat, ex corpore videlicet et anima, duplicem habet et huiusmodi modum generationis; aqua enim quae visibilis est, ad emundationem corporis intelligitur: spiritus vero invisibiliter concurrens, ad emundationem invisibilis animae innuitur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if He said, You understand me to speak of a carnal birth; but a man must be born of water and of the Spirit, if he is to enter into the kingdom of God. If to obtain the temporal inheritance of his human father, a man must be born of the womb of his mother; to obtain the eternal inheritance of his heavenly Father, he must be born of the womb of the Church. And since man consists of two parts, body and soul, the mode even of this latter birth is twofold; water the visible part cleansing the body; the Spirit by His invisible cooperation, changing the invisible soul.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si vero quis interrogat: qualiter ab aqua homo nascitur? Interrogo et ego: qualiter natus est Adam a terra? Sicut enim in principio subiciebatur elementum terra, totum vero opus plasmantis erat; ita et nunc subicitur elementum aqua, totum vero est spiritus gratiae. Tunc Paradisum dedit in conversationem; nunc autem caelum nobis aperuit. Sed quae est necessitas aquae his qui spiritum sanctum suscipiunt? Divina enim in ea perficiuntur symbola, sepultura et mortificatio, resurrectio et vita. Sicut enim in quodam sepulchro, in aqua nobis submergentibus capita, vetus homo sepelitur, et submersus deorsum occultatur, deinde novus rursus ascendit. Hoc etiam fit, ut discas quoniam virtus patris et filii et spiritus sancti omnia complet, et quod Christus tres dies ad resurgendum expectavit. Quod igitur est matrix fetui, hoc est fideli aqua: in aqua enim plasmatur, et figuratur; sed quod in matrice plasmatur, tempore indiget: quod vero in aqua, non ita, sed in uno momento omnia fiunt. Talis enim est natura corporum ut tempore assumant perfectionem; in spiritualibus vero non est ita; quoniam perfecta a principio constituuntur quae fiunt. Ex quo igitur ascendit a Iordane dominus, non adhuc reptilia animarum viventium, sed animas spirituales et rationabiles aqua reddit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. If any one asks how a man is born of water, I ask in return, how Adam was born from the ground. For as in the beginning though the element of earth was the subject-matter, the man was the work of the fashioner; so now too, though the element of water is the subject-matter, the whole work is done by the Spirit of grace. He then gave Paradise for a place to dwell in; now He has opened heaven to us. But what need is there of water, to those who receive the Holy Ghost? It carries out the divine symbols of burial, mortification, resurrection, and life. For by the immersion of our heads in the water, the old man disappears and is buried as it were in a sepulcher, whence he ascends a new man. Thus should you learn, that the virtue of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, fills all things. For which reason also Christ lay three days in the grave before His resurrection. That then which the womb is to the offspring, water is to the believer; he is fashioned and formed in the water. But that which is fashioned in the womb needs time; whereas the water all is done in an instant. For the nature of the body is such as to require time for its completion; but spiritual creations are perfect from the beginning. From the time that our Lord ascended out of the Jordan, water produces no longer reptiles, i.e. living souls; but souls rational and endued with the Spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Bapt. Parv</b>: Sed quia non ait nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu, non habebit salutem, vel vitam aeternam; sed non intrabit in regnum Dei; ad hoc, inquiunt quidam, parvuli baptizandi sunt, ut sint cum Christo in regno Dei, ubi non erunt, si baptizati non fuerint; quamvis et sine Baptismo si parvuli moriantur, salutem vitamque aeternam habituri sint, quoniam nullo peccati vinculo astricti sunt. Sed cur nascatur denuo, nisi renovandus a vetustate? Aut unde imago Dei non intrat in regnum Dei, nisi impedimento prohibente peccati?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Because He does not say, Except a man be born again of water and of the Spirit, he shall not have salvation, or eternal life; but, he shall not enter into the kingdom of God; from this, some infer that children are to be baptized in order to be with Christ in the kingdom of God, where they would not be, were they not baptized; but that they will obtain salvation and eternal life even if they die without baptism, not being bound with any chain of sin. But why is a man born again, except to be changed from his old into a new state? Or why does the image of God not enter into the kingdom of God, if it be not by reason of sin?

          <td><b>Haymo</b>: Talia autem ac tanta secreta mysteria Nicodemo capere non valenti dominus ex carnali nativitate similitudinem dedit, dicens quod natum est ex carne, caro est; et quod natum est ex spiritu, spiritus est: sicut enim caro carnem procreat, ita quoque spiritus spiritum parit.
          <td><b>HAYMO</b>. But Nicodemus being unable to take in so great and deep mysteries, our Lord helps him by the analogy of our carnal birth, saying, That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. For as flesh generates flesh, so also does spirit, spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Nihil igitur sensibilium inquiras, neque aestimes quod carnem generet spiritus: domini enim caro genita est non quidem a spiritu solum sed etiam a carne. Quod autem natum est ex spiritu, spirituale est. Nativitatem enim hic non eam quae secundum substantiam, dicit, sed eam quae secundum honorem et gratiam. Si igitur et filius Dei ita natus est, quid plus habebit omnibus qui ita nati sunt? Invenietur autem et spiritu minor, cum eius nativitas gratia spiritus sit. Et quomodo haec a Iudaicis distant dogmatibus? Vide autem et spiritus sancti dignitatem: Dei enim opus videtur facere. Supra enim dixit, quoniam ex Deo nati sunt; hic autem quoniam spiritus eos generat. Dicens autem Christus, quoniam qui natus est ex spiritu, spiritus est, quia turbatum rursus vidit, ad sensibile exemplum ducit sermonem, dicens non mireris quia dixi tibi: oportet vos nasci denuo. Dicendo enim ne mireris, ostendit animi eius turbationem. Ponit autem exemplum quod neque communionem aliquam ad corporum grossitiem habet, neque ad incorporeorum perveniens naturam, quod est venti delatio, dicens spiritus ubi vult spirat, et vocem eius audis: sed nescis unde veniat aut quo vadat. Sic est omnis qui natus est ex spiritu. Quod dicit, tale est. Si ventum nullus detinet, sed quo vult fertur: multo magis spiritus actionem, naturae leges detinere non poterunt, non terminus corporalis nativitatis, neque aliud quid talium. Quoniam autem de vento hic dictum est, manifestat illud quod dicit vocem eius audis, idest sonitum percussionis; non enim loquens infideli et nescienti spiritus actionem hoc diceret. Dicit autem ubi vult spirat, non quasi electionem quamdam vento habente, sed eam quae a natura est motionem, quae non prohibetur, et cum potestate fit. Et nescis unde veniat, aut quo vadat; idest, si huius spiritus, cuius sensum suscipis auditu et tactu, interpretari nescis viam, qualiter divini spiritus operationem scrutaris? Unde subdit sic est omnis qui natus est ex spiritu.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Do not look then for any material production, or think that the Spirit generates flesh; for even the Lord’s flesh is generated not by the Spirit only, but also by the flesh. That which is born of the Spirit is spiritual. The birth here spoken of takes place not according to our substance, but according to honor and grace. But the birth of the Son of God is otherwise; for else what would He have been more than all who are born again? And He would be proved too inferior to the Spirit, inasmuch as His birth would be by the grace of the Spirit. How does this differ from the Jewish doctrine? - But mark next the part of the Holy Spirit, in the divine work. For whereas above some are said to be born of God, here, we find, the Spirit generates them. - The wonder of Nicodemus being roused again by the words, He who is born of the Spirit is spirit, Christ meets him again with an instance from nature; Marvel not that I said to you, You must be born again. The expression, Marvel not, shows that Nicodemus was surprised at His doctrine. He takes for this instance some thing, not of the grossness of other bodily things, but still removed from the incorporeal nature, the wind; The wind blows where it lists, and you hear the sound thereof, but can not tell whence it comes, and whither it goes: so is every one that is born of the Spirit. That is to say, if no one can restrain the wind from going where it will; much less can the laws of nature, whether the condition of our natural birth, or any other, restrain the action of the Spirit. That He speaks of the wind here is plain, from His saving, You hear the sound thereof, i.e. its noise when it strikes objects. He would not in talking to an unbeliever and ignorant person, so describe the action of the Spirit. He says, Blows where it lists; not meaning any power of choice in the wind, but only its natural movements, in their uncontrolled power. But can not tell whence it comes or whither it goes; i.e. If you can not explain the action of this wind which comes under the cognizance both of your feeling and hearing, why examine into the operation of the Divine Spirit? He adds, So is every one that is born of the Spirit.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed quis nostrum non videat verbi gratia Austrum euntem a meridie ad Aquilonem, aut alium ventum venientem ab oriente et occidente? Quomodo ergo nescimus unde veniat aut quo eat?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But who of us does not see, for example, that the south wind blows from south to north, another wind from the east, another from the west? And how then do we not know whence the wind comes, and whither it goes?

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Spiritus igitur sanctus est qui ubi vult spirat, quia ipse in potestate habet cuius cor gratia suae visitationis illustret. Et vocem eius audis, cum te praesente loquitur is qui spiritu sancto repletus est.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. It is the Holy Spirit therefore, Who blows where He lists. It is in His own power to choose, whose heart to visit with in His enlightening grace. And you hear the sound thereof. When one filled with the Holy Spirit is present with you and speaks to you.

          <td><b>HAYMO</b>. Nicodemus cannot take in the mysteries of the Divine Majesty, which our Lord reveals, and therefore asks how it is, not denying the fact, not meaning any censure, but wishing to be informed: Nicodemus answered and said to Him, How can these things be?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Forasmuch then as he still remains a Jew, and, after such clear evidence, persists in a low and carnal system, Christ addresses him henceforth with greater severity: Jesus answered and said to him, Are you a master in Israel, and know not these things?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid putamus? Dominum huic magistro Iudaeorum quasi insultare voluisse? Volebat quidem illum nasci de spiritu: nemo autem ex spiritu nascitur nisi humilis fuerit, quia ipsa humilitas facit nos nasci de spiritu. Ille autem magisterio inflatus erat, et alicuius momenti sibi esse videbatur, quia doctor erat Iudaeorum. Deponit ergo dominus superbiam eius, ut possit nasci de spiritu.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What think we? that our Lord wished to insult this master in Israel? He wished him to be born of the Spirit: and no one is born of the Spirit except he is made humble; for this very humility it is, which makes us to be born of the Spirit. He however was inflated with his eminence as a master, and thought himself of importance because he was a doctor of the Jews. Our Lord then casts down his pride, in order that he may be born of the Spirit.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nequaquam tamen nequitiam accusat viri, sed insipientiam et ruditatem solum. Sed dicet aliquis: quid commune habet haec nativitas, de qua scilicet Christus locutus est, ad Iudaica dogmata? Habet quidem commune: nam qui primus homo factus est, et quae de costa facta est mulier, et quae steriles genuerunt, et quae per aquam miracula perfecta sunt: dico autem, quod Elisaeus de aqua ferrum eduxit, et quod Iudaei mare rubrum transierunt, et quod Naaman Syrus in Iordane purgatus est: haec omnia nativitatem spiritualem et purgamentum in ea futurum figuraliter personabant; et ea quae a prophetis sunt dicta, occulte ostendunt hunc nativitatis modum; ut puta illud: renovabitur ut aquilae iuventus tua; et: beati quorum remissae sunt iniquitates. Sed et Isaac figura huius nativitatis erat. Haec igitur rememorans dixit tu es magister in Israel, et haec ignoras? Rursus autem aliunde suum sermonem ei credibilem facit, ad imbecillitatem eius condescendens, cum subdit amen, amen dico tibi, quia quod scimus loquimur, et quod vidimus testamur, et testimonium nostrum non accipitis. Apud nos visus aliis sensibus certior est; et si volumus aliquem facere credere, ita dicimus, quoniam oculis nostris vidimus. Propterea Christus humano loquens ad eum sermone, non visum sensibilem inducit; sed manifestum est quod de certissima cognitione et non aliter se habente loquitur. Igitur hoc quidem, idest quod scimus, ait de seipso solo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nevertheless He does not charge the man with wickedness, but only with want of wisdom, and enlightenment. But some one will say, What connection has this birth, of which Christ speaks, with Jewish doctrines? Thus much. The first man that was made, the woman that was made out of his rib, the barren that bare, the miracles which were worked by means of water, I mean, Elijah’s bringing up the iron from the river, the passage of the Red Sea, and Naaman the Syrian’s purification in the Jordan, were all types and figures of the spiritual birth, and of the purification which was to take place thereby. Many passages in the Prophets too have a hidden reference to this birth: as that in the Psalms, Making you young and lusty as an eagle: and, Blessed is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven. And again, Isaac was a type of this birth. Referring to these passages, our Lord says, Are you a master in Israel, and know not these things? A second time however He condescends to his infirmity, and makes use of a common argument to render what He has said credible: Verily, verily, I say to you, We speak that we do know, and testify that we have seen, and you receive not our testimony. Sight we consider the most certain of all the senses; so that when we say, we saw such a thing with our eyes, we seem to compel men to believe us. In like manner Christ, speaking after the manner of men, does not indeed say that he has seen actually, i.e. with the bodily eye, the mysteries He reveals; but it is clear that He means it of the most certain absolute knowledge. This then, viz. That we do know, he asserts of Himself alone.

          <td><b>Haymo</b>: Quaeritur autem quare pluraliter dicat quod scimus loquimur. Ad quod dicendum, quod unigenitus Dei filius erat qui hoc loquebatur; ostendens qualiter pater est in filio, et filius in patre, et spiritus sanctus ab utroque indivisibilis procedat.
          <td><b>HAYMO</b>. Why, it is He asked, does He speak in the plural number, We speak that we do know? Because the speaker being the Only-Begotten Son of God, He would show that the Father was in the Son, and the Son in the Father, and the Holy Ghost from both, proceeding indivisibly.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or, the plural number may have this meaning; I, and they who are born again of the Spirit, alone understand what we speak; and having seen the Father in secret, this we testify openly to the world; and you, who are carnal and proud, receive not our testimony.

Hinc enim erudit nos, cum ad aliquos locuti fuerimus et non persuaserimus, non tristari neque irasci, sed nostrum sermonem credibilem facere, non solum non irascendo, sed etiam non clamando; materia enim irae clamor est. Iesus autem dogmata excelsa tangere debens, propter audientium infirmitatem se detinet multoties; et non continue dignis sua magnitudine dogmatibus immoratur, sed magis his quae condescensionem habent; unde hic subditur si terrena dixi vobis, et non creditis, quomodo si dixero vobis caelestia, credetis?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They are words of gentleness, not of anger; a lesson to us, when we argue and cannot converse, not by sore and angry words, but by the absence of anger and clamor, (for clamor is the material of anger,) to prove the soundness of our views. Jesus in entering upon high doctrines, ever checks Himself in compassion to the weakness of His hearer: and does not dwell continuously on the most important truths, but turns to others more humble. Whence it follows: If I have told you earthly things, and you believe not, how shall you believe if I tell you of heavenly things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Si Baptismum terrenum dicat, non mireris, quia in terra perficitur, et comparatione illius nativitatis stupendae quae est ex substantia patris, terrena est gratiae nativitas. Et bene non dixit: non intelligitis; sed non creditis: nam cum quis aliqua per intellectum suscipere non valet, amentiae vel ignorantiae imputatur; cum autem hoc non suscipiat aliquis quod solum fide oportet suscipere, non amentiae sed infidelitatis est accusatio. Dicebantur autem haec, etsi non credebantur, quia posteri erant ea suscepturi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>, Or thus: Be not surprised at His calling Baptism earthly. It is performed upon earth, and is compared with that stupendous birth, which is of the substance of the Father, an earthly birth being one of mere grace. And well has He said, not, You understand not, but, You believe not: for when the understanding cannot take in certain truths, we attribute it to natural deficiency or ignorance: but where that is not received which it belongs to faith only to receive, the fault is not deficiency, but unbelief. These truths, however, were revealed that posterity might believe and benefit by them, though the people of that age did not.

Dicens et nemo ascendit in caelum, nisi qui descendit de caelo, filius hominis qui est in caelo; quasi dicat: sic fiet generatio spiritualis, ut sint caelestes homines ex terrenis; quod adipisci non poterunt nisi membra mea efficiantur, ut ipse ascendat qui descendit, non aliud deputans corpus suum, idest Ecclesiam suam, quam seipsum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. After taking notice of this lack of knowledge in a person, who, on the strength of his magisterial station, set himself above others, and blaming the unbelief of such men, our Lord says, that if such as these do not believe, others will: No one has ascended into heaven, but He that came down from heaven, even the Son of man who is in heaven. This may be rendered: The spiritual birth shall be of such sort, as that men from being earthly shall become heavenly: which will not be possible, except they are made members of Me; so that he who ascends, becomes one with Him who descended. Our Lord accounts His body, i.e. His Church, as Himself.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quamvis autem in terra factus sit filius hominis, divinitatem tamen suam, qua in caelo manens, descendit ad terram, non indignam censuit nomine filii hominis, sicut carnem suam dignatus est nomine filii Dei. Per unitatem enim personae, qua utraque substantia unus est Christus; et filius Dei ambulabat in terra, et idem ipse filius hominis manebat in caelo. Fit ergo credibiliorum fides ex incredibilioribus creditis. Si enim divina substantia longe distantior potuit propter nos ita suscipere humanam substantiam, ut una persona fieret; quanto credibilius alii sancti fiunt cum homine Christo unus Christus, ut omnibus per gratiam ascendentibus, ipse unus ascendat in caelum qui de caelo descendit?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Although He was made the Son of man upon earth, yet His Divinity with which, remaining in heaven, He descended to earth, He has declared not to disagree with the title of Son of man, as He has thought His flesh worthy the name of Son of God. For through the Unity of person, by which both substances are one Christ, He walked upon earth, being Son of God; and remained in heaven, being Son of man. And the belief of the greater, involves belief in the less. If then the Divine substance, which is so far more removed from us, and could for our sake take up the substance of man so as to unite them in one person; how much more easily may we believe, that the Saints united with the man Christ, become with Him one Christ, so that while it is true of all, that they ascend by grace, it is at the same time true, that He alone ascends to heaven, Who came down from heaven.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Quia dixerat Nicodemus scimus quoniam a Deo venisti magister, ne aestimetur ita esse magister ut multi prophetarum de terra existentes, subiungit et nemo ascendit in caelum nisi qui descendit de caelo, filius hominis qui est in caelo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: Nicodemus having said, We know that You are a teacher sent from God; our Lord says, And no man has ascended, &amp;c. in that He might not appear to be a teacher only like one of the Prophets.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But when you hear that the Son of man came down from heaven, think not that His flesh came down from heaven; for this is the doctrine of those heretics, who held that Christ took His Body from heaven, and only passed through the Virgin.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By the title Son of man here, He does not mean His flesh, but Himself altogether; the lesser part of His nature being put to express the whole. It is not uncommon with Him to name Himself wholly from His humanity, or wholly from His divinity.

Quod vero hominis filius est, susceptae in virgine carnis est partus. Quod autem in caelis est, naturae semper permanentis potestas est, quae non ex infinitatis suae virtute in regionem definiti corporis coarctavit verbi Dei potestatem, et in forma servi manens ab omni intra extraque caeli mundique circulo, caeli ac mundi dominus non abfuit. Per hoc ergo et de caelo descendit, quia filius hominis est; et in caelis est, quia verbum caro factum, non amiserat manere quod verbum est.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>; Or, His descending from heaven is the source of His origin as conceived by the Spirit: Mary gave not His body its origin, though the natural qualities of her sex contributed its birth and increase. That He is the Son of man is from the birth of the flesh which was conceived in the Virgin. That He is in heaven is form the power of His everlasting nature, which did not contract the power of the Word of God, which is infinite, within the sphere of a finite body. Our Lord remaining in the form of a servant, far from the whole circle, inner and outer, of heaven and the world, yet as Lord of heaven and the world, was not absent therefrom. So then He came down from heaven because He was the Son of man; and He was in heaven, because the Word, which was made flesh, had not ceased to be the Word.

Exaltatus serpens est mors Christi, eo significandi modo quo per efficientem id quod efficitur significatur. A serpente quippe mors venit, qui peccatum, quo mori meretur, homini persuasit; dominus autem in carnem suam non peccatum transtulit tamquam venenum serpentis, sed mortem, ut esset in similitudine carnis peccati poena sine culpa; unde in carne peccati et poena solveretur et culpa.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Many dying in the wilderness from the attack of the serpents, Moses, by commandment of the Lord, lifted up a brazen serpent and those who looked upon it were immediately healed. The lifting up of the serpent is the death of Christ; the cause, by a certain mode of construction, being put for the effect. The serpent was the cause of death, inasmuch as he persuaded man into that sin, by which he merited death. Our Lord, however, did not transfer sin, i.e. the poison of the serpent, to his flesh, but death; in order that in the likeness of sinful flesh, there might be punishment without sin, by virtue of which sinful flesh might be delivered both from punishment and from sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Videas ergo figuram ad veritatem: ibi enim serpentis similitudo speciem quidem bestiae habet, venenum autem non habet; sic et hic Christus a peccato liber, in similitudinem carnis peccati venit. Exaltari autem audiens, suspensionem intelligas in altum, ut sanctificaret aerem qui sanctificaverat terram ambulando in ea: intelligas etiam per exaltationem gloriam: nam illa crucis altitudo gloria Christi facta est: in quo enim iudicari voluit, in hoc huius mundi principem iudicavit. Adam enim iuste mortuus est, quia peccavit; dominus vero iniuste, quia peccatum non fecit. Postquam ergo iniuste mortem sustinuit, superavit illum qui eum tradidit morti, et sic liberavit Adam a morte. Sed in hoc devictum se invenit: non enim potuit in cruce dominum contristare ut crucifigentes odiret; sed magis diligebat, et pro eis orabat. Sic igitur crux Christi eius exaltatio et gloria facta est.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. See then the aptness of the figure. The figure of the serpent has the appearance of the beast, but not its poison: in the same way Christ came in the likeness of sinful flesh, being free from sin. By Christ’s being lifted up, understand His being suspended on high, by which suspension He sanctified the air, even as He had sanctified the earth by walking upon it. Herein too is typified the glory of Christ: for the height of the cross was made His glory for in that He submitted to be judged, He judged the prince of this world; for Adam died justly, because he sinned; out Lord unjustly, because He did no sin. So He overcame him, who delivered Him over to death, and thus delivered Adam from death. And in this the devil found himself vanquished, that he could not upon the cross torment our Lord into hating His murderers: but only made Him love and pray for them the more. In this way the cross of Christ was made His lifting up, and glory.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ideo etiam non dixit: pendere oportet filium hominis, sed exaltari, quia honestius hoc videbatur: unde et propter audientem et propter figuram hoc posuit; ut discas quoniam cognata sunt vetera novis; deinde ut cognoscas quoniam non invitus ad passionem venit; et adhuc ut discas quoniam multis hinc nascitur salus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Wherefore He does not say, The Son of man must be suspended, but lifted up, a more honorable term, but coming near the figure. He uses the figure to show that the old dispensation is akin to the new, and to show on His hearers’ account that He suffered voluntarily; and that His death issued in life.

Quid ergo opus est ut morti Christi per Baptismum conformetur parvulus, si morsu serpentis non est omnino venenatus?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As then formerly he who looked to the serpent that was lifted up, was healed of its poison, and saved from death; so now he who is conformed to the likeness of Christ’s death by faith and the grace of baptism, is delivered both from sin by justification, and from death by the resurrection: as He Himself said; That whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. What need then is there that the child should be conformed by baptism to the death of Christ, if he be not altogether tainted by the poisonous bite of the serpent?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe; He alludes to the Passion obscurely, in consideration to His hearer; but the fruit of the Passion He unfolds plainly; viz. that they who believe in the Crucified One should not perish. And if they who believe in the Crucified live, much more shall the Crucified One Himself.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia dixerat oportet exaltari filium hominis, quo mortem occulte significavit, ne auditor tristis ab his fieret verbis, humanum quid de eo suspicans, et mortem eius aestimans non esse salutarem; hoc ad rectitudinem reducit, filium Dei dicens eum qui datur ad mortem, et mortem eius causam esse vitae aeternae; unde dicit sic enim Deus dilexit mundum, ut filium suum unigenitum daret; ut omnis qui credit in eum, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam; quasi dicat: ne mireris quoniam ego debeo exaltari, ut vos salvemini: etenim et patri hoc videtur; qui ita nos dilexit, ut pro servis indevotis filium dederit. Dicendo autem sic Deus dilexit mundum, multam indicat amoris intensionem. Multa enim est et infinita distantia: qui enim immortalis, qui sine principio, qui magnitudo infinita, eos qui sunt ex terra et cinere, infinitis plenos peccatis dilexit. Sed et ea quae post hoc ponit, ostensiva sunt magni amoris: non enim servum, non Angelum, non Archangelum dedit, sed filium suum. Rursus, si filios plures habuisset et dedisset unum, hoc etiam esset maximum; nunc vero filium unicum dedit; unde subdit unigenitum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Having said, Even so must the Son of man be lifted up, alluding to His death; lest His hearer should be cast down by His words, forming some human notion of Him, and thinking of His death as an evil, He corrects this by saying, that He who was given up to death was the Son of God, and that His death would be the source of life eternal; So God loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life; as if He said, Marvel not that I must be lifted up, that you may be saved: for so it seems good to the Father, who has so loved you, that He has given His Son to suffer for ungrateful and careless servants. The text, God so loved the world, shows intensity of love. For great indeed and infinite is the distance between the two. He who is without end, or beginning of existence, Infinite Greatness, loved those who were of earth and ashes, creatures laden with sins innumerable. And the act which springs from the love is equally indicative of its vastness. For God gave not a servant, or an Angel, or an Archangel, but His Son. Again, had He had many sons, and given one, this would have been a very great gift; but now He has given His Only Begotten Son.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Sed si dilectionis hinc fides est creaturam creaturae praestitisse, non facit magni meriti fidem vilis et spernenda iactura. Pretiosa autem sunt quae commendant caritatem, et ingentia ingentibus aestimantur. Deus diligens mundum, filium non adoptivum, sed suum et unigenitum dedit. Hic proprietas est, nativitas est, veritas est; non creatio est, non adoptio est, non falsitas est: hic dilectionis et caritatis fides est, ut ad mundi salutem et filium suum et unigenitum praestitisset.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>; If it were only a creature given up for the sake of a creature, such a poor and insignificant loss were no great evidence of love. They must be precious things which prove our love, great things must evidence its greatness. God, in love to the world, gave His Son, not an adopted Son, but His own, even His Only Begotten. Here is proper Sonship, birth, truth: no creation, no adoption, no lie: here is the test of love and charity, that God sent His own and only begotten Son to save the world.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Videtur autem mihi quod, sicut dixit superius, quod filius hominis descendit de caelo, cum caro de caelo non descenderit; sed propter unam personam in Christo, quae Dei sunt attribuit homini: sed et nunc e converso, quae sunt hominis, verbo Dei appropriat: etenim Deus Dei filius impassibilis mansit; sed quia unus erat secundum hypostasim Dei filius et homo qui passionem sustinuit; filius dari dicitur in mortem, qui passibiliter patiebatur, non natura propria, sed carne propria. Est autem maxima utilitas consecuta ex huiusmodi datione, mentem excedens humanam; sequitur enim ut omnis qui credit in eum, non pereat, sed habeat vitam aeternam. Vetus namque testamentum his qui servabant illud, dierum longitudinem promittebat; Evangelium vero aeternam et insolubilem vitam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b> As He said above, that the Son of man came down from heaven, not meaning that His flesh did come down from heaven, on account of the unity of person in Christ, attributing to man what belonged to God: so now conversely what belongs to man, he assigns to God the Word. The Son of God was impassible; but being one in respect of person with man who was passable, the Son is said to be given up to death, inasmuch as He truly suffered, not in His own nature, but in His own flesh. From this death follows an exceeding great and incomprehensible benefit: viz. that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. The Old Testament promised to those who obey obeyed it, length of days: the Gospel promises life eternal, and imperishable.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Notandum vero, quod eadem de filio Dei unigenito replicat quae de filio hominis in cruce exaltato praemiserat, dicens ut omnis qui credit in eum; quia idem redemptor et conditor noster filius Dei ante saecula existens, filius hominis factus est in fine saeculorum; ut qui per divinitatis suae potentiam nos creaverat ad perfruendam beatitudinem perennis vitae, ipse per fragilitatem humanitatis nostrae nos restauraret ad percipiendam quam perdidimus vitam.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; Note here, that the same which he before said of the Son of man, lifted up on the cross, he repeats of the only begotten Son of God: viz. That whosoever believes in Him, &amp;c. For the same our Maker and Redeemer, who was Son of God before the world was, was made at the end of the world the Son of man; so that He who by the power of His Godhead had created us to enjoy the happiness of an endless life, the same restored us to the life we have lost by taking our human frailty upon Him.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vere autem per filium Dei habebit mundus vitam; quia non alia de causa venit in mundum nisi ut salvet mundum; unde sequitur non enim misit Deus filium suum ut iudicet mundum, sed ut salvetur mundus per ipsum.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Truly through the Son of God shall the world have life; for no other cause came He into the world, except to save the world. God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quare enim salvator mundi dictus est, nisi ut salvet mundum? Ergo quantum in medico est, sanare venit aegrotum. Ipse se interimit qui praecepta medici servare non vult, aut contemnit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For why is He called the Savior of the world, but because He saves the world? The physician, so far as his will is concerned, heals the sick. If the sick despises or will not observe the directions of the physician, he destroys himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed quia hoc dicit, multi pigrorum in peccatorum magnitudine, et negligentiae superabundantia, Dei abutentes misericordia, dicunt: non est Gehenna, non est supplicium; omnia nobis Deus peccata dimittit. Sed considerandum, quod duo sunt Christi adventus: qui iam factus est, et qui futurus. Et prior quidem factus est, non ut iudicet quae facta sunt a nobis, sed ut dimittat. Secundus autem, non ut dimittat, sed ut iudicet. De priori igitur ait: non veni ut iudicem mundum; quia enim clemens est, non facit iudicium, sed interim remissionem omnium peccatorum per Baptismum primo, et postea per poenitentiam; quia si hoc modo non fecisset, universi simul perditi essent: omnes enim peccaverunt et egent gratia Dei. Ne igitur aliquis crederet se impune peccare, subdit de poena non credentis qui credit in eum, non iudicatur. Qui credit, inquit, non qui investigat. Quid igitur si immundam habeat vitam? Maxime quidem Paulus tales non fideles esse dicit: confitentur se nosse Deum, factis autem negant. Sed hoc illud significat: quia secundum hoc qui credit, non iudicatur; sed operum quidem graviorem sustinebit poenam; infidelitatis autem causa non torquebitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Because however He says this, slothful men in the multitude of their sins, and excess of carelessness, abuse God’s mercy, and say, There is no hell, no punishment; God remits us all our sins. But let us remember, that there are two advents of Christ; one past, the other to come. The former was, not to judge but to pardon us: the latter will be, not to pardon but to judge us. It is of the former that He says, I have not come to judge the world. Because He is merciful, instead of judgment, He grants an internal remission of all sins by baptism; and even after baptism opens to us the door of repentance, which had He not done all had been lost; for all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God. Afterwards, however, there follows something about the punishment of unbelievers, to warn us against flattering ourselves that we can sin with impunity. Of the unbeliever He says, ‘he is judged already.’ - But first He says, He that believes in Him is not judged. He who believes, He says, not who inquires. But what if his life be impure? Paul very strongly declares that such are not believers: They confess, he says, that they know God, but in works deny Him. That is to say, Such will not be judged for their belief, but will receive a heavy punishment for their works, though unbelief will not be charged against them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel qui credit in eum et adhaeret ei ut membrum capiti, non iudicabitur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He who believes in Him, and cleaves to Him as a member to the head, will not be condemned.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid autem dicturum sperabas de eo qui non credit, nisi quod iudicatur? Sed vide quid dicit: qui autem non credit, iam iudicatus est. Nondum apparuit iudicium, sed iam factum est iudicium. Novit enim dominus qui sunt eius; novit qui permaneant ad coronam et qui permaneant ad flammam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What did you expect Him to say of him who believed not, except that he is condemned. Yet mark His words: He that believes not is condemned already. The Judgment has not appeared, but it is already given. For the Lord knows who are His; who are awaiting the crown, and who the fire.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Aut hoc dicit, quia ipsum discredere impoenitentis supplicium est: esse enim extra lumen, etiam secundum se, maximum supplicium est. Vel quod futurum est praenuntiat. Sicut enim qui occidit hominem, etsi nondum sententia iudicantis condemnatus sit, rei tamen natura condemnatus est; ita et qui incredulus est; sicut et Adam qua die comedit de ligno, mortuus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or the meaning is, that disbelief itself is the punishment of the impenitent: inasmuch as that is to be without light, and to be without light is of itself the greatest punishment. Or He is announcing what is to be. Though a murderer be not yet sentenced by the Judge, still his crime has already condemned him. In like manner he who believes not, is dead, even as Adam, on the day that he ate of the tree, died.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Vel aliter. In extremo iudicio aliqui non iudicantur et pereunt, de quibus hic dicitur qui non credit, iam iudicatus est. Non enim eorum tunc causa discutitur qui a conspectu districti iudicis iam cum damnatione suae infidelitatis abscedunt. Professionem vero fidei retinentes, sed professionis opera non habentes, redarguuntur ut pereant. Qui vero nec fidei sacramenta tenuerunt, increpationem iudicis in extrema examinatione non audiunt: quia praeiudicati in infidelitatis suae tenebris, eius quem despexerant invectione argui non merentur. Princeps namque terrenam rempublicam regens aliter punit civem interius delinquentem, atque aliter hostem exterius rebellantem. In isto iura sua consulit; contra hostem vero bella movet, dignaque eius malitiae tormenta retribuit; de malo vero eius quid lex habeat non requirit; neque enim lege necesse est perimi eum qui lege numquam potuit teneri.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or thus: In the last judgment some perish without being judged, of whom it is here said, He that believes not is condemned already. For the day of judgment does not try those who for unbelief are already banished from the sight of a discerning judge, are under sentence of damnation; but those, who retaining the profession of faith, have no works to show suitable to that profession. For those who have not kept even the sacraments of faith, do not even hear the curse of the Judge at the last trial. They have already, in the darkness of their unbelief, received their sentence, and are not thought worthy of being convicted by the rebuke of Him whom they had despised Again; For an earthly sovereign, in the government of his state, has a different rule of punishment, in the case of the disaffected subject, and the foreign rebel. In the former case he consults the civil law; but against the enemy he proceeds at once to war, and repays his malice with the punishment it deserves, without regard to law, inasmuch as he who never submitted to law, has no claim to suffer by the law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Quare autem iudicatus est qui non credit, causam assignat dicens quia non credit in nomine unigeniti filii Dei. In hoc enim solo nomine est salus. Non habet Deus multos filios qui possint salvare; hunc habet unigenitum, per quem salvat.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He then gives the reason why he who believes not is condemned, viz. because he believes not in the name of the only begotten Son of God. For in this name alone is there salvation. God has not many sons who can save; He by whom He saves is the Only Begotten.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Peccat. Mer. et Remiss</b>: Ubi ergo parvulos ponimus baptizatos, nisi inter eos qui crediderunt? Hoc enim eis acquiritur per virtutem sacramenti et offerentium responsionem; ac per hoc eos qui baptizati non sunt, inter eos qui non crediderunt, statuimus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Where then do we place baptized children? Amongst those who believe? This is acquired for them by the virtue of the Sacrament, and the pledges of the sponsors. And by this same rule we reckon those who are not baptized, among those who believe not.

Et si quidem in iudicium venisset, haberet hoc aliquam rationem; qui enim malorum sibi conscius est, fugere iudicem consuevit; parcenti vero, qui dereliquerunt occurrunt. Decens igitur erat eos qui multorum sibi ipsis erant conscii peccatorum, maxime Christo ad ignoscendum venienti occurrere; quod et in multis factum est; etenim publicani et peccatores venientes recumbebant cum Iesu. Quia vero quidam sunt ita molles ad eos qui pro virtute sunt labores, ut usque ad ultimum velint adhaerere malitiae; in horum iniuriam subdit omnis enim qui male agit, odit lucem: quod quidem dictum est de his qui eligunt in malitia manere.

            <p><b>CHRYS</b>. Then because it seemed incredible that man should prefer light to darkness, he gives the reason of the infatuation, viz. that their deeds were evil. And indeed had He come to Judgment, there had been some reason for not receiving Him; for he who is conscious of his crimes, naturally avoids the judge. But criminals are glad to meet one who brings them pardon. And therefore it might have been expected that men conscious of their sins would have gone to meet Christ, as many indeed did; for the publicans and sinners came and sat down with Jesus. But the greater part being too cowardly to undergo the toils of virtue for righteousness’ sake, persisted in their wickedness to the last; of whom our Lord says, Every one that does evil, hates the light. He speaks of those who choose to remain in their wickedness.

Non enim mihi dicas eos qui a natura sunt mites et honesti; non enim est hoc virtus; sed eum dic qui a passionibus sustinet violentiam, et sapienter vivit; sed non utique habes. Si enim regni enuntiatio, et Gehennae minae, et alia tanta documenta vix detinent homines in virtute, nullo horum persuasi pertransibunt virtutem. Si vero hypocrisim fingunt, gloriae gratia hoc faciunt: unde cum potuerint latere, non omittent uti malis desideriis. Quae etiam utilitas est cum aliquis sobrius sit et non rapit, fit vero vanae gloriae servus? Hoc enim non est recte vivere.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. No one reproves a Pagan, because his own practice agrees with the character of his gods; his life is in accordance with his doctrines. But a Christian who lives in wickedness all must condemn. If there are any Gentiles whose life is good, I know them not. But are there not Gentiles? it may be asked. For do not tell me of the naturally amiable and honest; this is not virtue. But show me one who has strong passions, and lives with wisdom. You cannot. For if the announcement of a kingdom, and the threats of hell, and other inducements, hardly keep men virtuous which they are so, such calls will hardly rouse them to the attainment of virtue in the first instance. Pagans, if they do produce any thing which looks well, do it for vain-glory’s sake, and will therefore at the same time, if they can escape notice, gratify their evil desires as well. And what profit is a man’s sobriety and decency of conduct, if he is the slave of vain-glory? The slave of vain-glory is no less a sinner than a fornicator; nay, sins even oftener, and more grievously.

Per sentinam intrat; sed diu intrando et non exhauriendo mergit navem. Quid est autem exhaurire, nisi bonis operibus agere ne obruant peccata, gemendo, ieiunando, tribuendo, ignoscendo?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if God has discovered all men’s works to be evil, how is it that any have done the truth, and come to the light, i.e. to Christ? Now what He said is, that they loved darkness rather than light; He lays the stress upon that. Many have loved their sins, many have confessed them. God accuses your sins; if you accuse them too, you are joined to God. You must hate your own work, and love the work of God in you. The beginning of good works, is the confession of evil works, and then you does the truth: not soothing, not flattering yourself. And you are come to the light, because this very sin in you, which displeases you, would not displease you, did not God shine upon you, and His truth show it to you. And let those even who have sinned only by word or thought, or who have only exceeded in things allowable, do the truth, by making confession, and come to the light by performing good works. For little sins, if suffered to accumulate, become mortal. Little drops swell the river: little grains of sand become an heap, which presses and weighs down. The sea coming in by little and little, unless it be pumped out, sinks the vessel. And what is to pump out, but by good works, mourning, fasting, giving and forgiving, to provide against our sins overwhelming us?

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Nihil veritate apertius neque fortius; quae neque latere vult, neque periculum formidat, neque insidiis tremit, neque gloriam quae a multis est desiderat, nulli humanorum obnoxia; unde et dominus in solemnitatibus Ierusalem ascendebat; non se ostentans, neque honorem diligens, sed ut pluribus sua dogmata proponeret, et miraculorum utilitatem. Postquam autem solemnitates solvebantur, ad Iordanem frequenter veniebat, quia et illic etiam turbae concurrebant; unde dicitur post haec venit Iesus et discipuli eius in Iudaeam terram, et illic demorabatur cum eis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nothing is more open than truth, nothing bolder; it neither seeks concealment, or avoids danger, or fears the snare, or cares for popularity. It is subject to no human weakness. Our Lord went up to Jerusalem at the feasts, not from ostentation or love of honor, but to teach the people His doctrines, and show miracles of mercy. After the festival He visited the crowds who were collected at the Jordan. After these things came Jesus and His disciples into the land of Judea; and there he tarried with them, and baptized.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Dicit autem post haec, non continuo post disputationem cum Nicodemo, quae facta est in Hierosolymis, sed peracto spatio temporis de Galilaea in Iudaeam rediit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; After these things, is not immediately after His dispute with Nicodemus, which took place at Jerusalem; but on His return to Jerusalem after some. time spent in Galilee.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Per Iudaeam quidem significantur confitentes, quos visitat Christus: ubi enim est peccatorum confessio vel divinarum laudum, illuc venit Christus et discipuli eius, idest doctrina et illuminatio eius, et ibi moratur purgando a vitiis; unde sequitur et illic demorabatur cum eis, et baptizabat.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. By Judea are meant those who confess, whom Christ visits; for wherever there is confession of sins, or the praise of God, thither comes Christ and His disciples, i. e. His doctrine and enlightenment; and there He is known by His cleansing men from sin: And there He tarried with them, and baptized.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Cum autem Evangelista postmodum dicat quod Iesus non baptizabat, sed discipuli eius, manifestum est quoniam et hic hoc dicit, quod soli discipuli baptizabant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As the Evangelist says afterwards, that Jesus baptized not but His disciples, it is evident that he means the same here, i.e. that the disciples only baptized.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Baptizatus autem dominus baptizabat non eo Baptismate quo baptizatus est: baptizatus est enim a servo, ostendens humilitatis viam, et perducens ad Baptismum domini, hoc est suum. Baptizabat enim Iesus quomodo dominus, quomodo Dei filius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord did not baptize with the baptism wherewith He had been baptized; for He was baptized by a servant, as a lesson of humility to us, and in order to bring us to the Lord’s baptism, i.e. His own; for Jesus baptized, as the Lord, the Son of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Christo autem iam baptizante, adhuc baptizat Ioannes; quia adhuc permanet umbra, nec debet praecursor cessare donec veritas manifestetur; unde sequitur erat autem Ioannes baptizans in Aennon iuxta Salim. Aennon Hebraice aqua: unde quasi nominis interpretationem aperiens subdit quia aquae multae erant illic. Salim oppidum est iuxta Iordanem situm, ubi olim Melchisedech regnavit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; John still continues baptizing, though Christ has begun; for the shadow remains still, nor must the forerunner cease, till the truth is manifested. And John also was baptizing in Ænon, near to Salim. Ænon is Hebrew for water; so that the Evangelist gives, as it were, the derivation of the name, when he adds, For there was much water there. Salim is a town on the Jordan, where Melchisedec once reigned.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hieronymus ad Evagrium</b>: Nec refert utrum Salem aut Salim nominetur, cum vocalibus in medio litteris perraro utantur Hebraei, et pro voluntate lectorum ac regionum varietate, eadem verba diversis sonis atque accentibus proferantur. Sequitur et veniebant, et baptizabantur.
          <td><b>JEROME</b>; It matters not whether it is called Salem, or Salim; since the Jews very rarely use vowels in the middle of words; and the same words are pronounced with different vowels and accents, by different readers, and in different places. And they came, and were baptized.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quantum catechumenis nondum baptizatis prodest doctrina fidei, tantum profuit Baptisma Ioannis ante Baptismum Christi: quia sicut ille praedicabat poenitentiam et Baptismum Christi nuntiabat, et in cognitionem veritatis quae mundo apparuit attrahebat: sic ministri Ecclesiae primo erudiunt venientes ad fidem, post peccata eorum redarguunt, deinde in Baptismo Christi remissionem promittunt, et sic in cognitionem et dilectionem veritatis attrahunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; The same kind of benefit which catechumens receive from instruction before they are baptized, the same did John’s baptism convey before Christ’s. As John preached repentance, announced Christ’s baptism, and drew all men to the knowledge of the truth now made manifest to the world: so the ministers of the Church first instruct those who come to the faith, then reprove their sins; and lastly, drawing them to the knowledge and love of the truth, offer them remission by Christ’s baptism.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Discipulis autem Iesu baptizantibus, non cessavit Ioannes baptizans usque ad incarcerationem; quod significat Evangelista cum subdit nondum enim missus fuerat Ioannes in carcerem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Notwithstanding the disciples of Jesus baptized, John did not leave off till his imprisonment; as the Evangelist’s language intimates, For John was not yet cast into prison.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ecce aperte notat facta Christi ante Ioannem incarceratum; quae alii praeterierunt, incipientes ab his quae post missum Ioannem in carcerem facta sunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He evidently here is relating what Christ did before John’s imprisonment; a part which has been passed over by the rest, who commence after John’s imprisonment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quare autem baptizabat Ioannes? Quia oportebat ut dominus baptizaretur. Non solum autem baptizatus est ab eo, ne Baptismus Ioannis melior Baptismate domini videretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But why did John baptize? Because it was necessary that our Lord should be baptized. And why was it necessary that our Lord should be baptized? That no one might ever think himself at liberty to despise baptism.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed cuius gratia usque tunc baptizabat? Si enim cessasset, aestimaretur zelo vel ira facere; sed persistens, non sibi ipsi gloriam acquirebat, sed Christo auditores mittebat. Et multo efficacius hoc faciebat quam discipuli Christi, quia insuspicabile eius erat testimonium, et maiorem gloriam apud omnes habebat; ideo etiam adhuc baptizabat, ne discipulos suos in ampliorem zelum immitteret. Aestimo autem et propter hoc permissam esse mortem Ioannis, et eo sublato de medio, Iesum maxime praedicare coepisse, ut omnis multitudinis affectio ad Christum transiret, et non ultra his quae de utroque erant sententiis scinderetur. Zelotype enim se habentes discipuli Ioannis ad Christi discipulos et ad ipsum Christum, quia viderunt discipulos Christi baptizantes, coeperunt dicere ad eos qui baptizabantur, quasi aliquid maius haberet Baptisma Ioannis Baptismate discipulorum Christi; unde subditur facta est ergo quaestio ex discipulis Ioannis cum Iudaeis de purificatione. Quoniam enim ipsi quaestionem moverunt, sed non Iudaei, Evangelista occulte monstrat, non dicens quod Iudaeus quaesivit, sed quod quaestio facta est ex discipulis Ioannis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>, But why did he go on baptizing now? Because, had he left off, it might have been attributed to envy or anger: whereas, continuing to baptize, he got no glory for himself, but sent hearers to Christ. And he was better able to do this service, than were Christ’s own disciples; his testimony being so free from suspicion, and his reputation with the people so much higher than theirs. He therefore continued to baptize, that he might not increase the envy felt by his disciples against our Lord’s baptism. Indeed, the reason, I think, why John’s death was permitted, and, in his room, Christ made the great preacher, was, that the people might transfer their affections wholly to Christ, and no longer be divided between the two. For the disciples of John did become so envious of Christ’s disciples, and even of Christ Himself, that when they saw the latter baptizing, they threw contempt upon their baptism, as being inferior to that of John’s; And there arose a question from some of John’s disciples with the Jews about purifying. That it was they who began the dispute, and not the Jews, the Evangelist implies by saying, that there arose a question from John’s disciples, whereas he might have said, The Jews put forth a question.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Intelligas ergo dixisse Iudaeos maiorem esse Christum, et ad eius Baptisma debere concurri; illi autem nondum intelligentes defendebant Baptismum Ioannis. Ventum est ergo ad ipsum Ioannem, ut solveret quaestionem; unde sequitur et venerunt ad Ioannem, et dixerunt ei: Rabbi, qui erat tecum trans Iordanem (...) ecce baptizat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Jews then asserted Christ to be the greater person, and His baptism necessary to be received. But John’s disciples did not understand so much, and defended John’s baptism. At last they come to John, to solve the question: And they came unto John, and said to him, Rabbi, He that was with you beyond Jordan, behold, the Same baptizes.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc est: quem tu baptizasti. Non autem dixerunt: quem tu baptizasti: quia coacti essent et vocis eius meminisse quae super eum est delata; sed dicunt qui erat tecum, quasi qui discipuli ordinem habebat, nihil plus habens nobis, nunc se a te separans baptizat. Addunt autem cui etiam testimonium perhibuisti; quasi dicant: quem tu clarum ostendisti, et circumspectum fecisti, eadem tibi audet: et hoc est quod dicunt ecce hic baptizat. Non autem in hoc solum aestimabant se excitare eum, sed et in eo quod de reliquo ea quae ipsorum erant reprobabantur; unde subdunt et omnes veniunt ad eum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Meaning, He, Whom you baptized, baptizes. They did not say expressly, Whom you baptized, for they did not wish to be reminded of the voice from heaven, but, He Who was with you, i.e. Who was in the situation of a disciple, who was nothing more than any of us, He now separates Himself from you, and baptizes. They add, To Whom you bare witness; as if to say, Whom you showed to the world, Whom you made renowned, He now dares to do as you do. Behold, the Same baptizes. And in addition to this, they urge the probability that John’s doctrines would fall into discredit. All men come to Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Quasi dicant: te dimisso omnes currunt ad Baptismum illius quem tu baptizasti.

Humana enim facile deprehensibilia sunt, et imbecillia, et velociter defluunt; haec autem non talia sunt: non ergo sunt humanitus adinventa, sed divinitus ordinata. Si autem humilius loquitur de Christo, non mireris: non enim erat conveniens quod praeassumptos a tali passione, scilicet invidiae, ab initio doceret omnia; sed interim vult eos terrere, ostendens quod ad impossibilia conantur, et quod Deo rebelles inveniuntur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. John, on this question being raised, does not rebuke his disciples, for fear they might separate, and turn to some other school, but replies gently, John answered and said, A man can receive nothing, except it be given him from heaven; as if he said, No wonder that Christ does such excellent works, and that all men come to Him; when He Who does it all is God. Human efforts are easily seen through, are feeble, and short-lived. These are not such: they are not therefore of human, but of divine originating. He seems however to speak somewhat humbly of Christ, which will not surprise us, when we consider that it was not fitting to tell the whole truth, to minds prepossessed with such a passion as envy. He only tries for the present to alarm them, by showing that they are attempting impossible things, and fighting against God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Hoc Ioannes de seipso dicit: quasi homo de caelo accepi: ergo quia accepi ut aliquid essem, inanem me vultis esse, ut loquar contra veritatem?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or perhaps John is speaking here of himself: I am a mere man, and have received all from heaven, and therefore think not that, because it has been given me to be somewhat, I am so foolish as to spear: against the truth.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And see; the very argument by which they thought to have overthrown Christ, To whom you bare witness, he turns against them; You yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ; as if he said, If you think my witness true, you must acknowledge Him more worthy of honor shall myself. He adds, But that I was sent before Him; that is to say, I am a servant, and perform the commission of the Father which sent me; my witness is not from favor or partiality; I say that which was given me to say.

Sponsam dicit Ecclesiam ex omnibus gentibus congregatam, quae virgo est integritate mentis, perfectione caritatis, unitate Catholicae fidei, concordia pacis, integritate animae et corporis; quae habet sponsum, de quo quotidie generat.

John replies, He is the Bridegroom; I am the friend of the Bridegroom, sent to prepare the Bride for His approach: He that has the Bride, is the Bridegroom. By the Bride he means the Church, gathered from amongst all nations; a Virgin in purity of heart, in perfection of love, in the bond of peace, in chastity of mind and body; in the unity of the Catholic faith; [the Church has Christ as its spouse, from whom it bears children every day.]

Christ is the spouse of every soul; the wedlock, wherein they are joined, is baptism; the place of that wedlock is the Church; the pledge of it, remission of sins, and the fellowship of the Holy Ghost; the consummation, eternal life; which those who are worthy shall receive. Christ alone is the Bridegroom: all other teachers are but the friends of the Bridegroom, as was the forerunner. The Lord is the giver of good; the rest are the despisers of His gifts.

Simul autem et condescendens eorum imbecillitati amicum se dicit: quia enim aestimabant eum morderi ab his quae fiebant, ostendit quod non solum non mordetur, sed et valde gaudet, si sponsum sponsa cognoscit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But how does he who said above, Whose shoe’s latchet I am not worthy to unloose, call himself a friend? As an expression not of equality, but of excess of joy: (for the friend of the Bridegroom is always more rejoiced than the servant,) and also, as a condescension to the weakness of his disciples, who thought that he was pained at Christ’s ascendancy. For he hereby assures them, that so far from being pained, he was right glad that the Bride recognized her Spouse.

Non, inquit, gaudeo propter vocem meam, sed propter vocem sponsi gaudeo: ego in audiendo, ille in dicendo; ego auris, ille verbum. Qui enim custodit sponsam vel uxorem amici sui dat quidem operam ut nullus alius ametur; sed si amari se pro amico voluerit, et uti voluerit commendata sibi, quam detestandus universo generi humano apparet?

Again; He stands, and hears Him. So then if he fails, he hears Him not. Therefore the friend of the Bridegroom ought to stand and hear, i.e. to abide in the grace which he has received, and to hear the voice in which he rejoices. I rejoice not, he said, because of my own voice, but because of the Bridegroom’s voice. I rejoice; I in hearing, He in speaking; I am the ear, He the Word. For he who guards the bride or wife of his friend, takes care that she love none else; if he wish to be loved himself in the stead of his friend, and to enjoy her who was entrusted to him, how detestable does he appear to the whole world? Yet many are the adulterers I see, who would fain possess themselves of the spouse who was bought at so great a price, and who aim by their words at being loved themselves instead of the Bridegroom.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Quod dicit qui stat, non sine causa posuit; sed indicans quod quae sua sunt, iam cessaverunt, et quoniam eum de reliquo stare oportet et audire: quod quidem dicit, a parabola sermonem transferens ad propositum: quia enim sponsi et sponsae mentionem fecerat, ostendit qualiter haec sponsalia fiant, quia per vocem et doctrinam: fides enim est ex auditu; auditus autem per verbum Dei. Et quoniam ea quae speraverat evenerunt, idcirco subdit in hoc autem gaudium meum impletum est; idest, perfectum est a me opus quod fieri oportebat, et plus nihil operari possum de reliquo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus; The expression, which stands, is not without meaning, but indicates that his part is now over, and that for the future he must stand and listen. This is a transition from the parable to the real subject. For having introduced the figure of a bride and bridegroom, he shows how the marriage is consummated; viz. by word and doctrine. Faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God. And since the things he had hoped for had come to pass, he adds, This my Joy therefore is fulfilled; i.e. The work which I had to do is finished, and nothing more is left, that I can do.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Unde nunc gaudeo, quod scilicet omnes illum attendunt. Si enim non accessisset ad sponsum sponsa, idest populus, tunc dolerem ego paranymphus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. For which cause I rejoice now, that all men follow Him. For had the bride, i.e. the people, not come forth to meet the Bridegroom, then I, as the friend of the Bridegroom, should have grieved.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. In hoc gaudium meum impletum est, ut scilicet gaudeam ad vocem sponsi. Habeo gratiam meam; plus non mihi assumo, ne quod accepi amittam. Qui enim vult gaudere de se, tristis est; qui autem vult de Deo gaudere, semper gaudebit, quia Deus sempiternus est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus; This my joy is fulfilled, i.e. my joy at hearing the Bridegroom’s voice. I have my gift; I claim no more, lest I lose that which I have received. He who would rejoice in himself, has sorrow; but he who would rejoice in the Lord, shall ever rejoice, because God is everlasting.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Gaudio autem gaudet homo propter vocem sponsi, cum intelligit non se debere gaudere de sapientia sua, sed de sapientia quam accepit a domino. Quisquis enim in benefactis non gloriam suam vel laudem requirit, neque terrena lucra sed caelestia cupit, hic amicus est sponsi.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>; He rejoices at hearing the Bridegroom’s voice, who knows that he should not rejoice in his own wisdom, but in the wisdom which God gives him. Whoever in his good works seeks not his own glory, or praise, or earthly gain, but has his affections set on heavenly things; this man is the friend of the Bridegroom.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Deinde non solum circa praesentia, sed etiam circa futura passionem invidiae a se removit, dicens illum oportet crescere, me autem minui; quasi dicat: quae nostra sunt, steterunt, et cessaverunt de reliquo; crescunt autem quae sunt illius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He next dismisses the motions of envy, not only as regards the present, but also the future, saying, He must increase, but I must decrease: as if he said, My office has ceased, and is ended; but His advances.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed quid est hoc illum oportet crescere? Deus nec crescit, nec minuitur. Sed Ioannes et Iesus, quod ad carnem attinet, coaevi erant: sex menses, qui intererant, nullam distinguunt aetatem. Magnum est hoc sacramentum. Antequam veniret dominus, homines gloriabantur de se: venit ille homo, ut minueretur hominis gloria et augeretur gloria Dei. Sic enim venit ille ut dimitteret peccata, et homo confiteretur: etenim confessio hominis, humilitas hominis, miseratio Dei, altitudo Dei. Hanc autem veritatem etiam passionibus significaverunt Christus et Ioannes: nam Ioannes capite minutus est, Christus autem in cruce exaltatus. Deinde natus est Christus, cum iam inciperent crescere dies; natus est Ioannes quando coeperant minui dies. Crescat ergo in nobis gloria Dei, et minuatur gloria nostra, ut in Deo crescat et nostra. Quanto autem magis intelligis Deum, videtur in te crescere Deus; non autem in se crescit, sed semper perfectus est: sicut si curarentur alicuius oculi ex pristina caecitate, et inciperet videre paululum lucis, et alia die plus videret, videretur ei lux crescere; lux tamen perfecta est, sive ipse videat, sive non: sic enim et interior homo proficit quidem in Deo, et Deus in illo videtur crescere; ipse autem minuitur, ut a gloria sua decidat, et in gloria Dei surgat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What means this, He must increase? God neither increases, nor decreases. And John and Jesus, according to the flesh, were of the same age: for the six months’ difference between them is of no consequence. This is a great mystery. Before our Lord came, men gloried in themselves; He came in no man’s nature, that the glory of man might be diminished, and the glory of God exalted. For He came to remit sins upon man’s confession: a man’s confession, a man’s humility, is God’s pity, God’s exaltation. This truth Christ and John proved, even by their modes of suffering: John was beheaded, Christ was lifted up on the cross. Then Christ was born, when the days begin to lengthen; John, when they begin to shorten. Let God’s glory then increase in us, and our own decrease, that ours also may increase in God. But it is because you understand God more and more, that He seems to increase in you: for in His own nature He increases not, but is ever perfect: even as to a man cured of blindness, who begins to see a little, and daily sees more, the light seems to increase, whereas it is in reality always at the fall, whether he sees it or not. In like manner the inner man makes advancement in God, and it seems as if God were increasing in Him; but it is He Himself that decreases, falling from the height of His own glory, and rising in the glory of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel aliter. Sicut aliorum luminarium, adveniente sole, lumen extingui videtur, licet non sit secundum veritatem extinctum, sed a maiori occultatum; sic et praecursor tamquam stella a sole celatus, minui dicitur. Crescit autem Christus prout paulatim manifestat se per miracula: non quod in virtutibus cresceret aut proficeret (haec nempe Nestorii est opinio), sed secundum ostensionem divinitatis eius.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or thus; As, on the sun rising, the light of the other heavenly bodies seems to be extinguished, though in reality it is only obscured by the greater light: thus the forerunner is said to decrease; as if he were a star hidden by the sun. Christ increases in proportion as he gradually discloses Himself by miracles; not in the sense of increase, or advancement in virtue, (the opinion of Nestorius,) but only as regards the manifestation of His divinity.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As the worm gnaws wood, and rusts iron, so vainglory destroys the soul that cherishes it. But it is a most obstinate fault. John with all his arguments can hardly subdue it in his disciples: for after what he has said above, he said yet again, He that comes from above is above all: meaning, You extol my testimony, and say that the witness is more worthy to be believed, than He to whom he bears witness. Know this, that He who comes from heaven, cannot be accredited by an earthly witness. He is above all; being perfect in Himself, and above comparison.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ipse enim Christus desursum venit a patre descendens, et super omnes est, distinctus ab omnibus.

Sequitur qui est de terra, de terra est, idest terrenus est, et de terra loquitur, idest terrena loquitur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or, comes from above; i.e. from the height of that human nature which was before the sin of the first man. For it was that human nature which the Word of God assumed: He did not take upon Him man’s sin, as He did his punishment. He that is of the earth is of the earth; i.e. is earthly, and speaks of the earth, speaks earthly things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et nimirum non ex terra erant ei omnia: etenim animam habebat, et spiritum participabat non ex terra. Qualiter igitur ipse de terra se esse dicit? Nihil aliud per hoc ostendit occulte quam quod parvus est, utpote humi reptans, et in terra natus, et nulla comparatione dignus ad Christum, qui nobis desuper venit. Non autem dicit de terra loquitur, quoniam ex propria mente loquebatur; sed de terra se loqui dicit in comparatione ad Christi doctrinam; quasi dicat: parva et humilia sunt quae mea sunt, comparata his quae Christi sunt, qualia decens est suscipere terrestrem naturam in comparatione ad illum in quo sunt omnes thesauri sapientiae et scientiae Dei absconditi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And yet he was not altogether of the earth; for he had a soul, and partook of a spirit, which was not of the earth. What means he then by saying that he is of the earth? Only to express his own worthlessness, that he is one born on the earth, creeping on the ground, and not to be compared with Christ, Who comes from above. Speaks of the earth, does not mean that he spoke from his own understanding; but that, in comparison with Christ’s doctrine, he spoke of the earth: as if he said, My doctrine is mean and humble, compared with Christ’s; as becomes an earthly teacher, compared with Him, in Whom are hid all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel quod dicit de terra loquitur, de homine dicebat quantum ad ipsum hominem pertinet. Si enim aliqua loquitur divina, illuminatus est a Deo; sicut apostolus dicit: non autem ego, sed gratia Dei mecum. Ergo Ioannes, et quod ad Ioannem pertinet, de terra est, et de terra loquitur: si quid divinum audivistis a Ioanne, illuminantis est, non recipientis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, speaks of all the earth, he said of the man, i.e. of himself, so far as he speaks merely humanly. If he says ought divine, he is enlightened by God to say it: as said the Apostle; Yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me. John then, so far as pertains to John, is of the earth, and speaks of the earth: if you hear ought divine from him, attribute it to the Enlightener, not to him who has received the light.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Extincta igitur discipulorum passione, de reliquo cum ampliori propalatione loquitur de Christo: nam ante hoc superfluum erat ista praemittere, in mente audientium locum habere nondum valentia; unde sequitur qui de caelo venit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Having corrected the bad feeling of his disciples, he comes to discourse more deeply upon Christ. Before this it would have been useless to reveal the truths which could not yet gain a place in their minds. It follows therefore, He that comes from heaven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Idest, de patre venit, duobus modis super omnes est: primo super omnem humanitatem, qui de ipsa, priusquam peccaret, venit: secundo iuxta altitudinem patris, cui est aequalis.
          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. That is, from the Father. He is above all in two ways; first, in respect of His humanity, which was that of man before he sinned: secondly, in respect of the loftiness of the Father, to whom He is equal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Magnum autem quid et excelsum dicens de Christo, rursus ad humilius ducit sermonem, dicens et quod vidit et audivit, hoc testatur. Quia scilicet per sensus hos omnia certissime discimus, et digni fide aestimamur esse magistri de his quae visu suscepimus, vel auditu apprehendimus; hoc de Christo astruere volens Ioannes dixit quod vidit et audivit, hoc testatur: ostendens, quod nihil eorum quae ab ipso dicebantur, falsum est, sed omnia vera sunt; quasi dicat: ego indigeo audire ea quae ab illo dicuntur qui desuper venit, annuntians ea quae vidit et audivit; idest, quae solus ipse manifeste novit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But after this, high and solemn mention of Christ, his tone lowers: And what he has seen and heard, that he testifies. As our senses are our surest channels of knowledge, and teachers are most depended on who have apprehended by sight or hearing what they teach, John adds this argument in favor of Christ, that, what he has seen and heard, that he testifies: meaning that every thing which He said is true. I want, said John, to hear what things He, Who comes from above, has seen and heard, i.e. what He, and He alone, knows with certainty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cum ergo audis quod Christus ea quae audivit et vidit a patre, loquitur, non putes quod a patre indigeat addiscere; sed quia omnia quaecumque naturaliter novit, a patre habet, propter hoc a patre audire dicitur, quaecumque novit. Sed quid est quod filius audivit a patre? Forte filius, patris verbum audivit? Immo filius patris verbum est.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. When you hear then, that Christ speaks what He saw and heard from the Father, do not suppose that He needs to be taught by the Father; but only that that knowledge, which He has naturally, is from the Father. For this reason He is said to have heard, whatever He knows, from the Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quando concipis verbum quod proferas, rem vis dicere, et ipsa rei conceptio in corde tuo iam verbum est. Quomodo ergo tu verbum quod loqueris, in corde habes, et apud te est, sic Deus edidit verbum; hoc est, genuit filium. Cum ergo verbum Dei filius sit, filius autem locutus est nobis, non verbum suum, sed verbum patris se nobis loqui voluit, qui verbum patris loquebatur. Hoc ergo quomodo decuit et oportuit, dixit Ioannes.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what is it, w which the Son has heard from the Father? Has He heard the word of the Father? Yes, but He is the Word of the Father. When you conceives a word, wherewith to name a thing, the very, conception of that thing in the mind is a word. Just then as you have in your mind and with you your spoken word; even so God uttered the Word, i.e. begat the Son. Since then the Son is the Word of God, and the Son has spoken the Word of God to us, He has spoken to us the Father’s word. What John said is therefore true.

Mark how mankind are divided spiritually, though as human beings they are mixed up together: and John separated them by the thoughts of their heart, though as yet they were not divided in respect of place, and looked on them as two classes, the unbelievers, and the believers. Looking to the unbelievers, he said, No man receives his testimony. Then turning to those on the right hand he said, He that has received his testimony, has set to his seal.

Christ then Himself is God the true, and God has sent Him; God has sent God, join both together; they are One God. For John said, Whom God has sent, to distinguish Christ from himself. What then, was not John himself sent by God? Yes; but mark what follows, For God gives not the Spirit by measure to Him. To men He gives by measure, to His only Son He gives not by measure. To one man is given by the Spirit the word of wisdom, to another the word of knowledge: one has one thing, another another; for measure implies a kind of division of gifts.

Having said of the Son, God gives not the Spirit by measure to Him; he adds, The Father loves the Son, and farther adds, and has given all things into His hand; in order to show that the Father loves the Son, in a peculiar sense. For the Father loves John, and Paul, and yet has not given all things into their hands. But the Father loves the Son, as the Son, not as a master his servant: as an only, not as an adopted, Son. Wherefore He has given all things into His hand; so that, as great as the Father is, so great is the Son; let us not think then that, because He has deigned to send the Son, any one inferior to the Father has been sent.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Sic ergo secundum divinitatem omnia dedit pater filio natura, non gratia. Vel dedit omnia in manu eius, secundum humanitatem; dominatur enim omnium eorum et quae in caelo et quae in terra sunt.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Father then has given all things to the Son in respect of His divinity; of right, not of grace. Or; He has given all things into His hand, in respect of His humanity: inasmuch as He is made Lord of all things that are in heaven, and that are in earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Et quia omnia sunt in manu eius, ergo et vita aeterna; unde subdit qui credit in filium, habet vitam aeternam.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. And because all things are in His hand, the life everlasting is too: and therefore it follows, He that believes on the Son has everlasting life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Non debet hic intelligi fides quae verbo tenus tenetur, sed quae operibus adimpletur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. We must understand here not a faith in words only, but a faith which is developed in works.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non enim hic dicit quod credere in filium sufficiat ad vitam habendam perpetuam, cum ipse alibi dicat: non omnis qui dicit mihi: domine, domine, intrabit in regnum caelorum. Sed et quae in spiritum est blasphemia, sufficit sola mittere in Gehennam. Sed etsi in patrem et filium et spiritum sanctum quis recte crediderit, ne aestimemus sufficere ad salutem: opus est enim nobis vita et conversatione recta. Deinde sciens non ita promissione bonorum multos adduci ut terribilium minis, in hoc sermonem concludit, dicens qui autem incredulus est filio, non videbit vitam, sed ira Dei manet super eum. Vide qualiter hic ad patrem reducit eum qui est supplicii sermonem: non enim dixit: ita filii, quamvis ipse sit iudex, sed patrem iudicem instituit, magis terrere volens. Et non dicit manebit in eo, sed super eum, ostendens quoniam nunquam ab eo desistet: ut enim non aestimet quis mortem esse temporaneam, dixit non videbit vitam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He means not here, that to believe on the Son is sufficient to gain everlasting life, for elsewhere He says, Nor every one that said to Me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven. And the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost is of itself sufficient to send into hell. But we must not think that even a right belief in Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is sufficient for salvation; for we have need of a good life and conversation. Knowing then that the greater part are not moved so much by the promise of good, as by the threat of punishment, he concludes, But He that believes not the Son, shall not see life; but the wrath of God abides on him. See how He refers to the Father again, when He speaks of punishment. He said not, the wrath of the Son, though the Son is judge; but makes the Father the judge, in order to alarm men more. And He does not say, in Him, but on Him, meaning that it Will never depart from Him; and for the same reason He says, shall not see life, i.e. to show that He did not mean only a temporary death!
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Et non dixit ira Dei venit ad eum, sed manet super eum; quia omnes qui nascuntur mortales, habent secum iram Dei, quam accepit primus Adam. Venit filius Dei, non habens peccatum, et indutus est mortalitate: mortuus est ut vivas. Qui ergo non vult credere in filium, ira Dei manet super eum, de qua dicit apostolus: eramus natura filii irae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nor does He say, The wrath of God comes to him, but, abides on him. For all who are born, are under the wrath of God, which the first Adam incurred. The Son of God came without sin, and was clothed with mortality: He died that you might live. Whosoever then will not believe on the Son, on him abides the wrath of God, of which the Apostle speaks, We were by nature the children of wrath.

          <td><b>Glossa</b>: Postquam ostendit Evangelista qualiter Ioannes repressit discipulorum suorum invidiam, quam de profectu doctrinae Christi conceperant; hic ostendit quomodo Christus declinavit Pharisaeorum malitiam, qui contra ipsum ex eadem causa zelo invidiae movebantur; unde dicitur ut ergo cognovit Iesus quia audierunt Pharisaei.
          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. The Evangelist, after relating how John checked the envy of his disciples, on the success of Christ’s teaching, comes next to the envy of the Pharisees, and Christ’s retreat front the them. When therefore the Lord knew that the Pharisees had heard, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Utique dominus, si sciret Pharisaeos ita de se cognovisse quod plures discipulos faceret, et quod plures baptizaret, ut eis hoc ad salutem valeret sequendi eum, non relinqueret Iudaeam terram, sed propter illos maneret ibi; quia vero cognovit eorum scientiam, simul et invidentiam, quia non hoc propterea didicerunt ut sequerentur, sed ut persequerentur, abiit inde. Poterat quidem et praesens ab his non teneri, si nollet; sed in omni re quam gessit ut homo, hominibus in se credituris praebebat exemplum, quia unusquisque servus Dei non peccat si secesserit in alium locum videns furorem se persequentium. Fecit ergo hoc ille magister bonus, ut doceret, non ut timeret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Truly had the Pharisees’ knowledge that our Lord was making more disciples, and baptizing more than John, been such as to lead them heartily to follow Him, He would not have left Judea, but would have remained for their sake: but seeing, as He did, that this knowledge of Him was coupled with envy, and made them not followers, but persecutors, He departed thence. He could too, had He pleased, have stayed amongst them, and escaped their hands; but He wished to show His own example to believers in time to come, that it was no sin for a servant of God to fly from the fury of persecutors. He did it like a good teacher, not out of fear for Himself, but for our instruction.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc etiam fecit mitigans eorum invidiam. Conveniens est etiam eum hoc fecisse, ut non discrederetur carnis dispensatio: si enim retentus effugisset, in suspicionem devenisset veritas carnis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did it too to pacify the envy of men, and perhaps to avoid bringing the dispensation of the incarnation into suspicion. For had he been taken and escaped, the reality of His flesh would have been doubted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Fortassis autem hoc moveat quod dictum est baptizabat plures quam Ioannes; et postea subiectum est quamquam Iesus non baptizaret. Quid ergo? Falsum dictum erat, et correctum est?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It may perplex you, perhaps, to be told that Jesus baptized more than John, and then immediately after, Though Jesus Himself baptized not. What? Is there a mistake made, and then corrected?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem ipse Christus baptizabat; sed relatores volentes erigere eos qui audiebant, in invidiam, ita annuntiabant, scilicet quod Christus plures baptizaret quam Ioannes. Sed cuius gratia ipse non baptizaret, Ioannes praedixit dicens: ipse vos baptizabit in spiritu sancto et igne. Nondum autem spiritum sanctum dabat: decenter igitur nec baptizabat. Discipuli vero id agebant, volentes multos adducere ad salutarem doctrinam: ut enim non semper circumeuntes congregarent eos qui credituri erant, ut in Simone et fratre fecit, ideo baptizare instituerunt. Nihil enim amplius habebat discipulorum Baptisma, Ioannis Baptismate: utrumque enim expers erat ea quae ex spiritu est gratia; et utrique una causa erat, scilicet adducere ad Christum eos qui baptizabantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ Himself did not baptize, but those who reported the fact, in order to raise the envy of their hearers, so represented it as to appear that Christ Himself baptized. The reason why He baptized not Himself, had been already declared by John, He shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost and with fire. Now He had not yet given the Holy Spirit: it was therefore fitting that He should not baptize. But His disciples baptized, as an efficacious mode of instruction; better than gathering up believers here and there, as had been done in the case of Simon and his brother. Their baptism, however, had no more virtue than the baptism of John; both being without the grace of the Spirit, and both having one object, viz. that of bringing men to Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Utrumque verum est: quia Iesus et baptizabat et non baptizabat: baptizabat enim, quia ipse mundabat; non baptizabat, quia non ipse tingebat. Praebebant discipuli ministerium corporis; praebebat ille adiutorium maiestatis, de quo dictum est: hic est qui baptizat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, both are true; for Jesus both baptized, and baptized not. He baptized, in that He cleansed: He baptized not, in that He dipped not. The disciples supplied the ministry of the body, He the aid of that Majesty of which it was said, The Same is, He which baptize.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Solet autem quaeri si in Baptismo discipulorum Christi spiritus sanctus daretur, cum dicatur: spiritus sanctus nondum erat datus, quia Iesus nondum erat glorificatus. Sed sciendum, quia dabatur spiritus, licet non ea manifestatione qua post ascensionem in linguis igneis datus est; quia sicut ipse Christus in homine quem ferebat, semper habebat spiritum, sed tamen postea super ipsum baptizatum visibiliter descendit spiritus in specie columbae; sic ante manifestum et visibilem adventum spiritus sancti quicumque sancti eum latenter habere potuerunt.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The question is often asked, whether the Holy Ghost was given by the baptism of the disciples; when below it is said, The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because Jesus was not yet glorified. We reply, that the Spirit was given, though not in so manifest a way as he was after the Ascension, in the shape of fiery tongues. For, as Christ Himself in His human nature ever possessed the Spirit, and yet afterwards at His baptism the Spirit descended visibly upon Him in the form of a dove; so before the manifest and visible coming of the Holy Spirit, all saints might possess the Spirit secretly.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus ad Seleucianum</b> Intelligimus autem discipulos Christi iam fuisse baptizatos sive Baptismo Ioannis, sicut nonnulli arbitrantur, sive, quod magis credibile est, Baptismo Christi: neque enim ministerio baptizandi defuit, ut haberet baptizatos servos per quos ceteros baptizaret, qui non defuit illius humilitatis ministerio, quando eis lavit pedes.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But we must believe that the disciples of Christ were already baptized themselves, either with John’s baptism, or, as is more probable, with Christ’s. For He who had stooped to the humble service of washing His disciples’ feet, had not failed to administer baptism to His servants, who would thus be enabled in their turn to baptize others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Secedens autem Christus de Iudaea, rursus eisdem adhaeret quibus et prius; unde subditur et abiit iterum in Galilaeam. Sicut autem apostoli expulsi a Iudaeis ad gentes venerunt, ita et Christus ad Samaritanos accedit; sed tamen omnem auferens a Iudaeis excusationem, non principaliter ad eos vadit, sed quasi transiens; quod Evangelista occulte ostendit, dicens oportebat autem eum transire per mediam Samariam. Accepit autem hanc nominationem, quia mons Samariae Somer dicebatur, ab eo qui possedit; sed qui ibi habitabant, olim non Samaritani, sed Israelitae vocabantur. Tempore autem procedente offenderunt Deum, et rex Assyriorum ultra eos ibi manere non permisit; sed in Babylonem et Medos duxit; in Samaria vero gentes ex diversis locis ductas habitare fecit. Volens autem Deus ostendere quod non propter imbecillitatem Iudaeos tradidit, sed propter peccata eorum qui traditi sunt; immisit barbaris leones, qui eos laedebant. Annuntiata sunt haec regi, et mittit sacerdotem quemdam, traditurum eis Dei leges. Sed tamen neque ita ex toto ab impietate destiterunt, sed ex media parte. Etenim tempore procedente rursus ad idola quidam resilierunt; venerabantur tamen Deum qui a monte Samaritanos seipsos vocabant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ on withdrawing from Judea, joined those whom He was with before, as we react next, And departed again into Galilee. As the Apostles, when they were expelled by the Jews, went to the Gentiles, so Christ goes to the Samaritans. But, to deprive the Jews of all excuse, He does not go to stay there, but only takes it on His road, as the Evangelist implies by saying, And he must needs go through Samaria. Samaria receives its name from Somer, a mountain there, so called from the name of a former possessor of it. The inhabitants of the country were formerly not Samaritans, but Israelites. But in process of time they fell under God’s wrath, and the king of Assyria transplanted them to Babylon and Media; placing Gentiles from various parts in Samaria in their room. God however, to show that it was not for want of power on His part that he delivered up the Jews, but for the sins of the people themselves, sent lions to afflict the barbarians. This was told the king, and he sent a priest to instruct them in God’s law. But not even then did they wholly cease from their iniquity, but only half changed. For in process of time they turned to idols again, though they still worshipped God, calling themselves after the mountain, Samaritans.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ideo autem oportebat ipsum transire per Samariam, quia sita est inter Iudaeam et Galilaeam. Est autem Samaria insignis provinciae Palaestinae civitas, adeo ut tota regio ei sociata Samaria dicatur. Ad quem igitur ipsius regionis locum dominus verterit, Evangelista ostendit; unde dicitur venit ergo in civitatem Samariae, quae dicitur Sichar.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. He must needs pass through Samaria; because that country lay between Judea and Galilee. Samaria was the principal city of a province of Palestine, and gave its name to the whole district connected with it. The particular place to which our Lord went is next given: Then comes He to a city of Samaria which is called Sychar.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Postquam autem filii Iacob illam civitatem desertam fecerunt, occidentes Sichimitas, hanc civitatem desertam tempore procedente dedit Iacob in sortem Ioseph; unde dicitur: do tibi partem unam extra fratres tuos, quam tuli de manu Amorrhaei, in gladio et arcu meo; et hoc est quod subditur iuxta praedium quod dedit Iacob Ioseph filio suo. Sequitur erat autem ibi fons Iacob.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But after the sons of Jacob had desolated the city, by the slaughter of the Sychemites, Jacob annexed it to the portion of his son Joseph as we read in Genesis, I have given to you one portion above your brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword, and with my bow. This is referred to in what follows, Near to the place of ground which Jacob gave to his son Joseph. Now Jacob’s well was there.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Puteus erat: sed omnis puteus fons, non omnis fons puteus: ubi enim aqua de terra manat, et usum praebet haurientibus, fons dicitur; sed si in promptu et superficie sit, fons tantum dicitur; si autem in alto et in profundo sit, ita puteus vocatur ut nomen fontis non amittat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It was a well. Every, well is a spring, but every spring is not a well. Any water that rises from the ground, and can be drawn for use, is a spring: but where it is ready at hand, and on the surface, it is called a spring only; where it is creep and low down, it is called a well, not a spring.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Locus ille erat ubi pro Dina, levi et Simeon gravem occisionem fecerunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It was the place where Simeon and Levi made a great slaughter for Dinah.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quare autem Evangelista de praedio et fonte facit mentionem? Primo quidem ut, cum audieris mulierem dicentem quod pater noster Iacob dedit nobis hunc fontem, non admireris; secundo ex commemoratione fontis et praedii edocemur quod ea quae patriarchae propter fidem quam in Deo habebant, adepti sunt, Iudaei propter eorum impietatem perdiderunt, et eorum loca gentibus tradita sunt: quare nihil novi nunc accidit quod gentiles pro Iudaeis regnum caelorum consecuti sunt.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But why does the Evangelist make mention of the parcel of ground, and the well? First, to explain what the woman says, Our father Jacob gave us this well; secondly, to remind you that what the Patriarchs obtained by their faith in God, the Jews had lost by their impiety. They had been supplanted to make room for Gentiles. And therefore there is nothing new in what has now taken place, i.e.; in the Gentiles succeeding to the kingdom of heaven in the place of the Jews.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Christus igitur in Samariam accedens, facilem et deliciosam vitam abiciens, laboriosam vero sequens, non subiugalibus utitur, sed ita difficulter incedit ut ex itinere fatigetur; erudiens nos ita a superfluis alienos esse ut multa necessaria abscindamus a nobis; et hoc Evangelista ostendit, dicens Iesus ergo fatigatus ex itinere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ prefers labor and exercise to ease and luxury, and therefore travels to Samaria, not in a carriage but on foot; until at last the exertion of the journey fatigues Him; a lesson to us, that so far from indulging in superfluities, we should often even deprive ourselves of necessaries: Jesus therefore being wearied with His journey, &amp;c.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Invenimus Iesum fortem et infirmum: fortem, quia in principio erat verbum; infirmum, quia verbum caro factum est. Sic ergo infirmus Iesus, ab itinere fatigatus, sedebat super fontem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Jesus, we see, is strong and weak: strong, because in the beginning was the Word; weak, because the Word was made flesh. Jesus thus weak, being wearied with his journey, sat on the well.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: non in throno aut pulvinari, sed simpliciter ut contingebat super terram. Sessio autem propter laborem facta est, et ut expectaret discipulos, et propter aestum refrigeraret corpus apud fontem; unde sequitur hora autem erat quasi sexta.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if to say, not on a seat, or a couch, but on the first place He saw - upon the ground. He sat down because He was wearied, and to wait for the disciples. The coolness of the well would be refreshing in the midday heat: And it was about the sixth hour.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He mentions our Lord’s sitting and resting from His journey, that none might blame Him for going to Samaria Himself, after He had forbidden the disciples going.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Mystice autem dominus reliquit Iudaeam, idest infidelitatem eorum qui eum reprobaverunt, et per apostolos abiit in Galilaeam, idest in volubilitatem huius mundi, docens suos transmigrare de vitiis ad virtutes. Praedium autem non tam Ioseph quam Christo arbitror derelictum, cuius figuram Ioseph portaverit; quem vere sol adorat et luna et omnes stellae. Ad hoc praedium venit dominus, ut Samaritani, qui hereditatem sibi patriarchae Israel vindicare cupiebant, agnoscerent, et converterentur ad Christum, qui est patriarchae legitimus heres factus.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Our Lord left Judea also mystically, i.e. He left the unbelief of those who condemned Him, and by His Apostles, went into Galilee, i.e. into the fickleness of the world; thus teaching His disciples to pass from vices to virtues. The parcel of ground I conceive to have been left not so much to Joseph, as to Christ, of whom Joseph was a type; whom the sun, and moon, and all the stars truly adore. To this parcel of ground our Lord came, that the Samaritans, who claimed to be inheritors of the Patriarch Israel, might recognize Him, and be converted to Christ, the legal heir of the Patriarch.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Iter autem ipsius est caro pro nobis assumpta: qui enim ubique est, quo it, nisi quia non ad nos veniret nisi formam visibilis carnis assumeret? Ideo fatigatus ab itinere, quid est aliud quam fatigatus in carne? Quare ergo hora sexta? Quia aetate saeculi sexta. Computa tamquam unam horam, unam aetatem ab Adam usque ad Noe; secundam a Noe usque ad Abraham; tertiam ab Abraham usque ad David; quartam a David usque ad transmigrationem Babylonis; quintam usque ad Baptismum Ioannis; inde sexta agitur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. His journey, is His assumption of the flesh for our sake. For whither does He go, Who is every where present? What is this, except that it was necessary for Him, in order to come to us, to take upon Him visibly a form of flesh? So then His being wearied with His Journey, what means it, but that He is wearied with the flesh? And wherefore is it the sixth hour? Because it is the sixth age of the world. Reckon severally as hours, the first age from Adam to Noah, the second from Noah to Abraham, the third from Abraham to David, the fourth from David to the carrying away into Babylon, the fifth from thence to the baptism of John; on this calculation the present age is the sixth hour.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus Lib. 83 quaest</b>: Hora igitur sexta venit ad puteum dominus noster. Video in puteo tenebrosam profunditatem. Admoneor ergo intelligere mundi huius infimas partes, idest terrenas, quo venit dominus Iesus hora sexta, idest sexta aetate generis humani, tamquam senectute veteris hominis, quo iubemur exui, ut induamur novo; nam sexta aetas senectus est: quoniam prima est infantia, secunda pueritia, tertia adolescentia, quarta iuventus, quinta grandaevitas. Hora etiam sexta venit dominus ad puteum, idest medio die; unde iam incipit sol iste visibilis declinare in occasum: quoniam nobis vocatis a Christo, visibilium delectatio minuitur, ut invisibilium amore homo interior recreatus ad interiorem lucem, quae numquam excidit, revertatur. Quod autem sedit, humilitatem significat: vel quoniam solent sedere doctores, magistri denuntiat personam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. At the sixth hour then our Lord comes to the well. The black abyss of the well, methinks, represents the lowest parts of this universe, i.e. the earth, to which Jesus came at the sixth hour, that is, in the sixth age of mankind, the old age, as it were, of the old man, which we are bidden to put off; that we may put on the new. For so do we reckon the different ages of man’s life: the first age is infancy, the second childhood, the third boyhood, the fourth youth, the fifth manhood, the sixth old age. Again, the sixth hour, being the middle of the day, the time at which the sun begins to descend, signifies that we, who are called by Christ, are to check our pleasure in visible things, that by the love of things invisible refreshing the inner man, we may be restored to the inward light which never fails. By His sitting is signified His humility, or perhaps His magisterial character; teachers being accustomed to sit.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Ne quis dicat quoniam adversatur suo praecepto, Samaritanis loquens, posuit Evangelista multas causas eius quae ad mulierem est locutionis: non enim ad hoc venit antecedenter, ut Samaritanis loqueretur: non tamen quia propter hoc non venit, advenientem ad se expellere oportebat; dicitur enim venit mulier de Samaria haurire aquam. Vide quod et mulierem ostendit propter aestum exeuntem ad aquam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That this conversation might not appear a violation of His own injunctions against talking to the Samaritans, the Evangelist explains how it arose; viz. for He did not come with the intention beforehand of talking with the woman, but only would not send the woman away, when she had come. There came a woman of Samaria to draw water. Observe, she comes quite by chance.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Haec autem mulier forma est Ecclesiae, non iustificatae, sed iam iustificandae. Pertinet autem ad imaginem rei, quod ab alienigenis venit: Samaritani enim alienigenae fuerunt, quamquam vicinas terras incolerent: ventura enim erat Ecclesia de gentibus, et aliena a genere Iudaeorum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The woman here is the type of the Church, not yet justified, but just about to be. And it is a part of the resemblance, that she comes from a foreign people. The Samaritans were foreigners, though they were neighbors and in like manner the Church was to come from the Gentiles, and to be alien from the Jewish race.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Congrue autem disputatio ad mulierem a siti sumpsit occasionem; sequitur enim dicit ei Iesus: da mihi bibere: quia secundum humanitatem sitiebat et propter laborem et propter aestum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The argument with the woman arises naturally from the occasion: Jesus says to her, Give me to drink. As man. the labor and heat He had undergone had made Him thirsty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus Lib. 83 quaest</b>: Sitiebat etiam Iesus mulieris illius fidem: eorum enim fidem sitit pro quibus sanguinem fudit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Jesus also thirsted after that woman’s faith? At He thirsts for their faith, for whom He shed His blood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Discimus autem domini non solum circa itinera validum robur, sed etiam circa cibaria negligentiam: non enim discipuli eius deferebant victualia; propter hoc enim subdit discipuli autem eius abierant in civitatem, ut cibos emerent. Hinc etiam Evangelista ostendit Christum humilem in eo quod solus relinquebatur. Et nimirum poterat, si vellet, aut non omnes emittere, aut abeuntibus illis alios ministros habere; sed noluit: etenim ita discipulos assuefecit omnem superbiam conculcare. Sed fortasse dicet aliquis: quid magnum est si humiles erant discipuli, piscatores existentes et tabernaculorum factores? Sed repente facti sunt omnibus regibus reverentiores, collocutores et secutores domini orbis terrarum. Maxime autem qui ex humilibus sunt, quando dignitates quandoque assumpserint, facilius ad superbiam elevantur, velut inexperte se habentes ad tantum honorem. Detinens igitur discipulos dominus in eadem humilitate erudiebat eos ut per omnia se restringerent. Mulier ergo audiens da mihi bibere, valde sapienter ad formandam interrogationem eum qui a Christo accepit sermonem; unde sequitur dicit ergo illi mulier: quomodo tu cum Iudaeus sis, a me bibere poscis, quae sum mulier Samaritana? Iudaeum quidem eum esse aestimavit a figura et a locutione. Intuere vero qualiter mulier inquisitiva erat. Etsi enim oportebat custodire Iesum, ut non couteretur illi; non tamen oportebat illam custodire. Non enim dixit Evangelista quod Samaritani Iudaeis non couterentur, sed subdit non enim coutuntur Iudaei Samaritani. Iudaei igitur a captivitate revertentes zelotype se ad Samaritanos habebant, sicut ad alienigenas et impugnatores. Neque etiam Scripturis omnibus utebantur: solum enim ea quae Moysi sunt suspicientes, prophetarum non multam curam habebant. Contendebant etiam se in nobilitatem Iudaicam immittere: unde et Iudaei eos cum omnibus gentibus abominabantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This shows us too not only our Lord’s strength and endurance as a traveler, but also his carelessness about food; for his disciples did not carry about food with them, since it follows, His disciples were gone away into the city to buy food. Herein is shown the humility of Christ; He is left alone. It was in His power, had He pleased, not to send away all, or, on their going away, to leave others in their place to wait on Him. But He did not choose to have it so: for in this way He accustomed His disciples to trample upon pride of every kind. However some one will say, Is humility in fisherman and tent-makers so great a matter? But these very men were all on a sudden raised to the most lofty situation upon earth, that of friends and followers of the Lord of the whole earth. And men of humble origin, when they arrive at dignity, are on this very cry account more liable than others to be lifted up with pride; the honor being so new to them. Our Lord therefore to keep His disciples humble, taught them in all things to subdue themselves. The woman on being told, Give Me to drink, very naturally asks, How is it that You, being a Jew, asks drink of me, who am a woman of Samaria? She knew Him to be a Jew from His figure and speech. Here observe her simpleness. For even had our Lord been bound to abstain from dealing with her, that was His concern, not hers; the Evangelist saying not that the Samaritans would have no dealings with the Jews, but that the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. The woman however, though not in fault herself, wished to correct what she thought a fault in another. The Jews after their return from the captivity entertained a jealousy of the Samaritans, whom they regarded as aliens, and enemies; and the Samaritans did not use all the Scriptures, but only the writings of Moses, and made little of the Prophets. They claimed to be of Jewish origin, but the Jews considered them Gentiles, and hated them, as they did the rest of the Gentile world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Et omnino eorum vasculis non utebantur Iudaei. Et quia ferebat secum mulier vasculum, unde aquam hauriret, eo mirata est, quia Iudaeus petebat ab ea bibere, quod non solebant facere Iudaei.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Jews would not even use their vessels. So it would astonish the woman to hear a Jew ask to drink out of her vessel; a thing so contrary to Jewish rule.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed qualiter Christus quaesivit ab ea bibere, lege non concedente? Si autem quis dixerit, quia praesciebat eam non daturam; immo propter hoc neque petere oportebat. Est igitur dicendum, quod ideo petiit, quia indifferens erat de reliquo tales observantias praeterire.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why did Christ ask what the law allowed not? It is no answer to say that He knew she would not give it, for in that case, He clearly ought not to have asked for it. Rather His very reason for asking, was to show His indifference to such observances, and to abolish them for the future.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ille autem qui bibere quaerebat, sitiebat fidem ipsius mulieris; unde sequitur respondit Iesus, et dixit ei: si scires donum Dei, et quis est qui dicit: da mihi bibere, tu forsitan petisses ab eo, et dedisset tibi aquam vivam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He who asked to drink, however, out of the woman’s vessel, thirsted for the woman’s faith: Jesus answered and said unto her, If you knew the gift of God, or Who it is that says to you, Give Me to drink, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you living water.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Nam quasi dogma quoddam est, neminem accipere divinum donum ex non quaerentibus illud: ipsum autem salvatorem iubet pater poscere, ut det illi, secundum illud: postula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditatem tuam. Et ipse salvator dicit: petite et dabitur vobis. Et ideo signanter dicit petisses et dedisset tibi.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. For it is as it were a doctrine, that no one receives a divine gift, who seeks not for it. Even the Savior Himself is commanded by the Father to ask, that He may give it Him, as we read, Require of Me, and I will give you the heathen for you inheritance. And our Savior Himself says, Ask, and it shall be given you. Wherefore He says here emphatically, you would have asked of Him, and He would have given you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus Lib. 83 quaest</b>: Hic autem ei ostendit non se talem aquam petisse qualem ipsa intellexerat; sed quia ipse sciebat fidem eius, eidem sitienti spiritum sanctum dare cupiebat. Hanc enim recte intelligimus aquam vivam, quod est donum Dei, sicut ipse ait si scires donum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He lets her know that it was not the water, which she meant, that He asked for; but that knowing her faith, He wished to satisfy her thirst, by giving her the Holy Spirit. For so must we interpret the living water, which is the gift of God; as He says, If you knew the gift of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dicitur enim vulgo aqua viva illa quae de fonte exit: illa enim quae colligitur de pluvia in lacunas aut cisternas, aqua viva non dicitur: et si de fonte manaverit, et in loco aliquo collecta steterit, nec ad se illud unde manabat admiserit, sed in rupto meatu tamquam a fontis tramite separata fuerit, non dicitur aqua viva.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Living water is that which comes out of a spring, in distinction to what is collected in ponds and cisterns from the rain. If spring water too becomes stagnant, i.e. collects into some spot, where it is quite separated from its fountain head, it ceases to be living water.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Spiritus enim sancti gratiam quandoque Scriptura ignem, quandoque aquam vocat; ostendens quoniam non substantiae sunt haec nomina repraesentativa, sed actionis. Per ignis quidem appellationem erectivum et calidum gratiae, et consumptivum peccatorum aenigmatice insinuat: per aquae vero nuncupationem purgamentum quod est ex spiritu, et multum refrigerium recipientibus eum mentibus ostendit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. In Scripture the grace of the Holy Spirit is sometimes called fire, sometimes water, which shows that these words are expressive not of its substance but of its action. The metaphor of fire conveys the lively and sin-consuming property of grace; that of water the cleansing of the Spirit, and the refreshing of the souls who receive Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Gratiam ergo spiritus sancti dixit aquam vivam, idest vivificativam, refrigerativam et motivam. Nam gratia spiritus sancti semper movet illum qui bona operatur, ascensiones in corde suo disponens.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The grace of the Holy Spirit then He calls living water; i.e. life-giving, refreshing, stirring. For the grace of the Holy Spirit is ever stirring him who does good works, directing the risings of his heart.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Iterum autem dominus eam ab humili suspicione erexit, qua existimabat eum unum multorum esse: multum enim honorem tribuens, dominum vocat; sequitur enim dicit ei mulier: domine, neque in quo haurias habes, et puteus altus est: unde ergo habes aquam vivam?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. These words raised the woman’s notions of our Lord, and make her think Him no common person. She addresses Him reverentially by the title of Lord; The woman says to Him, Lord, you have nothing to draw with, and the well is deep: from whence then has you that living water?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Videte quomodo intellexit aquam vivam, scilicet aquam quae erat in illo fonte; quasi dicat: tu mihi vis dare aquam vivam, et ego fero unde hauriam et tu non fers: de hac ergo aqua viva mihi dare non potes, quoniam hauritorium non habes. Forte alium fontem promittis? Sed numquid tu maior es patre nostro Iacob, qui dedit nobis puteum, et ipse ex eo bibit, et filii eius, et pecora eius?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. She understands the living water to be the water in the well; and therefore says, You wish to give me living water; but You have nothing to draw with as I have: You can not then give me this living water; Are You greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the well, and drank thereof himself, and his children, and his cattle?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: non potes dicere quod Iacob dedit nobis hunc fontem, et alio ipse usus est: etenim ipse et sui ex eo bibebant: quod non esset, si meliorem alium habuissent. De hoc igitur fonte dare non potes: alium autem meliorem non est te habere, nisi confitearis te ipsum maiorem esse Iacob. Unde igitur habes aquam quam promittis te daturum nobis?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if she said, You can not say that Jacob gave us this spring, and used another himself; for he and they that were with him drank thereof; which would not have been done, had he had another better one. You can not then give me of this spring; and You have not another better spring, unless You confess Yourself greater than Jacob. Whence then have You the water, which You promise to give us?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quod autem dicit et pecora eius, ostensivum est abundantiae aquarum; quasi dicat: non solum suavis est aqua, ut Iacob ex ea biberet et filii eius; sed etiam intantum est abundans, ut tantae multitudini pecorum patriarchae sufficiat.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The addition, and his cattle, shows the abundance of the water; as if she said, Not only is the water sweet, so that Jacob and his sons drank of it, but so abundant, that it satisfied the vast multitude of the Patriarchs’ cattle.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vide autem qualiter seipsam impulit in nobilitatem Iudaicam. Samaritani enim Abraham progenitorem suum dicebant, quasi a Chaldaea existentem; sed et Iacob patrem vocabant, quasi ipsius existentem nepotem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> See how she thrusts herself upon the Jewish stock. The Samaritans claimed Abraham as their ancestor, on the ground of his having come from Chaldea; and called Jacob their father, as being Abraham’s grandson.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel patrem suum Iacob vocat, quia ipsa sub lege Moysi vixerat, et praedium quod Iacob filio suo Ioseph dederat possidebat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Or she calls Jacob their father, because she lived under the Mosaic law, and possessed the farm which Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Mystice autem fons Iacob Scripturae sunt; siquidem instructi in Scripturis bibunt ut Iacob et filii eius; simplices autem et rudes bibunt more pecorum Iacob.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. In the mystical sense, Jacob’s well is the Scriptures. The learned then drink like Jacob and his sons; the simple and uneducated, like Jacob’s cattle.

Non autem ab accusatione, sed ex supereminentia comparationem facit: non enim dicit quoniam haec aqua vilis est et contemptibilis; sed id quod natura testatur, hoc ponit, scilicet omnis qui bibit ex aqua hac, sitiet iterum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To the woman’s question, Are you greater than our father Jacob? He does not reply, I am greater, lest He should seem to boast; but His answer implies it; Jesus answered and said to her, Whosoever drink of this water shall thirst again: but whosoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall never thirst; as if He said, If Jacob is to be honored because he gave you this water. what will you say, if I give you far better than this? He makes the comparison however not to depreciate Jacob, but to exalt Himself. For He does not say, that this water is vile and counterfeit, but asserts a simple fact of nature, viz. that whosoever drink of this water shall thirst again.

Cum pervenerit quisque ad voluptatem saeculi huius, numquid non iterum sitiet? Ergo de hac aqua qui biberit, sitiet iterum. Si autem acceperit a me aquam, non sitiet in aeternum: nam quomodo sitient qui inebriabuntur ab ubertate domus Dei? Promittebat ergo venam quamdam in satietatem spiritus sancti.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Which is true indeed both of material water, and of that of which it is the type. For the water in the well is the pleasure of the world, that abode of darkness. Men draw it with the waterpot of their lusts; pleasure is not relished, except it be preceded by lust. And when a man has enjoyed this pleasure, i.e. drunk of the water, he thirsts again; but if he have received water from Me, he shall never thirst. For how shall they thirst, who are drunken with the abundance of the house of God? But He promised this fullness of the Holy Spirit.

Per virum suum ei volebat aquam illam dare. An quia non intelligebat, per virum suum eam volebat docere? Forte sicut apostolus dicit de mulieribus: si quae volunt discere, domi viros suos interrogent. Sed ibi dicitur, ubi non est Iesus qui doceat; cum vero ipse dominus aderat, quid opus erat ut per virum ei loqueretur? Numquid per virum loquebatur Mariae, quae sedit ad pedes eius?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus; The woman as yet understands Him of the flesh only. She is delighted to be relieved for ever from thirst, and takes this promise of our Lord’s in a carnal sense. For God had once granted to His servant Elijah, that he should neither hunger nor thirst for forty days; and if He could grant this for forty days, why not for ever? Eager to possess such a gift, she asks Him for the living water; The woman says to Him, Sir, give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come hither to draw. Her poverty obliged her to labor more than her strength could well bear; would in that she could hear, Come to Me, all that labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you. Jesus had said this very thing, i.e. that she need not labor any longer; but she did not understand Him. At last our Lord was resolved that she should understand: Jesus says to her, Go call your husband, and come hither. What means this? Did He wish to give her the water through her husband? Or, because she did not understand, did He wish to teach her by means of her husband? The Apostle indeed says of women, If they will learn any thing, let them ask their husbands at home. But this applies only where Jesus is not present. Our Lord Himself was present here; what need then that He should speak to her through her husband? Was it through her husband that He spoke to Mary, who sat at His feet?

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia igitur instabat mulier, accipere aquam promissam quaerens, dicit ei Iesus: voca virum tuum: quasi ostendens quoniam et illum oportet his communicare. Haec autem festinans accipere, et rei turpitudinem occultans, adhuc aestimabat se ad hominem loqui; unde sequitur respondit mulier, et dixit: non habeo virum. Hoc audiens Christus opportune de reliquo redargutionem inducit; nam et priores viros enumerat, et eum qui nunc occultabatur redarguit; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: bene dixisti, quia non habeo virum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The woman then being, urgent in asking for the promised water, Jesus says to her, Go call your husband; to show that he too ought to have a share in these things. But she was in a hurry to receive the gift, and wished to conceal her guilt, (for she still imagined she was speaking to a man) The woman answered and said, I have no husband. Christ answers her with a seasonable reproof; exposing her as to former husbands, and as to her present one, whom she had concealed; Jesus said to her, you have well said, I have no husband.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Vide autem si possibile est fontem Iacob mystice totas esse Scripturas, aquam vero Iesu ea pro quibus editae sunt; quae non est licitum omnibus perscrutari; eo quod quae scripta sunt dictaverunt homines; quae vero oculus non vidit, nec auris audivit, nec in cor hominis ascenderunt, in scriptis non possunt redigi; sed ex fonte aquae salientis in vitam aeternam, idest ex spiritu sancto, disciplinae patefiunt his qui nondum humanum cor gestant, sed possunt dicere: nos sensum Christi habemus. Qui ergo non suscipit profunditatem verborum, etsi ad modicum quieverit, denuo insistens dubitavit; qui autem bibit de aqua Christi, ad hoc promovetur ut fons omnium quaesitorum prorumpat in eo, sursum scaturizantibus aquis, et pervolante eius mente ad consequentiam huius aquae, ad vitam aeternam. Volebat autem mulier sine aqua Iacob, angelicam et super hominem discere veritatem: neque enim Angeli indigent fonte Iacob ut bibant; sed quilibet in se habet fontem aquae scaturientis in vitam aeternam ab ipso verbo; et hoc est quod subditur dicit ei mulier: domine, da mihi hanc aquam. Sed impossibile est hic absque ea quae hauritur ex fonte Iacob aquam capere quae datur a verbo: unde petenti Samaritanae aquam videtur dicere Iesus, se illam praebere non alibi quam in fonte Iacob; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: vade, voca virum tuum, et veni huc. Si enim sitiamus, idoneum est primo pocula sumere ex fonte Iacob; secundum autem apostolum, vir animae lex est.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. May not Jacob’s well signify mystically the letter of Scripture; the water of Jesus, that which is above the letter, which all are not allowed to penetrate into? That which is written was dictated by men, whereas the things which the eye has not seen, nor ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, cannot be reduced to writing, but are from the fountain of water, that springs up unto everlasting life, i.e. the Holy Ghost. These truths are unfolded to such as carrying no longer a human heart within them, are able to say with the Apostle, We have the mind of Christ. Human wisdom indeed discovers truths, which are handed down to posterity; but the teaching of the Spirit is a well of water which springs up into everlasting life. The woman wished to attain, like the angels, to angelic and super-human truth without the use of Jacob’s water. For the angels have a well of water within them, springing from the Word of God Himself. She says therefore, Sir, give me this water. But it is impossible here to have the water which is given by the Word, without that which is drawn from Jacob’s well; and therefore Jesus seems to tell the woman that He cannot supply her with it from any other source than Jacob’s well; If we are thirsty, we must first drink from Jacob’s well. Jesus says to her, Go, call your husband, and come hither. According to the Apostle, the Law is the husband of the soul.

Sed quoniam non credens Christo, adhuc illorum quinque virorum, idest quinque librorum, copulatione tenebatur, potest movere quomodo dici potuerit quinque viros habuisti, quasi nunc eos iam non haberet. Deinde quomodo potest intelligi a quinque illis libris recedere hominem ut ad Christum transeat, cum ille qui credit in Christum, non relinquendos illos quinque libros, sed spiritualiter intelligendos multo avidius amplectatur? Est ergo alius intellectus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The five husbands some interpret to be the five books which were given by Moses. And the words, He whom thou now have is not your husband, they understand as spoken by our Lord of Himself; as if He said, You have served the five books of Moses, as five husbands; but now he whom you have, i.e. whom you hear, is not your husband; for you do not yet believe in him. But if she did not believe in Christ, she was still united to those five husbands, i.e. five books, and therefore why is it said, you have had five husbands, as if she no longer had them? And how do we understand that a man must have these five books, in order to pass over to Christ, when he who believes in Christ, so far from forsaking these books, embraces them in this spiritual meaning the more strongly? Let us turn to another interpretation.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Videns enim Iesus quia mulier non intelligebat, et volens eam intelligere, voca, inquit, virum tuum; idest, praesenta intellectum tuum: cum enim ordinata fuerit vita, intellectus animam regit, ad ipsam animam pertinens: non enim aliud aliquid quid est, quam anima, sed aliquid animae est intellectus. Hoc ipsum animae quod intellectus et mens dicitur, illuminatur luce superiore. Talis lux cum muliere loquebatur, et in illa intellectus non aderat: ergo dominus, tamquam diceret: illustrare volo, et non adest quem; voca, inquit, virum tuum; idest, adhibe intellectum, per quem docearis quo regaris: et adhuc illa nondum vocato illo viro, non intelligit. Videtur autem mihi quinque viros priores animae nos posse accipere quinque sensus corporis: ante enim quam quisque possit uti ratione, non regitur nisi sensibus carnis; sed cum coeperit anima capax esse rationis, aut a sapiente mente regitur, aut ab errore; sed error non regit, sed perdit. Post illos ergo quinque sensus mulier illa adhuc errabat: error ille non erat legitimus vir, sed adulter. Dicit ergo dominus: tolle istum adulterum, qui te corrumpit, et voca virum tuum, ut intelligas me.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Jesus seeing that the woman did not understand, and wishing to enlighten her, says, Call your husband; i.e. apply your understanding. For when the life is well ordered, the understanding governs the soul itself, pertaining to the soul. For though it is indeed nothing else than the soul, it is at the same time a certain part of the soul. And this very part of the soul which is called the understanding and the intellect, is itself illuminated by a light superior to itself. Such a Light was talking with the woman; but in her there was not understanding to be enlightened. Our Lord then, as it were, says, I wish to enlighten, and there is not one to be enlightened; Call your husband, i. e. apply your understanding, through which you must be taught, by which governed. The five former husbands may be explained as the five senses, thus: a man before he has the use of his reason, is entirely under the government of his bodily senses. Then reason comes into action; and from that time forward he is capable of entertaining ideas, and is either under the influence of truth or error. The woman had been under the influence of error, which error was not her lawful husband, but an adulterer. Wherefore our Lord says, Put away that adulterer which corrupts thee, and call your husband, that you may understand Me.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Ubi autem decebat confutari a Iesu putatum Samaritanae virum, non esse virum, nisi apud fontem Iacob?

Revocatur autem ad verbum veritatis, quod resurrecturum erat a mortuis, non deinceps moriturum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. And what more proper place than Jacob’s well, for exposing the unlawful husband, i.e. the perverse law? For the Samaritan woman is meant to figure to us a soul, that has subjected itself to a kind of law of its own, not the divine lay. And our Savior wishes to marry her to a lawful husband, i.e. Himself; the Word of truth which was to rise from the dead, and never again to die.

This was a great dispute between the Samaritans and the Jews. The Jews worshipped in the temple built by Solomon, and made this a ground of boasting over the Samaritans. The Samaritans replied, Why boast you, because you have a temple which we have not? Did our fathers, who pleased God, worship in that temple?

He says, Believe me, because we have need of faith, the mother of all good, the medicine of salvation, in order to obtain any real good.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. There was no necessity for Christ to show why the fathers worshipped in the mountain, and the Jews in Jerusalem.

Iudaeis autem seipsum connumerat secundum opinionem mulieris, loquens quasi propheta Iudaeus existens: ideo dixit adoramus; cum tamen manifestum sit quod ipse est qui ab omnibus adoratur. Per hoc autem quod dicit quia salus ex Iudaeis est, nihil aliud ostendit quam quod orbi terrarum inde salutaria facta sunt. Scire enim Deum et idola detestari, illinc principium habuit et omnia alia dogmata; sed ipsum quod est apud nos, a Iudaeis orationis principium habuit. Praesentiam etiam suam salutem vocat: quam dicit ex Iudaeis esse, secundum illud apostoli: ex quibus est Christus secundum carnem. Vide qualiter applaudit veteri testamento, quod radicem ostendit bonorum, per omnia semetipsum non esse contrarium legi demonstrans.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Samaritans worshipped they knew not what, a local, a partial God, as they imagined, of whom they had the same notion that they had of their idols. And therefore they mingled the worship of God with the worship of idols. But the Jews were free from this superstition: indeed they knew God to be the God of the whole world; wherefore He says, We worship what we know. He reckons Himself among the Jews, in condescension to the woman’s idea of Him; and says as if He were a Jewish prophet, We worship, though it is certain that He is the Being who is worshipped by all. The words, For salvation is of the Jews, mean that every thing calculated to save and amend the world, the knowledge of God, the abhorrence of idols, and all other doctrines of that nature, and even the very origin of our religion, comes originally from the Jews. In salvation too He includes His own presence, which He says is of the Jews, as we are told by the Apostle, Of whom as concerning the flesh Christ came. See how He exalts the Old Testament, which He shows to be the root of every thing good; thus proving in every way that He Himself is not opposed to the Law.

But He does not spear; for the reprobate Jews, but for that party from whom the Apostles and the Prophets came. Such were all those saints who laid the prices of their possessions at the Apostle’s feet.

Quia enim prophetae ante longa tempora multa praedixerunt, ideo dixit et nunc est: ne aestimes hanc talem esse prophetiam quae post multum temporis impleatur: res iam instat et in ianuis est. Dixit autem veri adoratores, ad distinctionem falsorum: quoniam quidam sunt falsi adoratores, qui temporalia et caduca quaerunt in oratione; sive qui contra hoc quod orant, agere non cessant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Jewish worship then was far higher than the Samaritan; but even it shall be abolished; The hour comes, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth. He says, and now is, to show that this was not a prediction, like those of the ancient Prophets, to be fulfilled the course of ages. The event, He says, is now at hand, it is approaching your very doors. The words, true worshipers, are by way of distinction: for there are false worshipers, who pray for temporal and frail benefits, or whose actions are ever contradicting their prayers.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel dicens veros, excludit cum Samaritanis Iudaeos. Etsi enim Iudaei illis meliores essent, tamen futuris multo minores sunt, tamquam figura veritate.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or by saying, true, he excludes the Jews together with the Samaritans. For the Jews, though better than the Samaritans, were yet as much inferior to those who were to succeed them, as the type is to the reality. The true worshipers do not confine the worship of God to place, but worship in the spirit; as Paul said, Whom I serve with my spirit.

Cum ergo venerit hora quam dicit dominus, evitandus est mons Samaritanorum, et in Sion, ubi est Hierosolyma, adorandus est Deus, quae civitas esse dicitur a Christo celsi principis: et haec est Ecclesia, ubi sacra oblatio, spirituales victimae divinis aspectibus offeruntur ab his qui legem spiritualem intellexerunt. Cum autem venerit temporis complementum, tunc nequaquam pensandum verum cultum Hierosolymis, idest in praesenti Ecclesia, amplius pertractari: neque enim Angeli apud Hierosolymam colunt patrem; sic et qui similitudinem nacti sunt Iudaeorum, melius quam hi qui sunt Hierosolymis, colunt patrem. Cum autem haec hora evenerit, patri aliquis in filium deputatur. Ea propter non dictum est: adorabitis Deum, sed adorabitis patrem. Sed in praesenti colunt patrem in spiritu et veritate veri adoratores.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Twice it is said, The hour comes, and the first time without the addition, and now is. The first seems to allude to that purely spiritual worship which is suited only to a state of perfection; the second to earthly worship, perfected as far as is consistent with human nature. When that hour comes, which our Lord speaks of, the mountain of the Samaritans must be avoided, and God must be worshipped in Sion, where is Jerusalem, which is called by Christ the city of the Great King. And this is the Church, where sacred oblations and spiritual victims are offered up by those who understand the spiritual law. So that when the fullness of time shall have come, the true worship, we must suppose, will no longer be attached to Jerusalem, i.e. to the present Church: for the Angels do not worship the Father at Jerusalem: and thus those who have obtained the likeness of the Jews, worship the Father better than they who are at Jerusalem. And when this hour is come, we shall be accounted by the Father as sons. Wherefore it is not said, Worship God, but, Worship the Father. But for the present the true worshipers worship the Father in spirit and in truth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Dicit ergo hoc de Ecclesia, in qua est vera adoratio et Deo congrua; unde subdit nam et pater tales quaerit qui adorent eum. Et si olim volebat eos veteribus immorari, concessit eis figuram: hoc tamen fecit eis condescendens, ut per hoc ad veritatem inducantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He speaks here of the Church; wherein there is true worship, and such as becomes God; and therefore adds, For the Father seeks such to worship Him. For though formerly He willed that mankind should linger under a dispensation of types and figures, this was only done in condescension to human frailty, and to prepare men for the reception of the truth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Si autem pater quaerit, per Iesum quaerit, qui venit quaerere et salvare quod perierat: quos erudiens veros cultores efficit. Quod autem subditur spiritus est Deus, inde abstractum esse suspicor quod ad vitam veram nos perducit: nam et corporali vita vivificamur a spiritu.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. But if the Father seeks, He seeks through Jesus, Who came to seek and to save that which was lost, and to teach men what true worship was. God is a Spirit; i.e. He constitutes our real life, just as our breath (spirit) constitutes our bodily life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel indicat quod Deus incorporeus est. Oportet igitur et incorpoream eius culturam esse, hoc est per animam: et intellectus puritatem nos ei offerre; unde subdit et eos qui adorant eum, in spiritu et veritate oportet adorare. Quia enim Iudaei animam quidem negligebant, multum autem circa corpus studium faciebant, id omnifariam purgantes; ideo ait, quia non corporis mundatione, sed incorporeo quod est in nobis, hoc est intellectu, quem dicit spiritum, Deus incorporeus colitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or it signifies that God is incorporeal; and that therefore He ought to be worshipped not with the body, but with the soul, by the offering up a pure mind, i.e. that they who worship Him, must worship Him in spirit and in truth. The Jews neglected the soul, but paid great attention to the body, and had various kinds of purification. Our Lord seems here to refer to this, and to say, not by cleansing of the body, but by the incorporeal nature within us, i. e. the understanding, which He calls the spirit, that we must worship the incorporeal God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Vel cum in spiritu Deum spiritum docuit adorandum, et libertatem ac scientiam adorantium et adorandi infinitatem ostendit, secundum illud apostoli: ubi spiritus domini, ibi libertas.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Or, by saying that God being a Spirit ought to be worshipped in spirit, He indicates the freedom and knowledge of the worshipers, and the uncircumscribed nature of the worship: according to the saying of the Apostle, Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: In veritate autem oportet adorare: quia priora figura erant, scilicet circumcisio, holocausta et thymiamata; nunc autem totum est veritas.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And that we are to worship in truth, means that whereas the former ordinances were typical; that is to say, circumcision, burnt offerings, and sacrifices; now, on the contrary, every thing is real.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel quia multi putant se Deum secundum spiritum, idest animam, adorare, non rectam opinionem de eo habentes, ut haeretici: propter hoc addidit et veritate. Forte etiam dicet aliquis, quia duas partes philosophiae, quae secundum nos sunt, insinuat in praedictis, actionem scilicet et contemplationem: per spiritum namque activum insinuat, secundum apostolum: qui spiritu Dei aguntur, hi filii sunt Dei; per veritatem vero contemplativum. Vel aliter. Samaritanorum erat opinio quod Deus loco concluderetur, et quia in hoc loco Deum adorari oporteat: contra quos dicit, quia veri adoratores non localiter, sed spiritualiter adorant. Iudaeis vero omnia sub figura et umbra erant; et ideo dicit, quia veri adoratores non in figura adorabunt, sed in veritate: quia enim Deus spiritus est, spirituales adoratores quaerit: quia vero veritas, veros.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, because many think that they worship God in the spirit, i.e. with the mind, who yet held heretical doctrines concerning Him, for this reason He adds, and in truth. May not the words too refer to the two kinds of philosophy among us, i. e. active and contemplative; the spirit standing for action, according to the Apostle, As many as are led by the Spirit of God; truth, on the other hand, for contemplation. Or, (to take another view,) as the Samaritans thought that God was confined to a certain place, and ought to be worshipped in that place; in opposition to this notion, our Lord may mean to teach them here, that the true worshipers worship not locally, but spiritually. Or again, all being a type and shadow in the Jewish system, the meaning may be that the true worshipers will worship not in type, but in truth. God being a Spirit, seeks for spiritual worshipers; being the truth, for true ones.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quaerebas montem forte ad orandum, ut Deo esses propinquior; sed ipse qui in altis habitat, humilibus appropinquat: ergo descende, ut ascendas. Ascensiones in corde eius in convalle plorationis, quae humilitatem habet. In templo vis orare? In te ora; sed prius esto templum Dei.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. O for a mountain to pray on, you cry, high and inaccessible, that I may be nearer to God, and God may hear me better, for He dwells on high. Yes, God dwells on high, but He has respect to the humble. Wherefore descend that you may ascend. “Ways on high are in their heart,” it is said, “passing in the valley of tears,” and in “tears” is humility. Would you pray in the temple? pray in yourself; but first do you become the temple of God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But what reason had the Samaritans for expecting Christ’s coming? They acknowledged the books of Moses, which foretold it.

Now, having gradually awakened her to the thought of Christ, His disclosure of Himself is perfectly opportune. He is not equally open to the Jews, who ask Him, If You be the Christ, tell us plainly; for this reason, that they did not ask in order to learn, but to do Him injury; whereas she spoke in the simplicity of her heart.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The salvation of men He calls His food, showing His great desire that we should be saved. As food is an object of desire to us, so was the salvation of men to Him. Observe, He does not express Himself directly, but figuratively; which makes some trouble necessary for His hearers, in order to comprehend His meaning, and thus gives a greater importance to that meaning when it is understood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Dicit autem quem vos nescitis; idest nescitis quod cibum voco salutem hominum; vel nescitis quia Samaritani credituri sunt, et salvi fient. Discipuli autem adhuc dubitabant; unde sequitur dicebant ergo discipuli ad invicem: numquid aliquis attulit ei manducare?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. That you know not of; i.e. know not that I call the salvation of men food; or, know not that the Samaritans are about to believe and be saved. The disciples however were in perplexity: Therefore said the disciples one to another, Has any man brought Him ought to eat?

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et quidem assuetam reverentiam et honorem magistro praebent, ad se invicem quidem loquentes, ipsum vero non praesumentes interrogare.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They show, as usual, the honor and reverence in which they hold their Master, by talking among themselves, and not presuming to question Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: In hoc autem quod dicunt discipuli numquid aliquis attulit ei manducare? Considerandum est, quod cibos ab aliis oblatos dominus suscipere solebat, non quod alieno ministerio indigeret qui dat escam omni carni, sed ut deferentes meritum consequerentur, simulque formam tradens non erubescere paupertatem, neque grave putare ab aliis nutriri: proprium enim et necessarium est doctoribus, alios habere procuratores ciborum, ut ipsi de nullo curantes, verbi ministrationem procurent sollicite.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. From the question of the disciples, Has any man brought Him ought to eat, we may infer that our Lord was accustomed to receive food from others, when it was offered Him: not that He who gives food to all flesh, needed any assistance; but He received it, that they who gave it might obtain their reward, and that poverty thenceforth might not blush, nor the support of others be esteemed a disgrace. It is proper and necessary that teachers should depend on others to provide them with food, in order that, being free from all other cares, they may attend the more to the ministry of the word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Audivit autem dominus cogitationes discipulorum, et instruit eos ut magister, non per circuitum sicut mulierem, sed aperte; unde sequitur dicit eis Iesus: meus cibus est ut faciam voluntatem eius qui misit me.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord heard His doubting disciples, and answered them as disciples, i.e. plainly and expressly, not circuitously, as He answered the women; Jesus said to them, My meat is to do the will of Him that sent Me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Idoneus cibus filio Dei, cum actor paternae voluntatis efficitur, hoc velle in semetipso protestans quod erat in patre. Solus autem filius perfecti operis paternae voluntatis est capax; ceteri vero sancti nil praeter divinam peragunt voluntatem. Plenam autem et integram facit Dei voluntatem qui dixit meus cibus est ut faciam voluntatem eius qui misit me; proprius enim cibus eius ostenditur. Quid autem sit velle patris, innuit sermo sequens ut perficiam opus eius. Siquidem simplicius quis asseret, quoniam opus est iussum mandantis; puta si dicant aedificantes vel fodientes se perficere opus eius qui conduxit eos. Sed si per Christum perficitur opus Dei, restat ut priusquam perficeretur esset diminutum. Qualiter autem diminutum erat opus, cum esset Dei? Perfectio quidem operis, rationalis naturae est perfectio; ad huius enim operis perfectionem, cum esset imperfectum, verbum caro factum accessit. Cum enim quodammodo homo perfectus fuerit, ob transgressionem factus est imperfectus; et ideo missus est salvator, primo quidem ut perficiat voluntatem eius qui misit eum; secundo vero ut consummet opus Dei, ut quilibet perfectus fiat ad solidi cibi usum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Fit meat for the Son of God, who was so obedient to the Father, that in Him was the t same will that was in the Father: not two wills, but one will in both. The Son is capable of first accomplishing the whole will of the Father. Other saints do nothing against the Father’s will; He does that will. That is His meat in an especial sense. And what means, To finish His work? It would seem easy to say, that a work was what was ordered by him who set it; as where men are set to build or dig. But some who go deeper ask whether a work being finished does not imply that it was before incomplete; and whether God could originally have made an incomplete work? The completing of the work, is the completing of a rational creature: for it was to complete this work, which was as yet imperfect, that the Word made flesh come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Opus etiam Dei perfecit, scilicet hominem, Dei filius, nostram naturam in seipso sine peccato ostendens in omni opere perfectam et incorruptam. Opus etiam Dei, scilicet legem, perfecit: quia finis legis Christus eam cessare faciens, omnibus quae in ea erant perfectis, a corporali cultu in spiritualem reduxit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He finished the work of God, i.e. man, He, the Son of God, finished it by exhibiting our nature in Himself without sin, perfect and uncorrupt. He finished also the work of God, i.e. the Law, (for Christ is the end of the Law,) by abolishing it, when every thing in it had been fulfilled, and changing a carnal into a spiritual worship.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Mystice autem post poculi negotium, ac disciplinam distinctionis aquarum, consequens erat et de cibo disceptare. Samaritana quidem petita potum, non habebat praebere Iesu dignum poculum; discipuli vero invenientes humilia pulmenta apud alienigenas, ei obtulerunt, rogantes eum ut manducaret. Et attende si forsan verentur, ne verbum Dei, propriis non vigoratum escis, in eis deficiat. Quaecumque ergo reperiunt discipuli, his iugiter proponunt verbum alere, ut corroboratum atque roboratum perseveret penes eos qui nutriunt ipsum. Quemadmodum autem corpora egentia cibo, neque eisdem aluntur, neque eadem quantitas ciborum cunctis sufficiens est; sic intelligendum est et in his quae sunt supra corpus: nam horum hoc quidem plurimi, hoc autem paucioris indiget nutrimenti, dissimilis capedinis entia. Sed neque qualitas alentium verborum atque intentionum contemplativarum seu operationum eadem congruit omnibus: nam nuper geniti infantes, rationale appetunt lac; perfectorum autem est solidus cibus. Veridicus est ergo Iesus dicens ego cibum habeo manducare quem vos nescitis. Semper enim qui praeest infirmis ac nequeuntibus eadem cum validis videre, hoc dicere potest.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. The matter of spiritual drink and living water being explained, the subject of meat follows. Jesus had asked the woman of Samaria, and she could give Him none good enough. Then came the disciples, having procured some humble food among the people of the country, and offered it Him, beseeching Him to eat. They fear perhaps lest the Word of God, deprived of His own proper nourishment, fail within them; and therefore with such as they have found, immediately propose to feed Him, that being confirmed and strengthened, He may abide with His nourishers. Souls require food as well as bodies. And as bodies require different kinds of it, and in different quantities, so is it in things which are above the body. Souls differ in capacity, and one needs more nourishment, another less. So too in point of quality, the same nourishment of words and thoughts does not suit all. Infants just born need the milk of the word; the grown up, solid meat. Our Lord says, I have meat to eat. For one who is over the weak who cannot behold the same things with the stronger, may always speak thus.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What is the will of the Father He now proceeds to explain: Say you not, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Scilicet materialis. Ego autem dico vobis, quod messis intelligibilis adest: hoc enim dicebat propter Samaritanos venientes ad ipsum; unde subdit levate oculos vestros, et videte regiones, quia albae sunt iam ad messem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Now you are expecting a material harvest. But I say to you, that a spiritual harvest is at hand: lift up your eyes, and look on the fields; for they are white already to harvest. He alludes to the Samaritans who are approaching.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Rursus consuetis nominibus ad maximorum eos contemplationem reducit. Regio enim et messis hic indicat multitudinem animarum, quae paratae sunt ad praedicationis susceptionem. Oculos autem hic dicit et eos qui mentis, et eos qui corporis: etenim videbant de reliquo multitudinem Samaritanorum venientem. Has autem praeparationes hominum decenter regiones albatas vocat; sicut enim spicae cum dealbatae fuerint, ad messem sunt paratae, ita et hi ad salutem sunt parati. Sed propter quid non manifeste dicit, quod praeparati sunt homines ad susceptionem verbi? Duarum quidem occasionum gratia: unius quidem ut manifestior fiat sermo, et magis ante oculos ponat quae dicuntur; alterius autem ut dulcior sit narratio et permanentior eorum quae dicuntur memoria.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He leads them, as his custom is, from low things to high. Fields and harvest here express the great number of souls, which are ready to receive the word. The eyes are both spiritual, and bodily ones, for they saw a great multitude of Samaritans now approaching. This expectant crowd he calls very suitably white fields. For as the corn, when it grows white, is reader for the harvest; so were these ready for salvation. But why does He not say this in direct language? Because by making use in this way of the objects around them, he gave greater vividness and power to His words, and brought the truth home to them; and also that His discourse might be more pleasant, and might sink deeper into their memories.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: In opus autem fervebat et operarios mittere festinabat; unde subditur et qui metit, mercedem accipit, et congregat fructum in vitam aeternam; ut et qui seminat simul gaudeat, et qui metit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He was intent now on beginning the work, and hastened to send laborers: And he that reaps receives wages, and gathers fruit to life eternal, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per ea quae hic dicit, dividit terrena a caelestibus: sicut enim supra dixerat de aqua, quod qui bibit hanc aquam, non sitiet, ita hic dicit qui metit, congregat fructum in vitam aeternam: et iterum qui seminat, simul gaudeat, et qui metit. Prophetae enim sunt qui seminant; sed non illi messuerunt, sed apostoli: quia enim infra dicet, quod alius seminat et alius metit, ne quis aestimet quod prophetae seminantes mercede priventur, extraneum quiddam inducit, et a sensibilibus alienum: nam in rebus quidem sensibilibus si contingat alium seminare et alium metere, non simul laetantur, sed dolent qui seminant, quasi aliis laborantes; laetantur autem soli qui metunt: hic autem non ita; sed et qui non metunt seminantes, simul cum metentibus laetantur, quoniam in mercede communicant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Again He distinguishes earthly from heavenly things, for as above He said of the water, that he who drank of it should never thirst, so here He says, He that reaps gathers fruit to life eternal; adding, that both he that sows and he that reaps may rejoice together. The Prophets sowed, the Apostles reaped, yet are not the former deprived of their reward. For here a new thing is promised; viz. that both sowers and reapers shall rejoice together. How different this from what we see here. Now he that sows grieves because he sows for others, and he only that reaps rejoices. But in the Dew state, the sower and reaper share the same wages.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Disparis enim temporis labores habuerunt apostoli et prophetae; sed gaudio pariter perfruentur, mercedem simul accepturi sunt vitam aeternam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Apostles and Prophets had different labors, corresponding to the difference of times; but both will attain to like joy, and receive together their wages, even eternal life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ad hoc autem quod dixerat sermonem proverbialem inducit; unde subdit in hoc enim est verbum verum, quia alius est qui seminat, et alius qui metit. Hoc quidem vulgariter dicebatur, si quando alii labores sustinebant, et alii fructus metebant. Sed et hic sermo iste maxime habet veritatem: quia prophetae laboraverunt, sed vos fructus ex illorum laboribus metitis; unde subdit ego misi vos metere quod vos non laborastis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He confirms what He says by a proverb, And herein is that saying true, one sows and another reaps, i.e. one party has the labor, and another reaps the fruit. The saying is especially applicable here, for the Prophets had labored, and the disciples reaped the fruits of their labors: I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid ergo? Messores misit, non seminatores? Ibi ergo messores mittendi ubi iam prophetae praedicaverant. Legite labores illorum, et in omnibus eorum laboribus est prophetia Christi: ergo iam in Iudaea messis parata erat quando tot millia hominum pretia rerum suarum offerebant, et ad pedes apostolorum ponentes, expeditis humeris a sarcinis saecularibus, Christum dominum sequebantur. De ipsa messe eiecta sunt pauca grana, et seminaverunt orbem terrarum: et surgit alia messis, quae in fine saeculi metenda est; ad quam metendam non apostoli, sed Angeli mittentur. Messores sunt Angeli.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So then He sent reapers, no sowers. The reapers went where the Prophets had preached. Read the account of their labors: they all contain prophecy of Christ. And the harvest was gathered on that occasion when so many thousands brought the prices of their possessions, and laid them at the Apostles’ feet; relieving their shoulders from earthly burdens, that they might follow Christ. Yes verily, and from that harvest were a few grains scattered, which filled the whole world. And now arises another harvest, which will be reaped at the end of the world, not by Apostles, but by Angels. The reapers, He says, are the Angels.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dicit ergo ego misi vos metere quod vos non laborastis: quasi dicat: ubi minor labor est, maior autem delectatio, ad hoc vos reservavi; et quod laboriosius erat, hoc fuit prophetarum, scilicet mittere semina; unde subdit alii laboraverunt, et vos in labores eorum introistis. Per haec omnia vult ostendere quod prophetarum voluntas erat ut homines ad eum accederent. Et hoc lex ordinabat: et propterea illi seminaverunt, ut hunc facerent fructum. Ostendit etiam quod ipse illos misit, et quod multa est cognatio novi ad vetus testamentum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. I sent you to reap that whereon you bestowed no labor, i.e. I have reserved you for a favorable time, in which the labor is less, the enjoyment greater. The more laborious part of the work was laid on the Prophets, viz. the sowing of the seed: Other men labored, and you are entered into their labors. Christ here throws light on the meaning of the old prophecies. He shows that both the Law and the Prophets, if rightly interpreted, led men to Him; and that the Prophets were sent in fact by Himself. Thus the intimate connection is established between the Old Testament and the New.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Vel aliter totum. Qualiter quidem non est inconveniens hoc quod est levate oculos vestros etc. allegorizare; quod autem dicitur nonne vos dicitis quoniam quatuor menses sunt et messis venit, non secundum allegoricam tractare? Putamus ergo talia quaedam esse in hoc quod dicunt discipuli quatuor menses sunt, et messis venit. Plerique enim discipulorum verbi animadvertentes veritatem incomprehensibilem fore humanae naturae, quando coniecerunt aliam esse vitam a praesente, quae corruptioni quatuor elementorum, quasi quatuor mensium subicitur, putant solum post hanc vitam cognitionem esse veritatis. Dicunt igitur discipuli de messibus, quae sunt terminus operum ad veritatem conducentium, quia post instantem quaternitatem contingunt. Huiusmodi autem opinionem arguens velut non sanam, inquit verbum incarnatum his qui talia suspicantur nonne vos dicitis, quia adhuc quatuor menses sunt et messis venit? Ego autem hoc dico: levate oculos vestros. In pluribus locis Scripturae divinae hoc legitur; iubente nobis verbo divino extollere ac sublimare considerationes et cogitationes deorsum consistentes nec valentes erigi, nisi elevante illas Iesu: nemo enim consistens in passionibus et vivens carnaliter, hoc propositum servat mandatum. Quapropter qui talis est, non videbit regiones, si albae sunt ad messem. Albescunt quidem regiones ad messem, cum adest verbum Dei illustrans singulas regiones Scripturae, fecundans in eius adventu: et etiam omnia sensibilia sunt quasi regiones albae paratae ad messem, praesto existente levantibus oculos ratione, quae de quolibet est, ut quisquis fulgorem prospiciat profusae ubilibet veritatis. Qui autem metit praedictas messes, duplex habet in metendo emolumentum: unum quidem dum accipit praemium; unde dicitur et qui metit, mercedem accipit: quod arbitror dictum causa futurarum remunerationum: alterum quod sequitur et congregat fructum in vitam aeternam, bonum habitum quemdam denotat intellectus, qui est fructus ex ipsa speculatione proveniens. Arbitror autem quod in qualibet doctrina seminat quidem qui principia excogitat, quae suscipientes alii ac pertractantes, si quid novi potuerunt exprimere, coniungentes, fiunt suae inventionis gratia posteris causa ut metendo quasi maturos fructus aggregent. Quanto autem magis hoc in arte artium expedit contemplari? Siquidem seminantes sunt Moyses et prophetae praevenientes adventum Christi; metentes autem sunt apostoli, qui Christum susceperunt et gloriam eius perspexerunt. Semen autem erat tota ratio secundum revelationem mysterii temporibus praeteritis obfuscati silentio: regiones autem, idest legales et propheticae Scripturae, nondum albuerant his qui adventus verbi nequaquam extiterunt capaces. Quod autem simul serens et metens gaudeat, erit cum privatio moeroris et angustiae in futuro fiet saeculo. Dum etiam Iesus transfiguraretur in gloria, simul cum messoribus Petro, Iacobo et Ioanne, Moyses et Elias satores pariter gaudent in videndo filii Dei gloriam. Attende tamen si hoc quod dico, alius et alius, intelligi potest propter aliam et aliam vitae conversationem, in qua homines iustificati sunt: ut liceat dicere alium quidem legis cultorem, alium vero Evangelii: et tamen exultant simul, dum idem finis ab uno Deo per unum Christum in uno spiritu sancto reponitur. Ad labores autem prophetarum et Moysi advenerunt apostoli, instruente Iesu, metentes, ac in horrea colligentes animae suae intellectum in Scripturis illorum reconditum: et semper qui debite capiunt disciplinam, priorum labores ad maiorem evidentiam trahunt, non tantum laborantes sunt hi qui semina condiderunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. How can we consistently give an allegorical meaning to the words, Lift up your eyes, &amp;c. and only a literal one to the words, There are yet four months, and then comes harvest? The same principle of interpretation surely must be applied to the latter, that is to the former. The four months represent the four elements, i.e. our natural life; the harvest, the end of the world, when all conflict shall have ceased, and truth shall prevail. The disciples then regard the truth as incomprehensible in our natural state, and look forward to the end of the world for attaining the knowledge of it. But this idea our Lord condemns: Say not you, there are four months, and then comes harvest? Behold, I say to you, Lift up your eyes. In many places of Holy Scripture, we are commanded in the same way to raise the thoughts of our minds, which cling so obstinately to earth. A difficult task this for one who indulges his passions, and lives carnally. Such an one will not see if the fields be white to the harvest. For when are the fields white to the harvest? When the Word of God comes to light up and make fruitful the fields of Scripture. Indeed, all sensible things are as it were fields made white for the harvest, if only reason be at hand to interpret them. We lift up our eyes, and behold the whole universe over-spread with the brightness of truth. And he that reaps those harvests, has a double reward of his reaping; first, his wages; And he that reaps receives wages; meaning his reward in the life to come; secondly, a certain good state of the understanding, which is the fruit of contemplation, And gathers fruit to life eternal. The man who thinks out the first principles of any science, is as it were the sower in that science; others taking them up, pursuing them to their results, and engrafting fresh matter upon them, strike out new discoveries, from which posterity reaps a plentiful harvest. And how much more may we perceive this in the art of arts? The seed there is the whole dispensation of the mystery, now revealed, but formerly hidden in darkness; for while men were unfit for the advent of the Word, the fields were not yet white to their eyes, i.e. the legal and prophetical Scriptures were shut up. Moses and the Pro pets, who preceded the coming of Christ, were the sowers of this seed; the Apostles who came after Christ and saw His glory were the reapers. They reaped and gathered into barns the deep meaning which lay hid under the prophetic writings; and did in short what those do who succeed to a scientific system which others have discovered, and who with less trouble attain to clearer results than they who originally sowed the seed. But they that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together in another world, in which all sorrow and mourning shall be done away. Nay, and have they not rejoiced already; Did not Moses and Elias, the sowers, rejoice with the reapers Peter, James, and John, when they saw the glory of the Son of God at the Transfiguration? Perhaps in, one sows and another reaps, one and another may refer simply to those who live under the Law, and those who live under the Gospel. For these may both rejoice together, inasmuch as the same end is laid up for them by one God, through one Christ, in one Holy Spirit.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Postquam dicta sunt discipulis quae tractata sunt, resumit Scriptura de his qui venerant de civitate ad Iesum, et crediderant per testimonium mulieris.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b> After this conversation with the disciples, Scripture returns to those who had believed on the testimony of the woman, and were come to see Jesus.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sicut autem in messe cum facilitate fructus congregantur, et in momento uno area manipulis repletur, ita et nunc fit; unde dicitur ex civitate autem illa multi crediderunt in eum Samaritanorum, propter verbum mulieris testimonium perhibentis, quia dixit mihi omnia quaecumque feci. Considerabant enim, quod nequaquam mulier gratanter eum admirata esset qui eius delicta redarguerat, nisi magnus quis esset et excellens qui praedicabatur ab illa. Sic ergo solo mulieris testimonio credentes, et nullum signum videntes, exierunt deprecantes Christum ut apud eos maneret; et hoc est quod sequitur cum ergo venissent ad illum Samaritani, rogaverunt eum ut ibi maneret. Iudaei vero miracula videntes, non detinuerunt eum apud seipsos; sed omnia egerunt ut a regione eorum eum abicerent: nihil enim livore et invidia deterius, nihil inani gloria difficilius, quae infinita corrumpere consuevit bona. Et quidem Samaritani volebant eum semper secum detinere; ipse autem hoc non sustinuit, sed solum mansit ibi duobus diebus post haec; quod subditur et mansit ibi duos dies.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is now, as it were, harvest time, when the corn is gathered, and a whole floor soon covered with sheaves; And many of the Samaritans of that city believed on Him, for the saying of the woman which testified, He told me all that ever I did. They considered that the woman would never of her own accord have conceived such admiration for one Who had reproved her offenses, unless He were really some great and wonderful person. And thus relying solely on the testimony of the woman, without any other evidence, they went out to beseech Christ to stay with them: So when the Samaritans were come to Him, they besought Him that He would tarry with them. The Jews when they saw His miracles, so far from begging Him to stay, tried in every way to get rid of His presence. Such is the power of malice, and envy, and vainglory, that obstinate vice which poisons even goodness itself. Though the Samaritans however wished to keep Him with them, He would not consent, but only tarried there two days.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Non incongrue autem aliquis illud obiciet, quomodo rogatus salvator cum Samaritanis manet, qui iussit civitatem Samaritanorum non ingredi. Palam enim quoniam et discipuli eius cum eo ingressi sunt. Ad quod dicendum, quod in viam gentium pergere est imbui gentili dogmate, et in illo ambulare. Civitatem vero Samaritanorum intrare est acceptare falsam doctrinam recipientium legales, propheticos, evangelicos, et apostolicos sermones. Cum autem deseruerint propriam doctrinam et venerint ad Iesum, licet cum eis manere.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. It is natural to ask, why our Savior stays with the Samaritans, when He had given a command to His disciples not to enter into any city of the Samaritans. But we must explain this mystically. To go the way of the Gentiles, is to be imbued with Gentile doctrine; to go into a city of the Samaritans, is to admit the doctrines of those who believe the Scriptures, but interpret them heretically. But when men have given up their own doctrines, and come to Jesus, it is lawful to stay with them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Et Iudaei quidem etiam signis visis incorrecti manserunt; hi autem et sine signis multam circa eum fidem demonstraverunt; solum enim verba audierunt; unde sequitur et multo plures crediderunt propter sermonem eius. Cuius igitur gratia haec verba non dicunt Evangelistae? Ut discas quoniam multa magnorum transcurrerunt, a fine vero totum ostenderunt: suasit enim toti civitati per ea quae dicta sunt. Ubi autem auditores non persuadentur, tunc Evangelistae coguntur dicere ea quae dicta sunt, ne quod est ex indevotione auditorum, imputet quis defectui praedicantis. Ipsi autem discipuli Christi iam facti, magistram repulerunt; unde sequitur et mulieri dicebant: quia iam non propter tuam loquelam credimus: ipsi enim audivimus, et scimus quia hic est vere salvator mundi. Vide autem qualiter confestim intellexerunt quod orbem terrarum liberare venerat, et quod ad communem salutem veniens, non debebat in Iudaeis suam concludere providentiam, sed ubique seminare sermonem. Dicentes etiam, quod est salvator mundi, ostenderunt quod mundus perditus erat, in magnis malis existens. Et quidem venerunt salvare prophetae et Angeli; sed hic est vere salvator, qui salutem tribuit, non solum temporaneam, sed aeternam. Vide etiam qualiter audientes mulierem dubitanter dicentem numquid hic est Christus? Non dixerunt hi: quoniam nos suspicamur, sed quoniam scimus; et non simpliciter, sed quoniam hic vere salvator mundi, non quasi unum ex multis Christum confitentes. Solum verba audierunt, et hoc dixerunt quod dicere habebant, si miracula multa et magna vidissent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Jews disbelieved in spite of miracles, while these exhibited great faith, be fore even a miracle was wrought, and when they had only heard our Lord’s words. And many more believed because of His own word. Why then do not the Evangelists give these words? To show that they omit many important things, and because the result shows what they were; the result being that the whole city was convinced. On the other hand, when the hearers are not convinced, the Evangelists are obliged to give our Lord’s words, that the failure may be seen to be owing to the indifference of the hearers, not to any defect in the preacher. And now, having become Christ’s disciples, they dismiss their first instructor; And they said to the woman, Now we believe not because of your saying: for we have heard Him ourselves, and know that this is indeed the Christ, the Savior of the world. How soon they understand that He was come for the deliverance of the whole world, and could not therefore confine His purposes to the Jews, but must sow the Word every where. Their saying too, The Savior of the world, implies that they looked on this world as miserable and lost; and that, whereas Prophets and Angels had come to save it, this was the only real Savior, the Author not only of temporal but eternal salvation. And, observe, whereas the woman had spoken doubtfully, Is not this the Christ? they do not say, we suspect, but we know, know, that this is indeed the Savior of the world, not one Christ out of many. Though they had only heard His words, they said as much as they could have done, had they seen ever so many and great miracles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Ceterum si meminimus praedictorum, non difficile est conicere quomodo cum repererint verbum sincerum, alias disciplinas relinquunt, quasi dogmatum civitatem, de qua egredientes salutifere credunt. Et puto studiose protulisse Ioannem, cum non dixit: rogabant eum Samaritani intrare tantum Samariam, vel ingredi civitatem, sed etiam ibi manere. Manet namque Iesus penes deprecantes; et praesertim quoties qui precantur exeunt civitatem, et versus eum veniunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. With the aid of our former observations on Jacob’s well, and the water, it wills not be difficult to see, why, when they find the true word, they leave other doctrines, i.e. the city, for a sound faith. Observe, they did not ask our Savior only to enter Samaria, St. John particularly remarks, or enter that city, but to tarry there. Jesus tarries with those who ask Him, and especially with those who go out of the city to Him.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Neque enim capaces erant tertiae diei eius; non enim erant avidi miraculorum quid cernere, quale qui fuerant in Cana Galilaeae post triduum cum Iesu convivantes. Initium autem credendi multis fuit mulieris verbum: non enim sic per seipsum verbum conspicitur illuminans capientem, velut cum alterius dicto sibi testimonium perhibetur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. They were not ready yet for the third day; having no anxiety to see a miracle, as those had who supped with Jesus in Cana of Galilee. (This supper was after He had been in Cana three days.) The woman’s report was the ground of their belief. The enlightening power of the Word itself was not yet visible to them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic ergo Christum cognoverunt primo per famam, postea per praesentiam; sicut agitur hodie cum eis qui foris sunt, et nondum sunt Christiani: Christus nuntiatur per Christianos amicos: tamquam illa muliere, hoc est Ecclesia, nuntiante ad Christum veniunt: credunt per istam feminam; et multo plures et firmius in eum credunt, quoniam vere ipse est salvator mundi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So then they knew Christ first by report of another, afterwards by His own presence; which is still the case of those that are without the fold, and not yet Christians. Christ is announced to them by some charitable Christians, by the report of the woman, i.e. the Church; they come to Christ, they believe on Him, through the instrumentality of that woman; He stays with them two days, i.e. gives them two precepts of charity. And thenceforth their belief is stronger. They believe that He is indeed the Savior of the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Impossibile est namque eamdem circa intellectum fieri passionem videnti, et ei qui per videntem instruitur; magisque est per speciem ambulare quam per fidem; unde hi non solum testimonio hominis, sed ob ipsam quoque veritatem credunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. For it is impossible that the same impression should be produced by hearing from one who has seen, and seeing one’s self; walking by sight is different from walking by faith. The Samaritans now do not believe only from testimony, but from really seeing the truth.

In Samaria biduum fecit, et crediderunt in eum Samaritani: tot dies fecit in Galilaea, et non crediderunt in eum Galilaei; et propter hoc dixit, quod propheta in patria sua honorem non habet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Why then does the Evangelist say immediately, For Jesus Himself testified, that a prophet has no honor in his own country. For He would seem to have testified more to the truth, had He remained in Samaria, and not gone into Galilee. Not so: He stayed two days in Samaria and the Samaritans believed on Him: He stayed the same time in Galilee, and the Galileans did not believe on Him, and therefore He said, that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Ideo hoc adiectum est, quia non in Capharnaum abiit, sed in Galilaeam, et in Cana, ut infra dicetur. Ego enim patriam eum hic aestimo dicere Capharnaum. Quoniam autem non potitus est illic honore, audi eum dicentem: et tu, Capharnaum, quae usque ad caelum exaltata es, usque ad Infernum descendes. Dicit autem hic patriam propriam, in qua videtur plus conversatus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or consider this the reason that He went, not to Capernaum, but to Galilee and Cana, as appears below, His country being, I think, Capernaum. As He did not obtain honor there, hear what He says; And you, Capernaum, which are exalted to heaven, shall be brought down to hell. He calls it His own country, because He had most resided here.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or thus: Our Lord on leaving Samaria for Galilee, explains why He was not always in Galilee: viz. because of the little honor He received there. A prophet has no honor in his own country.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Perscrutanda est autem huius dicti sententia. Patria siquidem prophetarum in Iudaea erat, et est non ignotum quod honorem a Iudaeis nequaquam sunt consecuti, iuxta illud: quemnam prophetarum non persecuti sunt patres vestri? Miranda etiam occurrit huius decreti veracitas, cum pervenerit non tantum ad sanctos prophetas vilipensos a propriis, et ipsum dominum nostrum; sed protensa sit etiam in quosdam prophetiae sequaces contemptos a suis civibus, et ad mortem deductos.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. The country of the prophets was Judea, and every one knows how little honor they received from the Jews, as we read, Whom of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? One cannot but wonder at the truth of this saying, exemplified not only in the contempt cast upon the holy prophets and our Lord Himself, but also in the case of other teachers of wisdom who have been despised by their fellow-citizens and put to death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quid igitur? Nonne videmus et apud suos multos in admirationem deductos? Ita quidem: sed ab his quae raro contingunt non oportet talia pronuntiari. Sed et si in propria patria aliqui honorantur, multo magis in aliena. Consuetudo enim facile homines contemptibiles facere consuevit. Quando igitur venit in Galilaeam, susceperunt eum Galilaei; unde sequitur cum ergo venisset in Galilaeam, exceperunt eum Galilaei. Vides quoniam qui mali dicebantur, hi maxime ad Christum accedere inveniuntur. Nam propter Galilaeos dicitur: interroga, et vide, quoniam propheta ex Galilaea non surrexit. Propter Samaritanos autem improperabant ei: Samaritanus es et Daemonium habes. Sed ecce Samaritani et Galilaei credunt in confusionem Iudaeorum. Inveniuntur autem et Galilaei Samaritanis meliores: nam illi quidem mulieris crediderunt verbis; hi vero videntes signa quae faciebat; unde sequitur cum omnia vidissent quae fecerat Hierosolymis in die festo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But do we not see many held in admiration by their own people? We do; but we cannot argue from a few instances. If some are honored in their own country, many more are honored out of it, and familiarity generally subjects men to contempt. The Galileans however received our Lord: Then when He was come into Galilee, the Galileans received Him. Observe how those who are spoken ill of, are always the first to come to Christ. Of the Galileans we find it said below, Search and, look, for out of Galilee arises no prophet. And He is reproached with being a Samaritan, You are a Samaritan, and have a devil. And yet the Samaritans and Galileans believe, to the condemnation of the Jews. The Galileans however are superior to the Samaritans; for the latter believed from hearing the woman’s words, the former from seeing the signs which He did: Having seen all the things that He did at Jerusalem at the feast.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Quod enim dominus eicit de templo vendentes oves et boves, tam grande reperitur ut his moti Galilaei reciperent dominum, considerantes mirantesque maiestatem eius: non enim minor potentia eius ostenditur in his quam ut caeci videant, audiantque surdi. Aestimo vero nec haec sola ipsum tunc fecisse, sed et alia signa.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Our Lord by ejecting those who sold sheep and oxen from the temple, had impressed the Galileans with a strong idea of His Majesty, and they received Him. His power was shown no less in this act, than in making the blind to see, and the deaf to hear. But probably He had performed some other miracles as well.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. They had seen Him at Jerusalem, For they also went to the feast. Our Lord’s return has a mystical meaning, viz. that, when the Gentiles have been confirmed in the faith by the two precepts of love, i.e. at the end of the world, He will return to His country, i.e. Judea.

And the latter met Jesus on His way from the mountain to Capernaum; whereas the former came to Jesus in Cana. And the latter servant was laid up with the palsy, the former’s son with a fever. Of this nobleman then we read, When he heard that Jesus was come out of Judea into Galilee, he went to Him, and besought Him that He could heal his son: for be was at the point of death.

Here is a blow to that pride which honors human wealth and greatness, and not that nature which is made after the image of God. Our Redeemer, to show that things made much of among men, were to be despised by Saints, and things despised made much of, did not go to the nobleman’s son, but was ready to go to the centurion’s servant.

He wished to find out whether the recovery was accidental, or owing to our Lord’s word. And they said to him, Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him. How obvious is the miracle? His recovery did not take place in an ordinary way, but all at once; in order that it might be seen to be Christ’s doing, and not the result of nature: So the father knew that it was at the same hour, in the which Jesus said to him, your son lives; and himself believed, and his whole house.

Mystice autem, per hoc quod Iesus bis in Galilaeam accedit, binus salvatoris adventus in mundum ostenditur: primus quidem misericordiae, ut vino facto convivas exhilaret; secundus vero ut filium reguli ad mortem pene deductum suscitet, idest populum Iudaeorum, qui post plenitudinem gentium accedet salvandus in fine. Magnus autem rex regum est qui constitutus est a Deo in monte Sion sancto eius: huius qui viderunt diem, et gavisi sunt, reguli dignoscuntur. Arbitramur igitur regulum esse Abraham, aegrotum vero filium eius, Israeliticum genus debilitatum erga cultum divinum; et ideo incaluit ignitis spiculis inimici, ut proinde febrire censeatur. Apparet autem quod praecedentibus sanctis, postquam carnis exuerunt amictum, populus fuit curae: unde legitur in Machab. post mortem Ieremiae: hic est Ieremias propheta Dei, qui plurimum orat pro populo. Abraham igitur obsecrat adiuvari a salvatore populum infirmum. Et quidem potestatis verbum de Cana prodit, ubi dictum est filius tuus vivit; sed verbi efficacia in Capharnaum agitur, nam ibi filius reguli curatus est, quasi in agro consolationis morans; quod significat genus quoddam debilium, non tamen omnino fructibus privatorum. Illud autem nisi signa et prodigia videritis, non creditis, dictum illi, refertur ad multitudinem filiorum suorum, et ad ipsum quodammodo: sicut enim Ioannes expectabat datum sibi signum, scilicet: super quem videris spiritum descendentem, sic et praemortui sancti adventum Christi in carnem et signis et prodigiis manifestandum expectabant. Habebat autem hic regulus non solum filium, sed etiam servos; per quos significatur materies quaedam minus bene et infirme credentium. Nec a casu hora septima deserit filium febris: nam septenarius numerus est quietis.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. The sentence is ambiguous. Taken one way, it means that Jesus after coming to Galilee, performed two miracles, of which that of healing the nobleman’s son was the second: taken another, it means, that of the two miracles which Jesus performed in Galilee, the second was done after coming from Judea into Galilee. The latter is the true and received meaning. Mystically, the two journeys of Christ into Galilee signify His two advents; at the first of which He makes us His guest at supper, and gives us wine to drink; at the second, He raises up the nobleman’s son who was at the point of death, i.e. the Jewish people, who, after the fullness of the Gentiles, attain themselves to salvation. For, as the great King of Kings is He, whom God has seated upon His holy hill of Sion, so the lesser king is he, who saw his day, and was glad, i.e. Abraham. And therefore his sick son is the Jewish people fallen from the true religion, and thrown into a fever in consequence by the fiery darts of the enemy. And we know that the saints of old, even when they had put off the covering of the flesh, made the people the object of their care: for we read in Maccabees, after the death of Jeremiah, This is Jeremias the prophet of the Lord, who prays much for the people. Abraham therefore prays to our Savior to succor his diseased people. Again, the word of power, Your son lives, comes forth from Cana, i.e. the work of the Word, the healing of the nobleman’s son, is done in Capernaum, i.e. the land of consolation. The nobleman’s son signifies the class of believers who though diseased are yet not altogether destitute of fruits. The words, Except you see signs and wonders, you will not believe, are spoken of the Jewish people in general, or perhaps of the nobleman, i.e. Abraham himself, in a certain sense. For as John waited for a sign; on Whom you shall see the Spirit descending; so too the Saints who died before the coming of Christ in the flesh, expected Him to manifest Himself by signs and wonders. And this nobleman too had servants as well as a son; which servants stand for the lower and weaker class of believers. Nor is it chance that the fever leaves the son at the seventh hour; for seven is the number of rest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel quia per septiformem spiritum est omnis remissio peccatorum: septenarius enim in tria et quatuor divisus significat sanctam Trinitatem, in quatuor anni temporibus, in quatuor mundi partibus, in quatuor elementis.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or it was the seventh hour, because all remission of sins is through the sevenfold Spirit; for the number seven divided into three and four, signifies the Holy Trinity, in the four seasons of the world, in the four elements.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Possunt quoque significari duo adventus Christi verbi ad animam: primus quidem ex facto vino praebens animae gaudium spiritualis convivii; secundus vero omnes languoris ac mortis reliquias amputans.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. There may be an allusion in the two journeys to the two advents of Christ in the soul, the first supplying a spiritual banquet of wine, the second taking away all remains of weakness and death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Regulus autem est omnis homo: non solum quia regi universorum propinquus existit secundum animam, sed quia et ipse super omnia principatum sumpsit; cuius filius, idest mens, febricitat voluptatibus pravis et desideriis. Accedit autem ad Iesum, et deprecatur ut descendat; idest, ut condescensu misericordiae utatur, et parcat peccatis, priusquam a voluptatum infirmitate mortificetur. Sed dominus dicit vade, idest, profectum continuum circa bonum ostendas, et tunc filius tuus vivet; si autem ambulare cessaveris, mortificabitur tibi intellectus circa boni operationem.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The little king stands for man generally; man not only deriving his soul from the King of the universe, but having Himself dominion over all things. His son, i.e. his mind, labors under a fever of evil passion and desires. He goes to Jesus and entreats Him to come down; i.e. to exercise the condescension of His pity, and pardon his sins, before it is too late. Our Lord answers; Go your way, i.e. advance in holiness, and then your son will live; but if you stop short in your course, you will destroy the power of understanding and doing right.

Et primum quidem dedit Deus aquam expurgantem corporum sordes et inquinationes non existentes, sed opinatas, puta ea quae a funere, et quae a lepra, et quae ab aliis talibus; deinde infirmitates diversas per aquas facit solvi; unde sequitur in his iacebat multitudo magna languentium, caecorum, claudorum, aridorum expectantium aquae motum. Volens enim Deus propinquius adducere ad Baptismi donum, non adhuc inquinamenta solum mundat, sed etiam aegritudines sanat: sicut enim ministri qui prope regem sunt, his qui sunt a longe clariores sunt; ita et in figuris fit. Non autem simpliciter sanabat aquarum natura; semper enim hoc fieret; sed in Angeli descensione; unde sequitur Angelus autem domini descendebat secundum tempus in piscinam, et movebatur aqua. Sic enim et in baptizatis non simpliciter aqua operatur; sed cum spiritus sancti acceperit gratiam, tunc omnia solvit peccata. Angelus enim descendens turbabat aquam, et sanativam imponebat virtutem; ut discant Iudaei quoniam multo magis Angelorum dominus omnes aegritudines animae sanare potest. Sed tunc quidem infirmitas impedimentum volenti curari fiebat; subditur enim et qui prior descendisset in piscinam post motionem aquae, sanus fiebat a quacumque detinebatur infirmitate. Nunc autem unusquisque accedere potest: non enim Angelus est qui turbat aquam, sed Angelorum dominus, qui omnia operatur. Sed etsi orbis terrarum universus veniat, gratia non consumitur, sed similis manet: sicut enim solares radii per unamquamque illuminant diem, et non consumuntur, neque a multa largitione minor fit solis lux; ita et multo amplius spiritus sancti actio in nullo minuitur a multitudine eorum qui potiuntur ea. Hoc autem fiebat, scilicet ut unus tantum post motionem aquae sanaretur; ut qui didicerant quoniam in aqua aegritudines corporis sanabantur, in hoc per multum tempus exercitati, facile crederent quod et aegritudines animae aqua sanare potest.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This pool was one among many types of that baptism, which was to purge away sin. First God enjoined water for the cleansing from the filth of the body, and from those defilements, which were not real, but legal, e.g. those from death, or leprosy, and the like. Afterwards infirmities were healed by water, as we read: In these (the porches) lay a great multitude of impotent folk, of blind, halt, withered, waiting for the moving of the water. This was a nearer approximation to the gift of baptism, when not only defilements are cleansed, but sicknesses healed. Types are of various ranks, just as in a court, some officers are nearer to the prince, others farther off. The water, however did not heal by virtue of its own natural properties, (for if so the effect would have followed uniformly,) but by the descent of an Angel: For all Angel went down at a certain season into the pool, and troubled the water. In the same way, in Baptism, water does not act simply as water, but receives first the grace of the Holy Spirit, by means of which it cleanses us from all our sins. And the Angel troubled the water, and imparted a healing virtue to it, in order to prefigure to the Jews that far greater power of the Lord of the Angels, of healing the diseases of the soul. But then their infirmities prevented their applying the cure; for it follows, Whosoever then first after the troubling of the water stepped in, was made whole of whatsoever disease he had. But now every one may attain this blessing, for it is not an Angel which troubles the water, but the Lord of Angels, which works every where. Though the whole world come, grace fails not, but remains as full as ever; like the sun’s rays which give light all day, and every day, and yet are not spent. The sun’s light is not diminished by this bountiful expenditure: no more is the influence of the Holy Spirit by the largeness of its outpourings. Not more than one could be cured at the pool; God’s design being to put before men’s minds, and oblige them to dwell upon, the healing power of water; that from the effect of water on the body, they might believe more readily its power on the soul.

But as the soul itself did not know its Restorer, as it had eyes in the flesh to discern visible things, but not in the heart wherewith to know God; our Lord performed cures which could be seen, that He might afterwards work cures which could not be seen. He went to the place, where day a multitude of sick. out of whom He chose one to heal: And a certain man was there, which had an infirmity thirty and eight years.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Non autem confestim eum a principio sanavit; sed primum eum familiarem sibi fecit, per interrogationem futurae fidei faciens viam. Non autem expetit fidem, ut in caecis fecit, dicens: creditis quia possum hoc facere? Quia hic nondum noverat eum manifeste quis esset. Nam alii quidem ex aliis eius virtutem cognoscentes, convenienter haec audiebant; alii vero nondum eum cognoscentes, sed per signa eum cognituri, post miracula requiruntur de fide; unde sequitur hunc cum vidisset Iesus iacentem, et cognovisset quia multum iam tempus haberet, dicit ei: vis sanus fieri? Non hoc quaerit ut discat (hoc enim superfluum esset), sed ut ostenderet illius patientiam, qui triginta et octo annos habens, per unumquemque annum eripi ab aegritudine expectans, assidebat, et non desistebat; et ut cognoscamus propter quam causam dimittens alios, ad hunc venit. Et non dicit: vis, te curabo? Nondum enim aliquid magnum imaginabatur ille de Christo. Non autem turbatus est ad interrogationem, neque dixit: iniuriari mihi venisti, quando interrogas si volo sanus fieri; sed mansuete respondet; sequitur enim respondit ei languidus: domine, hominem non habeo, ut cum turbata fuerit aqua, mittat me in piscinam; dum venio enim ego, alius ante me descendit. Non noverat quis esset qui interrogabat, neque quod curaturus esset eum; opinabatur autem fortasse utilem sibi fore Christum ad mittendum eum in aquam. Sed Christus ostendit quod verbo omnia potest facere; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: surge, tolle grabatum tuum, et ambula.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did not, however, proceed immediately to heal him, but first tried by conversation to bring him into a believing state of mind. Not that He required faith in the first instance, as He did from the blind man, saying, Believe you that I am able to do this? for the lame man could not well know who He was. Persons who in different ways had had the means of knowing Him, were asked this question, and properly so. But there were some who did not and could not know Him yet, but would be made to know Him by His miracles afterwards. And in their case the demand for faith is reserved till after those miracles have taken place: When Jesus saw him lie, and knew that he had been a long time in that case, He said to him, Will you be made whole? He does not ask this question for His own information, (this were unnecessary,) but to bring to light the great patience of the man, who for thirty and eight years had sat year after year by the place, in the hope of being cured; which sufficiently explains why Christ passed by the others, and went to him. And He does not say, Do you wish Me to heal you? for the man had not as yet any idea that He was so great a Person. Nor on the other hand did the lame man suspect any mockery in the question, to make him take offense, and say, Have you come to vex me, by asking me if I would be made whole; but he answered mildly, Sir, I have no man, when the water is troubled, to put me into the pool; but while I am coming, another steps down before me. He had no idea as yet that the Person who put this question to him would heal him, but thought that Christ might probably be of use in putting him into the water. But Christ’s word is sufficient, Jesus said to him, Rise, take up your bed, and walk.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Intuere divinae sapientiae superabundantiam. Non solum sanat, sed et lectum portare iubet: ut et credibile faceret miraculum, et nullus existimet phantasiam esse quod factum est. Non enim, nisi certissime et vehementer compacta essent membra, lectulum ferre possent. Audiens autem languidus quoniam cum potestate et velut iubens dixit surge, tolle grabatum tuum, non derisit dicens: Angelus descendit, et turbat aquam, et solum unum curat, tu autem homo existens ex solo praecepto speras te magis Angelis posse? Sed audivit et non discredidit ei qui iussit, et sanus factus est; unde sequitur et statim sanus factus est homo, et sustulit grabatum suum, et ambulabat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Behold the richness of the Divine Wisdom. He not only heals, but bids him carry his bed also. This was to show the cure was really miraculous, and not a mere effect of the imagination; for the man’s limbs must have become quite sound and compact, to allow him to take up his bed. The impotent man again did not deride and say, The Angel comes down, and troubles the water, and he only cures one each time; do You, who are a mere man, think that you can do more than an Angel? On the contrary, he heard, believed Him who bade him, and was made whole: And immediately the man was made whole, and took up his bed, and walked.

Dicunt ergo Iudaei illi qui sanatus fuerat: sabbatum est; non licet tibi tollere grabatum tuum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This was wonderful, but what follows more so. As yet he had no opposition to face. It is made more wonderful when we see him obeying Christ afterwards in spite of the rage and railing of the Jews: And on the same day was the sabbath.

Sed ille auctorem sanitatis suae obiciebat calumniatoribus; unde sequitur respondit eis: qui me sanum fecit, ille mihi dixit: tolle grabatum tuum, et ambula; quasi dicat: quare non acciperem iussionem a quo acceperam sanitatem?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They did not charge our Lord with healing on the sabbath, for He would have replied that if an ox or an ass of theirs had fallen into a pit, would not they have taken it out on the sabbath day: but they addressed the man as he was carrying his bed, as if to say, Even if the healing could not be delayed, why enjoin the work? He shields himself under the authority of his Healer: He that made me whole, the Same said to me, Take up your bed, and walk: meaning, Why should not I receive a command, if I received a cure from Him?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nimirum si malignari vellet, poterat dicere: si crimen est, accusate eum qui iussit, et deponam lectulum; sed et curationem utique occultasset; etenim sciebat non ita eos id reprehendere ex sabbati solutione, sicut ex infirmitatis sanatione. Sed neque hoc occultavit, neque veniam petiit; sed clara voce beneficium confessus est. Illi vero maligne interrogaverunt; unde subditur interrogaverunt ergo eum: quis est ille homo qui dixit tibi: tolle grabatum tuum, et ambula? Non dicunt: quis est qui fecit te sanum? Sed in medium inducunt id quod transgressio aestimabatur. Sequitur is autem qui sanus fuerat effectus, nesciebat quis esset. Iesus autem declinavit a turba constituta in loco. Et primum quidem ut eo absente testimonium insuspicabile fieret; qui enim adeptus fuerat sanitatem, idoneus erat beneficii testis: demum ut non plus faceret furorem illorum accendi. Solus enim visus eius cui invidetur, non parvam invidentibus immittit scintillam. Propterea discedens permisit ab ipsis suum factum examinari. Quidam aestimant hunc paralyticum esse eum qui in Matthaeo positus est; sed non est: ille enim multos habebat sui curam habentes, et eum ferentes; hic autem nullum. Sed et locus utrorumque diversus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Had he been inclined to deal treacherously, he might have said, If it is a crime, accuse Him Who commanded it, and I will lay down my bed. And he would have concealed his cure, knowing, as he did, that their real cause of offense was not the breaking of the Sabbath, but the miracle. But he neither concealed it, nor asked for pardon, but boldly confessed the cure. They then ask spitefully; What man is that who said to you, Take up your bed, and walk. They do not say, Who is it, who made you whole? but only mention the offense. It follows, And he that was healed wist not who it was, for Jesus had conveyed Himself away, a multitude being in that place. This He had done first, because the man who had been made whole, was the best witness of the cure, and could give his testimony with less suspicion in our Lord’s absence; and secondly, that the fury of men might not be excited more than was necessary. For the mere sight of the object of envy, is no small incentive to envy. For these reasons He departed, and left them to examine the fact for themselves. Some are of opinion, that this is the same with the one who had the palsy, whom Matthew mentions. But he is not. For the latter had many to wait upon, and carry him, whereas this man had none. And the place where the miracle was performed, is different.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Si quidem mediocri corde et humano ingenio consideremus hoc miraculum facientem, quod ad potestatem pertinet, non magnum aliquid fecit; et quod ad benignitatem, parum fecit. Tot iacebant, et unus curatus est, cum posset uno verbo omnes erigere. Quid ergo intelligendum est, nisi quia potestas illa et bonitas magis agebat quid animae in factis eius pro salute sempiterna intelligerent, quam quid pro temporali salute corpora mererentur? In illis enim factis quicquid temporaliter sanatum est, in membris mortalibus in fine defecit; anima quae credidit, ad vitam aeternam transitum fecit. Piscina ista et aqua illa populum mihi videtur significasse Iudaeorum: significari enim populus nomine aquarum, aperte nobis indicat Apocalypsis Ioannis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Judging on low and human notions of this miracle, it is not at all a striking display of power, and only a moderate one of goodness. Of so many, who lay sick, only one was healed; though, had He chosen, He could have restored them all by a single word. How must we account for this? By supposing that His power and goodness were asserted more for imparting a knowledge of eternal salvation to the soul, than working a temporal cure on the body. That which received the temporal cure was certain to decay at last, when death arrived: whereas the soul which believed passed into life eternal. The pool and the water seem to me to signify the Jewish people: for John in the Apocalypse obviously uses water to express people.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Bene autem piscina probatica fuisse describitur. Ille enim populus ovis nomine significatur, secundum illud: nos populus tuus, et oves gregis tui.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. It is fitly described as a sheep pool. By sheep are meant people, according to the passage, We are your people, and the sheep of your pasture.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The water then, i.e. the people, was enclosed within five porches, i.e. the five books of Moses. But those books only betrayed the impotent, and did not recover them; that is to say, the Law convicted the sinner, but did not absolve him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Denique multa genera languentium in eadem iacuerunt: caeci scilicet qui scientiae lumine carent; claudi, qui ad ea quae iubentur implenda, vires non habent; aridi, qui supernae dilectionis pinguedine carent.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Lastly, many kinds of impotent folk lay near the pool: the blind, i.e. those who are without the light of knowledge; the lame, i.e. those who have not strength to do what they are commanded; the withered, i.e. those who have not the marrow of heavenly love.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Venit autem Christus ad populum Iudaeorum, et faciendo magna, docendo utilia, turbavit peccatores, idest aquam, praesentia sua, et excitavit ad passionem suam. Sed latens turbavit: si enim cognovissent, nunquam gloriae dominum crucifixissent. Subito enim videbatur aqua turbata, et a quo turbabatur non videbatur. Descendere ergo in aquam turbatam, hoc est humiliter credere in domini passionem. Ibi sanatur unus, significans Ecclesiae unitatem; postea quisquis veniret non sanabatur; quia quisquis praeter unitatem fuerit, sanari non poterit. Vae illis qui oderunt unitatem, et partem sibi faciunt in hominibus. Habebat autem triginta et octo annos in infirmitate qui sanatus est: hic enim numerus ad languorem pertinet magis quam ad sanitatem. Quadragenarius enim numerus sacratus nobis in quadam perfectione commendatur: quia lex in decem praeceptis data est, et praedicanda erat per totum mundum, qui quatuor partibus commendatur: denarius autem per quatuor multiplicatus ad quadragenarium pervenit. Vel quia per Evangelium, quod quatuor libros habet, impletur lex. Si ergo quadragenarius numerus habet perfectionem legis, et lex non impletur nisi in gemino praecepto caritatis, quid miraris, quia languebat qui quadraginta, minus duos, habebat? Necessarius erat illi homo ad sanitatem, sed homo ille qui et Deus est: et quia illum iacentem duobus minus invenit, duo quaedam iubendo, quod minus erat implevit. In duobus enim domini iussis duo praecepta significata sunt caritatis. Dei dilectio prior est ordine praecipiendi, proximi autem dilectio prior est ordine faciendi. Dicit ergo tolle grabatum tuum; quasi diceret: cum esses languidus, portabat te proximus tuus: sanus factus es, porta proximum tuum. Dicit etiam ambula. Sed quo iter agis nisi ad dominum Deum tuum?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So then Christ came to the Jewish people, and by means of mighty works, and profitable lessons, troubled the sinners, i.e. the water, and the stirring continued till He brought on His own passion. But He troubled the water, unknown to the world. For had they known Him, they would not hare crucified the Lord of glory. But the troubling of the water came on all at once, and it was not seen who troubled it. Again, to go down into the troubled water, is to believe humbly on our Lord’s passion. Only one was healed, to signify the unity of the Church: whoever came afterwards was not healed, to signify that whoever is out of this unity cannot be healed. Wo to them who hate unity, and raise sects. Again, he who was healed had had his infirmity thirty and eight years: this being a number which belongs to sickness, rather than to health. The number forty has a sacred character with us, and is significative of perfection. For the Law was given in Ten Commandments, and was to be preached throughout the whole world, which consists of four parts; and four multiplied into ten, make up the number forty. And the Law too is fulfilled by the Gospel, which is written in four books. So then if the number forty possesses the perfectness of the Law, and nothing fulfills the Law, except the twofold precept of love, why wonder at the impotence of him, who was two less than forty? Some man was necessary for his recovery; but it was a man who was God. He found the man falling short by the number two, and therefore gave two commandments, to fill up the deficiency. For the two precepts of our Lord signify love; the love of God being first in order of command, the love of our neighbor, in order of performance. Take up your bed, our Lord said, meaning, When you were impotent, your neighbor carried you; now you are made whole, carry your neighbor. And walk; but whither, except to the Lord your God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quid enim est dicere surge et ambula, nisi a torpore et ignavia, in quibus prius iacebas, erigere, et in bonis operibus proficere stude? Tolle grabatum tuum, idest proximum tuum, a quo portaris, et ipse patienter tolera.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. What mean the words, Arise, and walk; except that you should raise yourself from your torpor and indolence, and study to advance in good works. Take up your bed, i.e. your neighbor by which you are carried, and bear him patiently thyself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Porta ergo eum cum quo ambulas, ut ad eum pervenias cum quo manere desideras. Ille autem nondum Iesum noverat, quia et nos credimus in eum quem non videmus; et ut non videatur declinat a turba. Quadam solitudine intentionis videtur Deus; turba strepitum habet; visio ista secretum desiderat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Carry him then with whom you walk, that you may come to Him with Whom you desire to abide. As yet however he wist not who Jesus was; just as we too believe in Him though we see Him not. Jesus again does not wish to be seen, but conveys Himself out of the crowd. It is in a kind of solitude of the mind, that God is seen: the crowd is noisy; this vision requires stillness.

Dicunt enim quidam: numquid quia in brevi temporis momento adulteratus sum, immortaliter crucior? Vide quod hic tanto tempore pro peccatis cruciabatur: non enim temporis mensura peccata iudicantur, sed ipsa delictorum natura. Cum his autem et illud discimus, quod si gravem sustineamus poenam pro prioribus peccatis, deinde in eadem inciderimus, graviora patiemur; et hoc decenter: qui enim neque supplicio factus est melior, ut insensibilis de reliquo et contemptor, ad maius ducetur tormentum. Si autem hic non omnes pro peccatis torquentur, non confidamus: nihil enim nos hic pati pro peccatis, signum est maioris illic futuri supplicii. Non autem omnes aegritudines sunt ex peccatis, sed plures. Quaedam enim et a pigritia fiunt, quaedam propter probationem, sicut in Iob. Sed propter quid paralytico huic Christus de peccatis mentionem facit? Quidam huic paralytico detrahentes, dicunt eum Christi fuisse accusatorem, et propter hoc haec audisse: quid igitur dicent de paralytico qui est apud Matthaeum? Etenim et illi dictum est: dimittuntur tibi peccata tua. Neque etiam Christus hunc incusat de praeteritis, sed ad futurum eum munit solum. Alios igitur curans, peccatorum non meminit: quia his paralyticis ex peccatis aegritudines sunt factae, aliis autem ex infirmitate naturali. Vel per hos reliquos omnes admonet. Cum his autem et illud est dicere, quoniam multam vidit inesse animae huius patientiam, et ut valentem suscipere admonitionem eum admonet.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Here we learn in the first place, that his disease was the consequence of his sins. We are apt to bear with great indifference the diseases of our souls; but, should the body suffer ever so little hurt, we have recourse to the most energetic remedies. Wherefore God punishes the body for the offenses of the soul. Secondly, we learn, that there is really a Hell. Thirdly, that it is a place of lasting and infinite punishment. Some say indeed, Because we have corrupted ourselves for a short time, shall we be tormented eternally? But see how long this man was tormented for his sins. Sin is not to be measured by length of time, but by the nature of the sin itself. And besides this we learn, that if, after undergoing a heavy punishment for our sins, we fall into them again, we shall incur another and a heavier punishment still: and justly; for one, who has undergone punishment, and has not been made better by it, proves himself to be a hardened person, and a despiser; and, as such, deserving of still greater torments. Nor let it embolden us, that we do not see all punished for their offenses here: for if men do not suffer for their offenses here, it is only a sign that their punishment will be the greater hereafter. Our diseases however do not always arise from sins; but only most commonly so. For some spring from other lax habits: some are sent for the sake of trial, as Job’s were. But why does Christ make mention of this palsied man’s sins? Some say, because he had been an accuser of Christ. And shall we say the same of the man afflicted with the palsy? For he too was told, Your sins are forgiven you? The truth is, Christ does not find fault with the man here for his past sins, but only warns him against future. In heeling others, however, He makes no mention of sins at all: so that it would seem to be the case that the diseases of these men had arisen from their sins; whereas those of the others had come from natural causes only. Or perhaps through these, He admonishes all the rest. Or he may have admonished this men, knowing his great patience of mind, and that he w would bear an admonition. It is a disclosure too of His divinity, for He implies in saying, Sin no more, that He knew what sins He had committed.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He was not so insensible to the benefit, and the advice he had received, as to have any malignant aim in speaking this news. Had it been done to disparage Christ, he could have concealed the cure, and put forward the offense. But he does not mention Jesus’ saying, Take up your bed, which was an offense in the eyes of the Jews; but told the Jews that it was Jesus which had made him whole.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sic igitur ille annuntiabat, et illi insaniebant; unde sequitur propterea persequebantur Iudaei Iesum, quia hoc faciebat in sabbato. Manifestum enim opus corporale factum erat ante oculos Iudaeorum, non sanitas corporis, sed deportatio grabati, quae non videbatur ita necessaria quemadmodum sanitas. Aperte ergo dicit dominus, sacramentum sabbati, et signum observandi unius diei ad tempus datum esse Iudaeis; impletionem vero ipsam sacramenti in illo venisse, cum sequitur Iesus autem respondit eis: pater meus usque modo operatur, et ego operor; quasi dicat: nolite putare quia sabbato ita requievit pater meus ut ex illo non operetur; sed sicut ipse nunc operatur sine labore, operor et ego. Sed ideo dictum est, Deum requievisse, quia iam creaturam nullam condebat postquam perfecta sunt omnia. Quietem vero propterea appellavit Scriptura, ut nos admoneret post bona opera quieturos. Et sicut Deus postquam fecit hominem ad imaginem et similitudinem suam, et perfecit omnia opera sua bona valde, requievit septimo die; sic et tibi requiem non speres, nisi cum redieris ad similitudinem in qua factus es, quam peccato perdidisti; et nisi cum bona fueris operatus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This announcement enraged them, And therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, because He had done these things on the sabbath day. A plain bodily work had been done before their eyes, distinct from the healing of the man’s body, and which could not have been necessary, even if healing was; viz. the carrying of the bed. Wherefore our Lord openly says, that the sacrament of the Sabbath, the sign of observing one day out of seven, was only a temporary institution, which had attained its fulfillment in Him: But Jesus answered them, my Father works hitherto, and I work: as if He said, Do not suppose that My Father rested on the Sabbath in such a sense, as that from that time forth, He has ceased from working; for He works up to this time, though without labor, and so work I. God’s resting means only that He made no other creature, after the creation. The Scripture calls it rest, to remind us of the rest we shall enjoy after a life of good works here. And as God only when He had made man in His own image and similitude, and finished all His works, and seen that they were very good, rested on the seventh day: so do you expect no rest, except you return to the likeness in which you were made, but which you have lost by sin; i.e. unless you do good works.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. It may be said then, that the observance of the sabbath was imposed on the Jews, as the shadow of something to come; viz. that spiritual rest, which God, by the figure of His own rest promised to all who should perform good works.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>Augustinus super Genesim</b>: Cuius etiam quietis ipse dominus Iesus mysterium sua sepultura confirmavit: ipso quippe die sabbati requievit in sepulchro, postquam sexto die consummavit opera sua, quando ait: consummatum est. Quid ergo mirum si Deus istum diem, quo erat Christus in sepultura quieturus, volens etiam hoc modo praenuntiare, ab operibus suis in uno die requievit, deinceps operaturus ordinem saeculorum? Potest etiam intelligi, Deum requievisse a condendis generibus creaturae, quia ultra iam non condidit aliqua genere nova. Deinceps autem usque nunc et ultra operatur eorumdem generum administrationem, quae tunc instituta sunt, non ut ipso saltem die septimo potentia eius a caeli et terrae omniumque rerum quas condiderat gubernatione cessaret; alioquin continuo dilaberentur: creatoris namque potentia causa est abstinendi omni creaturae, quae ab eis quae creata sunt regendis si aliquando cessaret, simul et eorum cessaret species, omnisque natura concideret. Neque enim sicut structuram aedium cum fabricaverit quis abscedit, atque illo cessante stat opus eius; ita mundus vix ictu oculi stare potest, si ei Deus regimen suum subtraxerit. Proinde quod dominus ait pater meus usque modo operatur, continuationem quamdam operis eius, quae universam creaturam continet atque administrat, ostendit. Aliter enim posset intelligi, si diceret: et nunc operatur; ubi non esset necesse ut operis continuationem acciperemus. Aliter autem cogit intelligi, cum ait usque nunc, ex illo scilicet quo cuncta cum conderet operatus est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The mystery of which rest the Lord Jesus Himself sealed by His burial: fore He rested in His sepulcher on the sabbath, having on the sixth day finished all His work, inasmuch as He said, It is finished. What wonder then that God, to prefigure the day on which Christ was to rest in the grave, rested one day from His works, afterwards to carry on the work of governing the world. We may consider too that God, when He rested, rested from the work of creation simply, i.e. made no more new kinds of creatures: but that from that time till now, He has been carrying on the government of those creatures. For His power, as respects the government of heaven and earth, and all the things that He had made, did not cease on the seventh day: they would have perished immediately, without His government: because the power of the Creator is that on which the existence of every creature depends. If it ceased to govern, every species of creation would cease to exist: and all nature would go to nothing. For the world is not like a building, which stands after the architect has left it; it could not stand the twinkling of an eye, if God withdrew His governing hand. Therefore when our Lord says, My Father works hitherto, he means the continuation of the work; the holding together, and governing of the creation. It might have been different, had He said, Works even now. This would not have conveyed the sense of confirming. As it is we find it, Until now; i.e. from the time of the creation downwards.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ergo tamquam diceret Iudaeis: quid expectatis ut non operer sabbato? Sabbati dies vobis ad significationem meam praeceptus est. Opera Dei attenditis, per me facta sunt omnia. Operatus est pater lucem; sed dixit ut fieret. Si dixit: verbo operatus est, et verbum eius ego sum. Pater meus et tunc operatus est cum fecit mundum, et usque nunc operatur cum regit mundum: ergo et per me fecit cum fecit, et per me regit cum regit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He says then, as it were, to the Jews, Why think you that I should not work on the sabbath? The sabbath day was instituted as a type of Me. You observe the works of God: by Me all things were made. The Father made light, but He spoke, that it might be made. If He spoke, then He made it by the Word; and I am His Word. My Father worked when He made the world, and He works until now, governing the world: and as He made the world by Me, when He made it, so He governs it by Me, now He governs it.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et quidem Christus, cum discipulos excusare oportebat, David conservum eorum in medium ferebat; quando vero de seipso erat accusatio, ad patrem refugit. Considerandum etiam, quod neque ut homo solum excusat, sed neque ut Deus solum: sed quandoque hoc, quandoque illo modo. Volebat enim utrumque credi, et condescensionis dispensationem et deitatis dignitatem. Unde hic aequalitatem sui ad patrem ostendit, et in dicendo eum patrem singulariter (dicit enim pater meus) et in agendo eadem illi (dicit enim et ego operor); unde sequitur propterea ergo magis quaerebant eum Iudaei interficere, quia non solum solvebat sabbatum, sed et patrem suum dicebat Deum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ defended His disciples, by putting forward the example of their fellow-servant David: but He defends Himself by a reference to the Father. We may observe too that He does not defend Himself as man, nor yet purely as God, but sometimes as one, sometimes as the other; wishing both to be believed, both the dispensation of His humiliation, and the dignity of His Godhead; wherefore He shows His equality to the Father, both by calling Him His Father emphatically. (My Father), and by declaring that He does the same things, that the Father does, (And I work). Therefore, it follows, the Jews sought the more to kill Him, because he not only had broken the sabbath, but said also that God was His Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non quomodocumque, sed quia aequalem se fecit Deo: nam omnes dicimus Deo: pater noster, qui es in caelis. Legimus et Iudaeos dixisse: cum tu sis pater noster. Ergo non hic irascebantur quia patrem suum dicebat Deum, sed quod longe alio modo quam homines.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. i.e. not in the secondary sense in which it is true of all of us, but as implying equality. For we all of us say to God, Our Father, Which art in heaven. And the Jews say, You are our Father. They were not angry then because He called God His Father, but because He called Him so in a sense different from men.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The words, My Father works hitherto, and I work, suppose Him to be equal to the Father. This being understood, it followed from the Father’s working, that the Son worked: inasmuch as the Father does nothing without the Son.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si vero non naturalis esset filius, nec eiusdem substantiae, haec excusatio maior accusatione esset.

Sed quia par est dignitas filii ad patrem, propterea perfecta excusatio est. Sicut igitur pater operans sabbato, absolutus est a crimine, ita et filius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Were He not the Son by nature, and of the same substance, this defense would be worse than the former accusation made. For no prefect could clear Himself from a transgression of the king’s law, by urging that the king broke it also. But, on the supposition of the Son’s equality to the Father, the defense is valid. It then follows, that as the Father worked on the Sabbath without doing wrong: the Son could do so likewise.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Qui vero nolunt cum bona mente hoc suscipere, dicunt quod Christus non fecit se aequalem Deo, sed Iudaei hoc suspicabantur; sed ad hoc per ea quae supra dicta sunt superveniamus.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Those however who are not well-disposed to this doctrine, do not admit that Christ made Himself equal to the Father, but only that the Jews thought He did. But let us consider what has gone before. That the Jews persecuted Christ, and that He broke the sabbath, and said that God was His Father, is unquestionably true. That which immediately follows then from these premises, viz. His making Himself equal with God, is true also.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And again, had it been that our Lord Himself did not mean this, but that the Jews misunderstood Him, He would not have overlooked their mistake. Nor would the Evangelist have omitted to remark upon it, as he does upon our Lord’s speech, Destroy this temple.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non tamen Iudaei intellexerunt Christum esse filium Dei; sed intellexerunt in verbis Christi, quia talis commendaretur filius Dei quod aequalis esset Deo.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Jews however did not understand from our Lord that he was the Son of God, but only that He was equal with God; though Christ gave this as the result of His being the Son of God. It is from not seeing this, while they saw at the same time that equality was asserted, that they charged Him with making Himself equal with God: the truth being, that He did not make Himself equal, but the Father had begotten Him equal.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He refers to the charge of violating the sabbath, brought against Him. My Father works hitherto, and I work; meaning that He had a precedent for claiming the right He did; and that what He did was in reality His Father’s doing, who acted in the Son. And to quiet the jealousy which had been raised, because by the use of His Father’s name He had made Himself equal with God, and to assert the excellency of His birth and nature, He says, Verily, verily, I say to you, The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do.

Sed si Deus erat verbum, et est Deus maior et Deus minor, duos deos colimus, non unum Deum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Some who would be thought Christians, the Arian heretics, who say that the very Son of God who took our flesh upon Him, was inferior to the Father, take advantage of these words to throw discredit upon our doctrine, and say, You see that when our Lord perceived the Jews to be indignant, because He seemed to make Himself equal with God, He gave such an answer as showed that He was not equal. For they say, he who can do nothing but what he sees the Father do is not equal but inferior to the Father. But if there is a greater God, and a less God, (the Word being God,) we worship two Gods, and not one.

Quia ergo substantia filii de patre est, ideo potentia filii de patre est; quia ergo filius non est a se, ideo non potest a se. Sic ergo non potest filius a se facere quidquam, nisi quod viderit patrem facientem: quia videre filii hoc est natum esse de patre; non alia visio est eius et alia substantia eius: totum quod est, de patre est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if He said: Why are you offended that I called God My Father, and that I make Myself equal with God? I am equal, but equal in such a sense as is consistent with His having begotten Me; with My being from Him, not Him from Me. With the Son, being and power are one and the same thing. The Substance of the Son then being of the Father, the power of the Son is of tile Father also: and as the Son is not of Himself, so He can not of Himself. The Son can do nothing of Himself, but what He sees the Father do. His seeing and His being born of the Father are the same. His vision is not distinct from His Substance, but the whole together is of the Father.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. That the wholesome order of our confession, i.e. that we believe in the Father and the Son, might remain, He shows the nature of His birth; viz. that He derived the power of acting not from au accessible of strength supplied for each work, but by His own knowledge in the first instance. And this knowledge He derived not from any particular visible precedents, as if what the Father had done, the Son could do afterwards; but that the Son being born of the Father, and consequently conscious of the Father’s virtue and nature within Him, could do nothing but what He saw the Father do: as he here testifies; God does not see by bodily organs, but by the virtue of His nature.

Cum ergo dixisset non potest filius a se facere quidquam, ne forte carnalis subreperet intellectus, ut faceret sibi homo quasi duos fabros, unum magistrum, alterum discipulum, ut quomodo ille fecit arcam, iste faciat alteram, secutus ait quaecumque enim ille fecerit, haec et filius similiter facit. Non ait: quaecumque pater facit, et filius alia similia facit; sed: haec eadem. Mundum pater, mundum filius, mundum spiritus sanctus. Si unus Deus pater, et filius, et spiritus sanctus, unus mundus factus a patre per filium in spiritu sancto. Haec ergo eadem facit. Addit autem similiter, ne alius error in animo nasceretur. Videtur enim corpus hoc idem facere quod animus, sed non similiter: animus enim imperat corpori: corpus visibile est, animus invisibilis. Ut faceret aliquid servus, iubente domino fecit: idem ab utroque factum est; sed numquid similiter? Non ergo sic pater, et filius; sed haec eadem facit, et similiter facit; ut intelligamus simili potentia facere filium eadem ipsa quae facit pater. Aequalis igitur est patri filius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Yet that walking of the flesh upon the sea was done by the Father through the Son. For when the flesh walked, and the Divinity of the Son guided, the Father was not absent, as the Son Himself said below, The Father that dwells in Me, He does the works. He guards however against the carnal. interpretation of the words, The Son can do nothing of Himself. As if the case were like that of two artificers, master and disciple, one of whom made a chest, and the other made another like it, by adding, For whatsoever things he does, these do the Son likewise. He does not say, Whatsoever the Father does, the Son does other things like them, but the very same things. The Father made the world, the Son made the world, the Holy Ghost made the world. If the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost are one, it follows that one and the same world was made by the Father, through the Son, in the Holy Ghost. Thus it is the very same thing that the Son does. He adds likewise, to prevent another error arising. For the body seems to do the same things with the mind, but it does not do them in a like way, inasmuch as the body is subject, the soul governing, the body visible, the soul invisible. When a slave does a thing at the command of his master, the same thing is done by both; but is it in a like way? Now in the Father and Son there is not this difference; they do the same things, and in a like way. Father and Son act with the same power; so that the Son is equal to the Father.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Or thus; All things and the same, He says, to show the virtue of His nature, its being the same with God’s. That is the same nature, which can do all the same things. And as the Son does all the same things in a like way, the likeness of the works excludes the notion of the worker existing alone g. Thus we come to a true idea of the Nativity, as our faith receives it: the likeness of the works bearing witness to the Nativity, their sameness to the Nature.

Non enim imbecillitatem filii, sed multam eius virtutem ostendit hoc verbum. Sicut enim cum dicimus: impossibile est Deum peccare, non imbecillitatem eius accusamus, sed ineffabilem quamdam virtutem eius testamur; ita cum dicit filius: non possum a meipso facere quidquam, hoc dicit, quoniam impossibile est eum facere aliquid contrarium patri.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus; That the Son can do nothing of Himself, must be understood to mean, that He can do nothing contrary to, or displeasing to, the Father. And therefore He does not say that He does nothing contrary, but that He can do nothing; in order to show His perfect likeness, and absolute equality to the Father. Nor is this a sign of weakness in the Son, but rather of goodness. For as when we say that it is impossible for God to sin, we do not charge Him with weakness, but bear witness to a certain ineffable goodness; so when the Son says, I can do nothing of myself, it only means, that He can do nothing contrary to the Father.

Arian</b>: Hoc autem non deficientis est, sed in eo quod de patre natus est, permanentis; tamque laudabile est omnipotentem non posse mutari, quam laudabile est quod omnipotens non potest mori. Posset enim filius facere quod non vidisset patrem facientem, si posset facere quod per illum non facit pater; hoc est, si posset peccare: neque naturae immutabiliter bonae quae a patre est genita conveniret. Hoc autem quia non potest, non deficienter non potest, sed potenter.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This is not a sign of failing in Him, but of His abiding in His birth from the Father. And it is as high an attribute of the Almighty that He does not change, as it is that Ho does not die. The Son could do what He had not seen the Father doing, if He could do what the Father does not do through Him; i.e. if He could sin: a supposition inconsistent with the immutably good nature which was begotten from the Father. That He cannot do; this then is to be understood of Him, not in the sense of deficiency, but of power.

Si enim humilius producit verba quaedam, non mireris: quia enim persequebantur eum excelsa audientes, et contrarium Deo esse aestimabant, parum per verba remisit.

For it the Father does all things by Himself, so does the Son also, if this likewise is to stand good. You see how high a meaning these humble words bear. He gives His thoughts a humble dress purposely. For whenever He expressed Himself loftily, He was persecuted, as an enemy of God.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Cum ergo dixisset et se eadem facere, et similiter quae facit pater, subdit pater enim diligit filium, et omnia demonstrat ei quaecumque ipse facit. Ad hoc quod supra dixit nisi quod viderit patrem facere, videtur pertinere et quod omnia demonstrat ei quae ipse facit. Sed rursus mortalis cogitatio perturbatur: dicet enim aliquis: seorsum facit pater, ut possit filius videre quod facit; velut si faber doceat filium artem suam, et demonstret ei quicquid facit, ut possit et ipse facere quod viderit patrem facientem. Cum ergo pater facit, filius non facit, ut possit videre filius quod pater facit. Porro si fixum atque inconcussum tenemus, quia per filium omnia pater facit, antequam faciat demonstrat filio. Ubi etiam demonstrat filio pater quod facit, nisi in ipso filio, per quem facit? Si enim pater exemplo faciat, et filius attendat manus patris quemadmodum faciat, ubi est illa inseparabilitas Trinitatis? Non ergo faciendo demonstrat pater filio, sed demonstrando facit per filium. Videt enim patrem filius demonstrantem antequam aliquid fiat, et ex demonstratione patris, et visione filii fit quod fit a patre per filium. Sed dices: ostendo filio meo quod volo facere, et facit ipse, atque ego per ipsum. Sed verba dicturus es filio tuo. Sed ipse filius est verbum patris. Numquid ergo per verbum loqueretur ad verbum? An quia filius magnum est verbum, minora verba transitura erant inter patrem et filium, et sonus aliquis, et quasi creatura quaedam temporalis exitura erat ex ore patris, et percussura aurem filii? Remove omnia corporalia: simplicitatem vide, si simplex es; si non potes comprehendere quid sit Deus, vel hoc comprehendere quid non Deus sit. Multum proficies, si non aliud quam est senseris de Deo. In mente tua vide quod volo dicere: in qua video memoriam et cogitationem. Demonstrat memoria tua cogitationi tuae Carthaginem, et quod in illa erat antequam intenderes, conversae ad se cogitationi ostendit. Ecce facta est a memoria demonstratio, facta est in cogitatione visio, et nulla verba in medio cucurrerunt, nullum ex corpore signum datum est; sed tamen omnia quae in memoria tenes, forinsecus accepisti. Pater quae demonstrat filio, non accepit extrinsecus: intus totum agitur; quia nihil creaturarum esset extrinsecus, nisi pater hoc fecisset per filium; et eam pater demonstrando fecit, quia per filium videntem fecit. Sic ergo demonstrans pater filii visionem gignit, quemadmodum pater filium gignit. Demonstratio quippe generat visionem, non visio demonstrationem. Quod si purius et perfectius intueri valeremus, fortassis inveniremus nec aliud esse patrem, aliud eius demonstrationem, nec aliud filium, aliud eius visionem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Having said that He did the same A things that the Father did, and in a like way, He adds, For the Father loves the Son, and shows Him all things that Himself does. And shows Him all things that Himself does: this has a reference to the words above; But what He sees the Father do. But again, our human ideas are perplexed, and one may say, So then the Father first does something, that the Son may see what He does; just as an artificer teaches his son his art, and shows him what he makes, that he may be able to make the same after him. On this supposition, when the Father does a thing, the Son does not do it; in that the Son is beholding what His Father does. But we hold it as a fixed and incontrovertible truth, that the Father makes all things through the Son, and therefore He must show them to the Son, before He makes them. And where does the Father show the Son what He makes, except in the Son I Himself, by whom He makes them? For if the Father makes a thing for a pattern, and the Son attends to the workmanship as it goes on, where is the indivisibility of the Trinity? The Father therefore does not show the Son what He does by doing it, but by showing does it, through the Son. The Son sees, and the Father shows, before a thing is made, and from the showing of the Father, and the seeing of the Son, that is made which is made; made by the Father, through the Son. But you will say, I show my Son what I wish him to make, and he makes it, and I make it through him. True; but before you do any thing, you show it to your son, that he may do it for your example, and you by him; but you speak to your son words which are not yourself; whereas the Son Himself is the Word of the Father; and could He speak by the Word to the Word? Or, because the Son was the great Word, were lesser words to pass between the Father and the Son, or a certain sound and temporary creation, as it were, to go out of the mouth of the Father, and strike the ear of the Son? Put away these bodily notions, and if you are simple, see the truth in simplicity. If you can not comprehend what God is, comprehend at least what He is not. You will have advanced no little way, if you think nothing that is untrue of God. See what I am saying exemplified in your own mind. You have memory, and thought, your memory shows to your thought Carthage: before you perceive what is in her, she shows it to thought, which is turned toward her: the memory then has shown, the thought has perceived, and no words have passed between them, no outward sign been used. But whatever is in your memory, you receive from without: that which the Father shows to the Son, He does not receive from without; the whole goes on within; there being no creature existing without, but what the Father has made by the Son. And the Father makes by showing, in that He makes by, the Son who sees. The Father’s showing begets the Son’s seeing, as the Father begets the Son? Showing begets seeing, not seeing showing. But it would be more correct, and more spiritual, not to view the Father as distinct from His showing, or the Son from His seeing.

For He says that the works of the Father were shown to Him, not that strength was supplied Him for the doing of them, in order to teach that this showing is substantially nothing else than His birth; for that simultaneously with the Son Himself is born the Son’s knowledge of the works the Father will do through Him.

Quomodo enim anima, quae inferior Deo est, id quod ipsa inferius est, hoc est corpus, vivere facit, sic eamdem animam non facit beate vivere, nisi quod ipsa anima superius est, scilicet Deus.

Respondet: cum unus ex minimis meis discit, ego disco.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But now from Him whom we called co-eternal with the Father, who saw the Father’ and existed in that He saw, we return to the things of time, And He will show him greater works than these. But if He will show him, i.e. is about to show him, He has not yet shown him: and when He does show him, others also will see; for it follows, That you may believe. It is difficult to see what the eternal Father can show in time to the co-eternal Son, Who knows all that exists within the Father’s mind. For as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them even so the Son quickens whom He will. To raise the dead was a greater work than to heal the sick. But this is explained by considering that He Who a little before spoke as God, now begins to speak as man. As man, and therefore living in time, He will be strewn greater works in time. Bodies will rise again by the human dispensation by which the Son of God assumed manhood in time; but souls by virtue of the eternity of the Divine Substance. For which reason it was said before that the Father loved the Son, and showed Him what things soever He did. For the Father shows the Son that souls are raised up; for they are raised up by the Father and the Son, even as they cannot live, except God give them life. Or the Father is about to show this to us, not to Him; according to what follows, That you may believe. This being the reason why the Father would show Him greater things than these. But why did He not say, shall show you, instead of the Son? Because we are members of the Son, and He, as it were, learns in His members, even as He suffers in us. For as He says, Inasmuch as you have done it to one of the least of these My brethren, you have done it to Me: so if we ask Him, how He, the Teacher of all things, learns, He replies, When one of the least of My brethren learns, I learn.

These are plainly greater works, for it is more of a miracle that a dead man should rise again, than that a sick mall should recover. We must not understand from the words, that some are raised by the Father, others by the Son; but that the Son raises to life the same whom the Father raises. And to guard against any one saying, The Father raises the dead by the Son, the former by His own power, the latter, like an instrument, by another power, He asserts distinctly the power of the Son: The Son quickens whom he will. Observe here not only the power of the Son, but also His will. Father and Son have the same power and will. The Father wills nothing distinct from the Son; but both have the same will, even as they have the same substance.

Vel aliter de resurrectione animarum dictum est sicut pater suscitat mortuos, et cetera. Resurrectione autem corporum sic dicit: neque enim pater iudicat quemquam, et cetera. Resurrectio enim animarum fit per substantiam patris et filii, et ideo id simul operantur pater et filius: resurrectio vero corporum fit per dispensationem humanitatis non patri coaeternam. Sed vide quomodo verbum Christi mentem nostram huc atque illuc ducit, et uno carnis loco remanere non sinit; ut versando exerceat, exercendo mundet, mundando capaces reddat, capaces factos impleat.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But who are these dead, whom the Father and Son raise to life? He alludes to the general resurrection which is to be; not to the resurrection of those few, who were raised to life, that the rest might believe; as Lazarus, who rose again, to die afterwards. Having said then, For as the Father raises up the dead, and quickens them, to prevent our taking the words to refer to the dead whom He raised up for the sake of the miracle, and not to the resurrection to life eternal, He adds, For the Father judges no man; thus showing that He spoke of that resurrection of the dead which would take place at the judgment. Or the words, As the Father raises up the dead, &amp;c. refer to the resurrection of the soul; For the Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son, to the resurrection of the body. For the resurrection of the soul takes place by the substance of the Father and the Son, and therefore it is the work of the Father and the Son together: but the resurrection of the body takes place by a dispensation of the Son’s humanity, which is a temporal dispensation, and not co-eternal with the Father. But see how the Word of Christ leads the mind in different directions, not allowing it any carnal resting place; but by variety of motion exercising it, by exercise purifying it, by purifying enlarging its capacity, and after enlarging filling it. He said just before that the Father showed what things soever He did to the Son. So I saw, as it were, the Father working, and the Son waiting: now again I see the Son working, the Father resting.

What is meant is, that in the judgment, not the form of God but the form of the Son of man will appear; not because He will not judge Who has given all judgment to the Son; since the Son says of Him below, There is one that seeks and judges, but the Father judges no man; i.e. no one will see Him in the judgment, but all will see the Son, because He is the Son of man, even the ungodly who will look on Him Whom they pierced.

Quod dicitur ut omnes honorificent filium sicut honorificant patrem, redditum est resurrectioni animarum, quam sic operatur filius sicut pater; sed propter resurrectionem corporum subditur qui non honorificat filium, non honorificat patrem qui misit illum. Non dixit sic: honoratur enim homo Christus, sed non sicut pater Deus. Sed dicit aliquis: missus est filius, et maior est pater, quia misit. Recede a carne: missionem audi, non separationem.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. First indeed, the Son appeared as a servant, and the Father was honored as God. But the Son will be seen to be equal to the Father, that all men may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. But what if persons are found, who honor the Father, and do not honor the Son? It cannot be: He that honors not the Son, honors not the Father which has sent Him. It is one thing to acknowledge God, as God; and another to acknowledge Him as the Father. When you acknowledge God the Creator, you acknowledge an almighty, supreme, eternal, invisible, immutable Spirit. When you acknowledge the Father, you do in reality acknowledge the Son; for He could not be the Father, had He not the Son. But if you honor the Father as greater, the Son as less, so far as you gives less honor to the Son, you take away from the honor of the Father. For you in reality think that the Father could not or would not beget the Son equal to Himself; which if He would not do, He was envious, if He could not, He was weak. Or, That all men should honor the Son even as they honor the Father; has a reference to the resurrection of souls, which is the work of the Son, as well as of the Father. But the resurrection of the body is meant in what comes after: He that honors not the Son honors not the Father that sent Him. Here is no as; the man Christ is honored, but not as the Father Who sent Him, since with respect to His manhood He Himself says, My Father is greater than I. But some one will say, if the Son is sent by the Father, He is inferior to the Father. Leave your fleshly actions, and understand a mission, not a separation. Human things deceive, divine things make clear; although even human things give testimony against you, e.g. if a man offers marriage to a woman, and cannot obtain her by himself, he sends a friend, greater than himself; to urge his suit for him. But see the difference in human things. A man does not go with him whom he sends; but the Father Who sent the Son, never ceased to be with the Son; as we read, I am not alone, but the Father its with Me.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is not, however, as being born of the Father, that the Son is said to be sent, but from His appearing in this world, as the Word made flesh; as He says, I went forth from the Father, and am come into the world: or from His being received into our minds individually, as we read, Send her, that she may be with me, and may labor with me.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. The conclusion then stands good against all the fury of heretical minds.

To say, Believes in Him that sent Me, was a better way of making His discourse acceptable.

Sed cum persolveris mortem veteris hominis, suscipies vitam novi hominis, et transitum facies de morte ad vitam. Ad quam vitam?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But who is this favored Person? Will there be any one better than the Apostle Paul, who says, We must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ? Now judgment sometimes means punishment, sometimes trial. In the sense of trial, we must all appear before the judgment-seat of Christ: in the sense of condemnation we read, some shall not come into judgment; i.e. shall not be condemned. It follows, but is passed from death into life: not, is now passing, but has passed from the death of unbelief, into the life of faith, from the death of sin, to the life of righteousness. Or, it is so said perhaps, to prevent our supposing that faith would save us from bodily death, that penalty which we must pay for Adam’s transgression. He, in whom we all then were, heard the divine sentence, You shall surely die; nor can we evade it. But when we have suffered the death of the old man, we shall receive the life of the new, and by death make a passage to life. But to what life? To life everlasting: the dead shall rise again at the end of the world, and enter into everlasting life. For this life does not deserve the name of life; only that life is true which is eternal.

We see the lovers of this present transitory life so intent on its welfare, that when in danger of death, they will take any means to delay its approach, though they can not hope to drive it off altogether. If so much care and labor then is spent on gaining a little additional length of life, how ought we to strive after life eternal? And if they are thought wise, who endeavor in every way to put off death, though they can live but a few days longer; how foolish are they who so live, as to lose the eternal day?

He said not, because they live, they hear; but in consequence of hearing, they come to life again. But what is hearing, but obeying? For they who believe and do according to the true faith, live, and are not dead; whereas those who believe not, or, believing, live a bad life, and have not love, are rather to be accounted dead.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But some one will ask, Has the Son life, whence those who believe will fire? Hear His own words: As the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself. Life is original and absolute in Him, comes from no other source, depends on no other power. He is not as if He were partaker of a life, which is not Himself; but has life in Himself: so as that He Himself is His own life. Hear, O dead soul, the Father, speaking by the Son: arise, that you may receive that life which you have not in yourself, and enter into the first resurrection. For this life, which the Father and the Son are, pertains to the soul, and is not perceived by the body. The rational mind only discovers the life of wisdom.

          <td><b>Hilarius de synodis</b>: Conclusi quidem haeretici Scripturarum auctoritatibus, hoc solum tribuere solent filio, ut patri tantum virtute similis sit; tollunt autem ei similitudinem naturae; non intelligentes, non nisi ex naturae similitudine similitudinem esse virtutis: neque enim aliquando inferior natura superioris a se potiorisque naturae virtutem consequitur. Non autem potest negari quin filius Dei idem possit, cum dixerit quaecumque pater facit, eadem et filius facit similiter. Sed similitudini virtutis, naturae similitudo succedit, cum dixit sicut habet pater vitam in semetipso, ita et filio dedit habere vitam in semetipso. In vita, naturae et essentiae significatio est; quae sicut habetur, ita data esse docetur ad habendum. Quod enim in utroque vita est, id in utroque significatur essentia; et vita quae gignitur ex vita, idest essentia quae de essentia nascitur, dum non dissimilis nascitur, scilicet quia vita ex vita est, tenet in se originis suae indissimilem naturam.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. The heretics, driven hard by Scripture proofs, are obliged to attribute to the Son at any rate a likeness, in respect of virtue, to the Father. But they do not admit a likeness of nature, not being able to see that a likeness of virtue, could not arise but from a likeness of nature; as an inferior nature can never attain to the virtue of a higher and better one. And it cannot be denied that the Son of God has the same virtue with the Father, when He says, What things soever (the Father) does, the same does the Son likewise. But an express mention of the likeness of nature follows: As the Father has life in Himself, so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself. In life are comprehended nature and essence. And the Son, as He has it, so has He it given to Him. For the same which is life in both, is essence in both; and the life, i.e. essence, which is begotten from life, is born; though not born unlike the other. For, being life from life, it remains like in nature to its origin.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Father must he understand not to have given life to the Son, who was existing without life, but so to have begotten Him, independently of time, that the life which He gave Him in begetting, was co-eternal with His own.

Et quidem naturae humanae infirmitas ex disparibus comparatur, et ex inanimatis continetur ad vitam, nec statim in ea quod gignitur vivit, neque totum vivit ex vita, cum in ea multa sint quae sine naturae sensu, cum excreverint, desiccentur. In Deo vero totum quod est vivit: Deus enim vita est, et ex vita non potest quidquam esse nisi vivum.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Living born from living, has the perfection of nativity, without the newness of nature. For there is nothing new implied in generation from living to living, the life not coming at its birth from nothing. And the life which derives its birth from life, must by the unity of nature, and the sacrament of a perfect birth, both be in the living being, and have the being who lives it, in itself. Weak human nature indeed is made up of unequal elements, and brought to life out of inanimate matter; nor does the human offspring live for some time after it is begotten. Neither does it wholly live from life, since much grows up in it insensibly, and decays insensibly. But in the case of God, the whole of what He is, lives: for God is life, and from life, can nothing be but what is living.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ergo quod dicitur dedit filio, tale est ac si diceretur: genuit filium: generando enim dedit.

Quia ille dedit, iste accepit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Given to the Son, then, has the meaning of, begat the Son; for He gave Him tines life, by begetting. As He gave Him being, so He gave Him to have life in Himself; so that the Son did not stand in need of life to come to Him from without; but was in Himself the fullness of life, whence others, i.e. believers, received their life. What then is the difference between Them? This that one gave, the other received.

Qui enim persuasus est quoniam resurget, et filio dabit noxas eorum quae deliquit, etsi nihil aliud viderit, signum hoc suscipiens curret, benignum sibi iudicem faciens. Sequitur quia filius hominis est, nolite mirari hoc. Paulus quidem Samosatenus non ita ait; sed sic dedit ei potestatem iudicium facere, quia filius hominis est. Sed nullam convenientiam habet hoc dictum ita: non enim propterea suscepit iudicium quia homo est: quia quis prohibet omnes homines esse iudices? Sed quia ineffabilis Dei filius est, propterea et iudex est. Ita igitur legendum: quia filius hominis est, nolite mirari hoc: quia enim videbatur audientibus obstare his quae dicebantur: quoniam nihil plus aestimabant esse Christum quam purum hominem; quae vero dicebantur erant maiora quam secundum hominem, et etiam quam secundum Angelum, et erant solius Dei: ideo hanc opinionem solvens, dixit: ne miremini quia filius hominis est: et subdit causam quare non sit mirandum, dicens quia venit hora in qua omnes qui in monumentis sunt, audient vocem filii Dei. Et cuius gratia non dixit: ne miremini, quia filius hominis est: etenim et ipse filius Dei est? Si resurrectionem posuit, quasi scilicet opus dicens quod Dei proprium erat, dat audientibus ex eo syllogizare de reliquo, quoniam Deus erat, et Dei filius. Etenim qui argumenta complicant, cum partes ponentes nobiliter demonstraverint quod quaeritur, multoties non inducunt ipsi conclusionem, sed clariorem facientes victoriam, dimittunt illi qui contradicit, ut pro eis sententiam ferat. Igitur eius quidem quae secundum Lazarum resurrectionis supra reminiscens, de iudicio tacuit: non enim propter iudicium surrexit Lazarus: universalem vero resurrectionem inducens, iudicium posuit; unde sequitur et procedent qui bona fecerunt, in resurrectionem vitae; qui vero mala egerunt, in resurrectionem iudicii. Quia enim supra dixerat: qui audit sermonem meum et credit ei qui misit me, in iudicium non venit, ut non aestimet quis quod credere sufficit ad salutem, adiecit haec et de vita, dum dicit et qui bona egerunt (...) et qui mala egerunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why does He dwell so constantly on these subjects; judgment, resurrection, and life? Because these are the most powerful arguments for bringing men over to the faith, and the most likely ones to prevail with obstinate hearers. For one who is persuaded that he shall rise again, and be called by the Son to account for his misdeeds, will, though he know nothing more than this, be anxious to propitiate his Judge. It follows, Because He is the Son of man, marvel not at this. Paul of Samosata reads it, Has given Him power to execute judgment also, because He is the Son of man. But this connection has no meaning; for He does not receive the power to judge because He is man, (as, on this supposition, what would prevent all men from being judges:) but because He is the ineffable Son of God; therefore is He Judge. We must read it then, Because He is the Son of man, marvel not at this. As Christ’s hearers thought him a mere man, and as what He asserted of Himself was too high to be true of men, or even angels, or any being short of God Himself, there was a strong obstacle in the way of their believing, which our Lord notices in order to remove it: Marvel not, He says, that He is the Son of man: and then adds the reason why they should not marvel: For the hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear the voice of the Son of God. And why did He not say, Marvel not that He is the Son of man: because in truth He is the Son of God? Because, having given out that it was He who should raise men from the dead, the resurrection being a strictly divine work, He leaves His hearers to infer that He is God, and the Son of God. Persons in arguing often do this. When they have brought out grounds amply sufficient to prove the conclusion they want, they do not draw that conclusion themselves; but, to make the victory greater; leave the opponent to draw it. In referring above to the resurrection of Lazarus and the rest, he said nothing about judgment, for Lazarus did not rise again for judgment; whereas now, that He is speaking of the general resurrection, He brings in the mention of the judgment: And (they) shall come forth, He says, they that have done good to the resurrection of life, and they that have done evil to the resurrection of damnation. Having said above, He that hears My words, and believe in Him that sent Me, has everlasting life; that men might not suppose from this, that belief was sufficient for salvation, He proceeds to speak of works: And they that have done good, - and they that have done evil.

Inquantum erat verbum in principio apud Deum, dedit ei vitam habere in semetipso; sed quia verbum caro factum est ex virgine Maria, homo factus filius hominis est; et quia filius hominis est, accepit potestatem iudicium facere, quod scilicet erit in fine saeculi, et ibi erit resurrectio corporum mortuorum. Animas ergo suscitat Deus per Christum filium Dei, corpora suscitat per eumdem filium hominis; unde additur quia filius hominis est: nam secundum quod Dei filius est, semper habuit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: Inasmuch as the Word was in the beginning with God, the Father gave Him to have life in Himself; but inasmuch as the Word was made flesh of the Virgin Mary, being made man, He became the Son of man: and as the Son of man, He received power to execute judgment at the end of the world; at which time the bodies of the dead shall rise again. The souls then of the dead God raises by Christ the Son of God, their bodies by the same Christ, the Son of man. Wherefore He adds, Because He is the Son of man: for, as to the Son of God, He always had the power.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. At the judgment will appear the form of man, that form will judge, which was judged; He will sit a Judge Who stood before the judge; He will condemn the guilty, Who was condemned innocent. For it is proper that the judged should see their Judge. Now the judged consist of both good and bad; so that the form of the servant will be strewn to good and bad alike; the form of God to the good only. Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.

Above when He said, The hour comes, and added, and now is; He proceeds, When the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God. He does not say, All the dead; for by the dead are meant the wicked, and the wicked have not all been brought to obey the Gospel But in the end of the world all that are in their graves shall hear His voice, and come forth. He does not say, Shall live, as He said above, when He spoke of the eternal and blessed life; which all will not have, who shall come forth from their graves. This judgment was committed to Him because He was the Son of man. But what takes place in this judgment? They that have done good shall go to the resurrection of life, i.e. to live with the Angels of God; they that have done evil to the resurrection of judgment. Judgment here meaning damnation.

Unde ab illo est ei audire, et videre a quo illi est ipsum esse. Et ideo sicut audit iudicat: quia sicut genitum est verbum, ut idem verbum sit veritas, ita secundum veritatem iudicat. Sequitur et iudicium meum iustum est: quia non quaero voluntatem meam, sed voluntatem eius qui misit me patris. Hoc enim dicens, ad illum hominem voluit referre intentionem nostram qui voluntatem suam quaerendo, non eius a quo factus est, non habuit iustum iudicium de seipso: sed iustum iudicium habitum est de ipso. Ipse quippe faciens voluntatem suam, non Dei, moriturum se esse non credidit; sed hoc iudicium eius iustum non fuit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. As I hear, I judge, is said with reference either to His human subordination, as the Son of man, or to that immutable and simple nature of the Sonship derived from the Father; in which nature hearing and seeing is identical with being. Wherefore as He hears, He judges. The Word is begotten one with the Father, and therefore judges according to truth. It follows, And My judgment is just, because I seek not Mine own will, but the will of the Father which has sent Me. This is intended to take us back to that man who, by seeking his own will, not the will of Him who made him, did not judge himself justly, but had a just judgment pronounced upon him. He did not believe that, by doing his own will, not God’s, he should die. So he did his own will, and died; because the judgment; of God is just, which judgment the Son of God executes, by not seeking His own will, i.e. His will as being the Son of man. Not that He has no will in judging, but His will is not His own in such sense, as to be different from the Father’s.

Nor marvel if being hitherto thought no more than a mere man, He defends Himself in a somewhat human way, and shows his judgment to be just on the same ground which any other person would have taken; viz. that one who has his own ends in view, may incur suspicion of injustice, but that one who has not cannot.

Whence shall we obtain truth, when the Truth Itself says, My witness is not true. We must believe then that true, here, is said, not with reference to the intrinsic value of His testimony, but to their suspicions; for the Jews might say, We do not believe You, because no one who bears witness to himself is to he depended on. In answer then, he puts forth three clear and irrefragable proofs, three witnesses as it were, to the truth of what He had said; the works which He had done, the testimony of the Father, and the preaching of John: putting the least of these foremost, i.e. the preaching of John: There is another that bears witness of Me: and I know that the witness which he witnesses of Me is true.

But to anticipate their asking how it appeared that God taught John, as if the Jews had objected that John’s witness might not be true, our Lord anticipates them by saying, “you sought him yourselves to inquire of him; that is why I use his testimony, for I need it not.” He adds, But these things I say that you might be saved. As if He said, I being God, needed not this human kind of testimony. But, since you attend more to him, and think him more worthy of credit than any one else, while you do not believe me, though I work miracles; for this cause I remind you of his testimony. But had they not received John’s testimony? Before they have time to ask this, He answers it: He was a burning and a shining light, and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his light. He says this to show, how lightly they had held by John, and how soon they had left him, thus preventing him from leading them to Christ. He calls him a candle, because John had not his light from himself; but from the grace of the Holy Spirit.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. John was a candle lighted by Christ, the Light, burning with faith and love, shining in word and deed. He was sent before, to confound the enemies of Christ, according to the Psalm, I have ordained a lantern for Mine Anointed; as for His enemies, I shall clothe them with shame.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ad Ioannem igitur vos duco, non quasi illius indigens testimonio, sed ut vos salvemini: nam habeo maius testimonium Ioanne; et hoc est quod sequitur ego autem habeo testimonium maius Ioanne. Hoc autem est quod est ab operibus; unde sequitur opera enim quae dedit mihi pater ut perficiam ea, ipsa opera quae ego facio, testimonium perhibent de me, quia misit me pater.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. I therefore direct you to John, not because I want this testimony, but that you may: for I have greater witness than that of John, i.e. that of my works; The works which the Father hash given Me to finish, the same works that I do bear witness of Me, that the Father has sent Me.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Unigenitus enim Deus, non hominis testimonio tantum, sed etiam virtutis, docet esse se filium: opera enim eius quae facit, testantur eum a patre missum. Itaque filii obedientia et paterna auctoritas docentur in misso. Sed quia opera non sufficiunt in credibilibus ad testimonium, sequitur et qui misit me pater, ipse testimonium perhibet de me. Revolvite evangelica volumina, et omne eorum opus recensete: nullum aliud patris de filio testimonium extat in libris, quam quod hic sit filius suus. Quid infertur hodie calumniae, ut adoptio nominis sit, ut mendax Deus sit, ut nomina inania sint?
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. The Only-begotten God shows Himself to be the Son, on the testimony not of man only, but of His own power. The works which He does, bear witness to His being sent from the Father. Therefore the obedience of the Son and the authority of the Father are set forth in Him who was sent. But the testimony of works not being sufficient evidence, it follows, And the Father Himself which has sent Me, has borne witness of Me. Open the Evangelic volumes, and examine their whole range: no testimony of the Father to the Son is given in any of the books, other than that He is the Son. So what a calumny is it in men now saying that this is only a name of adoption: thus making God a liar, and names unmeaning.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda in Ioannem</b>: Missio autem incarnatio eius debet intelligi. Denique ostendit quod Deus incorporeus sit, et quod corporalibus et visibilibus oculis videri non possit; unde sequitur neque vocem eius unquam audistis, neque speciem eius vidistis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. By His mission we must understand His incarnation. Lastly, He shows that God is incorporeal, and cannot be seen by the bodily eye: You have neither heard His voice at any time, nor seen His shape.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Possent enim Iudaei dicere: nos soliti sumus vocem domini audire in Sina, et eum vidimus in specie ignis. Si ergo Deus perhibet testimonium de te, nos intelligeremus vocem domini. Contra hoc dicit: ego habeo testimonium a patre, quamvis non intelligatis: quia vos nunquam audistis vocem eius, neque speciem eius vidistis.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The Jews might say, We heard the voice of the Lord at Sinai, and saw Him under the appearance of fire. If God then bears witness of You, we should know His voice. To which He replies, I have the witness of the Father, though you understand it not; because you never heard His voice, or saw His shape.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quomodo ergo Moyses dicit: si facta est aliquando huiusmodi res, ut audiret populus vocem Dei loquentis de medio ignis, sicut tu audisti et vidisti? Vidisse etiam eum dicuntur Isaias et alii plures. Quid ergo est quod nunc ait Christus? In philosophicum eos inducit dogma, paulatim ostendens quoniam neque vox circa Deum est neque species; sed superior et figuris est et loquelis talibus. Sicut enim dixit neque vocem eius audistis, propter hoc non indicat quod vocem emittat, sed non audibilem; ita dicens neque speciem eius vidistis, non hoc dicit quod speciem sensibilem habeat et visibilem, sed quoniam nihil horum est circa Deum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. How then says Moses, Ask - whether there has been any such thing as this great thing is: did ever people hear the voice of God, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard and seen? Isaiah too, and many others, are said to have seen Him. So what does Christ mean here? He means to impress upon them the philosophical doctrine, that God has neither voice, or appearance, or shape; but is superior to such modes of speaking of Him. For as in saying, You have never heard His voice, He does not mean to say that He has a voice, only not an audible one to them; so when He says, Nor have even His shape, no tangible, sensible, or visible shape is implied to belong to God: but all such mode of speaking is pronounced inapplicable to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Non enim carnalibus auribus, sed spirituali intelligentia per gratiam spiritus sancti audiri potest. Non ergo vocem spiritalem audierant, quoniam eum amare et praeceptis eius obedire nolebant; neque speciem eius viderunt, quia non exterioribus oculis videri potest, sed fide et dilectione.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. For it is not by the carnal ear, but by the spiritual understanding, through the grace of the Holy Spirit, that God is heard. And they did not hear the spiritual voice, because they did not love or obey Him, nor saw they His shape; inasmuch as that is not to be seen by the outward eye, but by faith and love.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed neque possibile erat eis dicere quod praecepta eius suscepissent et servarent; ideoque subiungit et verbum eius non habetis in vobis manens, idest praecepta Dei, legem et prophetas: etsi enim ea Deus constituit, sed apud vos non sunt: et si Scripturae ubique docent ut mihi credatis, vos autem non creditis, manifestum est quod sermo eius deficit a vobis. Et propter hoc subdit quia quem misit ille, huic vos non creditis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But it was impossible for them to declare that they had received, and obeyed God’s commands: and therefore He adds, You have not His word abiding in you; i.e. the commandments, the law, and the prophets; though God instituted them, you have them not. For if the Scriptures every where tell you to believe in Me, and you believe not, it is manifest that His word is gone from you: For whom He has sent, Him you believe not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel aliter verbum quod in principio erat, non habent in se manens qui verbum Dei quod audiunt, et memoria tenere et opere implere contemnunt. Dixerat igitur se habere testimonium a Ioanne, ab operibus, a patre; addit et testimonium a lege quae data est per Moysen, dicens scrutamini Scripturas, in quibus putatis vitam aeternam habere; et illae sunt quae testimonium perhibent de me: quasi dicat: vos in Scripturis putatis vitam aeternam habere, et me quasi contrarium Moysi repudiatis: testimonio ipsius Moysi me esse Deum intelligere potestis, si ipsas Scripturas diligenter investigatis. Omnis enim Scriptura testimonium perhibet de Christo, sive per figuras, sive per prophetas, sive per Angelorum ministeria. Sed his Iudaei de Christo non crediderunt; et ideo vitam aeternam habere non possunt; unde sequitur et non vultis venire ad me, ut vitam habeatis; quasi dicat: Scripturae perhibent testimonium; et tamen per tot testimonia non vultis venire ad me; idest, non vultis mihi credere, et a me quaerere veram salutem.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or thus; they cannot have abiding in them the Word which was in the beginning, who came not to keep in mind, or fulfill in practice, that word of God which they hear. Having mentioned the testimonies of John, and the Father, and of His works, He adds now that of the Mosaic Law: Search the Scriptures, for in them you think you have eternal life; and they are they which testify of Me: as if He said, you think you have eternal life in the Scriptures, and reject Me as being opposed to Moses: but you will find that Moses himself testifies to My being God, if you search the Scripture carefully. All Scripture indeed bears witness of Christ, whether by its types, or by prophets, or by the ministering of Angels. But the Jews did not believe these intimations of Christ, and therefore could not obtain eternal life: You will not come to Me, that you may have life; meaning, The Scriptures bear witness of Me, but you will not come to Me notwithstanding, i.e. you will not believe in Me, and seek for salvation at my hands.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter potest continuari. Possent illi dicere: qualiter si vocem eius non audivimus, Deus tibi testatus est? Et ideo dicit scrutamini Scripturas, ostendens quod per has testatus est Deus de eo: etenim in Iordane testatus est, et in monte. Sed vocem quidem factam in monte non audierunt, factam autem in Iordane audierunt, sed non attenderunt. Propterea mittit eos ad Scripturas, ostendens quoniam et patris testimonium illic est. Non autem ad lectionem simplicem Scripturarum, sed ad scrutationem exquisitam eos mittebat: quia ea quae de eo dicebantur in Scripturis, desuper obumbrabantur; neque in superficie exprimebantur, sed velut quidam thesaurus recondebantur. Non dicit autem: in quibus habetis vitam aeternam; sed in quibus aestimatis vos habere; ostendens quoniam non capiebant magnum fructum et nobilem ex Scripturis, sola lectione aestimantes se salvari, cum fide essent privati; propter quod subdit et non vultis venire ad me: quia ei credere nolebant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or the connection may be given thus. They might say to Him, How, if we have never heard God’s voice, has God borne witness to you? So He says, Search the Scriptures; meaning that God had borne witness of Him by the Scriptures. He had borne witness indeed at the Jordan, and on the mount. But they did not hear the voice on the mount, and did not attend to it at the Jordan. Wherefore He sends them to the Scriptures, when they would also find the Father’s testimony. He did not send them however to the Scriptures simply to read them, but to examine them attentively, because Scripture ever threw a shade over its own meaning, and did not display it on the surface. The treasure was, as it were, hidden from their eve. He does not say, For in them you have eternal life, but, For in them you think you have eternal life; meaning that they did not reap much fruit from the Scriptures, thinking, as they did, that they should be saved by the mere reading of them, without faith. For which reason He adds, You will not come to Me; i.e. you will not believe on Me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quod autem venire pro credere ponatur, Psalmista ostendit dicens: accedite ad eum, et illuminamini. Subdit autem ut vitam habeatis: si enim anima quae peccat moritur, ipsi anima et mente mortui erant. Promittebat ergo illis vitam animae, vel felicitatis aeternae.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. That coming is put for believing we know, Come to Him, and be lightened. He adds, That you might have life; For, if the soul which sin dies, they were dead in soul and mind. And therefore He promises the life of the soul, i.e. eternal happiness.

Non enim est mea natura talis ut indigeat quae ab hominibus est gloria. Si enim sol a lucernae lumine non recipit adiectionem, multo magis ego humana gloria non indigeo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord having made mention of John, and the witness of God, and His own works, many, who did not see H that His motive was to induce them to believe, might suspect Him of a desire for human glory, and therefore He says, I receive not honor from men: i.e. I do not want it. My nature is not such as to want that glory, which comes from men. For if the Son receives no addition from the light of a candle, much more am not I in want of human glory.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or, I receive not honor from men: i.e. I seek not human praise; for I came not to receive carnal honor from men, but to give spiritual honor to men. I do not bring forward this testimony then, because I seek my own glory; but because I compassionate your wandering, and wish to bring you back to the way of truth. Hence what follows, But I know you that you have not the love of God in you.

Non autem ab his solum, sed etiam a futuris hoc ostendit, dicens ego veni in nomine patris mei, et non accepistis me. Si alius venerit in nomine suo, illum accipietis.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if to say, I said this to prove that it is not from your love of God, that you persecute Me; for He bears witness to Me, by My own works, and by the Scriptures. So that, if you loved God, as you rejected Me, thinking Me against God, so now you would come to Me. But you do not love Him. And He proves this, not only from what they do now, but from what they will do in time to come: I am come in My Father’s name, and you received Me not; if another shall come in his own name, him you will receive. He says plainly, I am come in the Father’s name, that they might never be able to plead ignorance as an excuse

Quia enim Iudaei noluerunt recipere Christum, poena peccati huius congruet ut recipiant Antichristum; ut qui nolunt credere veritati, credant mendacio.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. As if He said, For this cause came I into the world, that through Me the name of the Father might be glorified; for I attribute all to Him. As then they would not receive Him, Who came to do His Father’s will; they had not the love of God. But Antichrist will come not in the Father’s name, but in his own, to seek, not the Father’s glory, but his own. And the Jews having rejected Christ, it was a fit punishment on them, that they should receive Antichrist, and believe a lie, as they would not believe the Truth.

Ergo vita mea ex te pendebit, et salus mea ex te religabitur. Ita ne oblitus sim fundamentum meum? Nonne petra erat Christus?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Hear John, As you have heard that Antichrist shall come, even now are there many Antichrists. But what do you dread in Antichrist, except that he will exalt his own name, and despise the name of the Lord? And what else does he do, who says, “I justify;” or those who say, Unless we are good, you must perish?” Wherefore my life shall depend on You, and my salvation shall be fastened to You. Shall I so forget my foundation? Is not my rock Christ?

Manifestum est igitur quod livoris persecutio erat qua Christum persequebantur, et odii in Deum. Deinde causam eorum infidelitatis ponit, dicens quomodo vos potestis credere qui gloriam ab invicem accipitis, et gloriam quae a solo Deo est non quaeritis?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Here is the crowning proof of their impiety. He says, as it were, If it was the love of God that made you persecute me, you would persecute Antichrist much more: for he does not profess to be sent by the Father, or to come according to His will; but, on the contrary, usurping what does not belong to him, will proclaim himself to be God over all. It is manifest that your persecution of Me is from malice and hatred of God. Then He gives the reason of their unbelief: How can you believe, which receive honor one of another, and seek not the honor that comes from God only? another proof this, that theirs was not a zeal for God, but a gratification of their own passions.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. How faulty then is the boasting temper, and that eagerness for human praise, which likes to be thought to have what it has not, and would fain be thought to have all that it has, by its own strength. Men of such temper cannot believe; for in their hearts, they are bent solely on gaining praise, and setting themselves up above others.

The best way of guarding against this sin, is to bring to our consciences the remembrance, that we are dust, and should ascribe all the good that we have not to ourselves, but to God. And we should endeavor always to be such, as we wish to appear to others. Then, as they might ask, Will you accuse us then to the Father? He anticipates this question: Do not think that I will accuse you to the Father.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia scilicet non veni damnare, sed salvare. Est qui accusat vos, Moyses, in quo vos speratis.

Quid tibi et Moysi commune, qui sabbatum solvisti? Et ideo subdit si enim crederetis Moysi, crederetis forsitan et mihi; de me enim ille scripsit. Haec ex superioribus constitutionem habent: cum enim in confessionem deductum sit quod a Deo veni, ab operibus, a voce Ioannis, a patris testimonio, manifestum est quod Moyses eos accusabit; etenim dixit: si quis venerit signa faciens et ad Deum ducens, et futura praedicens cum veritate, oportet ei obedire. Christus autem haec omnia fecit; nec ei crediderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For I am not come to condemn, but to save. There is one that accuses you, even Moses, in whom you trust. As He had said of the Scriptures above: In them you think you have eternal life. So now of Moses He says, In whom you trust, always answering them out of their authorities. But they will say, How will he accuse us? What have you to do with Moses, you who have broken the sabbath? So He adds: For had you believed Moses, you would perhaps hare believed Me, for he wrote of me. This is connected with what was said before. For where evidence that He came from God had been forced upon them by His words, by the voice of John, and the testimony of the Father, it was certain that Moses would condemn them; for he had said, If any one shall come, doing miracles, leading men to God, and foretelling the future with certainty, you must obey him. Christ did all this, and they did not obey Him.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Perhaps, He says, in accommodation to our way of speaking, not because there is really any doubting in God. Moses prophesied of Christ, A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up from among your brethren like to me: Him shall you hear.

Sequitur si autem illius litteris non creditis, quomodo verbis meis credetis?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But, in fact, the whole that Moses wrote, was written of Christ, i.e. it has reference to Him principally; whether it point to Him by figurative actions, or expression; or set forth His grace and glory. But if you believe not his writings, how shall you believe My words.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Indeed had they attended to His words, they ought and would have tried to learn from Him, what the things were which Moses had written of Him. But they are silent. For it is the nature of wickedness to defy persuasion. Do what you will, it retains its venom to the last.

Propterea Christus furorem ex praemissis sermonibus natum, secedendo mitigavit, in Galilaeam vadens; non tamen ad eadem loca unde Ierusalem ascenderat: non enim in Cana Galilaeae, sed ultra mare ivit; unde ait post haec abiit trans mare Galilaeae, quod est Tiberiadis.

As missiles rebound with great force from a hard body, and fly off in all directions, whereas a softer material retains and stops them; so violent men are only excited to greater rage by violence on the side of their opponents, whereas gentleness softens them. Christ quieted the irritation of the Jews by retiring from Jerusalem. He went into Galilee, but not to Cana again, but beyond the sea: After these things Jesus went over the sea of Galilee, which is the sea of Tiberias.

Signa enim, ut ait Paulus, non sunt data fidelibus, sed infidelibus. Sapientiores autem erant illi de quibus dicitur quod stupebant in doctrina eius. Sed quare non dicit quae signa videbant eum facientem? Quoniam hic Evangelista maiorem partem libri in sermonibus domini consumere studuit. Sequitur subiit in montem Iesus, et ibi sedebat cum discipulis suis. In montem quidem ascendit propter signum quod fieri debebat. Sed quod discipulos secum ascendere fecit, accusatio multitudinis erat non sequentis eum. Ascendit etiam in montem erudiens nos a tumultibus et ab ea quae in mundo est turbatione requiescere; apta enim ad philosophiam solitudo est. Sequitur erat autem proximum Pascha dies festus Iudaeorum. Vide qualiter in anno integro nihil plus Evangelista nos docuit de signis Christi quam quod paralyticum sanavit, et filium reguli: non enim studuit universa annuntiare, sed ex multis magna et pauca. Qualiter igitur non ascendit ad diem festum? Paulatim enim solvebat legem, occasionem capiens a Iudaica nequitia.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Though favored with such teaching, they were influenced less by it, than by the miracles; a sign of their low state of belief: for Paul says of tongues, that they are for a sign, not to them that believe, I but to them that believe not. They were wiser of whom it is said, that they were astonished at His doctrine. The Evangelist does not say what miracles He wrought, the great object of his book being to give our Lord’s discourses. It follows: And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there sat with His disciples. He went up into the mountain, on account of the miracle which was going to be done. That the disciples alone ascended with Him, implies that the people who stayed behind were in fault for not following. He went up to the mountain too, as a lesson to us to retire from the tumult and confusion of the world, and leave wisdom in solitude. And the passover, a feast of the Jews, was nigh. Observe, in a whole year, the Evangelist has told us of no miracles of Christ, except His healing the impotent man, and the nobleman’s son. His object was to give not a regular history, but only a few of the principal acts of our Lord. But why did not our Lord go up to the feast? He was taking occasion, from the wickedness of the Jews, gradually to abolish the Law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia enim Iudaei eum persequebantur, occasionem recessus accipiens, legem exclusit, innuens observantibus quod, veritate adveniente, omnis cessat figura; et quod legibus non subicitur, ut legalia festa perficeret. Et vide hoc quod non erat festum Christi, sed Iudaeorum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The persecutions of the Jews gave Him reason for retiring, and thus setting aside the Law. The truth being now revealed, types were at an end, and He was under no obligation to keep the Jewish feasts. Observe the expression, a feast of the Jews, not a feast of Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Si quis verba Evangelistarum diligenter consideraverit, facile cognoscet quia unius anni spatium fuit inter decollationem Ioannis et passionem domini. Cum enim Matthaeus dicat, quia dominus audita nece Ioannis secessit in desertum locum, et ibi turbas pavit; et Ioannes dicit quod proximum erat Pascha Iudaeorum quando turbas pavit, aperte demonstratur quia imminente paschali festivitate decollatus est Ioannes. Evoluto autem unius anni spatio, passus est Christus in eadem festivitate. Sequitur cum sublevasset ergo oculos Iesus, et vidisset quia multitudo maxima venit ad eum, dixit ad Philippum: unde ememus panes ut manducent hi? Dixit cum sublevasset oculos Iesus, ut disceremus quia oculos non erigebat huc atque illuc; sed pudice sedebat attentus cum discipulis suis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. If we compare the accounts of the different Evangelists, we shall find very clearly, that there was an interval of a year between the beheading of John, and our Lord’s Passion. For, since Matthew says that our Lord, on hearing of the death of John, withdrew into a desert place, where He fed the multitude; and John says that the Passover was nigh, when He fed the multitude; it is evident that John was beheaded shortly before the Passover. And at the same feast, the next year Christ suffered. It follows, When Jesus then lifted up His eyes, and saw a great company come to Him, He said to Philip, Whence shall we buy bread, that these may eat? When Jesus lifted up His eyes, this is to show us, that Jesus was not generally with His eyes lifted up, looking about Him, but sitting calm and attentive, surrounded by His disciples.

            <b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Neque etiam simpliciter sedebat cum discipulis suis, sed diligenter loquens aliquid eis, et eos ad seipsum convertens. Deinde respiciens vidit turbam ad se venientem. Cuius igitur gratia Philippum interrogat? Sciebat enim quod discipulorum eius congregatio ampliori indigebat doctrina. Talis autem erat Philippus, qui postea dixit: ostende nobis patrem, et sufficit nobis. Propterea igitur prius eum erudiebat. Nam si simpliciter factum esset, miraculum non tantum appareret; nunc autem prius cogit confiteri inopiam, ut certius discat miraculi magnitudinem; unde sequitur hoc autem dicebat tentans eum.
            <p>Non quidem ignorans id quod debebat ab ipso dici; sed humano more hoc dictum est. Sicut enim quod dicitur: qui scrutatur corda hominum, non ostendit ignorantiae scrutationem, sed certissimae cognitionis: ita cum hic dicit quod tentavit eum, nihil aliud dicit quam quoniam sciebat certissime. Sed aliud est dicere, quoniam probatiorem eum faciebat, per talem interrogationem inducens in certissimam signi cognitionem. Propter hoc et Evangelista, ne infirmitate locutionis minorationem aliquam suspiceris, subiungit ipse enim sciebat quid esset facturus.
          <td>
            <b>CHRYS</b>. Nor did He only sit with His disciples, but conversed with them familiarly, and gained possession of their minds. Then He looked, and saw a crowd advancing. But why did He ask Philip that question? Because He knew that His disciples, and he especially, needed further teaching. For this Philip it was who said afterwards, Show us the Father, and it suffices us. And if the miracle had been performed at once, without any introduction, the greatness of it would not have been seen. The disciples were made to confess their own inability, that they might see the miracle more clearly; And this He said to prove him.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. One kind of temptation leads to sin, with which God never tempts any one; and there is another kind by which faith is tried. In this sense it is said that Christ proved His disciple. This is not meant to imply that He did not know what Philip would say; but is an accommodation to men’s way of speaking. For as the expression, Who searches the hearts of men, does not mean the searching of ignorance, but of absolute knowledge; so here, when it is said that our Lord proved Philip, we must understand that He knew him perfectly, but that He tried him, in order to confirm his faith. The Evangelist himself guards against the mistake which this imperfect mode of speaking might occasion, by adding, For He Himself knew what He would do.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Interrogat igitur, non ut ignorata discat, sed ut discipulo adhuc rudi propriam tarditatem ostendat, quam ipse in se perpendere non valebat.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He asks him this question, not for His own information, but in order to show His yet unformed disciple his dullness of mind, which he could not perceive of himself.

Evang</b>: Sed si dominus, secundum narrationem Ioannis, prospectis turbis quaesivit a Philippo, tentans eum, unde illis escae dari possent; potest movere quomodo sit verum, quod alii narraverunt, prius dixisse domino discipulos, ut dimitteret turbas. Quibus ille respondit, secundum Matthaeum: non habent necesse ire: date eis vos manducare. Intelligitur igitur, post haec verba dominum inspexisse multitudinem, et dixisse Philippo quod Ioannes commemorat, alii autem praetermiserunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if our Lord, according to John’s account, on seeing the multitude, asked Philip, tempting him, whence they could buy food for them, it is difficult at first to see how it can be true, according to the other account, that the disciples first told our Lord, to send away the multitude; and that our Lord replied, They need not depart; give you them to eat. We must understand then it was after saying this, that our Lord saw the multitude, and said to Philip what John had related, which has been omitted by the rest.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Thus tried by our Lord, Philip was found to be possessed which human notions, as appears from what follows, Philip answered Him, Two hundred pennyworth of bread is not sufficient for them, that every one of them may take a little.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The reply, which is attributed to Philip by John, Mark puts in the mouth of all the disciples, either meaning us to understand that Philip spoke for the rest, or else putting the plural number for the singular, which is often done.

Ascendit igitur mente in aliquod excelsum; sed ad summum non potuit pervenire; quod patet per hoc quod subdit sed haec quid sunt inter tantos? Aestimabat enim quod de paucioribus pauciora, et de pluribus plura facturus esset qui miracula faciebat; sed hoc non erat verum: similiter enim ei facile erat et de pluribus et de paucioribus pascere turbas: non enim materia subiecta indigebat; sed ne viderentur creaturae alienae esse ab eius sapientia, ipsis creaturis utitur ad materiam miraculorum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Probably He had some reason in his mind for this speech. He would know of Elijah’s miracle, by which a hundred men were fed with twenty loaves. This was a great step; but here he stopped. He did not rise any higher. For his next words are, But what are these among so many? He thought that less could produce less in a miracle, and more more; a great mistake; inasmuch as it was as easy for Christ to feed the multitude from a few fishes as from many. He did not really want any material to work from, but only made use of created things for this purpose in order to show that no part of the creation was severed from His wisdom.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. This passage confounds the Manicheans, who say that bread and all such things were created by an evil Deity.

Moses numbered the people from twenty years old and upwards, making no mention of the women; to signify that the manly and juvenile character is especially honorable in God’s eyes. And Jesus took the loaves; and when He had given thanks, He distributed to them that were sat down: and likewise of the fishes as much as they would.

Si enim indigeret orare, multo magis in maioribus hoc fecisset; quia vero illa ex auctoritate facit, manifestum est quod hic condescendendo nobis, orat: et adhuc quoniam turba multa erat praesens, oportebat eis suaderi quod secundum voluntatem Dei advenerat: et ideo cum occulte aliquod miraculum faciebat, non orabat; sed coram multis orabat, ne crederent quod esset Deo contrarius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why when He is going to heal the impotent, to raise the dead, to calm the sea, does He not pray, but here does give thanks? To teach us to give thanks to God, whenever we sit down to eat. And He prays more in lesser matters, in order to show that He does not pray from any motive of need. For had prayer been really necessary to supply His wants, His praying would have been in proportion to the importance of each particular work. But acting, as He does, on His own authority, it is evident, He only prays out of condescension to us. And, as a great multitude was collected, it was an opportunity of impressing on them, that His coming was in accordance with God’s will. Accordingly, when a miracle was private, He did not pray; when numbers were present, He did.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He multiplied in His hands the five loaves, just as He produces harvest out of a few grains. There was a power in the hands of Christ; and those five loaves were, as it were, seeds, not indeed committed to the earth, but multiplied by Him who made the earth.

Sequitur ut autem impleti sunt, dixit discipulis suis: colligite quae superaverunt fragmenta, ne pereant. Collegerunt ergo et impleverunt duodecim cophinos fragmentorum. Non quidem haec ostentatio superflua fuit, sed ne phantasiam aestimarent quod factum est; propter quod etiam ex subiecta materia miraculum fecit. Sed quare non turbis dedit fragmenta portanda, sed discipulis? Quoniam hos maxime erudire volebat, qui orbis terrarum debebant esse magistri. Ego autem non solum admiror multitudinem panum quae facta est, sed et certitudinem superfluorum: quia neque plus neque minus fecit superfluum esse, sed tantum quantum volebat; scilicet duodecim cophinos, secundum numerum duodecim apostolorum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe the difference between the servant and the lord. The Prophets received grace, as it were, by measure, and according to that measure performed their miracles: whereas Christ, working this by His own absolute power, produces a kind of super abundant result. When they were filled, He said to His disciples, Gather up the fragments that remain, that nothing be lost. Therefore they gathered them together, and filled twelve baskets with the fragments. This was not done for needless ostentation, but to prevent men from thinking the whole a delusion; which was the reason why He made use of an existing material to work from. But why did He give the fragments to His disciples to carry away, and not to the multitude? Because the disciples were to be the teachers of the world, and therefore it was most important that the truth should be impressed upon them. Wherefore I admire not only the multitude of the loaves which were made, but the definite quantity of the fragments; neither more nor less than twelve baskets full, and corresponding to the number of the twelve Apostles.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. When the multitude saw the miracle our Lord had done, they marveled; as they did not know yet that He was God. Then those men, the Evangelist adds, i.e. carnal men, whose understanding was carnal, when they had perceived the miracle that Jesus did, said, This is of a truth that Prophet that should come into the world.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Their faith being as yet weak, they only call our Lord a Prophet not knowing that He was God. But the miracle had produced considerable effect upon them, as it made them call our Lord that Prophet, singling Him out from the rest. They call Him a Prophet, because some of the Prophets had worked miracles; and properly, inasmuch as our Lord calls Himself a Prophet; It cannot be that a prophet perish out of Jerusalem.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Christ is a Prophet and the Lord of Prophets; as He is an Angel, and the Lord of Angels. In that He came to announce something, He was an Angel; in that He foretold the future, He was a Prophet; in that He was the Word made flesh, He was Lord both of Angels and Prophets; for none can be a Prophet without the word of God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Their expression, that should come into the world, shows that they expected the arrival of some great Prophet. And this is why they say, This is of a truth that Prophet: the article being put in the Greek, to show that He was distinct from other Prophets.

Maius enim miraculum est gubernatio totius mundi quam saturatio quinque millium hominum de quinque panibus: et tamen hoc nemo miratur; illud mirantur homines, non quia maius, sed quia rarum est. Nec tamen sufficit hoc intueri in miraculis Christi: quia enim dominus est in monte, verbum Dei est in alto: proinde non quasi humiliter iacet, nec transeunter praetereundum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But let us reflect a little here. Forasmuch as the Divine Substance is not visible to the eye, and the miracles of the divine government of the world, and ordering of the whole creation, are overlooked in consequence of their constancy; God has reserved to Himself acts, beside the established course and order of nature, to do at suitable times; in order that those who overlooked the daily course of nature, might be roused to wonder by the sight of what was different from, though not at all greater, than what they were used to. The government of the world is a greater miracle, than the satisfying the hunger of five thousand with five loaves; and yet no one wonders at this: the former excited wonder; not from any real superiority in it, but because it was uncommon. But it would be wrong to gather no more than this from Christ’s miracles: for, the Lord who is on the mount, and the Word of God which is on high, the same is no humble person to be lightly passed over, but we must look up to Him reverently.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Mystically, the sea signifies this tumultuous world.

Oculi vero domini sunt dona spiritualia, quae cum dominus electis suis misericorditer concedit, tunc in eos oculos suos dirigit: idest respectum pietatis impendit.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. His leaving the multitude below, and ascending the heights with His disciples, signifies, that lesser precepts are to be given to beginners, higher to the more matured. His refreshing the people shortly before the Passover signifies our refreshment by the bread of the divine word; and the body and blood, i.e. our spiritual passover, by which we pass over from vice to virtue. And the Lord’s eyes are spiritual gifts, which he mercifully bestows on His Elect. He turns His eyes upon them, i.e. has compassionate respect to them.

Et quod hordeacei erant panes, bene significavit vel ipsam legem, quae ita data erat ut in ea vitale animae alimentum corporalibus sacramentis obtegeretur: hordei enim medulla tenacissima palea tegitur: vel ipsum populum nondum expoliatum carnali desiderio, quod tamquam palea cordi eius inhaerebat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The five barley loaves signify the old law; either because the law was given to men not as yet spiritual, but carnal, i.e. under the dominion of the five senses, (the multitude itself consisted of five thousand:) or because the Law itself was given by Moses in five books. And the loaves being of barley is also an allusion to the Law, which concealed the soul’s vital nourishment, under carnal ceremonies. For in barley the corn itself is buried under the most tenacious husk. Or, it alludes to the people who were not yet freed from the husk of carnal appetite, which cling to their heart.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Hordeum etiam pabulum est iumentorum, et cibus servorum: et lex vetus data est servis et iumentis, idest carnalibus.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The two fishes again, that gave the pleasant taste to the bread, seem to signify the two authorities by which the people were governed, the Royal, viz. and the Priestly; both of which prefigure our Lord, who sustained both characters.

And whereas the number five refers to the five senses, a thousand stands for perfection. But those who strive to obtain the perfect government of their five senses, are called men, in consequence of their superior powers: they have no womanly weaknesses; but by a sober and chaste life, earn the sweet refreshment of heavenly wisdom.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord’s question proved the ignorance of His disciples, i.e. the people’s ignorance of the Law. They lay on the grass, i.e. were carnally minded, rested in carnal things, for all flesh is grass. Men are filled with the loaves, when what they hear with the ear, they fulfill in practice.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Baskets are used for servile work. The baskets here are the Apostles and their followers, who, though despised in this present life, are within filled with the riches of spiritual sacraments. The Apostles too are represented as baskets, because, that through them, the doctrine of the Trinity was to be preached in the four parts of the world. His not making new loaves, but multiplying what there were, means that He did not reject the Old Testament, but only developed and explained it.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The multitude concluding, from so great a miracle, that He was merciful and powerful, wished to make Him a king. For men like having a merciful king to rule over them, and a powerful one to protect them. Our Lord knowing this, retired to the mountain: When Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take Him by force to make Him a king, He departed again into a mountain Himself alone. From this we gather, that our Lord went down from the mountain before, where He was sitting with His disciples, when He saw the multitude coming, and had fed them on the plain below.

And this kingdom will be made manifest, after the judgment; when the brightness of His saints shall be revealed.

They care no more for the violation of the Sabbath; all their zeal for God is fled, now that their bellies are filled: Christ has become a Prophet, and they wish to enthrone Him as king. But Christ makes His escape; to teach us to despise the dignities of the world. He dismisses His disciples, and goes up into the mountain. - These, when their Master had left them went down in the evening to the sea; as we read; And when even was now come, His disciples went down to the sea. They waited till evening, thinking He would come to them; and then, as He did not come, delayed no longer searching for Him, but in the ardor of love, entered into a ship, and went over the sea toward Capernaum.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. He does not say, I am Jesus, but only I am. He trusts to their easily recognizing a c voice, which was so familiar to them, or, as is more probable, He shows that He was the same who said to Moses, I am that I am.

Hoc enim ostendit Evangelista subdens voluerunt ergo accipere eum in navi, et statim fuit navis ad terram ad quam ibant; tranquillam enim praebuit eis navigationem. Non autem navim ascendit, volens maius miraculum operari, et deitatem eius revelare apertius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He appeared to them in this way, to show His power; for He immediately calmed the tempest: Then they wished to receive Him into tile ship; and immediately the ship was at the land, whither they went. So great was the calm, He did not even enter the ship, in order to work a greater miracle, and to show his Divinity more clearly.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vide namque tria miracula. Primum est quod ambulabat supra mare; secundum est quod fluctus mitigat; tertium est quod statim fecit navim ad terram ire, ad quam ibant: nam multum distabant a terra cum eis dominus apparuit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Observe the three miracles here; the first, His walking on the sea; the second, His stilling the waves; the third, His putting them immediately on shore, which they were some distance off, when our Lord appeared.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Turbae autem non ostendit se Iesus supra mare ambulantem, quia hoc signum imbecillitatem eorum excedebat; sed neque discipulis diu visus est hoc faciens, sed statim disparuit ab eis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Jesus does not show Himself to the crowd walking on the sea, such a miracle being too much for them to hear. Nor even to the disciples did He show Himself long, but disappeared immediately.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Non est autem adversum quod Matthaeus prius eum dixit iussisse discipulos ascendere in naviculam, et praecedere eum trans fretum, donec dimitteret turbas: ac deinde dimissis turbis, ascendisse in montem solus orare; Ioannes vero prius eum fugisse commemorat solum in montem, ac deinde inquit ut autem sero factum est, descenderunt discipuli eius ad mare, et cum ascendissent navim, et cetera. Quis enim non hoc videat recapitulando Ioannem postea dixisse factum a discipulis, quod iam Iesus iusserat antequam fugisset in montem?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Mark’s account does not contradict this. He says indeed that our Lord told the disciples first to enter the ship, and go before Him over the sea, while He dismissed the crowds, and that when the crowd was dismissed, He went up alone into the mountain to pray: while John places His going up alone in the mountain first, and then says, And when even was now come, His disciples went down to the sea. But it is easy to see that John relates that as done afterwards by the disciples, which our Lord had ordered before His departure to the mountain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Mihi videtur hoc signum aliud ab eo quod apud Matthaeum positum est: tunc enim non statim eum susceperunt, nunc autem persuasi sunt statim suscipere; et tunc quidem adhuc tempestas permanebat concutiens navim, nunc autem cum voce tranquillitas advenit. Multoties enim eadem facit signa, ut facile susceptibilia fiant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or take another explanation. This miracle seems to me to be a different one, from the one given in Matthew: for there they do not receive Him into the ship immediately, whereas here they do: and there the storm lasts for some time, whereas here as soon as He speaks, there is a calm. He often repeats the same miracle in order to impress it on men’s minds.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Mystice autem pavit dominus turbas et ascendit in montem: sic enim de illo praedictum est: congregatio populorum circumdabit te; et propter hanc in altum regredere; idest, ut circumdet te congregatio populorum, regredere in altum. Quare autem dictum est fugit? Neque enim si nollet teneretur. Aliquid ergo significavit fugiendo: quia scilicet non potuit intelligi altitudo eius; quidquid enim non intellexeris fugit me dicis. Ergo fugit in montem ipse solus, quia ascendit super omnes caelos. Illo autem sursum posito discipuli in navicula tempestatem patiebantur: navicula illa Ecclesiam praesignabat. Tenebrae iam factae erant, et merito, quia lux non erat; non enim venerat ad illos Iesus. Quantum accedit finis mundi, crescunt errores, crescit iniquitas. Lux denique caritas est, secundum illud: qui odit fratrem suum, in tenebris est. Ipsi fluctus navem turbantes, et tempestates, et venti, clamores sunt maledicorum: inde caritas refrigescit, inde fluctus augentur, et turbatur navis. Nec tamen venti illi, et tempestas, et fluctus, et tenebrae id agebant ut vel navis non promoveretur, vel soluta mergeretur: qui enim perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit. Quinarius autem numerus ad legem pertinet; ipsi sunt quinque libri Moysi: ergo legem signat numerus vigesimus quintus: quoniam quinquies quini fiunt vigintiquinque. Sed huic legi, antequam Evangelium veniret, deerat perfectio, quae in senario numero comprehenditur. Ipsa ergo quinque per sex multiplicentur, ut lex per Evangelium impleatur, ut fiant sexies quini triginta. Ad eos ergo qui legem implent, venit Iesus calcans fluctus; idest, omnes tumores mundi sub pedibus habens, omnes altitudines saeculi premens; et tamen tantae sunt tribulationes ut etiam ipsi qui credunt in Iesum, expavescant ne deficiant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There is a mystical meaning in our Lord’s feeding the multitude, and ascending the mountain: for thus was it prophesied of Him, So shall the congregation of the people come about You: for their sake therefore lift up Yourself again: i.e. that the congregation of the people may come about You, lift up Yourself again. But why is it fled; for they could not have detained Him against His wild? This fleeing has a meaning; viz. that His flight is above our comprehension; just as, when you do not understand a thing, you see, It escapes me. He fled alone to the mountain, because He is ascended from above all heavens. But on His ascension aloft a storm came upon the disciples in the ship, i.e. the Church, and it became dark, the light, i.e. Jesus, having gone. As the end of the world draws nigh, error increases, iniquity abounds. Light again is love, according to John, He that hates his brother is in darkness. The waves and storms and winds then that agitate the ship, are the clamors of the evil speaking, and love waxing cold. Nevertheless the wind, and storm, and waves, and darkness were not able to stop, and sink the vessel; For be that endures to the end, the same shall be saved. As the number five has reference to the Law, the books of Moses being five, the number five and twenty, being made up of five pieces, has the same meaning. And this law was imperfect, before the Gospel came. Now the number of perfection is six, so therefore five is multiplied by six, which makes thirty: i.e. the law is fulfilled by the Gospel. To those then who fulfill the law Jesus comes treading on the waves, i.e. trampling under foot all the swellings of the world, all the loftiness of men: and yet such tribulations remain, that even they who believe on Jesus, fear lest they should be lost.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cum autem homines vel Daemones nos per timorem nituntur movere, audiamus Christum dicentem ego sum, nolite timere; idest, ego semper assisto, et sicut Deus permaneo, et numquam pertranseo: non perdatis in me fidem pro falsis terroribus. Vide etiam quomodo non in principio periculi dominus astitit, sed in fine. Permittit namque nos esse in medio periculorum, ut certantes in tribulationibus probabiliores fiamus, et ut ad ipsum solum recurramus qui potens est ex insperatis nos liberare. Cum enim intellectus humanus sibi providere non poterit, tunc salus divina advenit. Si voluerimus etiam Christum in naviculam nostram suscipere, idest in cordibus nostris habitare, statim inveniemur in terra ad quam ire volumus, idest in caelum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. When either men or devils try to terrify us, let us hear Christ saying, It is I, be not afraid, i.e. I am ever near you, God unchangeable, immovable; let not any false fears destroy your faith in Me. Observe too our Lord did not come when the danger was beginning, but when it was ending. He suffers us to remain in the midst of dangers and tribulations, that we may be proved thereby, and flee for succor to Him Who is able to give us deliverance when we least expect it. When man’s understanding can no longer help him, then the Divine deliverance comes. If we are willing also to receive Christ into the ship, i.e. to live in our hearts, we shall find ourselves immediately in the place, where we wish to be, i.e. heaven.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quia vero haec navicula non torpentes vehit, sed fortiter remigantes, significatur quod in Ecclesia non desidiosi et molles, sed fortes et in bonis operibus perseverantes perveniunt ad portum salutis aeternae.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. This ship, however, does not carry an idle crew; they are all stout rowers; i.e. in the Church not the idle and effeminate, but the strenuous and persevering in good works, attain to the harbor of everlasting salvation.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord, though He did not actually show Himself to the multitude walking on the sea, yet gave them the opportunity of inferring what had taken place; The day following, the people which stood on the other side of the sea saw that there was none other boat there, save that one whereinto His disciples were entered, and that Jesus went not with His disciples into the boat, but that His disciples were gone away alone. What was this but to suspect that He had walked across the sea, on His going away?

Except we say that this when meant how. And observe their lightness of mind. After saying, This is that Prophet, and wishing to take Him by force to make Him king, when they find Him, nothing of the kind is thought of.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Kindness and lenity are not always expedient. To the indolent or insensible disciple the spur must be applied; and this the Son of God does. For when the multitude comes with soft speeches, Rabbi, when came you hither? He shows them that He did not desire the honor that comes from man, by the severity of His answer, which both exposes the motive on which they acted, and rebukes it.

Sed et ipse Corinthum veniens morabatur apud aquilam et Priscillam, et operabatur. Dicendo autem ne operemini cibum qui perit, non insinuat quod oporteat pigritari, sed quod oporteat operari et dare: hic enim est cibus qui non perit; operari autem cibum qui perit, est affici saecularibus rebus.

And he himself too, when he resided with Aquila and Priscilla at Corinth, worked with his hand. By saying, Labor not for the meat which perishes, our Lord does not mean to tell us to be idle; but to work, and give alms. This is that meat which perishes not; to labor for the meat which perishes, is to be devoted to the interests of this life. Our Lord saw that the multitude had no thought of believing, and only wished to fill their bellies, without working; and this He justly called the meat which perishes.

Do not conceive that Son of man to be the same as other sons of men: He stands alone in abundance of grace, separate and distinct from all the rest: for that Son of man is the Son of God, as it follows, For Him has God the Father sealed. To seal is to put a mark upon; so the meaning is, Do not despise Me because I am the Son of man, for I am the Son of man in such sort, as that the Father has sealed Me, i.e. given Me something peculiar, to the end that should not be confounded with the human race, but that the human race should be delivered by Me.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. A seal throws out a perfect impression of the stamp, at the same time that it takes in that impression. This is not a perfect illustration of the Divine nativity: for sealing supposes matter, different kinds of matter, the impression of harder upon softer. Yet He who was God Only-Begotten, and the Son of man only by the Sacrament of our salvation, makes use of it to express the Father’s fullness as stamped upon Himself. He wishes to show the Jews He has the power of giving the eternal meat, because He contained in Himself the fullness of God.

          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Per eorum etiam personam, dominus illos intra sanctam Ecclesiam detestatur qui per sacros ordines ad dominum propinquantes, non in eisdem ordinibus virtutum merita, sed subsidia praesentis vitae exquirunt. Satiatos quippe de panibus dominum sequi, est de sancta Ecclesia temporalia alimenta sumpsisse; et non pro signis dominum, sed pro panibus quaerere, est ad religionis officium non pro augendis virtutibus, sed pro requirendis subsidiis inhiare.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. In their persons too our Lord condemns all those within the holy Church, who, when brought near to God by sacred Orders, do not seek the recompense of righteousness, but the interests of this present life. To follow our Lord, when filled with bread, is to use Holy Church as a means of livelihood; and to seek our Lord not for the miracle’s sake. but for the loaves, is to aspire to a religious office, not with a view to increase of grace, but to add to our worldly means.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Illi etiam qui in oratione quaerunt non aeterna, sed temporalia, quaerunt Iesum non propter Iesum, sed propter aliquid aliud. Significatur autem mystice quoniam haereticorum conventicula carent hospitio Christi ac discipulorum eius; et dicuntur aliae supervenisse naves, quia haereses repentinae fuerunt. Per turbam autem, quae cognovit quod Iesus non erat ibi, neque discipuli eius, illi designantur qui cognoscentes errores haereticorum, relinquunt eos, et ad veram fidem veniunt.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. They too seek Jesus, not for Jesus’ sake, but for something else, who ask in their prayers not for eternal, but temporal blessings. The mystical meaning is, that the conventicles of heretics are without the company of Christ and His disciples. And other ships coming is the sudden growth of heresies. By the crowd, which saw that Jesus was not there, or His disciples, are designated those who seeing the errors of heretics, leave them and turn to the true faith.

            <b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non autem dicit: ut credatis ei, sed ut credatis in eum: non enim continuo qui credit ei, credit in eum, nam et Daemones credebant ei, et non credebant in eum; et nos credimus Paulo, sed non in Paulum. Credere ergo in eum, est credendo amare, credendo diligere, credendo in eum ire, et eius membris incorporari. Ipsa est fides quam de nobis exigit Deus, quae per dilectionem operatur. Discernitur tamen ab operibus fides, sicut dicit apostolus: iustificari hominem per fidem sine operibus legis. Et sunt opera quae videntur bona sine fide Christi, et non sunt bona, quia non referuntur ad eum finem ex quo sunt bona; finis enim legis Christus ad iustitiam omni credenti; et ideo noluit discernere ab opere fidem; sed ipsam fidem dixit esse opus Dei; ipsa est enim fides quae per dilectionem operatur. Nec dixit: hoc est opus vestrum; sed hoc est opus Dei, ut credatis in eum, ut qui gloriatur, in domino glorietur.
            <p>Credere ergo in eum, est manducare cibum qui permanet in vitam aeternam. Ut quid paras dentem et ventrem? Crede, et manducasti.

          <td>
            <b>AUG</b>. He does not say, That you believe Him, but, that you believe in Him. For the devils believed Him, and did not believe in Him; and we believe Paul, but do not believe in Paul. To believe in Him is believing to love, believing to honor Him, believing to go to Him, and be made members incorporate of His Body. The faith, which God requires of us, is that which works by love. Faith indeed is distinguished from works by the Apostle, who says, That man is justified by faith without the deeds of the law. But the works indeed which appear good, without faith in Christ, are not really so, not being referred to that end, which makes them good. For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes. And therefore our Lord would not separate faith from works, but said that faith itself was the doing the work of God; He said not, This is your work, but, This is the work of God, that you believe in Him: in order that he that glories might glory in the Lord.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. To eat then that meat which endures to everlasting life, is to believe in Him. Why do you make ready your tooth and your belly? Only believe, and you have eaten already. As He called on them to believe, they still asked for miracles whereby to believe; They said therefore to Him, What sign show you then, that we may see and believe You? What do you work?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nihil irrationabilius quam ut, signo prae manibus existente, quasi nullo iam signo facto, hoc dicant. Neque electionem signi fiendi domino permittunt; sed in necessitatem eum aestimant ducere, ut nullum aliud faciat signum quam tale quale factum est in eorum parentibus; unde subditur patres nostri manducaverunt manna in deserto.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nothing can be more unreasonable than their asking for another miracle, as if none had been given already. And they do not even leave the choice of the miracle to our Lord; but would oblige Him to give them just that sign, which was given to their fathers: Our fathers did eat manna in the desert.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. And to exalt the miracle of the manna they quote the Psalm, As it is written, He gave them bread from heaven to eat.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Multis quidem factis signis et in Aegypto, et in mari rubro, et in deserto, huius maxime meminerunt, quod valde concupiscebant propter ventris tyrannidem. Neque autem dicunt quod Deus hoc fecit, ne videantur eum exaequare Deo; neque Moysen inducunt, ut non videantur Christum deprimere; sed medium ponunt dicentes patres nostri manducaverunt manna.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Whereas many miracles were performed in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the desert, they remembered this one the best of any. Such is the force of appetite. They do not mention this miracle as the work either of God, or of Moses, in order to avoid raising Him on the one hand to an equality with God, or lowering Him on the other by a comparison with Moses; but they take a middle ground, only saying, Our fathers did eat manna in the desert.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Dominus Iesus talem se dicebat ut se Moysi praeponeret: non enim est ausus Moyses de se dicere, quod daret cibum qui non perit.

Panes hordeaceos ille non dedit, sed manna de caelo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus; Our Lord sets Himself above Moses, who did not dare to say that He gave the meat which perishes not. The multitude therefore remembering what Moses had done, and wishing for some greater miracle, say, as it were, you promise the meat which perishes not, and does not works equal to those Moses did. He gave us not barley loaves, but manna from heaven.

An non ex caelo erat manna? Qualiter igitur ex caelo dicitur? Sicut et volucres caeli dicuntur, et sicut dicitur: intonuit de caelo dominus. Panem autem non verum vocavit illum, non quia falsum erat miraculum de manna; sed quia figura erat, non veritas. Non dixit: non Moyses dedit, sed ego; sed pro Moyse quidem Deum, pro manna vero seipsum posuit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord might have replied, that He had done miracles greater than Moses: but it was not the time for such a declaration. One thing He desired, viz. to bring them to taste the spiritual meat: then Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Moses gave you not that bread from heaven; but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven. Did not the manna come from heaven? True, but in what sense did it? The same in which the birds are called, the birds of heaven; and just as it is said in the Psalm, The Lord thundered out of heaven. He calls it the true bread, not because the miracle of the manna was false, but because it was the figure, not the reality. He does not say too, Moses gave it you not, but I: but He puts God for Moses, Himself for the manna.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quasi diceret: illud manna hoc significabat, scilicet cibum de quo paulo ante locutus sum; et omnia signa mea erant.

Deus enim dat panem quem significavit manna ipsum, scilicet dominum Iesum Christum; unde sequitur panis enim verus est qui de caelo descendit, et dat vitam mundo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if He said, That manna was the type of this food, of which I just now spoke; and which all my. miracles refer to. You like my miracles, you despise what is signified by them. This bread which God gives, and which this manna represented, is the Lord Jesus Christ, as we read next, For the bread of God is He which comes down from hearer, and gives life to the world.

Nam Iudaei videntes, stupefacti, unus ad alium dicebant: quid est hoc? Filius autem Dei factus homo ipse est potissimum admirativum manna, ita ut cuilibet contingat quaerere: quid est hoc? Quomodo filius Dei, filius hominis est? Quomodo ex duabus naturis una fit persona?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He calls Himself the true bread, because the only-begotten Son of God, made man, was principally signified by the manna. For manna means literally, what is this? The Israelites were astonished at first on finding it, and asked one another what it was. And the Son of God, made man, is in an especial sense this mysterious manna, which we ask about, saying, What is this? How can the Son of God be the Son of man? How can one person consist of two natures?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Qui per assumptam humanitatem descendit de caelo, et per assumentem divinitatem dat vitam mundo.

Sicut enim panis ex terra infirmam naturam carnis conservat, sic et Christus per spiritus operationes vivificat animam, et etiam corpus incorruptibile facit, nam per eius resurrectionem corporalis confertur incorruptio; et ideo dicit quod dat vitam mundo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. But this bread, being essentially life, (for He is the Son of the living Father,) in quickening all things, does but what is natural to Him to do. For as natural bread supports our weak flesh, so Christ, by the operations of the Spirit, gives life to the soul; and even incorruption to the body, (for at the resurrection the body will be made incorruptible.) Wherefore He says, that He gives life to the world.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Not only to the Jews, but to the whole world. The multitude, however, still attached a low meaning to His words: Then said they to Him, Lord, evermore give us this bread. They say, Give us this bread, not, Ask Your Father to give it us: whereas He had said that His Father gave this bread.

Per hoc autem tangit incredulitatem eorum, ostendens quoniam qui non credit ei, voluntatem transgreditur patris. Paulus autem ait quod ipse eos tradiderit patri: cum tradiderit regnum Deo et patri. Sicut igitur pater dans non privat seipsum, sic nec filius tradens. Dicitur autem filius tradere, quoniam per eum ad patrem adducimur. Et de patre dictum est: per quem vocati estis in societatem filii eius. Sic igitur qui venit ad me salvabitur, quia pro his veni et carnem assumpsi; unde sequitur quia descendi de caelo, non ut faciam voluntatem meam, sed voluntatem eius qui misit me. Quid dicis? Alia sunt tua, et quae illius? Ne igitur hoc aliquis suspicetur, subiunxit haec est autem voluntas eius qui misit me, ut omnis qui videt filium et credit in eum, habeat vitam aeternam. Per hoc autem et filius vult, quia filius quos vult vivificat. Quid est igitur quod dicit? Non aliud acturus veni quam quod pater vult, quasi non habens divisam voluntatem a patre: omnia enim quae patris sunt, mea sunt. Sed hoc non dixit; sed in fine reservat; excelsa enim interim occultat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The expression, that the Father gives Me, shows that it is no accident whether a man believes or not, and that belief is not the work of human cogitation, but requires a revelation from on high, and a mind devout enough to receive the revelation. Not that they are free from blame, whom the Father does not give, for they are deficient even in that which lies in their own power, the will to believe. This is a virtual rebuke to their unbelief, as it shows that whoever does not believe in Him, transgresses the Father’s will. Paul, however, says, that He gives them up to the Father: When He shall have given up the kingdom to God, even the Father. But as the Father, in giving, does not take from Himself, so neither does the Son when He gives up. The Son is said to give up to the Father, because we are brought to the Father by Him. And of the Father at the same time we read, By Whom you were called to the fellowship of His Son. Whoever then, our Lord says, comes to Me, shall be saved, for to save such I took up flesh: For I came down from heaven not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. But what? Have you one will, He another? No, certainly. Mark what He says afterwards; And this is the will of Him that sent Me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes in Him, should have everlasting life. And this is the Son’s will too; For the Son quickens whom He will. He says then, I came to do nothing but what the Father wills, for I have no will distinct from My Father’s: all things that the Father has are Mine. But this not now: He reserves these higher truths for the end of His ministry.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Quare non eiciat foras, subiungit dicens quia descendi de caelo, non ut faciam voluntatem meam, sed voluntatem eius qui misit me. Propterea enim anima a Deo exiit, quia superba erat. Superbia enim eiecti sumus, humilitate regredimur. Medicus enim quando aegritudinem discutit, si curet quod per aliquam causam factum est, et ipsam causam non curet, ad tempus videtur mederi, sed causa manente, morbus repetitur. Ut ergo causa omnium morborum curaretur, idest superbia, descendit, et humilis factus est filius Dei. Quid superbis, homo? Filius Dei propter te humilis factus est. Puderet te fortasse imitari humilem hominem; saltem imitare humilem Deum: haec est enim commendatio humilitatis. Non veni facere voluntatem meam, sed voluntatem eius qui misit me: superbia quippe facit voluntatem suam, humilitas voluntatem Dei.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This is the reason why He does not cast out those who come to Him. For I came down from, heaven not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. The soul departed from God, because it was proud. Pride casts us out, humility restores us. When a physician in the treatment of a disease, cures certain outward symptoms, but not the cause which produces them, his cure is only temporary. So long as the cause remains, the disease may return. That the cause then of all diseases, i.e. pride, might be eradicated, the Son of God humbled Himself. Why are you proud, O man? The Son of God humbled Himself for you. It might shame you, perhaps, to imitate a humble man; but imitate at least a humble God. And this is the proof of His humility: I came not to do Mine own will, but the will of Him that sent Me. Pride does its own will; humility the will of God.

Quare autem ideo non eiciat foras qui venit ad illum, quia non venit facere voluntatem suam, ostendit cum subdit haec est enim voluntas eius qui misit me patris, ut omne quod dedit mihi pater non perdam ex eo. Ipse illi datus est qui servat humilitatem. Non est voluntas in conspectu patris, ut pereat unus de pusillis. De tumentibus potest perire, de pusillis nihil perit: quia nisi fueritis sicut pusillus iste, non intrabitis in regnum caelorum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For this very reason therefore, I will not cast out Him that comes to Me; because I came not to do Mine own will. I came to teach humility, by being humble Myself. He that comes to Me, is made a member of Me, and necessarily humble, because He will not do His own will, but the will of God; and therefore is not cast out. He was cast out, as proud; he returns to Me humble, he is not sent away, except for pride again; he who keeps his humility, fails not from the truth. And further, that He does not cast out such, because He came not to do His will, He shows when He says, And this is the Father’s will which has sent Me, that of all which He has given Me, I should lose nothing. Every one of an humble mind is given to Him: It is not the will of your Fatter, that one of these little ones should perish. The swelling ones may perish; of the little ones none can; for except you be as a little child, you shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven.

They therefore who by God s unerring providence are foreknown, and predestined, called, justified, glorified, even before their new birth, or before they are born at all, are already the sons of God, and cannot possibly perish; these are they who truly come to Christ.

After these declarations, I will in no wise cast out, and I should lose nothing, He adds, But should raise it up at the last day. In the general resurrection the wicked will be cast out, according to Matthew, Take him, and cast him into outer darkness. And, Who is able to cast both soul and body into hell. He often brings in mention of the resurrection for this purpose: viz. to warn men not to judge of God’s providence from present events, but to carry on their ideas to another world.

Superius dixit: qui audit verbum meum, et credit ei qui misit me; modo autem: qui videt filium et credit in eum.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. See how the twofold resurrection is expressed here. He who comes to Me, shall forthwith rise again; by becoming humble, and a member of Me. But then He proceeds; But I will raise him up at the last day. To explain the words, All that the Father has given Me, and, I should lose nothing, He adds; And this is the will of Him that has’ sent Me, that every one which sees the Son, and believes in Him, may have everlasting life: and I will raise him up on the last day. Above He said, Whoso hears My word, and believes in Him that sent Me: now it is, Every one which sees the Son, and believes in Him. He does not say, believe in the Father, because it is the same thing to believe in the Father, and in the Son; for us the Father has life in Himself, even so has He given to the Son to have life in Himself, and again, That whoso sees the Son and believes on Him, should hare everlasting life; i.e. by believing, by passing over to life, as at the first resurrection. But this is only the first resurrection, He alludes to the second when He says, And I will raise him up at the last day.

The Jews, so long as they thought to get food for their carnal eating, had no misgivings; but when this hope was taken away, then, we read, the Jews murmured at Him because He said, I am the bread which came down from heaven.

As yet however they reverenced Him, for His miracle; and only expressed their discontent by murmurs.

This is the doctrine of grace: none comes, except he be drawn. But whom the Father draws, and whom not, and why He draws one, and not another, presume not to decide, if you would avoid falling into error.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed si inviti trahimur ad Christum, inviti credimus; ergo violentia adhibetur, non voluntas excitatur. Sed intrare quisquam Ecclesiam potest nolens; credere non potest nisi volens; corde enim creditur ad iustitiam. Si ergo invitus venit qui trahitur, non credit; si non credit, non venit: non enim ad Christum ambulando currimus, sed credendo; nec motu corporis, sed voluntate cordis accedimus: ergo voluntate traheris. Quid est autem trahi voluntate? Delectare in domino, et dabit tibi petitiones cordis tui. Est quaedam voluptas cordis, cui dulcis est panis ille caelestis. Porro si poetae dicere licuit: trahit sua quemque voluptas, quanto fortius nos dicere debemus trahi hominem ad Christum, qui delectatur veritate, beatitudine, iustitia, sempiterna vita, quod totum Christus est? An vero habent corporis sensus voluptates suas, et animus deseritur a voluptatibus suis? Da amantem, desiderantem, ferventem, fonti aeternae patriae suspirantem; et scit quid dicam. Sed quare voluit dicere quem traxerit pater? Si trahendi sumus, ab illo trahamur cui dicit quaedam quae diligit: trahe me post te. Sed quid intelligi voluit advertamus. Trahit pater ad filium eos qui propterea credunt in filium, quia eum cogitant patrem habere Deum. Deus enim pater aequalem sibi genuit filium: et qui cogitat, atque in fide sua sentit, ac ruminat aequalem esse patri eum in quem credit, ipsum trahit pater ad filium. Arius credidit creaturam: non eum traxit pater. Photinus dicit: homo solum est Christus. Qui sic credit, non eum pater trahit. Traxit Petrum qui dixit: tu es Christus filius Dei vivi; unde ei dictum est: non tibi revelavit caro et sanguis, sed pater meus qui in caelis est. Ista revelatio ipsa attractio est. Si enim qui inter delicias terrenas revelantur amantibus, trahunt, non trahet revelatus Christus a patre? Quid enim fortius desiderat anima quam veritatem? Sed hic homines esuriunt, ibi saturabuntur; ideo subiecit et ego resuscitabo eum in novissimo die: quasi dicat: saturabitur eo quod et hic sitit, in resurrectione mortuorum, quoniam ego resuscitabo eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Now if we are drawn to Christ without our own will, we believe without our own will; the will is not exercised, but compulsion is applied. But, though a man can enter the Church involuntarily, he cannot believe other than voluntarily; for with the heart man believes to righteousness. Therefore if he who is drawn, comes without his will, he does not believe; if he does not believe, he does not come. For we do not come to Christ, by running, or walking, but by believing, not by the motion of the body, but the will of the mind. You are drawn by your will. But what is it to be drawn by the will? Delight you in the Lord, and He will give you your heart’s desire. There is a certain craving of the heart, to which that heavenly bread is pleasant. If the Poet could say, “Trahit sua quemque voluptas,” how much more strongly may we speak of a man being drawn to Christ, i.e. being delighted with truth, happiness, justice eternal life, all which is Christ? Have the bodily senses their pleasures, and has not the soul hers? Give me one who loves, who longs, who burns, who sighs for the source of his being and his eternal home; and he will know what I mean. But why did He say, Except my Father draw him? If we are to be drawn, let us be drawn by Him to whom His love said, Draw me, we will run after You. But let us see what is meant by it. The Father draws to the Son those who believe on the Son, as thinking that He has God for His Father. For the Father begat the Son equal to Himself; and whoso thinks and believes really and seriously that He on Whom He believes is equal to the Father, him the Father draws to the Son. Arius believed Him to be a creature; the Father drew not him. Thomas says, Christ is only a man. Because he so believes, the Father draws him not. He drew Peter who said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God; to whom accordingly it was told, For flesh and blood, has not revealed it to you, but My Father which is in heaven. That revelation is the drawing. For if earthly objects, when put before us, draw us; how much more shall Christ, when revealed by the Father? For what does the soul more long after than truth? But here men hunger, there they will be filled. Wherefore He adds, And I will raise him up at the last day: as if He said, He shall be filled with that, for which he now thirsts, at the resurrection of the dead; for I will raise him up.

You see the excellence of faith; that it cannot be learnt from men, or by the teaching of man, but only from God Himself. The Master sits, dispensing His truth to all, pouring out His doctrine to all. But if all are to be taught of God, how is it that some believe not?

Si autem omnis qui audivit a patre et didicit, venit, profecto omnis qui non venit, non audit a patre, nec didicit. Valde remota est a sensibus carnis haec schola, in qua pater auditur et docet, ut veniatur ad filium; nec agit hoc cum carnis aure, sed cordis, ubi est et ipse filius; quia ipse est verbum eius per quod pater sic docet: simul est et spiritus sanctus: inseparabilia enim didicimus esse opera Trinitatis. Sed patri hoc potissimum est attributum, quia de ipso procedit et filius et spiritus sanctus. Itaque gratia quae occulte et humanis cordibus divina largitate tribuitur, a nullo corde duro respuitur: ideo quippe tribuitur, ut cordis duritia primitus auferatur. Cur ergo non omnes docet ut veniant ad Christum, nisi quia eos quos docet, misericordia docet; quos autem non docet, iudicio non docet? Si autem dixerimus, quod volunt discere, quos non docet, respondebitur nobis: et ubi est quod ei dicitur: Deus, tu convertens vivificabis nos? Aut si non faciat volentes ex nolentibus Deus, ut quid orat Ecclesia secundum praeceptum domini pro persecutoribus suis? Non enim quisquam dicere potest: credidi, ut sic vocarer; praevenit quippe eum misericordia Dei, quia sic est vocatus ut crederet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. All that are taught of God come to the Son, because they have heard and learnt from the Father of the Son: wherefore He proceeds, Every man that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to Me. But if every one that has heard and learnt of the Father comes, every one that has not heard of the Father has not learnt. For beyond the reach of the bodily senses is this school, in which the Father is heard, and men taught to come to the Son. Here we have not to do with the carnal ear, but the ear of the heart; for here is the Son Himself, the Word by which the Father teaches, and together with Him the Holy Spirit the operations of the three Persons being inseparable from each other. This is attributed however principally to the Father, because from Him proceeds the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Therefore the grace which the Divine bounty imparts in secret to men’s hearts, is rejected by none from hardness of heart: seeing it is given in the first instance, in order to take away hard-heartedness. Why then does He not teach all to come to Christ? Because those whom He teaches, He teaches in mercy; and those whom He teaches not, He teaches not in judgment. But if we say, that those, whom He teaches not, wish to learn, we shall be answered, Why then is it said, Will you not turn again, and quicken us? If God does not make willing minds out of unwilling, why prays the Church, according to our Lord’s command, for her persecutors? For no one can say, I believed, and therefore He called me: rather the preventing mercy of God called him, that he might believe.

Quid igitur? Christus nihil docuit? Quid quod? Patrem magistrum homines non viderunt, filium viderunt? Filius ergo dicebat, sed pater docebat. Si enim ego homo cum sim, illum doceo qui audivit verbum meum, illum docet et pater qui audivit verbum eius. Exponit autem hoc ipse, et ostendit nobis quid dixerat, continuo subiungens non quia patrem vidit quisquam; nisi qui a Deo est, hic vidit patrem; quasi dicat: ne forte cum dico vobis omnis qui audivit a patre, et didicit, dicatis apud vos: nunquam vidimus patrem: quomodo ab eo discere poterimus? A meipso audite. Ego novi patrem, ab illo sum, quomodo verbum est ab illo cuius est verbum: non quod sonat et transit, sed quod manet cum dicente, et trahit audientem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Behold then how the Father draws; not by laying a necessity on man, but by teaching the truth. To draw, belongs to God: Every one that has heard, and has learned of the Father, comes to Me. What then? has Christ taught nothing? Not so. What if men saw not the Father teaching, but saw the Son. So then the Father taught, the Son spoke. As I teach you by My word, so the Father teaches by His Word. But He Himself explains the matter, if we read on: Not that any man has seen the Father, save He which is of God, He has seen the Father; as if He said, Do not when I tell you, Every man that has heard and learnt of the Father, say to yourselves, We have never seen the Father, and how then can we have learnt from Him? Hear Him then in Me. I know the Father, and am from Him, just as a word is from him who speaks it; i.e. not the mere passing sound, but that which remains with the speaker, and draws the hearer.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The addition, In the wilderness, is not put in without meaning, but to remind them how short a time the manna lasted; only till the entrance into the land of promise. And because the bread which Christ gave seemed inferior to the manna, in that the latter had come down from heaven, while the former was of this world, He adds, This is the bread which comes down from heaven.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He then gives them a strong reason for believing that they were given for higher privileges than their fathers. Their fathers eat manna and were dead; whereas of this bread He says, that a man may eat thereof, and not die. The difference of the two is evident from the difference of their ends. By bread here is meant wholesome doctrine, and faith in Him, or His body: for these are the preservatives of the soul.

Nam et nos hodie accipimus visibilem cibum; sed aliud est sacramentum, aliud virtus sacramenti: quoniam multi de altari accipiunt, et accipiendo moriuntur: unde apostolus: iudicium sibi manducat et bibit. Panem ergo caelestem spiritualiter manducare, est innocentiam ad altare apportare; peccata, etsi sint quotidiana, non sint mortifera; antequam ad altare accedatis attendite quid dicatis: dimitte nobis debita nostra, sicut et nos dimittimus debitoribus nostris. Si dimittis, dimittentur tibi; securus accede: panis est, non venenum.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But are we, who eat the bread that comes down from heaven, relieved from death? From visible and carnal death, the death of the body, we are not: we shall die, even as they died. But from spiritual death which their fathers suffered, we are delivered. Moses and many, acceptable of God, eat the manna, and died not, because they understood that visible food in a spiritual sense, spiritually tasted it, and were spiritually filled with it. And we too at this day receive the visible food; but the Sacrament is one thing, the virtue of the Sacrament another. Many a one receives from the Altar, and perishes in receiving; eating and drinking his own damnation, as said the Apostle. To eat then the heavenly bread spiritually, is to bring to the Altar an innocent mind. Sins, though they be daily, are not deadly. Before you go to the Altar, attend to the prayer you repeat: Forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. If you forgive, you are forgiven: approach confidently; it is bread, not poison. None then that eat of this bread, shall die. But we speak of the virtue of the Sacrament, not the visible Sacrament itself; of the inward, not of the outward eater.

Quia si caro videretur, horror nos in eius assumptione invaderet; unde ut nostrae infirmitati condescendatur, talis nobis videtur mysticus cibus secundum quod nostrae consuetudini competebat.

Forte autem et vitam quae in sanctificatione et beatificatione consistit, et spiritu, mundi vitam dixit: quamvis enim non omnes susceperint vitam quae est in sanctificatione et spiritu; tamen dominus seipsum pro mundo tradidit; et quantum in eo est, totus mundus sanctificatur.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Which I shall give: this shows His power; for it shows that He was not crucified as a servant, in subjection to the Father, but of his own accord; for though He is said to have been given up by the Father, yet He delivered Himself up also. And observe, the bread which is taken by us in the mysteries, is not only the sign of Christ’s flesh, but is itself the very flesh of Christ; for He does not say, The bread which I will give, is the sign of My flesh, but, is My flesh. The bread is by a mystical benediction conveyed in unutterable words, and by the indwelling of the Holy Ghost, transmuted into the flesh of Christ. But why see we not the flesh? Because, if the flesh were seen, it would revolt us to such a degree, that we should be unable to partake of it. And therefore in condescension to our infirmity, the mystical food is given to us under an appearance suitable to our minds. He gave His flesh for the life of the world, in that, by dying, He destroyed death. By the life of the world too, I understand the resurrection; our Lord’s death having brought about the resurrection of the whole human race. It may mean too the sanctified, beatified, spiritual life; for though all have not attained to this life, yet our Lord gave Himself for the world, and, as far as lies in Him, the whole world is sanctified.

Numquid enim corpus meum vivit de spiritu tuo? Hunc panem exponit apostolus dicens: unum corpus multi sumus. O sacramentum pietatis, o signum unitatis, o vinculum caritatis.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But when does flesh receive the bread which He calls His flesh? The faithful know and receive the Body of Christ, if they labor to be the body of Christ. And they become the body of Christ, if they study to live by the Spirit of Christ: for that which lives by the Spirit of Christ, is the body of Christ. This bread the Apostle sets forth, where he says, We being many are one body. O sacrament of mercy, O sign of unity, O bond of love! Whoso wishes to live, let him draw nigh, believe, be incorporated, that he may be quickened.

If we do not take that indeed, we shall not live, neither do we live, if we take it: for either disease, or old age, or some accident kills us after all. Whereas this meat and drink, i.e. the Body and Blood of Christ, is such that he that takes it not has not life, and he that takes it has life, even life eternal.

Sed contradicit eis apostolus dicens: manifesta sunt opera carnis, quae sunt fornicatio, immunditia, impudicitia, luxuria, idolorum servitus, veneficia, inimicitiae, contentiones, aemulationes, irae, rixae, dissensiones, sectae, invidiae, homicidia, ebrietates, comessationes, et his similia; quae praedico, sicut praedixi, quoniam qui talia agunt, regnum Dei non possidebunt. Quamobrem quomodo sit accipiendum quod hic dicitur, merito quaeritur. Qui enim in eius est corporis unitate, idest in Christianorum compage membrorum, cuius corporis sacramentum fideles communicantes de altari sumere consueverunt, ipse vere dicendus est manducare corpus et bibere sanguinem Christi; ac per hoc haeretici et schismatici ab unitate corporis separati, possunt idem percipere sacramentum, sed non sibi utile, immo vero etiam noxium, quo iudicentur gravius quam vel tardius liberentur. Nec illi etiam in perditis et damnabilibus moribus debent esse securi, qui per vitae iniquitatem, ipsam vitae iustitiam, quae est Christus, deserunt, sive fornicando, sive aliquid huiusmodi faciendo: non enim isti dicendi sunt manducare corpus Christi, quoniam nec in membris computandi sunt Christi. Ut enim alia taceam, non possunt simul esse membra Christi et membra meretricis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There are some who promise men deliverance from eternal punishment, if they are washed in Baptism and partake of Christ’s Body, whatever lives they live. The Apostle however contradicts them, where he says, The works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies, envyings, murders, drunkeness, revelings, and such like; of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. Let us examine what is meant here. He who is in the unity of His body, (i.e. one of the Christian members,) the Sacrament of which body the faithful receive when they communicate at the Altar; he is truly said to eat the body, and drink the blood of Christ. And heretics and schismatics, who are cut off from the unity of the body, may receive the same Sacrament; but it does not profit them, may, rather is hurtful, as tending to make their judgment heavier, or their forgiveness later. Nor ought they to feel secure in their abandoned and damnable ways, who, by the iniquity of their lives, desert righteousness, i.e. Christ; either by fornication, or other sins of the like kind. Such are not to be said to eat the body of Christ; forasmuch as they are not to be counted among the members of Christ For, not to mention other things, men cannot be members of Christ, and at the same time members of an harlot.

Huius rei sacramentum, idest unitas corporis et sanguinis Christi, alicubi quotidie, alicubi certis intervallis dierum in dominica mensa praeparatur, et de dominica mensa sumitur: quibusdam ad vitam, quibusdam ad exitium. Res vero ipsa, cuius sacramentum est, omni homini est ad vitam, nulli ad exitium, quicumque eius particeps fuerit. Ne autem putarent sic in isto cibo et potu promitti vitam aeternam, ut qui eum sumerent, iam nec corpore morerentur, huic cogitationi occurrens subiungit dicens et ego resuscitabo eum in novissimo die: ut scilicet habeant interim vitam aeternam secundum spiritum in requie, quae sanctorum spiritus suscipit; quod autem ad corpus attinet, nec corpus etiam vita aeterna fraudetur, sed in resurrectione mortuorum in novissimo die eam habeat.

By this meat and drink then, He would have us understand the society of His body, and His members, which is the Church, in the predestined, and called, and justified, and glorified saints and believers. The Sacrament whereof, i.e. Of the unity of the body and blood of Christ, is administered, in some places daily, in others on such and such days from the Lord’s Table: and from the Lord’s Table it is received by some to their salvation, by others to their condemnation. But the thing itself of which this is the Sacrament, is for our salvation to every one who partakes of it, for condemnation to none. To prevent us supposing that those who, by virtue of that meat and drink, were promised eternal life, would not die in the body, Ho adds, And I will raise him up at the last day; i.e. to that eternal life, a spiritual rest, which the spirits of the Saints enter into. But neither shall the body be defrauded of eternal life, but shall be endowed With it at the resurrection of the dead in the last day.

Cum cibo et potu id appetant homines ut non esuriant neque sitiant; hoc veraciter non praestat nisi iste cibus et potus, qui eos a quibus sumitur immortales et incorruptibiles facit; idest societas ipsa sanctorum, ubi pax erit, et unitas plena atque perfecta. Propterea dominus noster corpus et sanguinem suum in eis rebus commendavit quae ad unum aliquid rediguntur ex multis: namque aliud, scilicet panis, ex multis granis in unum constat; aliud, scilicet vinum, ex multis acinis confluit. Deinde iam exponit quid sit manducare corpus eius et sanguinem bibere, dicens qui manducat meam carnem et bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet et ego in illo. Hoc est ergo manducare illam escam et illum bibere potum, in Christo manere, et Christum in se habere. At per hoc qui non manet in Christo, et in quo non manet Christus, proculdubio nec manducat eius carnem, nec bibit eius sanguinem; sed magis tantae rei sacramentum ad iudicium sibi manducat et bibit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: Whereas men desire meat and drink to satisfy hunger and thirst, this effect is only really produced by that meat and drink, which makes the receivers of it immortal and incorruptible; i.e. the society of Saints, where is peace and unity, full and perfect. On which account our Lord has chosen for the types of His body and blood, things which become one out of many. Bread is a quantity of grains united into one mass, wine a quantity of grapes squeezed together. Then He explains what it is to eat His body and drink His blood: He that eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, dwells in Me, and I in him. So then to partake of that meat and that drink, is to dwell in Christ and Christ in you. He that dwells not in Christ, and in whom Christ dwells not, neither eats His flesh, nor drinks His blood: but rather eats and drinks the sacrament of it to his own damnation.

Quod autem dicit qui manducat me, et ipse vivet propter me, non de vita simpliciter hoc dicit, sed de approbata: etenim etiam infideles vivunt non manducantes de carne illa.

He that eats Me, even he shall live by Me; the life here meant is not life simply, but the justified life: for even unbelievers live, who never eat of that flesh at all.

Si ergo ita dictum est vivo propter patrem, quia ipse de illo est, sine detrimento aequalitatis dictum est. Nec tamen eamdem nostram et suam aequalitatem significavit, sed gratiam mediatoris ostendit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He said not, As I eat the Father, and live by the Father, so he that eats Me, even he shall live by Me. For the Son does not grow better by partaking of the Father, as we do by partaking of the Son, i.e. of His one body and blood, which this eating and drinking signifies. So that His saying, I live by the Father, because He is from Him, must not be understood as detracting from His equality. Nor do the words, Even he that eats Me, the same shall live by Me, give us the equality that He has. He does not equalize, but only mediates between God and man. If, however, we understand the words, I live by the Father, in the sense of those below, My Father is greater than I, then it is as if He said, That I live by the Father, i.e. refer my life to Him, as my superior, my humiliation in my incarnation is the cause; but He who lives by Me, lives by Me by virtue of partaking of My flesh.

Si ergo nos naturaliter secundum carnem per eum vivimus, idest naturam carnis suae adepti; quomodo non naturaliter secundum spiritum in se patrem habeat, cum vivat ipse per patrem?

Of the truth then of the body and blood of Christ, no room for doubting remains: for, by the declaration of our Lord Himself, and by the teaching of our own faith, the flesh is really flesh, and the blood really blood. This then is our principle of life. While we are in the flesh, Christ dwells in us by His flesh. And we shall live by Him, according as He lives. If then we live naturally by partaking of Him according to the flesh, He also lives naturally by the indwelling of the Father according to the Spirit. His birth did not give Him an alien or different nature from the Father.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He calls Himself the bread, because He is the origin of His own body. And lest it should be thought that the virtue and nature of the Word had given way to the flesh, He calls the bread His flesh, that, inasmuch as the bread came down from heaven, it might be seen that His body was not of human conception, but a heavenly body.

For if it was possible without harvest or fruit of the earth, or any such thing, to preserve the lives of the Israelites of old for forty years, much more will He be able to do this with that spiritual food, of which the manna is the type. He knew how precious a thing life was in men’s eyes, and therefore repeats His promise of life often; just as the Old Testament had done; only that it only offered length of life, He life without end. This promise was an abolition of that sentence of death, which sin had brought upon us. These things said He in the synagogue, as He taught in Capernaum; where many displays of His power took place. He taught in the synagogue and in the temple, with the view of attracting the multitude, and as a sign that He was not acting in opposition to the Father.

For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were For believed not, and who should betray him. 65. And he said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to me, except it were given that him of my Father. 66. From that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him. 67. Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away? 68. Then Simon Peter answered him. Lord, to whom shall we go? you have the words of eternal life. 69. And we believe and are sure that you are that Christ, the Son of the living God. 70. Jesus answered red them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? 71. He spoke of Judas Iscariot the son of Simon: for he it was that should betray him, being one of the twelve.</span>

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Talia loquente Iesu, non crediderunt aliquid magnum dicentem, et verbis illis aliquam gratiam cooperientem; sed prout voluerunt intellexerunt, et more hominum, quia poterat aut disponebat Iesus carnem, qua indutum erat verbum, veluti conscissam distribuere credentibus in se; unde dicitur multi ergo audientes, non ex inimicis, sed ex discipulis eius dixerunt: durus est hic sermo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Such is our Lord’s discourse. The people did not perceive that it had a deep meaning or, that grace went along with it: but receiving the matter in their own way, and taking His words in a human sense, understood Him as if He spoke of cutting of the flesh of the Word into pieces, for distribution to those who believed on Him: Many therefore, not of His enemies, but even of His disciples, when they heard this, said, This is a hard saying, who can bear it?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Idest, difficile susceptibilis, superexcedens eorum imbecillitatem: putabant enim eum supra seipsum loqui maiora propria dignitate, et dixerunt quis potest eum audire? Quasi pro seipsis respondentes, quia non debebant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. i.e. difficult to receive, too much for their weakness. They thought He spoke above Himself, and more loftily than He had a right to do; and so said they, Who can bear it? which was answering in fact for themselves, that they could not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Si autem discipuli durum habuerunt istum sermonem, quid inimici? Et tamen sic oportebat ut diceretur quod non ab hominibus intelligeretur; secretum Dei intentos debet facere, non adversos.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And if His disciples thought that saying hard what would His enemies think? Yet it was necessary to declare a thing, which would be unintelligible to men. God’s mysteries should draw men’s attention, not enmity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cum autem audis quod discipuli eius murmurabant, non intelligas hos qui actu sunt discipuli, sed hos qui in habitu et figura videbantur ab eo instrui. Nam inter discipulos erant quidam ex plebe, qui dicebantur eius discipuli, quia multo cum discipulis manebant tempore.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. When you hear, however, of His disciples murmuring, understand not those really such, but rather some who, as far as their air and behavior went, seemed to be receiving instruction from Him. For among His disciples were some of the people, who were called such, because they stayed some time with His disciples.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic autem apud se ista dixerunt ut ab illo non audirentur; sed ille, qui noverat in seipsis, apud seipsum audiebat; unde sequitur sciens autem Iesus apud seipsum, quia murmurarent de hoc discipuli eius, dixit eis: hoc vos scandalizat?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They spoke, however, so as not to be heard by Him. But He, who knew what was in them, heard within Himself: When Jesus knew within Himself that His disciples murmured at it, He said to them, Does this of offend you?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Quod scilicet dixi vobis, manducare carnem meam, et bibere sanguinem meum.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. i.e. that I said, you should eat My flesh, and drink My blood.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Erat autem hoc suae deitatis signum, occulta in medium ferre; unde sequitur si ergo videritis filium hominis ascendentem ubi erat prius: supple: quid dicetis? Hoc et in Nathanaele fecit dicens: quoniam dixi tibi: vidi te sub ficu, credis; maiora his videbis. Non igitur quaestiones quaestionibus copulat; sed magnitudine dogmatum et multitudine eos inducere vult. Non igitur discipulos in scandalum mittere volens hoc dicit, sed eorum scandalum solvere volens: nam dum aestimant eum de Ioseph natum, non suscipiunt ea quae dicebantur. Qui vero credituri erant quoniam de caelo descendit et illuc ascendit, facilius attendunt his quae dicebantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The revelation however of these hidden things was a mark of His Divinity: hence the meaning of what follows; And if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before; supply, What will you say? He said the same to Nathanael, Because I said to you, I saw you under the fig tree, believe you? You shall see greater things than these. He does not add difficulty to difficulty, but to convince them by the number and greatness of His doctrines. For if He had merely said that He came down from heaven, without adding any thing further, he would have offended His hearers more; but by saying that His flesh is the life of the world, and that as He was sent by the living Father, so He lives by the Father; and at last by adding that He came down from heaven, He removed all doubt. Nor does He mean to scandalize His disciples, but rather to remove their scandal. For so long as they thought Him the Son of Joseph, they could not receive His doctrines; but if they once believed that He had come down from heaven and would ascend thither, they would be much more willing and able to admit them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Hinc solvit quod illos commoverat: illum enim putabant erogaturum corpus suum; ille autem dixit se ascensurum in caelum, utique integrum. Cum videritis, inquiens, filium hominis ascendentem ubi erat prius. Certe vel tunc videbitis quia non eo modo quo putatis erogat corpus suum, et quia gratia eius non consumitur morsibus. Filius autem hominis Christus ex virgine Maria hic esse coepit in terra, ubi carnem assumpsit ex terra: quid ergo vult quod ait cum videritis filium hominis ascendentem ubi erat prius, nisi ut intelligamus unam personam esse Christum Deum et hominem, non duas? Ne fides nostra sit quaternitas, sed Trinitas. Sic ergo erat filius hominis in caelo, quemadmodum filius Dei erat in terra: filius Dei in terra in suscepta carne; filius hominis in caelo in unitate personae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, these words are an answer to their mistake. They supposed that He was going to distribute His body in bits: whereas He tells them now, that He should ascend to heaven whole and entire: What and if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before? You will then see that He does not distribute His body in the way you think. Again; Christ became the Son of man, of the Virgin Mary here upon earth, and took flesh upon Him: He says then, What and, if you shall see the Son of man ascend up where He was before? to let us know that Christ, God and man, is one person, not two; and the object of one faith, not a quaternity, but a Trinity. He was the Son of man in heaven, as He was Son of God upon earth; the Son of God upon earth by assumption of the flesh, the Son of man in heaven, by the unity of the person.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Non ergo propter hoc putes quod de caelo corpus Christi descenderit: hoc enim Marciani haeretici et Apollinaris est dictum, sed quia unus et idem erat filius Dei et hominis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Do not suppose from this that the body of Christ came down from heaven, as the heretics Marcion and Apollinarius say; but only that the Son of God and the Son of man are one and the same.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Propter hoc autem et aliam solutionem inducit, dicens spiritus est qui vivificat; caro non prodest quidquam. Quod autem dicit, tale est. Spiritualiter oportet ea quae de me sunt audire; qui autem carnaliter audit, nihil proficit. Est autem carnaliter intelligere, simpliciter ea quae proposita sunt videre, et nihil plus imaginari. Oportet autem non ita iudicare; sed omnia mysteria interioribus oculis inspicere, quod semper est spiritualiter audire. Carnale vero erat dubitare qualiter potest nobis carnem dare manducare. Quid igitur? Non est vera caro? Immo utique; quod igitur ait caro non prodest quidquam, non de sua carne dicit, sed de eius carne qui carnaliter accipiebat quae dicebantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He tries to remove their difficulties in another way, as follows, It is the spirit that quickens, the flesh profits nothing: that is to say, You ought to understand My words in a spiritual sense: he who understands them carnally is profited nothing. To interpret carnally is to take a proposition in its bare literal meaning, and allow no other. But we should not judge of mysteries in this way; but examine them with the inward eye; i.e. understand them spiritually. It was carnal to doubt how our Lord could give His flesh to eat. What then? Is it not real flesh? Yes, verily. In saying then that the flesh profits nothing, He does not speak of His own flesh, but that of the carnal hearer of His word
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Caro non prodest quidquam. Sed quomodo illi intellexerunt? Carnem quippe sic intellexerunt quomodo in cadavere dilaniatur, aut in macello venditur, non quomodo spiritu vegetatur. Accedat spiritus ad carnem, et prodest plurimum: nam si caro nihil prodesset, verbum caro non fieret, ut habitaret in nobis; sed spiritus per carnem aliquid operatus est in nobis pro salute nostra.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus, the flesh profits nothing. They had under stood by His flesh, as it were, of a carcass, that was to be cut up, and sold in the shambles, not of a body animated by the spirit. Join the spirit to the flesh, and it profits much: for if the flesh profited not, the Word would not have become flesh, and dwelt among us. The Spirit has done much for our salvation, by means of the flesh.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Civ. Dei</b>: Non enim caro per seipsam mundat, sed per verbum a quo suscepta est; quod cum sit principium omnium, suscepta anima et carne, et animam credentium mundat et carnem. Spiritus ergo est qui vivificat; caro non prodest quidquam; sicut illi intellexerunt carnem. Non sic ego do ad manducandum carnem meam. Nec carnem debemus sapere secundum carnem; proinde dicit verba quae ego locutus sum vobis, spiritus et vita sunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For the flesh does not cleanse of itself, but by the Word who assumed it: which Word, being the principle of life in all things, having taken up soul and body, cleanses the souls and bodies of those that believe. It is the spirit, it, then, that quickens: the flesh profits nothing; i.e. the flesh as they understood it. I do not, He seems to say, give My body to be eaten in this sense. He ought not to think of the flesh carnally: The words that I speak to you, they are spirit, and they are life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Idest, spiritualia sunt, nihil habentia carnale, neque consequentiam naturalem; sed eruta sunt ab omni tali necessitate quae in terra, et a legibus quae hic positae sunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. i.e. are spiritual, have nothing carnal in them, produce no effects of the natural sort; not being under the dominion of that law of necessity, and order of nature established on earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Si ergo intellexisti spiritualiter, spiritus et vita tibi sunt; si intellexisti carnaliter, etiam sic spiritus et vita sunt, sed tibi non sunt. Diximus enim hic dominum commendasse in manducatione carnis suae et potatione sanguinis sui, ut in illo maneamus, et ipse in nobis. Hoc autem quid facit nisi caritas? Caritas autem Dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum qui datus est nobis; ergo spiritus est qui vivificat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If then you understand them spiritually, they are life and spirit to you: if carnally, even then they are life and spirit, but not to you. Our Lord declares that in eating His body, and drinking His blood, we dwell in Him, and He in us. But what has the power to affect this, except love? The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, which is given to us.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et quia de carnali audientia supra locutus est, subiungit sed sunt quidam ex vobis qui non credunt. Dicens quidam, discipulos excepit; suam autem dignitatem ostendit, occulta revelans.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Having spoken of His words being taken carnally, He adds, But there are some of you that believe not. Some, He says, not including His disciples in the number. This insight shows His high nature.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non dixit: sunt quidam in vobis qui non intelligunt; sed causam dixit quare non intelligant. Propheta enim dixit: nisi credideritis, non intelligetis; nam qui resistit, quomodo vivificatur? Adversarius enim radio lucis quo penetrandus est, non avertit faciem, sed claudit mentem. Credant et aperiant, et illuminabuntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He says not, There are some among you who understand not; but gives the reason why they do not understand. The Prophet said, Except you believe, you shall not understand. For how can he who opposes be quickened? An adversary, though he avert not his face, yet closes his mind to the ray of light which should penetrate him. But let men believe, and open their eyes, and they will be enlightened.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et ut discas quoniam ante haec verba, et non postquam murmuraverunt et scandalizati sunt, haec Christus cognoverat, subiungit Evangelista dicens sciebat enim ab initio Iesus qui essent credituri, et qui traditurus eum esset.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To let you know that it was before these words, and not after, that the people murmured and were offended, the Evangelist adds, For Jesus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, and who should betray Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Volens per hoc nobis Evangelista ostendere quod ante constitutionem mundi omnia cognoscebat; quod divinitatis erat indicium.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Evangelist wishes to show us, that He knew all things before the foundation of the world: which was a proof of His divinity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed postquam distinxit credentes dominus a non credentibus, expressit causam quare non credunt; unde sequitur et dicebat: propterea dixi vobis, quia nemo potest venire ad me, nisi fuerit ei datum a patre meo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And after distinguishing those who believed from those who did not believe, our Lord gives the reason of the unbelief of the latter, And He said, Therefore said I to you, that no man can come to Me, except it were given him of My Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: non turbant me neque stuporem inferunt qui non credunt. Novi quibus dedit pater. Dixit autem hoc, ut ostendat quoniam non illorum gloriam concupiscens hoc dicebat; et ut suadeat eis quod patrem eius existiment Deum, et non Ioseph.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if He said, Men’s unbelief does not disturb or astonish Me: I know to whom the Father has given to come to Me. He mentions the Father, to show first that He had no eye to His own glory; secondly, that God was His Father, and not Joseph.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ergo et credere datur nobis: non enim nihil est credere. Si autem magnum quid est, gaude quia credidisti, sed noli extolli: quid enim habes quod non accepisti? Hoc autem donum quibusdam dari et quibusdam non dari, omnino non dubitat qui non vult manifestissimis sacris litteris repugnare. Cur autem non omnibus detur, fidelem movere non debet, qui credit ex uno omnes esse in condemnationem iustissimam; ita ut nulla Dei esset iusta reprehensio, etsi nullus inde liberaretur; unde constat magnam esse gratiam quod plurimi liberantur. Cur autem istum potius quam illum liberet, inscrutabilia sunt iudicia eius, et investigabiles viae eius. Sequitur ex hoc multi discipuli eius abierunt retro, et iam cum illo non ambulabant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So then (our) faith is given to us: and no small gift it is. Wherefore rejoice if you believe; but be not lifted up, for what have you which you did not receive? And that this grace is given to some, and not to others, no one can doubt, without going against the plainest declarations of Scripture. As for the question, why it is not given to all, this cannot disquiet the believer, who knows that in consequence of the sin of one man, all are justly liable to condemnation; and that no blame could attach to God, even if none were pardoned; it being of His great mercy only that so many are. And why He pardons one rather than another, rests with Him, whose judgments are unsearchable, and His ways past finding out. And from that time many of the disciples went back, and walked no more with Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non dixit: recesserunt, sed abierunt retro, ab ea quae secundum virtutem est auditione, et quam habebant olim fidem, perdiderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He does not say, withdrew, but went back, i.e. from being good hearers, from the belief which they once had.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ecce praecisi a corpore vitam perdiderunt: quia in corpore nec fuerunt: inter non credentes et ipsi reputati sunt. Abierunt retro non pauci, sed multi post Satanam, non post Christum, quomodo de quibusdam feminis dicit apostolus: quaedam conversae sunt retro post Satanam. Petrum autem non repulit dominus retro ire post Satanam, sed fecit post se ire.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Being cut off from the body, their life was gone. They were no longer in the body; they were created among the unbelieving. There went back not a few, but many after Satan, not after Christ; as the Apostle says of some women, For some had already turned aside after Satan. Our Lord says to Peter, Get you behind Me. He does not tell Peter to go after Satan.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quaeret autem aliquis: quod tempus erat verba dispensandi his quae constructa erant nocentia? Multa quidem utilitas et necessitas. Quia enim instabant cibum corporalem petentes, et eius qui sub patribus datus est reminiscentes, ostendens quoniam omnia illa typus erant, meminit cibi spiritualis. Non igitur scandalizari oportebat, sed interrogare congruum erat: quare illorum amentiae scandalum fuit, non indissolubilitatis eorum quae dicebantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But it may be asked, what reason was there for speaking words to them which did not edify, but might rather have injured them? It was very useful and necessary; for this reason, they had been just now urgent in petitioning for bodily food, and reminding Him of that which had been given to their fathers. So He reminds them here of spiritual food; to show that all those miracles were typical. They ought not then to have been offended, but should have inquired of Him further. The scandal was owing to their fatuity, not to the difficulty of the truths declared by our Lord.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Et hoc etiam forte factum est ad consolationem nostram: quoniam aliquando contingit ut homo dicat verum, et quod dicit non capiatur, atque illi qui audiunt scandalizentur et discedant. Poenitet autem hominem dixisse quod verum est: dicit enim apud se homo: non debui sic dicere; et sic domino contingit. Dixit, et perdidit multos: sed non turbatur ipse, quia ab initio noverat qui non essent credentes. Nos, si nobis contingat, conturbamur: solatium in domino inveniamus, et tamen caute verba dicamus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And perhaps this took place for our consolation; since it sometimes happens that a man says what is true, and what He says is not understood, and they which hear are offended and go. Then the man is sorry he spoke what was true; for he says to himself; I ought not to have spoken it; and yet our Lord was in the same case. He spoke the truth, and destroyed many. But He is not disturbed at it, because He knew from the beginning which would believe. We, if this happens to us, are disturbed. Let us desire consolation then from our Lord’s example; and withal use caution in our speech.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Sciebat autem dominus de aliis discipulis qui remanserunt an vellent abire; sed tamen eos interrogavit, ut fides eorum monstraretur, et aliis imitanda proponeretur; unde sequitur dixit ergo Iesus ad duodecim: numquid et vos vultis abire?
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Our Lord knew well the intentions of the other disciples which stayed, as to staying or going; but yet He put the question to them, in order to prove their faith, and hold it up to imitation: Then said Jesus to the twelve, Will you also go away?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Per hunc autem modum oportebat eos trahi: nam si eos laudasset, passi essent aliquid humanum, existimantes se gratiam Christo facere, eum non relinquendo: ostendens vero se non indigere eorum sequela, magis eos detinuit. Non autem eis dixit: abite; hoc enim esset eos expellere; sed interrogavit eos an vellent abire, auferens eis vim et necessitatem, et nolens eos verecundia coarctari: ex necessitate enim detineri par esset ac si abirent. Petrus autem fratrum amator, amicitiae conservator, pro toto respondet collegio; unde sequitur respondit ergo ei Simon Petrus: domine, ad quem ibimus?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This was the right way to retain them. Had He praised them, they would naturally, as men do, have thought that they were conferring a favor upon Christ, by not leaving Him: by showing, as He did, that He did not need their company, He made them hold the more closely by Him. He does not say, however, Go away, as this would have been to cast them off; but asks whether they wished to go away; thus preventing their staying with Him from any feeling of shame or necessity: for to stay from necessity would be the same as going away. Peter, who loved his brethren, replies for the whole number, Lord, to whom shall we go?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quasi dicat: repellis nos a te: da nobis alterum ad quem ibimus, si te relinquimus.

Deinde ut non videatur hoc propterea dicere, quia non essent qui eos reciperent, subiungit verba vitae aeternae habes. Audiens enim magistrum dicentem quoniam resuscitabo eum et habebit vitam aeternam, ostendit se recordari eorum quae dicta sunt verborum. Et Iudaei quidem dicebant: hic est filius Ioseph; hic vero dicit et nos credimus, et cognovimus, quia tu es Christus filius Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. A speech of the greatest love: proving that Christ was more precious to them than father or mother. And that it might not seem to be said, from thinking that there was no one whose guidance they could look to, he adds, You have the words of eternal life: which showed that he remembered his Master’s words, I will raise Him up, and, has eternal life. The Jews said, Is not this the Son of Joseph? how differently Peter: We believe and are sure, that you art that Christ, the son of the living God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Credidimus enim, ut cognosceremus: nam si prius cognoscere, deinde credere vellemus, nec cognosceremus, nec credere valeremus.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. For we believed, in order to know. Had we wished first to know, and then to; believe, we could never have been able to believe. This we believe, and know, that You are the Christ the Son of God; i.e. that You are eternal life, and that in Your flesh and blood you give what You are Yourself.

Quod autem dicit, tale est. Ne aestimetis quod quia secuti estis me, non redarguam malos. Dignum autem est hic quaerere, quare nunc nihil dicunt discipuli; sed postea formidantes dicunt: numquid ego sum, domine? Sed nondum Petrus audierat: vade retro me, Satana, et propter hoc timorem non habuit. Nunc etiam non dicit unus ex vobis me tradet, sed Diabolus est: ideo nesciebant quod dicebatur; sed malitiam aestimabant vituperari solum. Accusant autem hic Christum gentiles insipienter: non enim electio eius vim infert his quae futura sunt; sed in voluntate situm est salvari et perire.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Peter however having said, We believe, our Lord excepts Judas from the number of those who believed: Jesus answered them, Have not I chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil? i.e. Do not suppose that, because you have followed Me, I shall not reprove the wicked among you. It is worth inquiring, why the disciples say nothing here, whereas afterwards they ask in fear, Lord, is it I? But Peter had not yet been told, Get you behind Me, Satan; and therefore had as yet no fear of this sort. Our Lord however does not say here, One of you shall betray Me, but, is a devil: so that they did not know what the speech meant, and thought that it was only a case of wickedness in general, that He was reproving. The Gentiles on the subject of election blame Christ foolishly. His election does not impose any necessity upon the person with respect to the future, but leaves it in the power of His will to be saved or perish.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Vel dicendum, quod ad aliud elegit undecim, et ad aliud unum; undecim elegit, ut in apostolica dignitate perseverarent; unum elegit, ut per proditionis eius officium salutem operaretur humani generis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Or we must say, that He elected the eleven for one purpose, the twelfth for another: the eleven to fill the place of Apostles, and persevere in it to the end; the twelfth to the service of betraying Him, which was the means of saving the human race.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Electus enim est iste, de quo nolente et nesciente magnum aliquid boni fieret. Sicut enim iniqui male utuntur bonis operibus Dei, sic e contra Deus bene utitur malis operibus hominum. Quid Iuda peius? Sed malo eius bene usus est dominus: tradi se pertulit, ut nos redimeret. Potest etiam sic intelligi quod ait duodecim elegi: quia consecratus est duodenarius numerus eorum, qui per quatuor cardines mundi Trinitatem fuerant denuntiaturi. Non autem quia periit inde unus, ideo illius numeri honor ademptus est: nam in locum pereuntis alius subrogatus est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He was elected to be an involuntary and unconscious instrument of producing the greatest good. For as the wicked turn the good works of God to an evil use, so reversely God turns the evil works of man to good. What can be worse than what Judas did? Yet our Lord made a good use of his wickedness; allowing Himself to be betrayed, that He might redeem us. In, Have I not chosen you twelve, twelve seems to be a sacred number used in the case of those, who were to spread the doctrine of the Trinity through the four quarters of the world. Nor was the virtue of that number impaired, by one perishing; inasmuch as another was substituted in his room.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. [The body is named after the head, when, with reference to a perverse man, it is said, One of you is a devil; thus the Gospel goes on to say that he said this with reference to Judas Simon Iscariot. He was going to betray him, since he was one of the twelve.]

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Futurum erat ut aliquis fidelis Christi absconderet se, ne a persecutoribus inveniretur; et ne illi pro crimine obiceretur latibulum, praecessit in capite quod in membro confirmaretur; unde dicitur post haec autem ambulabat Iesus in Galilaeam: non enim volebat in Iudaeam ambulare, quia quaerebant eum Iudaei interficere.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As the believer in Christ would have in time to, come to hide himself from persecution, that no guilt might attach to such concealment, the Head began with doing Himself, what He sanctioned in the member; After these things Jesus walked in Galilee: for he would not walk in Jewry, because the Jews sought to kill Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Haec verborum connexio talis est, ut intelligamus quoniam in medio multa geri et fieri potuerunt. Iudaea autem et Galilaea regiones sunt Palaestinae provinciae, sed Iudaea dicta est a tribu Iuda: non tamen solum illa regio quam tribus Iuda, sed et illa quam tribus Beniamin possidebat, Iudaea dicta est, quia ex tribu Iuda reges oriebantur. Galilaea vero dicitur, eo quod lacteum populum, idest candidum, gignat: Galilaea enim Graece, Latine lac dicitur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The connection of this passage admits of much taking place in the interval previously. Judea and Galilee are divisions of the province of Palestine. Judea has its name from the tribe of Judah; but it embraces not only the territories of Judah, but of Benjamin, all of which were called Judea, because Judah was the royal tribe Galilee has its name, from the milky, i.e. white, color of its inhabitants; Galilee being Greek for milk.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic autem hoc dominus dixit, quasi non posset ambulare inter Iudaeos, et non occidi a Iudaeis; hanc enim potentiam quando voluit demonstravit; sed infirmitati nostrae praebebat exemplum: non ipse perdiderat potestatem, sed nostram consolabatur fragilitatem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is not meant that our Lord could not walk among the Jews, and escape being killed; for He had this power, whenever He chose to show it: but He set the example of so doing, as an accommodation to our weakness. He had not lost His power, but He indulged our frailty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed et illud est dicere, quoniam quae deitatis erant ostendebat, et quae humanitatis: etenim fugiebat persecutores ut homo, et apparebat eis ut Deus, utrumque vere existens.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That is to say, He displayed the attribute both of divinity and humanity. He fled from His persecutors as man, He remained and appeared amongst them as God; being really both.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Secessit etiam nunc in Galilaeam, quia nondum passionis aderat tempus: unde vanum reputabat in medio inimicorum manere, et magis ipsos ad odium incitare; unde et consequenter tempus describitur, cum subditur erat autem in proximo dies festus Iudaeorum, Scenopegia.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He withdrew too now to Galilee, because the hour of His passion was not yet come; and He thought it useless to stay in the midst of His enemies, when the effect would only have been to irritate them the more. The time at which this happened is then given; Now the Jews; feast of tabernacles was at hand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid sit Scenopegia, qui Scripturas legerunt noverunt. Faciebant tabernacula in die festo ad similitudinem tabernaculorum, in quibus habitaverunt, cum ex Aegypto educti peregrinarentur in eremo. Celebrabant ex hoc diem festum, reminiscentes beneficiorum domini, qui tamen occisuri erant dominum. Appellabatur autem apud Iudaeos dies festus, cum tamen non esset unus, sed plures.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What the feast of tabernacles is, we read in the Scriptures. They used to make tents on the festival, like those in which they lived during their journey in the desert, after their departure from Egypt. They celebrated this feast in commemoration of the good things the Lord had done for them; though they were the very people who were about to slay the Lord. It is called the day of the feast, though it lasted many days.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ostendit igitur per hoc Evangelista, quoniam multum tempus praetermisit. Cum enim dominus sedit in monte, erat prope dies festus Paschae. Hic autem Scenopegiae meminit, et in quinque intermediis mensibus nihil aliud nobis enarravit, nisi miraculum panum et allocutionem factam ad eos qui comederunt. Quia enim indeficienter signa faciebat et disputabat, non poterant Evangelistae omnia enumerare; sed ista praecipue studuerunt dicere pro quibus aut querela aut contradictio quaedam a Iudaeis subsequebatur; quod et hic apparet.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It appears here, that a considerable time had passed since the last events. For when our Lord sat upon the mount, it was near the feast of the Passover and now it is the feast of tabernacles: so that in the five intermediate months the Evangelist has related nothing but the miracle of the loaves, and the conversation with those who ate of them. As our Lord was unceasingly working miracles, and holding disputes with people, the Evangelists could not relate all; but only aimed at giving those, in which complaint or opposition had followed on the part of the Jews as was as the case here.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia enim fratres eius viderant ipsum non esse paratum ad descendendum, subditur dixerunt autem fratres eius ad eum: transi hinc et vade in Iudaeam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. His brethren saw that He was not preparing to go to the feast: His brethren therefore said to him, Depart hence, and go into Judea.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ac si dicant: tu signa facis, et pauci ea vident; transi ergo ad regiam urbem, ubi sunt principes, ut, visis signis, laudem consequaris ab eis. Sed quia non omnes discipuli semper dominum sequebantur, sed eorum multi in Iudaea erant, ideo subdunt ut et discipuli tui videant opera tua quae facis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Meaning to say, You do miracles, and only a few see them: go to the royal city, where the rulers are, that they may see Your miracles, and so you obtain praise. And as our Lord had not brought all His disciples with Him, but left many behind in Judea, they add, That Your disciples also may see the storks that you do.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Idest, turbae quae sequuntur te: non enim de duodecim dicunt discipulis, sed de aliis qui conversabantur cum illo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. i.e. the multitudes that follow You. They do not mean the twelve, but the others that had communication with Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Cum autem auditis fratres domini, Mariae cogitate consanguinitatem non iterum parientis ullam propaginem. Sicut enim in sepulchro, ubi positum est corpus domini, nec ante, nec postea mortuus iacuit, sic uterus Mariae nec ante, nec postea quidquam mortale concepit. Opera quidem domini discipulos non latebant, sed istos latebant; et ideo dicebant ut discipuli tui videant opera tua quae facis. Loquebantur autem prudentiam carnis, verbo quod caro factum est; unde et subdunt nemo quippe in occulto aliquid facit, et quaerit ipse in palam esse. Si hoc facis, manifesta teipsum mundo; quasi dicant: facis miracula: appare hominibus, ut laudari possis ab hominibus: nam qui eum videntur monere, gloriae ipsius consulunt: et quia humanam gloriam requirebant, in eum non credebant; unde sequitur neque enim fratres eius credebant in eum; Christum enim consanguineum potuerunt habere; credere autem in eum ipsa propinquitate fastidierunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. When you hear of our Lord’s brethren, you must understand the kindred of Mary, not her offspring after our Lord’s birth. For as the body of our Lord once only lay in the sepulcher, and neither before, nor after that once; so could not the womb of Mary have possibly conceived any other mortal offspring. Our Lord’s works did not escape His disciples, but they escaped His brethren; hence their suggestion, That Your disciples may see the works that you do. They speak according to the wisdom of the flesh, to the Word that was made flesh, and add, For there is no man that does any thing in secret, and he himself seeks to be known openly. If you do these things, show Yourself to the world; as if to say, You do miracles, do them in the eyes of the world, that the world may honor You. Their admonitions aim at procuring glory for Him; and this very thing, viz. aiming at human glory, proved that they did not believe in Him, as we next read, For neither did His brethren believe in Him. They were Christ’s kindred, hut they were on that very account above believing in Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dignum est autem mirari Evangelistarum morem veritatis amicum, qualiter non verecundantur dicere ea quae magistro videntur inferre iniuriam, sed hoc maxime studuerunt enuntiare. Non enim parvam habet detractionem quod fratres eius discredebant. Et videtur initium verborum quasi amicorum esse; multae autem amaritudinis erant quae dicebantur: quia de formidine et de amore gloriae eum notant; nam dicunt nemo in occulto aliquid facit: quod erat formidinem incusantium, et simul suspicantium quae fiebant non vere facta esse. Per hoc autem quod dicunt et quaerit ipse in palam esse, amorem gloriae in eo notant. Christus autem mansuete eis respondit, docens nos non indigne ferre, si aliqui etiam viles nobis consilientur; sequitur enim dicit eis Iesus: tempus meum nondum advenit; tempus autem vestrum semper est paratum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is striking to observe the great sincerity of the Evangelists; that they are not ashamed to mention things which appear to be to our Lord’s disadvantage, but take particular care to tell us of them. It is a considerable reflection on our Lord, that His brethren do not believe on Him. The beginning of their speech has a friendly appearance about it: tent there is much bitterness in it, thus charging Him with the motives of fear and vain glory; No man, say they, does anything in secret: this was reproaching Him tacitly with fear; and was an insinuation too that His miracles had not been real and solid ones. In what follows, And he himself seeks to be known openly, they taunt Him with the love of glory. Christ however answers them mildly, teaching us not to take the advice of people ever so inferior to ourselves angrily; Then Jesus said to them, My time is not yet come: but your time is alway ready.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Ne autem videatur hoc contrarium ei quod apostolus dicit: at ubi venit plenitudo temporis, misit Deus filium suum, referendum est quod hic dicitur, non ad tempus nativitatis, sed ad tempus glorificationis.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. This is no contradiction to what the Apostle says, But when the fullness of time was come, God sent forth His Son. Our Lord referring here to the time not of His nativity, but of His glorification.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dabant enim illi consilium consequendae gloriae, veluti saeculariter, et terreno affectu monentes, ne esset ignobilis et latitaret. Sed dominus voluit ad ipsam celsitudinem per humilitatem viam sternere; dicit ergo tempus meum, idest gloriae meae, qua veniam in altitudine iudicaturus, nondum venit; tempus autem vestrum, idest, mundi gloria, semper est paratum. Et quoniam nos domini corpus sumus, quando nobis insultant amatores huius saeculi, dicamus eis: tempus vestrum adest paratum, tempus nostrum nondum advenit: excelsa enim patria, humilis via. Qui recusat viam, quid quaerit patriam?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They gave Him advice to pursue glory, and not allow Himself to remain in concealment and obscurity; appealing altogether to worldly and secular motives. But our Lord was laying down another road to that very exaltation, viz. humility: My time, He says, i.e. the time of My glory, when I shall come to judge on high, is not yet come; but your time, i.e. the glory of the world, is always ready. And let us, who are the Lord’s body, when insulted by the lovers of this world, say, Your time is ready: ours is not yet come. Our country is a lofty one, the way to it is low. Whoso rejects the way, why seek he the country?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Videtur mihi aliud occulte insinuare: fortassis enim eum prodere volebant, et tradere Iudaeis; ideo dicit tempus meum nondum advenit, hoc est tempus crucis et mortis; tempus autem vestrum semper est paratum: quia etsi vos semper sitis cum Iudaeis, non interficient vos, eadem cum illis zelantes; unde sequitur non potest vos odisse mundus; me autem odit, quia ego testimonium perhibeo de illo, quia opera eius mala sunt; quasi dicat: qualiter mundus eos odit qui eadem cum ipso volunt, et pro eisdem student? Me autem odit, quoniam redarguo eum. Intantum ergo gloriam hominum non quaero, quod non praetermitto eos redarguere; licet sciam ex hoc odium nasci et mortem intentari. Per hoc etiam ostendit quod odium Iudaeorum contra eum concitabat publica redargutio, non autem sabbati solutio.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>, Or there seems to be another meaning concealed in the words; perhaps they intended to betray Him to the Jews; and therefore He says, My time is not yet come, i.e. the time of My cross and death: but your time is always ready; for though you are always with the Jews, they will not kill you, because you are of the same mind with them: The world cannot hate you; but Me it hates, because I testify of it, that the works thereof are evil: as if He said, How can the world hate them who have the same wishes and aims with itself? It hates Me, because I reprove it. I seek not then glory from men; inasmuch as I hesitate not to reprove them, though I know that I am hated in consequence, and that My life is aimed at. Here we see that the hatred of the Jews was owing to His reproofs, not to His breaking the sabbath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel dominus contra duo de quibus illi eum arguebant, alia duo inducit. Contra formidinem quidem dicit, quod opera mundi redarguit, idest opera eorum qui mundana sapiunt: quod non faceret, si formidolosus esset; sed contra inanem gloriam misit illos ad festum; unde sequitur vos ascendite ad diem festum hunc: nam si vanae gloriae passione detineretur, retinuisset eos secum: nam gloriae cupidi consueverunt multos habere qui sequantur eos.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Our Lord brings two arguments in answer to their two charges. To the charge of fear He answers, that He reproves the deeds of the world, i.e. of those who love worldly things; which He would not do, if He were under the influence of fear; and He replies to the charge of vain glory, by sending them to the feast, Go you up to this feast. Had He been possessed at all with the desire for glory, He would have kept them with Him: for the vain glorious like to have many followers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc etiam dicit ostendens quod eis blandiri non vult, sed concedit eis Iudaica facere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This is to show too, that, while He does not wish to humor them, He still allows them to observe the Jewish ordinances.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Vos ascendite ad diem festum hunc, ubi gloriam humanam quaeritis, ubi extendere vultis carnalia gaudia, non cogitare caelestia. Sequitur ego autem non ascendam ad diem festum istum.

Latenter autem ascendit: poterat enim manifeste ascendere et detinere eorum inordinatum impetum, quod multoties fecit; at nolebat hoc continuo facere, ne magis suam divinitatem denudaret, et ut incarnatio eius certior esset, et ut nos erudiret ad virtutem. Ut igitur disceremus quid nos oporteat facere, qui non possumus persecutores detinere, voluit latenter ascendere. Non autem dixit: in occulto, sed quasi in occulto, ut ostendat dispensative hoc esse factum. Si enim omnia ut Deus ageret, quomodo possemus nos scire, incidentes humanis periculis, quid oporteat facere?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He goes up, not to suffer, but to teach. And He goes up secretly; because, though He could have gone openly, and kept the violence and impetuosity of the Jews in check, as He had often done before; yet to do this every time, would have disclosed His divinity; and he wished to establish the fact of His incarnation, and to teach us the way of life. And He went up privately too, to show us what we ought to do, who cannot check our persecutors. It is not said, however, in secret, but, as it were in secret; to show that it was done as a kind of economy. For had He done all things as God, how should we of this world know what to do, when we fell into danger?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel occulte ascendit, quia favorem hominum non quaerit, non pompis stipantium se turbarum delectatur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or, He went up in secret, because He did not seek the favor of men, and took no pleasure in pomp, and being followed about with crowds.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem designatur quia singulis quibusque carnalibus humanam gloriam quaerentibus, dominus manet in Galilaea, quae interpretatur transmigratio sancta, idest in membris suis, qui transmigrant de vitiis ad virtutes, et in eis proficiunt. Postmodum vero dominus ascendit, quia membra Christi non huius vitae, sed aeternae gloriam quaerunt. Occulte autem dominus ascendit, quia omnis gloria eius est ab intus, idest de corde puro et conscientia bona, et fide non ficta.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The mystical meaning is, that to all those carnal persons who seek human glory, the Lord remains in Galilee; the meaning of which name is, “passing over;” applying to those his members who pass from vice to virtue, and make progress in the latter. And our Lord Himself delayed to go up, signifying that Christ’s members seek not temporal but eternal glory. And He went up secretly, because all glory is from within: that is, from a pure heart and good conscience, and faith unfeigned.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel quod quasi latenter ascendit, aliquid significare voluit: omnia enim quae dicta sunt antiquo populo Israel, umbrae fuerunt futurorum, et Scenopegia umbra erat futurorum. Omnia ergo quae fiebant in figura, manifestantur in nobis. Ascendit ergo in occulto; figura enim erat ipsum esse in occulto. In ipso die festo Christus latebat, quia ipse dies festus Christi membra peregrinatura significabat. Ille enim est in tabernaculis qui se in mundo esse intelligit peregrinum: Scenopegia autem erat celebratio tabernaculorum. Sequitur Iudaei autem quaerebant eum in die festo, et dicebant: ubi est ille?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or the meaning is, that all the ceremonial of the ancient people was the figure of what was to be; such as the feast of tabernacles. Which figure is now unveiled to us. Our Lord went up in secret, to represent the figurative system. He concealed Himself at the feast itself, because the feast itself signified, that the members of Christ were in a strange country. For he dwells in the tents, who regards himself as a stranger in the world. The word scenopegia here means the feast of tabernacles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Ex multo odio et inimicitia; neque enim eum nominatim vocare volebant. Non autem multa erat eis in festivitate reverentia, nec multa religio; quia a festivitate credebant Christum fraudulenter detinere. Sequitur et murmur multum erat de eo in turba.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Then the Jews sought Him at the feast, and said, Where is He? out of hatred and enmity; for they would not call Him by His name. There was not much reverence or religion in this observance of the feast, when they wanted to make it an opportunity of seizing Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Murmur erat de contentione, quam convenienter exponit dicens quidam enim dicebant, quia bonus est; alii autem dicebant: non, sed seducit turbas. Quicumque emicuerit in aliqua gratia, alii dicunt bonus est; alii: non, sed seducit turbas. Quod autem dictum est de eo, valet ad consolationem de quocumque hoc dictum fuerit Christiano. Et quidem si seducere decipere est, nec Christus seductor, nec quisquam debet seductor esse Christianus. Si autem seducere, aliunde aliquem ad aliud persuadendo ducere est, quaerendum est unde, et quo. Si a bono ad malum, malus seductor est; si a malo ad bonum, bonus est: et utinam sic omnes seductores vocemur et simus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And there was much murmuring in the people concerning Him. A murmuring arising from disagreement. For some said, He is a good man: others said, Nay; out He seduces the people. Whoever had any spark of grace, said, He is a good man; the rest, Nay, but He seduces the people. That such was said of Him, Who was God, is a consolation to any Christian, of whom the same may be said. If to seduce be to decide, Christ was not a seducer, nor can any Christian be. But if by seducing be meant bringing a person by persuasion out of one way of thinking into another, then we must inquire from what, and to what. If from good to evil, the seducer is an evil man; if from evil to good, a good one. And would that we were all called, and really were, such seducers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Igitur illam quidem aestimo opinionem multitudinis esse, qua scilicet dicebatur bonus esse: hanc vero principum et sacerdotum; quod ostenditur per hoc quod dicunt seducit turbas: non dicunt: seducit nos. Sequitur nemo tamen palam loquebatur de illo propter metum Iudaeorum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The former, I think, was the opinion of the multitude, the one, viz. who pronounced Him a good man; the latter the opinion of the priests and rulers; as is strewn by their saying, He deceives the people, not, He deceives us.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Eorum scilicet qui dicebant bonus est, non qui dicebant seducit turbas: haec enim clarius sonabant, sed bonus est pressius susurrabant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Howbeit no man spoke openly of Him, for fear of the Jews; none, that is, of those who said, He is a good man. They who said, He deceives the people, proclaimed their opinion openly enough; while the former only dared whisper theirs.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vide autem eorum qui principantur corruptionem; hi autem qui principatibus subiciuntur, sani quidem erant iudicio, sed non habebant libertatem dicendi: quod maxime multitudinis est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe, the corruption is in the rulers: the common people are sound in their judgment, but have not liberty of speech, as is generally their case.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Dominus tardatione sua auditores attentiores facere volens, non in primis diebus ascendit, sed circa solemnitatis medium; unde dicitur iam autem die festo mediante, ascendit Iesus in templum et docebat. Qui enim primis diebus eum quaesierunt, repente eum praesentem videntes, magis intendebant docenti, et qui bonum eum dicebant et qui malum: illi quidem, ut aliquid lucrarentur et admirarentur; hi vero ut comprehenderent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord delays His visit, in order to excite men’s attention, and goes up not the first day, but about the middle of the feast: Now about the midst of the feast Jesus went up into the temple, and taught. Those who had been searching for Him, when they saw Him thus suddenly appear would be more attentive to His teaching, both favorers and enemies; the one to admire and profit by it; the other to find an opportunity of laying hands on Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Nam in principio festi his quae festi erant magis attendebant: unde postea Christum attentius audierunt.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. At the commencement of the feast, men would be attending more to the preachings of the festival itself; and afterwards would be better disposed to hear Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quantum enim datur intelligi, ipsam festivitatem diebus pluribus celebrabant; et ideo dicit iam die festo mediante; idest, cum illius diei festi tot dies remansissent quot praeterissent; ut etiam hoc impleretur quod ait: non ascendam ad diem festum hunc, id est, ad quem vos vultis, primum vel secundum diem; ascendit autem postea die festo mediante.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The feast seems, as far as we can judge, to have lasted several days. And therefore it is said, “about the middle of the feast day:” i.e. when as many days of that feast had passed, as were to come. So that His assertion, I go not up yet to this feast day, (i.e. to the first or second day, as you would wish me,) was strictly fulfilled. For He went up afterwards, about the middle of the feast.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de quaest. Nov. et Vet. Testam</b>: Tunc etiam ascendit, non quasi ad diem festum, sed quasi ad lucem. Illi vero ascenderunt quasi ad perfruendum deliciis diei festi. Christo vero ille fuit dies festus, quo passione sua redemit mundum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In going there too, He went up, not to the feast day, but to the light. They had gone to enjoy the pleasures of the festival, but Christ’s feast day was that on which by His Passion He redeemed the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ille autem qui prius latebat, docebat, et palam loquebatur, et non tenebatur. Illud enim quod latebat, erat causa exempli, hoc potestatis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He who had before concealed Himself, taught and spoke openly, and was not laid hold on. The one was intended for an example to us, the other to testify His power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quid autem docebat, non dixit Evangelista; sed quod mirabiliter docebat, hoc solum ostendit: tanta enim erat virtus docentis ut qui dixerant: seducit turbas, transmutati mirarentur; unde sequitur et mirabantur Iudaei, dicentes: quomodo hic litteras scit, cum non didicerit? Vide admirationem nequitia plenam: non enim dicit quod in doctrina admirarentur; sed in aliam admirationem inciderunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What His teaching is, the Evangelist does not say; but that it was very wonderful is shown by its effect even upon those who had accused Him of deceiving the people, who turned round and began to admire Him: And the Jews marveled, saying, How knows this Man letters, having never learned? See how perverse they are even in their admiration. It is not His doctrine they admire, but another thing altogether.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Omnes quidem, quantum arbitror, admirabantur, sed non omnes convertebantur. Et unde admiratio? Quia multi noverant ubi natus, quemadmodum fuerat educatus: numquam eum viderant litteras discentem; audiebant tamen de lege disputantem, legis testimonia proferentem; quae nemo posset proferre, nisi legisset; nemo legeret, nisi litteras didicisset; et ideo mirabantur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. All, it would appear, admired, but all were not converted. Whence then the admiration? Many knew where here He was born, and how He had been educated; but had never seen Him learning letters. Yet now they heard Him disputing on the law, and bringing forward its testimonies. No one could do this, who had not read the law; no one could read who had not learnt letters; and this raised their wonder.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ab hac autem admiratione cognoscere debebant quoniam haec scientia humanitus non erat in eo, sed divinitus; sed quia hoc ipsi nolebant confiteri, sed in sola admiratione stabant, dominus haec revelavit; sequitur enim respondit eis Iesus, et dixit: mea doctrina non est mea, sed eius qui misit me.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Their wonder might have led them to infer, that our Lord became possessed of this learning in some divine way, and not by any human process. But they would not acknowledge this, and contented themselves with wondering. So our Lord repeated it to them: Jesus answered them and said, My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Videtur autem hoc esse contrarium quod dicit mea, et non est mea; nam si dixisset: ista doctrina non est mea, nulla esset quaestio. Quae est ergo doctrina patris, nisi verbum patris? Ipse ergo Christus est doctrina patris, si verbum patris est. Sed quia verbum non potest esse nullius, sed est alicuius; et suam doctrinam dixit seipsum, et non suam: quia patris est verbum. Quid est tam tuum quam tu; et quid tam non tuum quam tu, si alicuius es quod es? Breviter ergo hoc mihi dixisse videtur mea doctrina non est mea; ac si diceret: ego non sum a meipso. Sabellianam haeresim sententia ista dissolvit, qui dicere ausi sunt, ipsum esse filium qui est et pater: duo esse nomina, sed unam rem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Mine is not mine, appears a contradiction; why did He not say, This doctrine is not Mine? Because the doctrine of the Father being the Word of the Father, and Christ Himself being that Word, Christ Himself is the doctrine of the Father. And therefore He calls the doctrine both His own, and the Father’s. A word must be a word of someone’s. What is so much Yours as You, and what is so much not Yours as You, if what You are, You art of another. His saying then, My doctrine is not Mine own, seems briefly to express the truth, that He is not from Himself; it refuses the Sabellian heresy, which dares to assert that the Son is the same as the Father, there being only two names for one thing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel suam dicit, quoniam eam docuerat: non suam autem, quoniam patris erat doctrina. Sed si omnia quae sunt patris, eius sunt; ex hoc ipso quod patris est, deberet esse et sua. Sed hoc quod dicit non est mea, vehementer ostendit et sui et patris unam esse doctrinam; ac si diceret: nihil habeo permutatum aut diversum; sed ita ago, ut non aestimetur aliud quid praeter patrem dicere vel agere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or He calls it His own, inasmuch as He taught it; not His own, inasmuch as the doctrine was of the Father. If all things however which the Father has are His, the doctrine for this very reason is His; i.e. because it is the Father’s. Rather that He says, Is not Mine own, shows very strongly, that His doctrine and the Father’s are one: as if He said, I differ nothing from Him; but so act, that it may be thought I say and do nothing else than does the Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Vel aliter. Secundum aliud suam dixit, secundum aliud non suam: secundum formam Dei suam, secundum formam servi, non suam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: In one sense He calls it His, in another sense not His; according to the form of the Godhead His, according to the form of the servant not His.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Si quis autem hoc parum intellexerit, audiat consilium quod dominus consequenter dat, dicens si quis voluerit voluntatem eius facere, cognoscet de doctrina utrum ex Deo sit, an ego ex meipso loquar. Quid est si quis voluerit voluntatem eius facere? Hoc est credere in eum: ipse enim dixit: hoc est opus Dei ut credatis in eum quem ipse misit. Quis autem hoc nesciat, hoc esse facere voluntatem Dei, operari opus eius? Cognoscere autem, hoc est intelligere. Ergo noli quaerere intelligere ut credas, sed crede ut intelligas: quia nisi credideritis, non intelligetis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Should any one however not understand this, let him hear the advice which immediately follows from our Lord: If any man will do His will, he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or whether I speak of Myself. What means this, If any man will do His will? To do His will is to believe in Him, as He Himself says, This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom He has sent. And who does not know, that to work the work of God, is to do His will? To know is to understand. Do not then seek to understand in order to believe, but believe in order to understand, for, Except you believe, you shall not understand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel hoc ita dicit, ac si dicat: auferte iram et invidiam et odium quod sine causa in me habetis; et nihil erit quod prohibeat vos cognoscere quoniam Dei verba sunt quae loquor. Deinde aliud inducit argumentum insolubile, ab his quae sunt in consuetudine hominum, nos erudiens; unde sequitur qui a semetipso loquitur, gloriam propriam quaerit; quasi dicat: qui aliquam propriam vult instituere doctrinam, propter nihil aliud hoc vult quam ut gloriam acquirat. Si vero ego gloriam eius qui misit me quaero, cuius gratia aliena vellem vos docere? Et hoc est quod subdit qui autem quaerit gloriam eius qui misit illum, hic verax est, et iniustitia in illo non est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This is as much as to say, Put away the anger, envy, and hatred which you have towards Me, and there will be nothing to prevent your knowing, that the words which I speak are from God. Then He brings in an irresistible argument taken from human experience: He that speaks of himself, seeks his own glory: as if to say, He who aims at establishing some doctrine of his own, does so for no purpose, but to get glory. But I seek the glory of Him that sent me, and wish to teach you for His, i.e. another’s, sake: and then it follows, But he that seeks His glory that sent Him, the same is true, and there is no unrighteousness in Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicat: verax sum, quia doctrina mea continet veritatem: iniustitia in me non est, quia alterius gloriam non usurpo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if He said, I speak the truth, because My doctrine contains the truth there is no unrighteousness in Me, because I usurp not another’s glory.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Qui quaerit gloriam propriam, Antichristus est. Dominus autem noster magnum nobis exemplum praebuit humilitatis, dum habitu inventus ut homo, quaerit gloriam patris, non suam. Sed tu quando aliquid boni facis, gloriam tuam quaeris: quando aliquid mali facis, Deo calumniam meditaris.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He who seeks his own glory is Antichrist. But our Lord set us an example of humility, in that being found in fashion as a man, He sought His Father’s glory, not His own. You, when you do good, take glory to yourself, when you do evil, upbraid God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vide ergo quoniam causa quaedam propter quam humilia de se dicit, haec est, ut credant quoniam non desiderat gloriam neque principatum, et etiam propter imbecillitatem audientium, et ut doceat homines moderata sapere, et nihil de se dicere magnum, sed semper humile.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Observe, the reason why He spoke so humbly of Himself, is to let men know, that He does not aim at glory, or power; and to accommodate Himself to their weakness, and to teach them moderation, and a humble, as distinguished from an assuming, way of speaking of themselves.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Jews brought two charges against Christ; one, that He broke the sabbath; the other, that He said God was His Father, making Himself equal with God. The latter He confirmed first by showing, that He did nothing in opposition to God, but that both taught the same. Then turning to the charge of breaking the sabbath, He says, Did not Moses give you a law, and none of you keep the law? as much as to say, The law says, You shall not kill, whereas you kill. And then, Why go you about to kill Me? As if to say, If I broke a law to heal a man, it was a transgression, but a beneficial one; whereas you transgress for an evil end; so you have no right to judge Me for breaking the law. He rebukes them then for two things; first, because they went about to kill Him; secondly, because they were going about to kill another, when they had not even any right to judge Him.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel hoc dicit quia si legem facerent, in ipsis litteris Christum agnoscerent, et praesentem non occiderent. Respondit autem ei turba, non pertinentia ad ordinem, sed ad perturbationem; sequitur enim respondit turba, et dixit: Daemonium habes: quis te quaerit interficere? Ei dictum est quod Daemonium haberet, qui Daemones expellebat. Dominus autem non turbatus, sed in sua veritate tranquillus, non reddidit maledictum pro maledicto, sed respondit tranquille.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or He means to say, that if they kept the law, they would see Him pointed to in every part of it, and would not seek to kill Him, when He came. The people return an answer quite away from the subject, and only showing their angry feelings: The people answered and said, You have a devil: who goes about to kill You? He who cast out devils, was told that He had a devil. Our Lord however, in no way disturbed, but retaining all the serenity of truth, returned not evil for evil, or railing for railing.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Wherein He left us an example to take it patiently, whenever wrong censures are passed upon us, and not answer them by asserting the truth, though able to do so, but rather by some wholesome advice to the persons; as does our Lord: Jesus answered and said to them, I have done one work, and you all marvel.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ac si diceret: quid si omnia opera mea videretis? Ipsius enim opera erant quae in mundo videbant, et ipsum qui fecit omnia non videbant. Fecit unam rem et turbati sunt, quia salvum fecit hominem in sabbato; quasi si quisquam eorum aegrotus sabbato sinceraret, alius illum sanum fecisset quam iste qui eos scandalizavit, quia unum hominem sabbato salvum fecit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if He said, What if you saw all My works? For all that they saw going on in the world was of His working, but they saw not Him Who made all things. But He did one thing, made a man whole on the sabbath day, and they were in commotion: as if, when any one of them recovered from a disease on the sabbath, he who made him whole were any other than He, who had offended them by making one man whole on the sabbath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc enim quod dicit miramini, hoc est turbamini et tumultuatis. Vide autem quomodo prudenter a lege eos syllogizat. Vult enim ostendere quod facere hoc opus non erat legem solvere: sunt enim multa principaliora quam lex de observatione sabbati, per quorum observationem lex non solvitur, sed impletur; et ideo subdit propterea Moyses dedit vobis circumcisionem, non quia ex Moyse est, sed ex patribus; et in sabbato circumciditis hominem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. You marvel, i.e. are disturbed, are in commotion. Observe how well He argues with them from the law. He wishes to prove that this work was not a violation of the law; and shows accordingly that there are many things more important than the law for the observance of the sabbath, by the observance of which that law is not broken but fulfilled. Moses therefore, He says, gave to you circumcision, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers, and you on the sabbath day circumcise a man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quasi dicat: bene factum est ut acciperetis circumcisionem a Moyse, non quia ex Moyse est, sed ex patribus: Abraham enim primus accepit circumcisionem a domino. Et in sabbato circumciditis. Convicit vos Moyses: accepistis in lege ut circumcidatis octavo die; accepistis in lege ut vacetis septimo die. Si octavus dies illius qui natus est, occurrit ad diem septimum sabbati, circumciditis hominem; quae circumcisio pertinet ad aliquod signaculum salutis, et non debent homines sabbato vacare a salute.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if He said, you have done well to receive circumcision from Moses, not because it is of Moses, but of the fathers; for Abraham first received circumcision from the Lord. And you circumcise on the sabbath. Moses has convicted you: you received a law to circumcise on the eighth day; and you received a law to rest on the seventh day. If the eighth day after a child is born happen to be the sabbath, you circumcise the child; because circumcision appertains to, is a kind of sign of, salvation; and men ought not to rest from the work of salvation on the sabbath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Propter tres enim causas data fuit circumcisio: primo ut signum esset magnae fidei Abrahae; secundo ut per eam a ceteris nationibus discernerentur; tertio ut illam in virili membro suscipientes castitatem mentis et corporis observare deberent. Et tantum conferebat tunc circumcisio quantum nunc Baptisma; nisi quia ianua nondum aperta erat. Concludit ergo ex praemissis si circumcisionem accipit homo in sabbato, ut non solvatur lex Moysi, indignamini mihi, quia totum hominem sanum feci in sabbato?
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Circumcision was given for three reasons; first, as a sign of Abraham’s great faith; secondly, to distinguish the Jews from other nations; thirdly, that the receiving of it on the organ of virility, might admonish us to observe chastity both of body and mind. And circumcision then possessed the same virtue that baptism does now; only that the gate was not yet open. Our Lord concludes: If a man. on the sabbath day receive circumcision, that the law of Moses should not be broken; are you angry at Me because I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: sabbati solutio in circumcisione, legis est observatio: sic et ego hominem curans sabbato, legem servavi. Vos, qui non estis legislatores, ultra modum legem defenditis; sed Moyses iubet legem solvi propter mandatum quod non erat ex lege, sed ex patribus. Per hoc autem quod dici totum hominem sanum feci in sabbato, ostendit circumcisionem esse particularem sanitatem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Which is as much as to tell them, The breaking of the sabbath in circumcision is a keeping of the law; and in the same way I by healing on the sabbath have kept the law. You, who are not the legislators, enforce the law beyond its proper bounds; whereas Moses made the law give way to the observance of a commandment, which did not come from the law, but from the fathers. His saying, I have made a man every whit whole on the sabbath day, implies that circumcision was a partial recovering.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Forte autem illa circumcisio ipsum dominum significabat. Quid enim est circumcisio, nisi carnis expoliatio? Significavit ergo expoliationem a corde cupiditatum carnalium. Non ergo sine causa data est in eo membro per quod procreatur creatura mortalium: quia per unum hominem peccatum intravit in mundum. Ideo autem quisquis cum praeputio nascitur, quia omnis cum vitio propaginis nascitur; et non mundat Deus sive a vitio cum quo nascimur, sive a vitiis quae male vivendo addimus, nisi per Christum: cultellis enim petrinis circumcidebant, et petrae nomine Christum figurabant. Ideo autem octavo die, quia post septimum sabbati dominus die dominico resurrexit. Ipsa autem resurrectio nos circumcidit; idest, abstulit desideria carnalia. Intelligite hoc significari opus bonum quo ego feci totum hominem salvum in sabbato: quia et curatus est ut sanus esset in corpore, et credidit ut sanus esset in anima. Estis autem prohibiti servilia opera facere sabbato: numquid servile opus est hominem sanare in sabbato? Manducatis siquidem et bibitis sabbato, quia pertinet ad salutem; per quod ostenditis, opera salutis nullo modo esse die sabbati omittenda.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Circumcision also was perhaps s a type of our or Lord Himself. For what is circumcision but a robbing of the flesh, to signify the robbing the heart of its carnal lusts. And therefore it was not without reason that it was applied to that member by which the mortal creature is propagated: for by one man sin entered into the world. And therefore every one is born with the foreskin, because every one is born with the fault of his propagation. And God does not change us either from the corruption of our birth, or from that we have contracted ourselves by a bad life, except by Christ: and therefore they circumcised with knives of stone, to prefigure Christ who is the stone; and on the eighth day, because our Lord’s resurrection took place on the day after the seventh day; which resurrection circumcises us, i.e. destroys our carnal appetites. Regard this, said our Lord, as a type of My good work in making a man every whit whole on the sabbath day: for he was healed, that he might be whole in body, and he believed, that he might be whole in mind. You are forbidden indeed to do servile work on the sabbath; but is it a servile work to heal on the sabbath? You eat and drink on the sabbath, because it is necessary for your health: which shows that works of healing are by no means to be omitted on the sabbath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem dixit: ego maius circumcisione operatus sum; sed solum factum narrans, iudicium eis concessit; unde subditur nolite iudicare secundum faciem, sed iustum iudicium iudicate; quasi dicat: non quia Moyses apud vos habet maiorem gloriam quam ego, ex personarum dignitate feratis sententiam, sed a rerum natura: hoc enim est iuste iudicare. Nullus autem incusavit Moysen de hoc quod iussit sabbatum solvi propter mandatum circumcisionis, quod erat aliunde quam ex lege inductum. Ergo fide dignior vobis est Moyses, qui iubet solvi legem a mandato non legali.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He does not say, however, I have done a greater work than circumcision; but only states the matter of fact, and leaves the judgment to them, saying, Judge not according to the appearance, out judge righteous judgment: as if to say, Do not, because Moses has a greater name with you than I, decide by degree of personal eminence; but decide by the nature of the thing itself, for this is to judge righteously. No one however has blamed Moses for making the sabbath give place to the commandment of circumcision, which was not derived from the law, but from another source. Moses then commands the law to be broken to give effect to a commandment not of the law: and he is more worthy of credit than you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hoc autem quod dominus notavit hoc loco, evadere in hoc saeculo, magni laboris est: non personaliter iudicare. Admonuit quidem dominus Iudaeos, admonuit et nos: quod enim pretiosum sonabat de ore domini, et propter nos scriptum est, et nobis servatum, et propter nos recitatum. Sursum est dominus, sed etiam hic est veritas dominus. Corpus enim domini, in quo surrexit, uno loco esse potest; veritas eius ubique diffusa est. Quis ergo est qui non iudicat personaliter? Qui aequaliter diligit. Non enim cum homines diverso modo pro suis gradibus honoramus, timendum est ne personas accipiamus: nonnunquam enim est iudicium inter patrem et filium; non aequamus filium patri in honore, sed praeponimus, si bonam causam habet, filium patri in veritate; et sic tribuimus honorem debitum, ut non perdat aequitas meritum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What our Lord here tells us to avoid, in judging by the person, is very difficult in this world not to do. His admonition to the Jews is an admonition to us as well; for every sentence which our Lord uttered, was written for us, and is preserved to us, and is read for our profit. Our Lord is above; but our Lord, as the truth, is here as well. The body with which He rose can be only in one place, but His truth is diffused every where. Who then is he who judges not by the person? He who loves all alike. For it is not the paying men different degrees of honor according to their situation, that will make us chargeable with accepting persons. There may be a case to decide between father and son: we should not put the son on an equality with the father in point of honor; but, in respect of truth, if he have the better cause, we should give him the preference; and so give to each their due, that justice do not destroy desert.

Ecce palam loquitur, et nihil ei dicunt. Noverant enim qua saevitia quaerebatur; mirabantur qua potentia non tenebatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It was said above that our Lord went up to the feast secretly, not because He feared being taken, (for He had power to prevent it,) but to show figuratively, that even in the very feast which the Jews celebrated, He was hid, and that it was His mystery. Now however the power appears, which was thought timidity: He spoke publicly at the feast, in so much that the multitude marveled: They said some of them at Jerusalem, Is not this He, whom they seek to kill? but, lo, He speaks boldly, and they say nothing to Him. They knew the fierceness with which He had been sought for; they marveled at the power by which he was not taken.

An non magnum, insanientes et quaerentes interficere, habere eum in manibus, et repente quiescere?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Evangelist adds, from Jerusalem: for there had been the greatest display of miracles, and there the people were in the worst state, seeing the strongest proofs of His divinity, and yet willing to give up all to the judgment of their corrupt rulers. Was it not a great miracle, that those who raged for His life, now that they had Him in their grasp, became on a sudden quiet?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But they do not follow the opinion of the rulers, but put forth another most perverse and absurd one; Howbeit we know this Man, whence He is; but when Christ comes, no man knows whence He is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Haec opinio apud Iudaeos non inaniter nata est. Invenimus tamen quod Scripturae dixerunt de Christo, quoniam Nazaraeus vocabitur; ergo praedixerunt unde sit. Iudaei etiam dixerunt Herodi quaerenti, quod Christus in Bethlehem Iudae nasceretur, et testimonium etiam propheticum attulerunt. Unde ergo nata est haec opinio apud Iudaeos, quod Christus cum venerit, nemo sciat unde sit, nisi quia utrumque pronuntiaverunt Scripturae? Secundum hominem praedixerunt unde esset; secundum Deum latebat impios, et quaerebat pios. Hanc igitur opinionem in eis generaverat quod per Isaiam dictum est: generationem eius quis enarrabit? Denique dominus ad utrumque respondit, et quia noverant eum unde esset, et quia non noverant; unde sequitur clamabat ergo Iesus docens in templo, et dicens: et me scitis, et unde sim scitis; hoc est dicere: et unde sim scitis, et unde sim nescitis; unde sim scitis, Iesus a Nazareth, cuius etiam parentes nostis. Solus enim in hac causa latebat virginis partus, quo excepto, totum noverunt in Iesu quod ad hominem pertinet. Recte ergo dixit et me nostis, et unde sim scitis, secundum carnem et effigiem hominis quam gerebat; secundum divinitatem autem a meipso non veni; sed est verus qui misit me.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This notion did not arise without foundation. We find indeed that the Scriptures said of Christ, He shall be called a Nazarene, and thus predicted whence He would come. And the Jews again told Herod, when he inquired, that Christ would be born in Bethlehem of Judah, and adduced the testimony of the Prophet. How then did this notion of the Jews arise, that, when Christ came, no one would know whence He was? From this reason, viz. that the Scriptures asserted both. As man, they foretold whence Christ would be; as God, He was hid from the profane, but revealed Himself to the godly. This notion they had taken from Isaiah, Who shall declare His generation? Our Lord replies, that they both knew Him, and knew Him not: Then cried Jesus in the temple as He taught, saying, You both know Me, and know whence I am: that is to say, You both know whence I am, and do not know whence I am: you know whence I am, that I am Jesus of Nazareth, whose parents you know. The birth from the Virgin was the only part of the matter unknown to them: with this exception, they knew all that pertained to Jesus as man. So He well says, You both know Me, and know whence I am: i.e. according to the flesh, and the likeness of man. But in respect of His divinity, He says, I am not come of Myself, but He that sent Me is true.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per quod ea quae in mente habebant revelat; ac si diceret: non sum de numero eorum qui sine causa venerunt; sed est verax qui misit me; et si verax est, in veritate misit; et qui missus est, congruum est veracem esse. Rursus autem ex propriis sermonibus eos capit; quia enim dicebant cum venerit Christus, nullus cognoscet unde sit: ostendit etiam inde se Christum esse; quoniam a patre venit, quem ipsi nesciebant: et ideo subdit quem vos nescitis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By which He discloses what was in their minds. I am not, He seems to say, of the number of those who have come without reason, but He is true that sent Me; and if He is true, He has sent Me in truth; and therefore He who is sent must needs speak the truth. He then convicts them from their own assertions. For whereas they had said, When Christ comes, no man knows whence He is, He shows that Christ did come from one whom they knew not, i.e. the Father. Wherefore He adds, Whom you know not.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Numquid autem non omnis homo, licet in carne ex Deo natus, secundum sensum communis opinionis ex Deo est? Et quomodo negat ab his vel seipsum vel unde ipse sit sciri, nisi id unde est ad naturae suae referret auctorem? Nam id quod unde sit ignoratur, naturam ex qua est, dum unde sit nescitur, ostendit. Ignorari enim unde sit non potest quidquid subsistit ex nihilo; quia hoc ipsum quod non ignoratur ex nihilo, ignorationem eius unde sit, non habet. Ob hoc autem quid sit ipse, nescitur, dum ignoratur a quo sit: non enim confitetur filium qui negat natum; nec natum intelligit, qui putat eum esse ex nihilo.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Every man, ever born in the flesh, is in a certain sense from God. How then could He say that they were ignorant who He was, and whence He was.? Because our Lord is here referring to His own peculiar birth from God, which they were ignorant of, because they did not know that He was the Son of God. His very saying then that they did not know whence He was, was telling them whence He was. If they, did not know whence He was, He could not be from nothing; for then there would be no whence to be ignorant of. He must therefore be from God. And then not knowing whence He is, was the reason that they did not know who He is. He does not know the Son who does not know His birth from the Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or the ignorance, He here speaks of, is the ignorance of a bad life; as Paul said, They profess that they know God, but in words they deny Him. Our Lord’s reproof is twofold: He first published what they were speaking secretly, crying out, in order to put them to shame.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Lastly, to show whence they could get to know Him (who had sells Him), He adds, I know Him: so if you would know Him, inquire of Me. No one knows the Father, save the Son, and he to whom the Son will reveal Him. And if I should say, I know Him not, I should be a liar like to you.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Which is impossible for He that sent Me is true, and therefore He that is sent must be true likewise He every where attributes the knowledge of the Father to Himself, as being from the Father: thus here, But I know Hint, for I am from Him.

Si vero idcirco ei, quia ab eo sit, eum nosse sit proprium; quomodo non hoc ei qui ab eo est, erit proprium, scilicet ut verus filius ex natura Dei sit? Habes igitur proprietatem cognitionis de proprietate generationis. Tamen, ne forte id quod ab eo est, ad adventus sui tempus haeresis invaderet, continuo subiecit et ipse me misit. Tenuit ordinem evangelici sacramenti, natum se professus et missum.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. I ask however does the being from Him express a work of creation, or a birth by generation? If a work of creation, then every thing which is created is from Him. And how then does not all creation know the Father, if the Son knows Him, because He is from Him? But if the knowledge of the Father is peculiar to Him, as being from Him, then the being from Him is peculiar to Him also; i.e. the being the true Son of God by nature. So you have then a peculiar knowledge springing from a peculiar generation. To prevent however ever any heresy applying the being from Him, to the time of His advent He adds, And He has sent Me; thus preserving, the order of the Gospel sacrament; first announcing Himself born, and then sent.

Mark the invisible check which is kept upon their fury: though the Evangelist does not mention it, but preserves purposely a humble and human way of speaking, in order to impress us with Christ’s humanity; and therefore only adds, Because His hour was not yet come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hoc est, quia nolebat, non enim dominus sub fato natus est. Hoc nec de te credendum est, quanto minus de illo per quem factus es? Si tua hora voluntas est illius, illius hora quae est nisi voluntas sua? Non ergo horam dixit qua cogeretur mori, sed qua dignaretur occidi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That is, because He was not so pleased; for our Lord was not born subject to fate. You must not believe this even of yourself, much less of Him by Whom you were made. And if your hour is in His will, is not His hour in His own will? His home then here does not mean the time that He was obliged to die, but the time that He deigned to be put to death.

Dicere enim Christus cum venerit, erat non firmiter credentium hunc esse Christum. Vel etiam hoc dicere, est ostendere eum non esse Christum; ac si dicant: nonne ille cum venerit melior erit et plura signa faciet? Grossiores enim non a doctrina, sed a signis inducuntur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Neither had these however a sound faith; but took up a low way of speaking, after the manner of the multitude: When Christ comes, will He do more miracles than this Man has done? Their saying, When Christ comes, shows that they were not steady in believing that He was the Christ: or rather, that they did not believe He was the Christ at all; for it is the same as if they said, that Christ, when He came, would be a superior person, and do more miracles. Minds of the grosser sort are influenced not by doctrine, but by miracles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel intelligunt: si duo non erunt, hic est Christus. Principes autem insaniebant: et ideo medicum non solum non agnoscebant, sed etiam occidere cupiebant; unde sequitur audierunt Pharisaei turbam murmurantem de illo haec, et miserunt principes et Pharisaei ministros ut apprehenderent eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or they mean, If there are not to be two Christs, this is He. The rulers however, possessed with madness, not only refused to acknowledge the physician, but even wished to kill Him: The Pharisees heard that the people murmured such things concerning Him, and the Pharisees and chief priests sent officers to take Him.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Multa quidem locutus est supra, sed nihil tale fecerunt; quod maxime enim eos mordebat, hoc erat, quod turbae scilicet Christum glorificabant. Sabbati autem solutio, apparens causa erat, quam scilicet praetendebant. Et ipsi quidem non audebant Christum capere, periculum timentes; ministros autem mittunt tamquam periculis expositos.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He had discoursed often before, but they had never so treated Him. The praises of the multitude however now irritated them; though the transgression of the sabbath still continued to be the reason put forward. Nevertheless, they were afraid of taking this step themselves, and sent officers instead.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quia ergo non poterant apprehendere nolentem, missi sunt ut audirent docentem; sequitur enim dixit ergo Iesus: adhuc modicum tempus vobiscum sum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Not being able to take Him against His will, they sent men to hear Him teach. Teach what? Then said Jesus to them, Yet a little while I am with you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Verba loquitur humilitatis plena; ac si diceret: quid festinatis me interficere? Parvum expectate tempus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He speaks with the greatest humility: as if to say, Why do you make such haste to kill Me? Only wait a little time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod modo ergo vultis facere, facturi estis, sed non modo, quia modo nolo: implere enim debeo dispensationem meam, et sic pervenire ad passionem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That which you wish to do now, you shall do sometime, but not now: because it is not My will. For I wish to fulfill My mission in due course, and so to come to My passion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per hoc igitur audaciorem turbam terruit, studiosiorem vero magis avidam faciebat ad audiendum, quasi parvo tempore derelicto, in quo possent hac doctrina potiri. Non autem dixit simpliciter: hic sum, sed vobiscum sum, quasi dicat: et si persequamini me, non tamen cessabo, quae sunt pro vobis dispensans, et ea quae sunt ad salutem docens et monens vos. Quod autem subdit et vado ad eum qui me misit, sufficiens erat eos terrere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. In this way He astonished the bolder part of the multitude, and made the earnest among them more eager to hear Him; so little time being now left, during which they could have the benefit of His teaching. He does not say, I am here, simply; but, I am with you; meaning, Though you persecute Me, I will not cease fulfilling my part towards you, teaching you the way to salvation, anti admonishing you. What follows, And I go to Him that sent Me, was enough to excite some fear.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. I go to Him that sent Me: i.e. I return to My Father, at whose command I became incarnate. He is speaking of that departure, from which He has never returned.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quod vero eo indigebant, manifestat per hoc quod dicit quaeretis me, et non invenietis. Sed ubi quaesierunt eum Iudaei? Dicit Lucas quoniam plangebant mulieres super eum. Probabile autem est et multos alios hoc passos esse; et praecipue dum civitas caperetur, eos meminisse Christi et miraculorum eius, et praesentiam eius quaesivisse.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That they wanted His presence, appears from His saying, You seek Me, and shall not find Me. But when did the Jews seek Him? Luke relates that the women lamented over Him: and it is probable that many others did the same. And especially, when the city was taken, would they call Christ and His miracles to remembrance, and desire His presence.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel hic iam resurrectionem suam praedixit: quia quaesituri illum erant post resurrectionem compuncti. Noluerunt enim eum agnoscere praesentem, et postea quaesierunt cum viderent in eum multitudinem credentem: unde multi compuncti dixerunt: quid faciemus? Viderunt enim Christum suo scelere morientem, et crediderunt in Christum suis sceleribus ignoscentem, et quousque biberent sanguinem quem fuderunt, de sua salute desperaverunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Here He foretells His resurrection: for the search for Him was to take place after His resurrection, when men were conscience stricken. They would not acknowledge Him, when present; afterward they sought Him, when they saw the multitude believing on Him; and many pricked in their hearts said, What shall we do? They perceived that Christ’s death was owing to their sin, and believed in Christ’s pardon to sinners; and so despaired of salvation, until they drank of that blood which they shed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Deinde ne quis eum per mortem communi modo abire aestimet, subiungit et ubi ego sum, vos non potestis venire. Si vero in morte maneret, possent ad eum ire: illuc enim omnes abimus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Then lest any should think that His death would take place in the common way, He adds, And where I am, thither you cannot come. If He continued in death, they would be able to go to Him: for we all are going thitherwards.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non autem dixit: ubi ero, sed ubi sum: semper enim ibi erat Christus quo fuerat rediturus; sic rediit, ut nos non derelinqueret. Erat enim Christus secundum visibilem carnem in terra, secundum invisibilem maiestatem in caelo et in terra. Non autem dixit: non poteritis, sed non potestis venire: tales enim tunc erant qui non possent. Nam ut sciatis non hoc ad desperationem dictum, et discipulis suis dixit tale aliquid quo ego vado, vos non potestis venire. Denique hoc Petro exposuit, dicens: quo ego vado, non potes me sequi modo, sequeris autem postea.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He does not say, Where I shall be, but Where I am. For Christ was always there in that place, whither He was about to return: He returned in such a way, as that He did not forsake us. Visibly and according to the flesh, He was upon earth; according to His invisible majesty, He was in heaven and earth. Nor again is it, you will not be able, but, you are not able to come: for they were not such at the time, as to be able. That this is not meant to drive men to despair, is shown by His saying the very same thing to His disciples; Whither I go, you cannot come; and by His explanation last of all to Peter, Whither I go, you cannot follow Me now, but you shall follow Me afterwards.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Haec autem omnia induxit volens eos attrahere; etenim modicum tempus quod relinquebatur, et post recessum ipsum desiderabilem esse, et eum non posse de cetero inveniri, sufficientia erant ad suadendum ut ad eum accederent. Per hoc autem quod dicit vado ad eum qui misit me, ostendit nullam sibi fieri laesionem ab insidiis eorum, et passionem suam voluntariam sibi esse. Passi sunt autem aliquid ipsi Iudaei ad ea quae dicta sunt, et quaerunt ad seipsos quo debeat ire; quod non erat eorum qui desiderarent ab eo liberari. Sequitur enim dixerunt ergo Iudaei ad semetipsos: quo hic iturus est, quia non inveniemus eum? Numquid in dispersionem gentium iturus est, et docturus gentes? Sic enim gentes vocabant quasi exprobrantes et magna in semetipsis gloriantes: quia gentes ubique disseminatae erant, et imperfecte ad invicem permixtae. Sed hoc opprobrium postea ipsi sustinuerunt, quia ubique dispersi sunt. Antiquitus autem tota gens in unum collecta erat; sed cum Iudaei ubique terrarum iam gentibus permixti essent, non diceret: quo ego vado, vos non potestis venire: si per hoc gentes intellexisset.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He wants them to think seriously how little time longer He should be with them, and what regret they will feel when He is gone, and they are not able to find Him. I go to Him that sent Me; this shows that no injury was done Him by their plots, and that His passion was voluntary. The words had some effect upon the Jews, who asked each other, where they were to go, which was like persons desiring to be quit of Him: Then said the Jews among themselves, Whither will He go, that we shall not find Him? Will He go to the dispersed among the Gentiles, and teach the Gentiles? In the fullness of their self-satisfaction, they call them Gentiles, as a term of reproach; the Gentiles being dispersed every where; a reproach which they themselves underwent afterwards. Of old all the nation was united together: but now that the Jews were mixed with the Gentiles in every part of the world, our Lord would not have said, Whither I go, you cannot come, in the sense of going to the Gentiles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dixerat autem dominus quo ego vado, de sinu patris. Hoc ergo illi nullo modo intellexerunt; et tamen ex hac occasione salutem nostram praedixerunt, quod dominus iturus esset ad gentes, non praesentia corporis, sed tamen pedibus suis; misit enim ad nos membra sua, et fecit nos membra sua.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Whither I go, i.e. to the bosom of the Father. This they did not at all understand: and yet even their mistake is an unwitting prophecy of our salvation; i.e. that our Lord would go to the Gentiles, not in His own person, but by His feet, i.e. His members. He sent to us those whom He had made His members, and so made us His members.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem dixerunt quod iturus esset ad gentes laedere eas, sed docere. Iam enim iram submiserant, et his quae dicta erant, crediderant. Nequaquam autem nisi credidissent, quaesiissent ad seipsos: quis est hic sermo quem dixit: quaeretis me, et non invenietis, et: ubi ego sum, vos non potestis venire?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They did not mean, that our Lord was going to the Gentiles for their hurt, but to teach them. Their anger had subsided, and they believed what He had said. Else they would not have thought of asking each other, What manner of saying is this that He said, you shall seek Me, and shall not find Me: and whither I am, you cannot come.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ad qualem autem potum dominus invitasset, exposuit Evangelista, et dixit hoc autem dixit de spiritu quem accepturi erant credentes in eum. Quem dicit spiritum, nisi spiritum sanctum? Nam unusquisque homo habet in se proprium spiritum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What kind of drink it was, to which our Lord invited them, the Evangelist next explains; But this He spoke of the Spirit, which they that believe on Him should receive. Whom does the Spirit mean, but the Holy Spirit; For every man has within him his own spirit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Spiritum autem sanctum ante ascensionem apostolis promisit; post ascensionem linguis igneis dedit; inde dicit quem accepturi erant credentes in eum.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He promised the Holy Spirit to the Apostles before the Ascension; He gave it to them in fiery tongues, after the Ascension. The Evangelist’s words, Which they that believe in Him should receive, refer to this.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Erat ergo spiritus Dei; sed nondum in eis erat qui crediderant in Iesum. Ita enim disposuit non eis dare spiritum istum, nisi post resurrectionem suam; unde sequitur nondum enim erat spiritus datus quia nondum Iesus erat glorificatus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Spirit of God was, i.e. was with God, before now; but was not yet given to those who believed on Jesus; for our Lord had determined not to give them the Spirit, till He was risen again: The Holy Ghost was not yet given, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Apostoli quidem prius spiritu eiciebant Daemonia, sed ea quae a Christo est potestate; quando enim mittebat eos, non dicitur: dedit eis spiritum sanctum, sed: dedit eis potestatem. De prophetis autem ab omnibus confessum est quod spiritus sanctus eis dabatur: sed haec gratia a terra defecerat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Apostles indeed cast out devils by the Spirit before, but only by the power which they had from Christ. For when He sent them, it is not said, He gave them the Holy Spirit, but, He gave to them power. With respect to the Prophets however, all agree that the Holy Spirit was given to them but this grace had been withdrawn from the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Sed quomodo et de Ioanne Baptista dictum est: spiritu sancto replebitur ab utero matris suae; et spiritu sancto repletus Zacharias invenitur, ut de illo talia diceret; et spiritu sancto Maria, ut talia de domino praedicaret; spiritu sancto Simeon et Anna, ut magnitudinem Christi parvuli agnoscerent? Quomodo ergo intelligitur, nisi quia certa illa spiritus sancti datio post clarificationem Christi futura erat qualis nunquam antea fuerat? Habitura enim erat quamdam proprietatem in ipso adventu, qualis antea nunquam fuit. Nusquam enim legimus, linguis quas non noverant, homines locutos veniente in se spiritu sancto, sicut tunc factum est, cum oportet eius adventum signis sensibilibus demonstrari.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Yet we read of John the Baptist, He shall be filled with the Holy Ghost even from his mother’s womb. And Zacharias was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied. Mary was filled with the Holy Ghost, and prophesied of our Lord. And so were Simeon and Anna, that they might acknowledge the greatness of the infant Christ. We are to understand then that the giving of the Holy Spirit was to be certain, after Christ’s exaltation, in a way in which it never was before. It was to have a peculiarity at His coming, which it had not before. For we no where read of men under the influence of the Holy Spirit, speaking with tongues which they had never known, as then took place, when it was necessary to evidence His coming by sensible miracles.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Cum ergo et modo accipiatur spiritus sanctus, quare nemo loquitur linguis omnium gentium? Quia iam ipsa Ecclesia linguis gentium loquitur: in hac qui non est, nec modo accipit spiritum sanctum. Si amas unitatem, etiam tibi habet quisquis in illa aliquid habet. Tolle invidiam, et tuum est quod habeo. Livor separat, caritas iungit: ipsam habeto, et cuncta habebis: quia sine ipsa nihil proderit quidquid habere potueris. Caritas autem Dei diffusa est in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum, qui datus est nobis. Quare ergo dominus post resurrectionem suam spiritum sanctum dare voluit? Ut scilicet in resurrectionem nostram caritas flagraret, ab amore saeculi separaretur, et tota curreret in Deum. Qui enim dixit qui credit in me, veniat et bibat, et flumina de ventre eius fluent aquae vivae, vitam aeternam promisit, ubi nihil timeamus, ubi non moriamur. Quia ergo tale est quod promisit spiritus sancti caritate ferventibus; ideo ipsum spiritum noluit dare nisi cum esset glorificatus, ut in suo corpore ostenderet vitam, quam modo non habemus, sed in resurrectione speramus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If the Holy Spirit then is received now, why is there no one who speaks the tongues of all nations? Because now the Church herself speaks the tongues of all nations. Whoso is not in her, neither does he now receive the Holy Spirit. But if only you love unity, whoever has any thing in her, has it for you. Put away envy, and that which I have is yours. Envy separates, love unites: have it, and you have all things: whereas without it nothing that you can have, will profit you. The love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which its given to us. But why did our Lord give the Holy Spirit after His resurrection? That the flame of love might mount upwards to our own resurrection: separating us from the world, and devoting us wholly to God. He who said, He that believes in Me, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water, has promised life eternal, free from all fear, and change, and death. Such then being the gifts which He promised to those in whom the Holy Spirit kindled the flame of love, He would not give that Spirit till He was glorified: in order that in His own person He might show us that life, which we hope to attain to in the resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus contra Faustum</b>: Si itaque haec causa erat ut nondum daretur spiritus sanctus, quia nondum erat Iesus glorificatus; proculdubio clarificatio Iesu iam causa erat ut statim daretur. Cataphryges autem se promissum Paraclitum suscepisse dixerunt, et hinc a fide Catholica deviarunt. Manichaei etiam quae de promissione spiritus sancti dicuntur, de Manichaeo asserunt esse praedicta, tamquam scilicet antea non fuerit spiritus datus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If this then is the cause why the Holy Spirit was not yet given; viz. because Jesus was not yet glorified; doubtless, the glorification of Jesus when it took place, was the cause immediately of its being given. The Cataphryges, however, said that they first received the promised Paraclete, and thus strayed from the Catholic faith. The Manichaeans too apply all the promises made respecting the Holy Spirit to Manichaeus, as if there were no Holy Spirit given before.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Gloriam Christi crucem vocat: quia enim inimici eramus, donum autem non inimicis, sed amicis datur; oportebat prius offerri hostiam, et inimicitiam in carne dissolvi, et tunc factos Dei amicos suscipere donum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus; By the glory of Christ, He means the cross. For, whereas we were enemies, and gifts are not made to enemies, but to friends, it was necessary that the victim should be first offered up, and the enmity of the flesh removed; that, being made friends of God, we might be capable of receiving the gift.

Nonne Scriptura dicit quia ex semine David, et de Bethlehem castello, ubi erat David, venit Christus? Noverant enim quid de Christo praedixissent prophetae; sed ignorabant omnia in ipso impleta fuisse; et qui noverant in Nazareth nutritum, nativitatis locum non attendebant, nec prophetiam, quam legerant, in eo completam credebant.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. These had now begun to drink in that spiritual thirst, and had laid aside the unbelieving thirst. But others still remained dried up in their unbelief: But some said, Shall Christ come out of Galilee? Has not the Scripture said, That Christ comes of the seed of David, and out of the town of Bethlehem, where David was? They knew what were the predictions of the Prophets respecting Christ, but knew not that they all were fulfilled in Him. They knew that He had been brought up at Nazareth, but the place of His birth they did not know; and did not believe that it answered to the prophecies.

Et quia non diligenter attendebant his quae dicebantur, neque discendi gratia; propter hoc nihil eis Christus respondit. Nathanaelem autem dicentem: a Nazareth potest aliquid boni esse?

Why did they ask, Has not the Scripture said, that Christ comes of the seed of David? They wished to conceal His extraction, and therefore put forward where He had been educated. For this reason, they do not go to Christ and ask, How say the Scriptures that Christ must come from Bethlehem, whereas you come from Galilee purposely and of malice prepense they do not do this. And because they were thus inattentive, and indifferent about knowing the truth, Christ did not answer them: though He had lauded Nathanael, when he said, Can any good thing come out of Nazareth? and called Him an Israelite indeed, as being a lover of truth, an well learned in the ancient Scriptures.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Dominus maxime circa suam passionem, hanc sibi effecerat consuetudinem, ut in die quidem in templo, quod erat Hierosolymis, verbum Dei praedicaret, signa et miracula ostenderet; sero autem revertebatur in Bethaniam, ubi apud sorores Lazari hospitabatur; et mane iterum ad simile opus revertebatur. Igitur secundum hunc morem, cum in ultimo die Scenopegiae tota die in templo praedicasset, vespere perrexit in montem oliveti; et hoc est quod dicitur Iesus autem perrexit in montem oliveti.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Our Lord at the time of His passion used to spend the day in Jerusalem, preaching in the temple, and performing miracles, and return in the evening to Bethany, where He lodged with the sisters of Lazarus. Thus on the last day of the feast, having, according to His wont, preached the whole day in the temple, in the evening He went to the mount of Olives.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ubi enim decebat docere Christum nisi in monte oliveti, in monte unguenti, in monte chrismatis? Christi enim nomen a chrismate dictum est. Chrisma autem Graece, Latine unctio nominatur. Ideo autem nos unxit, quia luctatores contra Diabolum fecit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And where ought Christ to teach, except on the mount of Olives; on the mount of ointment, on the mount of chrism. For the name Christ is from chrism, chrism being the Greek word for unction. He has anointed us, for wrestling with the devil.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Unctio enim olei fessis et dolentibus membris solet afferre levamen. Mons etiam olivarum sublimitatem dominicae pietatis designat: quia oleos Graece, Latine misericordia. Natura quoque olei mysterio aptissime congruit: superfertur enim omnibus liquoribus; et sicut ait Psalmista: miserationes eius super omnia opera eius. Sequitur et diluculo iterum venit in templum, ut scilicet misericordiam cum incipiente novi testamenti lumine fidelibus, in templo videlicet suo, pandendam praebendamque signaret. Quod enim diluculo redibat, exortum novae gratiae designat.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The anointing with oil is a relief to the limbs, when wearied and in pain. The mount of Olives also denotes the height of our Lord’s pity, olive in the Greek signifying pity. The qualities of oil are such as to fit in to this mystical meaning. For it floats above all other liquids: and the Psalmist says, Your mercy is over all Your works. And early in the morning, He came again into the temple: i.e. to denote the giving and unfolding of His mercy, i.e. the now dawning light of the New Testament in the faithful, that is, in His temple. His returning early in the morning, signifies the new rise of grace.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Sessio humilitatem incarnationis insinuat. Sedente ergo domino, ad eum venit populus: quia postquam per susceptam humanitatem visibilis apparuit, coeperunt eum multi audire, et in eum credere, quem per humanitatem sibi proximum meminerant. Mansuetis autem et simplicibus sermonem domini admirantibus, Scribae et Pharisaei interrogant, non ut discant, sed ut veritati laqueos nectant; unde sequitur adducunt autem Scribae et Pharisaei mulierem in adulterio deprehensam; et statuerunt eam in medio, et dixerunt ei: magister, haec mulier deprehensa est modo in adulterio.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The sitting down, represents the humility of His incarnation. And the people came to Him, when He sat down, i.e. after taking up human nature, and thereby becoming visible, many began to hear and believe on Him, only knowing Him as their friend and neighbor. But while these kind and simple persons are full of admiration at our Lord’s discourse, the Scribes and Pharisees put questions to Him, not for the sake of instruction, but only to entangle the truth in their nets: And the Scribes and Pharisees brought to Him a woman taken in adultery; and when they had set her in the midst, they say to Him, Master, this woman was taken in adultery, if the very act.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Ergo attulit veritatem ut doctor, mansuetudinem ut liberator, iustitiam ut cognitor. Cum loqueretur, veritas agnoscebatur; cum adversus inimicos non moveretur, mansuetudo laudabatur; in tertio ergo, iustitia scilicet, scandalum posuerunt: dixerunt enim apud seipsos: si eam dimitti censuerit, iustitiam non tenebit: lex enim quod iniustum erat, iubere non poterat; et ideo legem inducunt, dicentes in lege autem Moyses mandavit nobis huiusmodi lapidare. Ut autem mansuetudinem non perdat, in qua iam populis amabilis factus est, eam dimitti debere dicturus est. Unde eius sententiam requirunt dicentes tu ergo quid dicis? Hinc nos inveniemus ad accusandum occasionem, et reum faciemus tamquam legis praevaricatorem; unde Evangelista subdit haec autem dicebant tentantes eum, ut possent accusare. Sed dominus in respondendo et iustitiam servaturus est, et a mansuetudine non recessurus; sequitur enim Iesus autem inclinans se deorsum, digito scribebat in terra.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They had remarked upon, Him already, as being over lenient. Of Him indeed it had I been prophesied, Ride on because of the word of truth, of meekness, and of righteousness. So as a teacher He exhibited truth, as a deliverer meekness, as a judge righteousness. When He spoke, His truth was acknowledged; when against His enemies He used no violence, His meekness was praised. So they raised the scandal on the score of justice For they said among themselves, If He decide to let her go He will not do justice; for the law cannot command what is unjust: Now Moses in the law commanded as, that such should be stoned: but to maintain His meekness, which has made Him already so acceptable to the people, He must decide to let her go. Wherefore they demand His opinion: And what say You? hoping to find an occasion to accuse Him, as a transgressor of the law: And this they said tempting Him, that they might have to accuse Him. But our Lord in His answer both maintained His justice, and departed not from meekness. Jesus stooped down, and with His finger wrote on the ground.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Tamquam illos tales in terra scribendos significaret, non in caelo, ubi monuit discipulos ut se scriptos esse gauderent; aut quod se humiliando, quod capitis inclinatione monstrabat, signa in terra faceret; aut quod iam tempus esset ut in terra quae fructum daret, non in lapide sterili, sicut antea, lex eius conscriberetur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if to signify that such persons were to be written in earth, not in heaven, where He told His disciples they should rejoice they were v written. Or His bowing His head (to write on the ground), is an expression of humility; the writing on the ground signifying that His law was written on the earth which bore fruit, not on the barren stone, as before.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Per terram enim cor humanum ostenditur, quod bonarum vel malarum actionum solet reddere fructus; per digitum autem, qui articulorum compositione flexibilis est, sublimitas discretionis exprimitur. Nos ergo instruit, ut cum qualibet mala proximorum conspicimus, non statim ea temere damnemus; sed prius ad conscientiam cordis humiliter reversi, digito discretionis ea sollicite disquiramus.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The ground denotes the human heart, which yields the fruit either of good or of bad actions: the finger jointed and flexible, discretion. He instructs us then, when we see any faults in our neighbors, not immediately and rashly to condemn them, but after searching our own hearts to begin with, to examine them attentively with the finger of discretion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quantum etiam ad historiam pertinet, per hoc quod digito scripsit in terra, illum se fore monstravit qui quondam legem in lapide scripsit. Sequitur cum autem perseverarent interrogantes eum, erexit se.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. His writing with His finger on the ground perhaps showed, that it was He who had written the law on stone. So when they continued asking Him, He lifted Himself up.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non dixit: non lapidetur, ne contra legem dicere videretur. Absit autem ut diceret: lapidetur; venit enim non perdere quod invenerat, sed quaerere quod perierat. Quid ergo respondit? Qui sine peccato est vestrum, primus in illam lapidem mittat. Haec vox iustitiae est. Puniatur peccatrix, sed non a peccatoribus; impleatur lex, sed non a praevaricatoribus legis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He did not say, Stone her not, lest He should seem to speak contrary to the law. But God forbid that He should say, Stone her; for He came not to destroy that which He found, but to seek that which was lost. What then did He answer? He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her. This is the voice of justice. Let the sinner be punished, but not by sinners; the law carried into effect, but not by transgressors of the law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Qui enim prius semetipsum non iudicat, quid in alio rectum iudicet ignorat. Et si novit etiam per auditum recte tamen aliena merita iudicare non valet, cui conscientia innocentiae propriae nullam iudicii regulam praebet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. For he who judges not himself first, cannot know how to judge correctly in the case of another. For though He know what the offense is, from being told, yet He cannot judge of another’s deserts, who supposing himself innocent, will not apply the rule of justice to himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Cum ergo eos telo iustitiae percussisset, nec dignatus est cadentes attendere; sed avertit ab eis obtutum; unde sequitur et iterum se inclinans scribebat in terra.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Having with the weapon of justice smitten them, He deigned not even to look on the fallen, but averted His eyes: And again He stooped down, and wrote on the ground.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Potest etiam intelligi fecisse hoc dominus iuxta consuetudinem, ut quasi aliquid agens, vultu intendens in aliud, liberam eis exeundi facultatem daret. In hoc etiam figurate admonet, ut et priusquam peccantem fratrem corripiamus, et post adhibitam correctionem, diligenter perpendamus utrum ipsis peccatis, de quibus alium castigamus, aut aliis obnoxii simus.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. This is like our Lord; while His eyes are fixed, and He seems attending to something else, He gives the bystanders an opportunity of retiring: a tacit admonition to us to consider always both before we condemn a brother for a sin, and after we have punished him, whether we are not guilty ourselves of the same fault, or others as bad.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic igitur illi voce iustitiae tamquam telo percussi sese inspicientes, et reos invenientes, unus post unum omnes recesserunt; et hoc est quod subditur audientes autem haec, unus post alium exibant, incipientes a senioribus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Thus smitten then with the voice of justice, as with a weapon, they examine themselves, find themselves guilty, and one by one retire: And they which heard it, went out one by one, beginning at the eldest.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Relicti sunt autem duo: miseria, et misericordia; nam sequitur et remansit solus Iesus, et mulier in medio stans. Credo, territa illa mulier, ab illo se puniendam sperabat in quo peccatum inveniri non poterat. Ille autem, qui adversarios eius repulerat lingua iustitiae, levans in illam oculos mansuetudinis, interrogavit eam; unde sequitur erigens se autem Iesus, dixit ei: mulier, ubi sunt qui te accusabant? Nemo te condemnavit? Quae dixit: nemo, domine. Audivimus supra vocem iustitiae: audiamus nunc mansuetudinis; nam sequitur dixit ei Iesus: nec ego te condemno, a quo te forte condemnari timuisti, quia in me peccatum non invenisti. Quid est, domine? Faves ergo peccatis? Non plane; attende quod sequitur: vade, et amplius noli peccare. Ergo et dominus damnavit, sed peccatum, non hominem: nam si peccatorum auctor esset, diceret: vade, et vive ut vis; de mea liberatione esto secura: ego te quantumcumque peccaveris, etiam a Gehenna et Inferni tortoribus liberabo. Non hoc dixit. Intendant ergo qui amant in domino mansuetudinem, et timeant veritatem: etenim dulcis et rectus dominus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There were left however two, the pitiable, and the pitiful, And Jesus was left alone, and the woman standing in the midst: the woman, you may suppose, in great alarm, expecting punishment from one in whom no sin could be found. But He who had repelled her adversaries with there word of justice, lifted on her the eyes of mercy, and asked; When Jesus had lifted Himself up, and saw none but the woman, He said to her, Woman, where are these your accusers? Has no man condemned you? She said, No man, Lord. We heard above the voice of justice; let us hear now that of mercy: Jesus said to her, Neither do I condemn you; I, who you feared would condemn you, because You found no fault in me. What then Lord? Do You favor sin? No, surely. Listen to what follows, Go, and sin no more. So then our Lord condemned sin, but not the sinner. For did He favor sin, He would have said, Go, and live as you will: depend on my deliverance: howsoever great your sins be, it matters not: I will deliver you from hell, and its tormentors. But He did not say this. Let those attend, who love the Lord’s mercy, and fear His truth. Truly, Gracious and righteous is the Lord.

The Manichaeans suppose the sun of the natural world to be our Lord Christ; but the Catholic Church reprobates such a notion for our Lord Christ was not made the sun, but the sun was made by Him: inasmuch as all things were made by Him. And for our sake did He come to be under the sun being the light which made the sun: He hid Himself under the cloud of the flesh, not to obscure, but to temper His light.

In istis usibus corporalibus aliud est lumen, et aliud fons: fontem fauces quaerunt, lumen oculi. Apud Deum, quod lumen est, hoc est fons. Qui tibi lucet ut videas, ipse tibi manat ut bibas.

He thinks it not enough to say shall have light, but adds, of life. These words of our Lord agree with those of the Psalm, In Your light shall we see light; for with you is the well of life. For bodily uses, light is one thing, and a well another; and a well ministers to the mouth, light to the eyes. With God the light and the well are the same. He who shines upon you, that you may see Him, the Same flows to you, that you may drink Him. What He promises is put in the future tense; what we ought to do in the present. He that follows Me, He says, shall have; i.e. by faith now, in sight hereafter. The visible sun accompanies you, only if you go westward, whither it go also; and even if you follow it, it will forsake you, at its setting. Your God is every where wholly; He will not fall from you, if you fall not from Him.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord having said, I am the Light of the world; and, he that follows Me, walks not in darkness, the Jews wish to overthrow what He has said: The Pharisees therefore said to Him, you bear record of Yourself, Your record is not true.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. As if our Lord Himself were the only (one that bore) witness to Himself; whereas the truth was that He had, before His incarnation, sent many witnesses to prophesy of His Sacraments.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dominus autem evertit quod dixerant; unde sequitur respondit Iesus, et dixit eis: et si ego testimonium perhibeo de meipso, verum est testimonium meum. Hoc iuxta eorum suspicionem locutus est, hominem eum nudum aestimantium; et causam subiungit: quia scio unde venio et quo vado; idest: ex Deo sum, et Deus, et Dei filius. Non autem hoc dicit manifeste, quia semper humilia miscet altis. Deus autem ipse sibi fide dignus est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord however overthrew their argument: Jesus answered and said, Though I bear record of Myself, yet My record is true. This is an accommodation to those who thought Him no more than a mere man. He adds the reason, For I know whence I come and whither I go; i.e. I am God, from God, and the Son of God: though this He does not say expressly, from His habit of mingling lofty and lowly words together. Now God is surely a competent witness to Himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Verum est enim testimonium luminis, sive se ostendat, sive alia. Locutus est propheta verum; sed unde haberet, nisi de fonte veritatis hauriret? Ergo idoneus est Iesus qui sibi testimonium perhibeat. Dicens autem quia scio unde venio et quo vado, patrem volebat intelligi: patri enim gloriam dabat filius, a quo est missus. Quantum ergo debet homo glorificare eum a quo est creatus? Non autem veniendo inde discessit, aut redeundo nos dereliquit. Non potest hoc fieri ab isto sole, qui quando pergit ad occidentem, deserit orientem. Sicut autem sol iste et videntis faciem illustrat, et caeci; sed videt ille, ille non videt: sic et sapientia Dei, verbum Dei, ubique praesens est etiam infidelibus; sed quibus eam videant oculos non habent cordis. Ut ergo dominus inter fideles suos, et inimicos suos Iudaeos, tamquam inter tenebras et lucem distingueret, subiungit vos autem nescitis unde venio aut quo vado. Isti ergo Iudaei videbant hominem, nec credebant Deum; et ideo dominus subdit vos secundum carnem iudicatis, dum scilicet dicitis tu de teipso testimonium perhibes, et testimonium tuum non est verum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The witness of light is true, whether the light show itself, or other things. The Prophet spoke the truth, but whence had he it, but by drawing from the fount of truth? Jesus then is a competent witness to Himself: For I know whence I come, and whither I go: this has reference to the Father; for the Son gave glory to the Father who sent Him. How greatly then should man glorify the Creator, who made Him. He did not separate from His Father, however, when He came, or desert us when He returned: unlike that sun which in going to the west, leaves the east. And as that sun throws its light on the faces both of him who sees, and him who sees not; only the one sees with the light, the other sees not: so the Wisdom of God, the Word, is every where present, even to the minds of unbelievers; but they have not the eyes of the understanding, whereas with to see. To distinguish then between believers and enemies among the Jews, as between light and darkness, He adds, But you cannot tell whence I come, and whither I go. These Jews saw the man, and did not believe in the God, and therefore our Lord says, You judge after the flesh, i.e. in saying, You bear record of Yourself, Your record is not true.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ac si dicat: vos quoniam in carne sum, carnem me solum esse putantes, non autem Deum, secundum carnem fallibiliter iudicatis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if to say: You judge untruly, according to the flesh, thinking, because I am in the flesh, that I am flesh only, and not God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quia enim Deum non intelligitis, et hominem videtis; ideo vobis arrogans videor, quia ego de me testimonium perhibeo. Omnis enim homo quando de se perhibere vult laudabile testimonium, superbus et arrogans videtur: homines enim infirmi sumus, verum dicere et mentiri possumus; lux mentiri non potest.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Understanding Me not as God, and seeing Me as man, you think Me arrogant in bearing witness of Myself. For any man who bears high testimony to himself, is thought proud and arrogant. But men are frail, and may either speak the truth, or lie: the Light cannot lie.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Sicut secundum carnem vivere, male vivere est, ita secundum carnem iudicare, iudicare iniustum est. Et quia possent dicere: si iniuste iudicamus, propter quid non convincis, propter quid non condemnas? Subiungit ego non iudico quemquam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As to live according to the flesh is to live amiss, so to judge according to the flesh, is to judge unjustly. They might say, however, If we judge wrongly, why do you not convict us, why do you not condemn us? So He adds, I judge no man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod duobus modis intelligi potest: ut aut hoc intelligamus non iudico quemquam, idest modo, sicut dicit alio loco: ego non veni ut iudicem mundum, sed ut salvum faciam mundum, non iudicium suum negando, sed differendo; aut certe quia dixerat vos secundum carnem iudicatis, ita coniunxit ego non iudico quemquam, ut subaudias: secundum carnem Christum non iudicare, sicut ab hominibus iudicatus est; nam ut agnoscas iam iudicem Christum, subditur et si iudico ego, iudicium meum verum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Which may be understood in two ways; judge no man, i.e. not now: as He says elsewhere, God sent not His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world through Him might be saved: not that He abandons, but only defers, His justice. Or having said, You Judge according to the flesh, He says immediately, I judge no man, to let you know that Christ does not judge according to the flesh, as men judged Him. For that Christ is a judge appears from the next words, And yet if I Judge, My judgment is true.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: propter hoc dixi non iudico, quasi non praesumens iudicare: quia si iudicarem iuste, vos condemnarem; sed nunc tempus iudicii non est; sed de futuro iudicio insinuat, cum subdit quia solus non sum, sed ego, et qui misit me pater: ostendens quia non ipse solus eos condemnabit, sed et pater. Hoc autem ad suspicionem illorum loquitur: non enim aestimabant dignum fide esse filium, nisi patris testimonium assumpsisset.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if to say: In saying, I judge no man, I meant that I did not anticipate judgment. If I judged justly, I should condemn you, but now is not the time for judging. He alludes however to the future judgment, in what follows; For I am not alone, but I and the Father that sent Me; which means that He will not condemn them alone, but He and the Father together. This is intended too to quiet suspicion, as men did not think the Son worthy to be believed, unless He had the testimony of the Father also.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Si autem tecum est pater, quomodo te misit? Ergo, domine, missio tua, incarnatio tua est. Hic ergo Christus erat secundum carnem, et a patre non recesserat: quia pater et filius ubique erant. Erubesce, Sabelliane: non enim dixit: ego sum pater, et ego ipse sum filius; sed solus non sum, inquit, quia mecum est pater. Distingue ergo personas, distingue intelligentiam; agnosce quia pater pater est, et filius filius est; sed noli dicere: pater maior est, filius minor. Una substantia est, una coaeternitas, perfecta aequalitas. Ergo verum est, inquit, iudicium meum, quia filius Dei sum. Ut tamen intelligas quia mecum est pater, non sic sum filius ut ipsum deseruerim: formam servi accepi; sed formam Dei non amisi. De iudicio dixerat; de testimonio vult dicere; nam sequitur et in lege vestra scriptum est, quia duorum hominum testimonium verum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if the Father is with You, how did He send You? O Lord, Your mission is Your incarnation. Christ was here according to the flesh without withdrawing from the Father, because the Father and the Son are every where. Blush, you Sabellian; our Lord does not say, I am the Father, and I the self-same person am the Son; but, I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. Make a distinction then of persons, and distinction of intelligences: acknowledge that the Father is the Father, the Son the Son: but beware of saying, that the Father is greater, the Son less. Theirs is one substance, one co-eternity, perfect equality. Therefore, He says, My judgment is true, because I am the Son of God. But that you may understand how that the Father is with Me, it is not for the Son ever to leave the Father. I have taken up the form of a servant; but I have not lost the form of God. He had spoken of judgment: now he speaks of witness: It is also written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus contra Faustum</b>: An forte Manichaei calumniantur, quia non ait: in lege Dei, sed in lege vestra scriptum est? Ubi usitatam locutionem Scripturarum quis non cognoscat? Lege enim vestra dixit vobis data, sicut apostolus dicit Evangelium suum, quod se tamen accepisse testatur, non ab homine, sed per revelationem Iesu Christi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Is this made a bad use of by the Manichaeans, that our Lord does not say, in the law of God, but, in your law? Who does not recognize here a manner of speaking customary in Scripture? In your law, i.e. the law given to you. The Apostle speaks of his Gospel in the same way, though he testifies to having received it not from men, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Magnam autem habet quaestionem, et valde videtur in mysterio res esse constituta, ubi Deus dixit: in ore duorum vel trium testium stat omne verbum: fieri enim potest ut duo mentiantur. Susanna casta duobus falsis testibus urgebatur; universus populus mentitus est contra Christum: quomodo ergo accipiendum est in ore duorum vel trium stabit omne verbum, nisi quia hoc modo per mysterium Trinitas commendata est, in qua est perpetua stabilitas veritatis? Accipite ergo nostrum testimonium, ne sentiatis iudicium: differo iudicium, non differo testimonium; unde sequitur ego sum qui testimonium perhibeo de meipso, et testimonium perhibet de me qui misit me, pater.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There is much difficulty, and a great mystery seems to be contained, in God’s words, In the mouth of two or three witnesses, let every word be established. It is possible that two may speak false. The chaste Susannah was arraigned by two false witnesses: the whole people spoke against Christ falsely. How then must we understand the word, By the mouth of two or three witnesses shall every word be established: except as an intimation of the mystery of the Trinity, in which is perpetual stability of truth? Receive then our testimony, lest you feel our judgment. I delay My judgment: I delay not My testimony: I am one that bears witness of Myself, and the Father that sent Me bear witness of Me.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: In multis enim locis pater filio suo perhibet testimonium, ut est illud: ego hodie genui te; item: hic est filius meus dilectus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. In many places the Father bears witness of the Son; as, This day have I begotten You; also, This is My beloved Son.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Si quod dictum est, simpliciter accipiatur, quaestionem habet; nam in hominibus quidem propter hoc determinatum est quod in ore duorum vel trium testium stat omne verbum, quia unus solus non est fide dignus; in Deo autem qualiter utique hoc habebit rationem? Sed et aliter non staret quod dictum est; nam in hominibus cum duo de aliena re testantur, tunc testimonium est verum; hoc enim est duo testari: si vero unus eorum sibi ipsi testetur, non adhuc sunt duo testes. Ad nihil ergo aliud hoc dixit quam ut ostendat se nihil minus patre habentem; alioquin non dixisset ego, et qui misit me, pater. Considera etiam potestatem nihil habentem diminutum a patre: homo enim cum a seipso dignus fuerit fide, testimonio non indiget; sed hoc in aliena re: in propria vero cum testimonio alieno indigeat, non adhuc dignus est fide. Hic vero totum contrarium: etenim in propria re testans, et ab alio testimonium habens, dixit se fide dignum esse.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is written in your law, that the testimony of two men is true. If this is to be taken literally, in what respect does our Lord differ from men? The rule has been laid down for men, on the ground that one man alone is not to be relied on: but how can this be applicable to God? These words are quoted then with another meaning. When two men bear witness, both to an indifferent matter, their witness is true: this constitutes the testimony of two men. But if one of them bear witness to himself, then they are no longer two witnesses. Thus our Lord means to show that He is consubstantial with the Father, and does not need another witness, i.e. besides the Father’s. I and the Father that sent Me. Again, on human principles, when a man bears witness, his honesty is supposed, he is not home witness to; and a man is admitted as a fair and competent witness in an indifferent matter, but not in one relating to himself, unless he is supported by other testimony. But here it is quite otherwise. Our Lord, though giving testimony in His own case, and though saying that He is borne witness to by another, pronounces Himself worthy of belief; thus showing His all-sufficiency. He says He deserves to be believed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel potest sic intelligi quod dicitur, quasi dicat: si vestra lex approbat testimonium duorum hominum qui possent decipi et plura testari; qua ratione meum et patris mei testimonium, quod summa stabilitate firmum est, verum esse non dicitis?
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or it is as if He said, If your law admits the testimony of two men who may be deceived, and testify to more than is true; on what grounds can you reject Mine and My Father’s testimony, the highest and most sure of all?

Some remark that this is said in contumely and contempt; to insinuate either that He is born of fornication, and knows not who His Father is; or as a slur on the low situation of His father, i.e. Joseph; as if to say, Your father is an obscure, ignoble person; why do you so often mention him? So because they asked the question, to tempt Him, not to get at the truth, Jesus answered, You neither know Me, nor My Father.

Quaeret itaque aliquis: quomodo verum est quod dicitur si me sciretis, et patrem meum sciretis: cum Hierosolymitae, quibus dicitur: et me scitis, patrem nesciverunt?

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. You neither know Me, nor My Father: this seems inconsistent with what was said above, You both know Me, and know whence I am. But the latter is spoken in reply to some from Jerusalem, who asked, Do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ? You neither know Me, is addressed to the Pharisees. To the former persons from Jerusalem however He said, He that sent Me is true, Whom you know not. You will ask then, How is that true, If you know Me, you would know My Father also? when they of Jerusalem, to whom He said, You know Me, did Dot know the Father. To this we must reply, that our Savior sometimes speaks of Himself as man, and sometimes as God. You both know Me, He says as man: You neither know Me, as God.

As used by men indeed it is the expression of doubt, but He who knew all things could only mean by that doubt to rebuke unbelief: Nay, even we sometimes say perhaps, when they are certain of a thing, e.g. when you are angry with your slave, and say, Do not you heed me? Consider, perhaps I am your master. So our Lord’s doubt is a reproof to the unbelievers, when He says, You should have known perhaps My Father also.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Oportet autem videre quoniam qui alterius sectae sunt, opinantur ex hoc probari manifeste, Deum quem Iudaei colebant, patrem non esse Christi. Si enim, inquiunt, hoc Pharisaeis Deum provisorem mundi colentibus dicebat salvator, manifestum est, quod patrem Iesu, alterum a conditore mundi existentem, nequaquam Pharisaei noverunt. Hoc vero dicunt, non observantes consuetudinem locutionis in Scripturis. Si enim aliquis vellet inducere ea quae de Deo sunt, a parentibus eruditus, non autem bene vivat; hunc dicimus de Deo notitiam non habere: unde et filii Heli propter eorum malitiam Deum ignorasse dicuntur. Sic igitur et Pharisaei patrem ignoraverunt: non enim vivebant secundum conditoris edictum. Est autem et aliud significatum cognoscendi Deum, altero existente cognoscere dominum quam simpliciter credere. Dicitur enim in Psalmo: studete et videte, quoniam ego sum Deus quis non confitetur hoc scribi populo in conditorem credenti? Multum enim differt credendo cognoscere, et credere tantum. Sed Pharisaeis, quibus ait neque me scitis, neque patrem meum, rationabiliter diceret: neque creditis patri meo: qui enim negat filium, minime patrem habet, scilicet neque secundum fidem, neque secundum cognitionem. Sed et aliter dicit Scriptura, illos qui adiuncti sunt alicui, cognoscere illud. Tunc enim Adam cognovit uxorem suam cum ei coniunctus est. Si ergo qui adhaeret mulieri, mulierem cognoscit; et qui adhaeret domino, unus spiritus est et Deum cognoscit. Si vero sic se habet, Pharisaei nec patrem noverunt nec filium. Post hoc est quidem aliquem cognoscere Deum, non autem cognoscere patrem. Infinitis ergo orationibus editis in lege non invenimus aliquem orando dicentem Deum patrem: tamen orant eum tamquam Deum et dominum: ne praevenirent gratiam per Iesum toti mundo effusam, vocantem cunctos ad filiationem, iuxta illud: narrabo nomen tuum fratribus meis. Sequitur haec verba locutus est Iesus in gazophylacio, docens in templo.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. It is proper to observe, that the followers of other sects think this text proves clearly, that the God, whom the Jews worshipped, was not the Father of Christ. For if, say they, our Savior said this to the Pharisees, who worshipped God as the Governor of the world, it is evident that the Father of Jesus, whom the Pharisees knew not, was a different person from the Creator. But they do not observe that this is a usual manner of speaking in Scripture. Though a man may know the existence of God, and have learned from the Father that He only must be worshipped, yet if his life is not good, he is said not to have the knowledge of God. Thus the sons of Eli, on account of their wickedness, are said not to have known God. And thus again the Pharisees did not know the Father; because they did not live according to their Creator’s command. And there is another thing meant too by knowing God, different from merely believing in Him. It is said, Be still then, and know that I am God. And this, it is certain, was written for a people that believed in the Creator. But to know by believing, and believe simply, are different things. To the Pharisees, to whom He says, You neither know Me, nor My Father, He could with right have said, you do not even believe in My Father; for he who denies the Son, has not the Father, either by faith or knowledge. But Scripture gives us another sense of knowing a thing, viz. being joined to that thing. Adam knew his wife, when he was joined to her. And if he who is joined to a woman knows that woman, he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit, and knows the Lord. And in this sense the Pharisees neither knew the Father, nor the Son. But may not a man know God, and yet not know the Father; Yes; these are two different conceptions. And therefore among an infinite number of prayers offered up in the Law, we do not find any one addressed to God the Father. They only pray to Him as God and Lord; in order not to anticipate the grace shed by Jesus over the-whole world, calling all men to the Sonship, according to the Psalm, I will declare Thy name to my brethren. These words spoke Jesus in the treasury, as He taught in the temple.

Wherefore it follows, And no man laid hands on Him, for His hour was not yet come. Some, when they hear this, think Christ to have been under the control of fate. But if fate comes from the verb fari, to speak, as some derive it, how can the Word of God be under the control of fate? Where are the fates? In the heavens, you say, in the courses and revolutions of the stars. How then can fate have power over Him, by Whom the heavens and stars were made; when even your will, if you exert it aright, transcends the stars? Do you think that because the flesh of Christ was placed beneath the heavens, that therefore His power was subjected to the heavens? His hour then had not yet come; i.e. the hour, not on which he should be obliged to die, but on which He should deign to be put to death.

In this sense then let every one contribute to the edification of the Church, carrying into that spiritual treasury all that he can collect, to the honor of God, and the common good. But while all were thus contributing to the treasury of the temple, it was especially the office of Jews to contribute his gifts, which were the words of eternal life. While Jesus therefore was speaking in the treasury, no one laid hands on Him; His discourse being stronger than those who wished to take Him; for there is no weakness in that which the Word of God utters.

And that you may not think that you shall seek Me in a good sense, I tell you, You shall die in your sin. This is to seek Christ amiss, to die in one’s sin: this is to hate Him, from Whom alone comes salvation. He pronounces sentence on them prophetically, that they shall die in their sins.

But if we fall into wickedness then He says to us, I go away; and when we seek Him, we shall not find Him, but shall die in our sin, die caught in our sin. But we should not pass over without notice the expression itself: You shall die in your sins. If you shall die be understood in the ordinary sense, it is manifest that sinners die in their sins, the righteous in their righteousness. But if we understand it of death in the sense of sin; then the meaning is, that not their bodies, but their souls were sick to death. The Physician seeing them thus grievously sick, says You shall die in your sins. And this is evidently the meaning of the words, Whither I go you cannot come. For or when a man dies in his sin, he cannot go where Jesus goes: no dead man can follow Jesus: The dead praise not You, O Lord.

As then there was a prophetical tradition, that Christ was to be born at Bethlehem, so there may have been a tradition also respecting His death, viz. that He would depart from this life in the way which He declares, No man takes it from Me, I lay it down of Myself: So then the question, Will He kill Himself, is not to be taken in its obvious sense, but as referring to some Jewish tradition about Christ. For His saying, I go My way, shows that He had power over His own death, and departure from the body; so that these were voluntary on His part. But I chink that they bring forward this tradition which had come down to them, on the death of Christ, contemptuously, and not with any view to give Him glory. Will He kill Himself? say they: whereas, they ought to have used a loftier way of speaking, and have said, Will His soul wait His pleasure, to depart from His body? Our Lord answers, You are from beneath, i.e. you love earth; your hearts are not raised upwards,. He speaks to them as earthly men, for their thoughts were earthly.

And again, the love of this world makes a man of this world: whereas he who loves not the world, neither the things that are in the world, is not of the world. Yet is there beyond this world of sense, another world, in which are things invisible the beauty of which shall the pure in heart behold, yes, the First-born of every creature may be called the world, insomuch as He is absolute wisdom, and in wisdom all things were made. In Him therefore was the whole world, differing from the material world, in so far as the scheme divested of the matter, differs from the subject matter itself. The soul of Christ then says, I am not of this world; i.e. because it has not its conversation in this world.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Exposuit autem dominus quid intelligi voluerit, cum dixit vos de hoc mundo estis; quia scilicet peccatores erant. Omnes autem cum peccato nati sumus, omnes vivendo ad id quod nati eramus addidimus. Tota ergo infelicitas Iudaeorum ipsa erat, non peccatum habere, sed in peccatis mori; unde subdit dixi ergo vobis, quia moriemini in peccatis vestris. Credo autem in illa multitudine quae dominum audiebat, et eos fuisse qui credituri erant; quasi in omnes autem processerat illa severissima sententia in peccato vestro moriemini; ac per hoc et illis qui credituri erant, spes erat ablata. Revocavit ergo eos ad spem, adiungens si enim non credideritis quia ego sum, moriemini in peccato vestro. Ergo si credideritis quia ego sum, non moriemini in peccato vestro.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord expresses His meaning in the words, You are of this world, i.e. you are sinners. All of us are born in sin; all have added by our actions to the sin in which we were born. The misery of the Jews then was, not that they had sin, but that they would die in their sin: I said; therefore to you, that you shall die in your sin. Amongst the multitude, however, who heard our Lord, there were some who were about to believe; whereas this most severe sentence had gone forth against all: You shall die in your sin; to the destruction of all hope even in those who should hereafter believe. So His next words recall the latter to hope: For if you believe not that I am He, you shall die in your sin: therefore if you believe that I am He, you shall not die in your sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si enim propter hoc venit ut peccatum tollat, et aliter non contingit illud exuere nisi per lavacrum; nec continget eum qui non credit, baptizari, necesse est eum qui non credit, ex hac vita abire, veterem hominem, idest peccatum, habentem: non solum quia non credit, sed etiam quia priora peccata habens, hinc recedit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For if He came in order to take away sin, and a man cannot put that off, except by washing, and cannot be baptized except he believe; it follows, that he who believers not must pass out of this life, with the old man, i.e. sin, within him: not only because he believes not, but because he departs hence, with his former sins upon him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Cum autem dixit si non credideritis quia ego sum, quia nihil addidit, multum est quod commendavit: quia sic etiam et Deus Moysi dixerat: ego sum qui sum. Sed quomodo audio: ego sum qui sum, et nisi credideritis quia ego sum, quasi alia non sint? Sed prorsus qualiscumque excellentia, si mutabilis est, vera non est: non enim est ibi verum esse ubi est et non esse. Discute rerum mutationem: invenies fuit et erit; cogita Deum, invenies est, ubi tempus praeteritum esse non possit. Ut ergo tu sis, transcende tempus. Haec itaque promittens, ne moriamur in peccatis nostris, nihil aliud mihi videtur his verbis dixisse nisi credideritis quia ego sum, quam: nisi credideritis quia Deus sum. Deo gratias, quia dicit nisi credideritis; non dixit: nisi ceperitis: quis enim hoc capiat?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. His saying, If you believe not that I am, without adding any thing, proves a great deal. For thus it was that God spoke to Moses, I am that I am. But how do I understand, I am that I am, and, If you believe not that I am? In this way. All excellence, of whatever kind, if it be mutable, cannot be said really to be, for there is no real to be, where there is a not to be. Analyze the idea of mutability, and you will find, was, and will be; contemplate God, and you will find is, without possibility of a past. In order to be, you must leave him behind you. So then, If you believe not that I am, means in fact, If you believe not that I am God; this being the condition, on which we shall not die in our sins. God be thanked that He says, If you believe not, not, If you understand not; for who could understand this?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Manifestum est autem quod qui moritur in peccatis suis, quamvis dicat se Christo credere, tamen in veritate non credit: qui enim credit iustitiae, non iniustum facit; et credens in sapientiam, nil stultum dicit aut facit: et sic si scrutatus fueris ceteros intellectus Christi, invenies quomodo qui non credit Christo, moritur in peccatis suis. Accedens autem ad contraria eorum quae considerantur in Christo, in peccatis suis moritur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. It is manifest, that he, who dies in his sins, though he say that he believes in Christ, does not really believe. For he who believes in His justice does not do injustice; he who believes in His wisdom, does not act or speak foolishly; in like manner with respect to the other attributes of Christ, you will find that he who does not believe in Christ, dies in his sins: inasmuch as he comes to be the very contrary of what is seen in Christ.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quia dixerat supra dominus: nisi credideritis quia ego sum, moriemini in peccatis vestris, interrogant illi velut quaerentes nosse in quem deberent credere, ne in suo peccato morerentur; unde dicitur dicebant ergo ei: tu quis es? Non enim cum dixisti nisi credideritis quia ego sum, addidisti quis esses. Sciebat autem ibi quosdam esse credituros; et ideo cum dixissent tu quis es? Ut scirent quid illum credere deberent, dixit eis Iesus principium, qui et loquor vobis; non tamquam diceret: principium sum; sed tamquam diceret: principium me credite: quod in sermone Graeco evidenter apparet, ubi principium feminini generis est. Principium ergo me credite, ne moriamini in peccatis vestris: principium enim mutari non potest, in se manet, et innovat omnia. Absurdum est autem ut filium dicamus principium, et patrem principium non dicamus; non tamen duo principia, sicut nec duos deos: spiritus autem sanctus patris et filii est spiritus, nec pater est, nec filius. Pater tamen et filius et spiritus sanctus sunt unus Deus, unum lumen, unum principium. Addidit autem qui et loquor vobis: quia humilis propter vos factus ad ista verba descendi. Ergo credite me esse principium: quia ut hoc credatis non solum sum principium, sed et loquor vobis. Nam si principium sicuti est, ita maneret apud patrem, ut non acciperet formam servi, quomodo ei crederent, cum infirma corda intelligibile verbum sine voce sensibili audire non possent?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord having said, You believe not that I am, you shall die in your sins; they inquire of Him, as if wishing to, know in whom they are to believe, that they might not die in their sin: Then said they to Him, Who are You? For when you said, If you believe not that I am, you did not add, who you are. But our Lord knew that these were some who would believe, and therefore after being asked, Who are You? that such might know what they should believe Him to be, Jesus said to them, The beginning, who also speak to you; not as if to say, I am the beginning, but, Believe Me to be the beginning; as is evident from the Greek, where beginning is feminine. Believe Me then to be the beginning but you die in your sins: for the beginning cannot be changed; it remains fixed in itself, and is the source of change to all things. But it is absurd to call the Son the beginning, and not the Father also. And yet there are not two beginnings, even as these are not two Gods. The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Father and the Son; not being either the Father, or the Son. Yet Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are one God, one Light, one beginning. He adds, Who also speak to you, i.e. Who humbled Myself for your sakes, and condescended to those words. Therefore believe Me to be the beginning; because that you may believe this, not only am I the beginning but I also speak with you, that you may believe that I am. For if the Beginning had remained with the Father in its original nature, and not taken upon it the form of a servant, how, could men have believed in it? Would their weakly minds have taken in the spiritual Word, without the medium of sensible sound?

From the beginning I speak with you; as if to say, you do not deserve to hear any thing from Me, much less this thing, Who I am. For you speak always, to tempt Me.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. When our Lord said, He is true that sent Me, the Jews did not understand that He spoke to them of the Father. But He saw some there, who, He knew, would believe on Him after His passion. Then said Jesus to them, When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am. Recollect the words, I am that I am, and you will know why I say, I am. I pass over your knowledge, in order that I may fulfill My passion. In your appointed time you will know who I am; when you have lifted up the Son of man. He means the lifting up of the cross; for He was lifted up on the cross, when He hung thereon. This was to be accomplished by the hands of those who should afterwards believe, whom He is now speaking to; with what intent, but that no one, however great his wickedness and consciousness of guilt might despair, seeing even the murderers of our Lord forgiven.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter continua: quia multa signa faciens et docens eos non converterat, de cruce de reliquo loquitur, dicens cum exaltaveritis filium hominis, tunc cognoscetis quia ego sum; quasi dicat: vos aestimatis quod tunc maxime a me separati eritis quando me occideritis; ego autem dico quoniam tunc maxime scietis et gratia signorum et resurrectionis et captivitatis vestrae, quoniam ego sum Christus filius Dei, et quod non contrarior illi; propter quod subdit et a meipso nihil facio; sed sicut docuit me pater, sic loquor: per hoc enim indifferentiam substantiae manifestat, et quod nihil extra paternales intelligentias loquitur; si enim Deo contrarius essem, non tantam iram movissem contra eos qui me non audierunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or the connection is this: When His miracles and teaching had failed to convert men, He spoke of the cross; When you have lifted up the Son of man, then you shall know that I am He: as if to say, you think that you have killed Me; but I say that you shall then, by the evidence of miracles, of My resurrection, and your captivity, know most especially, that I am Christ the Son of God, and that I do not act in opposition to God; But that as My Father has taught Me, I speak these things. Here He shows the likeness of His substance to the Father’s; and that He says nothing beyond the Paternal intelligence. If I were contrary to God, I should not have moved His anger so much against those who did not hear Me.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Quia dixerat tunc cognoscetis quia ego sum, et ad ipsum esse pertinet tota Trinitas; ne forte subintraret error Sabellianorum, continuo subiunxit et a meipso facio nihil; quasi dicat: a meipso non sum: filius enim de patre est Deus. Quod ergo addidit sicut docuit me pater, haec loquor, nemini vestrum obrepat cogitatio carnalis. Nolite vobis quasi duos homines ante oculos ponere, et loquentem patrem ad filium, sicut facis tu quando aliqua verba dicis filio tuo. Quae enim verba fierent unico verbo? Si autem loquitur in cordibus vestris sine sono, quomodo loquitur filio suo? Incorporaliter pater locutus est filio, quia incorporaliter pater genuit filium; nec eum sic docuit quasi indoctum genuerit; sed hoc est eum docuisse, quod est scientem genuisse. Si enim simplex est natura veritatis, hoc est filio esse quod nosse. Quemadmodum ergo pater illi gignendo dedit ut esset, sic gignendo dedit ut nosset.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: Having said, Then shall you know that I am, and in this, I am, implied the whole Trinity: lest the Sabellian error should creep in, He immediately adds, And I do nothing of Myself; as if to say, I am not of Myself; the Son is God from the Father. Let not what follows, as the Father has taught Me, I speak these things, suggest a carnal thought to any of you. Do not place as it were two men before your eyes, a Father speaking to his son, as you do when you speak to your sons. For what words could be spoken to the only Word? If the Father speaks in your hearts without sound, how does he speak to the Son? The Father speaks to the Son incorporeally, because He begat the Son incorporeally: not did He teach Him, as having begotten Him untaught; rather the teaching Him, was the begetting Him knowing. For if the nature of truth be simple, to be, in the Son, is the same as to know. As then the Father gave the Son existence by begetting, so He gave Him knowledge also.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He gives now a humbler turn to the discourse: And He that sent Me. That this might not be thought however to imply inferiority, He says, Is with Me. The former is His dispensation, the latter His divinity.

Misit itaque pater filium, sed non recessit a filio; unde sequitur et non reliquit me solum: non enim quo misit filium, non ibi erat pater, qui dixit: caelum et terram ego impleo. Sed quare eum non dereliquit, subdit quia quae placita sunt ei facio semper; non ex quodam initio, sed sine initio, sine fine: Dei enim generatio non habet initium temporis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And though both are together, yet one is sent, the other sends. For the mission is the incarnation; and the incarnation is of the Son only, not of the Father. He says then, He that sent Me, meaning, By whose Fatherly authority I am made incarnate. The Father however, though He sent the Son, did not withdraw from Him, as He proceeds to say: The Father has not left Me alone. For it could not be that where He sent the Son, there the Father was not, He who says, If in heaven and earth. And He adds the reason why He did not leave Him: For I do always those things that please Him; always, i.e. not from any particular beginning, but without beginning and without end. For the generation from the Father has no beginning in time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Quia continuo dicebant, quoniam non ex Deo est, et quia sabbatum non custodit; contra est, quod ait quoniam quae placita sunt ei facio semper: ostendens quoniam et solvere sabbatum, placitum est ei. Multipliciter enim studet ut ostendat quod nihil facit patri contrarium. Et quia hoc humanius locutus est, subditur haec illo loquente multi crediderunt in eum: ac si diceret Evangelista: ne turberis si quid humile a Christo audieris; qui enim post tantam doctrinam nondum suasi erant, humiliora audiunt, et suadentur. Igitur crediderunt quidem, sed non ut oportebat; sed simpliciter quasi laetantes et requiescentes in verborum humilitate: et hoc ostendit Evangelista in subsequentibus sermonibus, in quibus narratur quod rursus ei iniuriabantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, He means it as an answer to those who were constantly saying that He was not from God, and that because He did not keep the sabbath; I do always, He says, do those things that please Him; showing that the breaking the sabbath even was pleasing to Him. He takes care in every way to show that He does nothing contrary to the Father. And as this was speaking more after a human fashion, the Evangelist adds, As He spoke these words many believed in Him; as if to say, Do not be disturbed at hearing so humble a speech from Christ; for those who had heard the greatest doctrines from Him, and were not persuaded, were persuaded by these words of humility. These then believed on Him, yet not as they ought; but only out of joy, and approbation of His humble way of speaking. And this the Evangelist shows in his subsequent narration, which relates their unjust proceedings towards Him.

Our Lord wished to try the faith of those who believed, that it might not be only a superficial belief: Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed in Him, If you continue in My word, then are you My disciples indeed. His saying, if you continue, made it manifest what was in their hearts. He knew that some believed, and would not continue.

Nor because we speak with authority, are we therefore masters; but He is the Master of all, Who dwells in the hearts of all. It is a small thing for the disciple to come to Him in the first instance: he must continue in Him: if we continue not in Him, we shall fall. A little sentence this, but a great work; if you continue. For what is it to continue in God’s word, but to yield to no temptations.

Si ergo permaneatur in eo quod creditur, pervenitur ad id quod videtur, ut scilicet contemplemur ipsam veritatem sicuti est, non per verba sonantia, sed per lucem splendentem. Veritas incommutabilis est, panis est mentis; reficit, nec deficit; mutat vescentem, non ipsa in vescentem mutatur. Ipsa autem veritas verbum Dei est: haec veritas carne induta est propter nos: latebat in carne, non ut negaretur, sed ut differretur; ut in carne pateretur, ut caro peccati redimeretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if to say: Whereas you have now belief, by continuing, you shall have sight. For it was not their knowledge which made them believe, but rather their belief which gave them knowledge. Faith is to believe that which you see not: truth to see that which you believe? By continuing then to believe a thing, you come at last to see the thing; i.e. to the contemplation of the very truth as it is; not conveyed in words, but revealed by light. The truth is unchangeable; it is the bread of the soul, refreshing others, without diminution to itself; changing him who eats into itself; itself not changed. This truth is the Word of God, which put on flesh for our sakes, and lay hid, not meaning to bury itself, but only to defer its manifestation, till its suffering in the body, for the ransoming of the body of sin, had taken place.

Indeed if they had been disturbed at His former saying, they had much more reason to be so now. For they might argue; If He says we shall know the truth, He must mean that we do not know it now: so then the law is a lie, our knowledge a delusion. But their thoughts took no such direction: their grief is wholly worldly; they know of no other servitude, but that of this world: They answered Him, We be Abraham’s seed, and were never in bondage to any man. How say you then, we shall be made free? As if to say, They of Abraham’s stock are free, and ought not to be called slaves: we have never been in bondage to any one.

But how could they say with truth, taking only secular bondage into account, that we have never been in bondage to any man? Was not Joseph sold? were not the holy prophets carried into captivity? Ungrateful people! Why does God remind you so continually of His having taken you out of the house of bondage if you never were in bondage?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ then, who speaks for their good, not to gratify their vainglory, explains His meaning to have been that they were the servants not of men, but of sin, the hardest kind of servitude, from which God only can rescue: Jesus answered them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Whosoever commits sin is the servant of sin.

Nam hoc verbum amen Hebraeum est: non est autem interpretatum, ut honorem haberet velamento secreti: non ut esset ligatum, sed ne vilesceret nudatum. Iam quantum hoc commendatum sit, ex ipsa geminatione cognoscite. Verum dico vobis. Veritas dicit; quae utique etsi non diceret: verum dico, mentiri omnino non posset; tamen inculcat, dormientes quodammodo excitat: contemni non vult quod dicit. Omnis, inquit, Iudaeus, Graecus, dives, pauper, imperator et mendicus, si facit peccatum, servus est peccati.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This asseveration is important: it is, if one may say so, His oath. Amen means true, but is not translated. Neither the Greek nor the Latin Translator have dared to translate it. It is a Hebrew word; and men have abstained from translating it, in order to throw a reverential veil over so mysterious a word: not that they wished to lock it up, but only to prevent it from becoming despised by being exposed. How important the word is, you may see from its being repeated. Verily I say to you, says Verity itself; which could not be, even though it said not verily. Our Lord however has recourse to this mode of enforcing His words, in order to rouse men from their state of sleep and indifference. Whosoever, He said, commits sin, whether Jew or Greek, rich or poor, king or beggar, is the servant of sin.

Solus de peccato liberare potest qui venit sine peccato, et factus est sacrificium pro peccato; nam sequitur servus autem non manet in domo in aeternum. Ecclesia est domus, servus peccator est: multi intrant in Ecclesiam peccatores. Non ergo dixit servus non est in domo, sed non manet in domo in aeternum. Si ergo nullus ibi servus erit, quis ibi erit? Quis gloriabitur mundum se esse a peccato? Multum nos terruit; sed adiungit filius autem manet in aeternum. Ergo solus in domo sua erit Christus. An forte in hoc quod dicit filius, caput et corpus est? Non enim sine causa terruit et spem dedit; terruit, ne peccatum amaremus; spem dedit, ne de peccati absolutione diffideremus. Haec est ergo spes nostra ut a libero liberemur: ipse enim pretium dedit, non argentum, sed sanguinem suum; et propter hoc subditur si ergo filius vos liberaverit, vere liberi eritis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. O miserable bondage! The slave of a human master when wearied with the hardness of his tasks, sometimes takes refuge in flight. But whither does the slave of sin flee? He takes it along with him, wherever he goes; for his sin is within him. The pleasure passes away, but the sin does not pass away: its delight goes, its sting remains behind. He alone can free from sin, who came without sin, and was made a sacrifice for sin. And thus it follows: The servant abides not in the house for ever. The Church is the house: the servant is the sinner; and many sinners enter into the Church. So He does not say, The servant is, not in the house; but, The servant abides not in the house for ever. If a time then is to come, when there shall be no servant in the house; who will there be there? Who will boast that he is pure from sin? Christ’s are fearful words. But He adds, The Son abides for ever. So then Christ will live alone in His house. Or does not the word Son, imply both the body and the head? Christ purposely alarms us first, and then gives us hope. He alarms us, that we may not love sin; He gives us hope, that we may not despair of the absolution of our sin. Our hope then is this, that we shall be freed by Him who is free. He has paid the price for us, not in money, but in His own blood: If the Son therefore shall make you free, you shall be free indeed.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The first stage of freedom’ is, the abstaining from sin. But that is only incipient, it is not perfect freedom: for the flesh still lusts against the spirit, so that you do not do the things that you would. Full and perfect freedom will only be, when the contest is over, and the last enemy, death, is destroyed.

Filius manet in aeternum. Domus mentionem facit, patris principatum domum nominans, ostendens ex translatione humanorum, quoniam sicut dominus in domo, ita ipse omnium potestatem habet: hoc enim quod dicit non manet, significat: non habet potestatem donandi; sed filius, qui est dominus domus, habet. Et ideo sacerdotes veteris legis non habebant potestatem per sacramenta legalia peccata dimittere: omnes enim peccaverunt, etiam sacerdotes, qui pro seipsis, ut dicit apostolus, necesse habebant sacrificia offerre; sed filius hanc habet potestatem; unde concludit si ergo filius vos liberaverit, vere liberi eritis: ostendens quod mundana libertas, de qua gloriabantur, non est vera libertas.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>, Or thus: Having said that whosoever commits sin, is the servant of sin, He anticipates the answer that their sacrifices saved them, by saying, The servant abides not in the house for ever, but the Son abides ever. The house, He says, meaning the Father’s house on high; in which, to draw a comparison from the world, He Himself had all the power, just as a man has all the power in his own house. Abides not, means, has not the power of giving; which the Son, who is the master of the house, has. The priests of the old law had not the power of remitting sins by the sacraments of the law; for all were sinners. Even the priests, who, as the Apostle says, were obliged to offer up sacrifices for themselves. But the Son has this power; and therefore our Lord concludes: If the Son shall make you free, you shall be free indeed; implying that that earthly freedom, of which men boasted so much, was not true freedom.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Noli ergo libertate abuti ad libere peccandum; sed utere ad non peccandum: erit enim voluntas tua libera, si fuerit pia; eris liber, si fueris servus iustitiae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Do not then abuse your freedom, for the purpose of sinning freely; but use it in order not to sin at all. Your will will be free, if it be merciful: you will be free, if you become the servant of righteousness.

He thus removes them by degrees out of their relationship to Abraham, teaching them not to pride themselves so much upon it: for that, as bondage and freedom were the consequences of works, so was relationship.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Also another reading has; And, do you do what you have heard from the Father. All that was written in the Law and the Prophets they had heard from the Father. He who takes this reading, may use it to prove against them who hold otherwise, that the God who gave the Law and the Prophets, was none other than Christ’s Father. And we use it too as an answer to those who maintain two original natures in men, and explain the words, My word has no place in you, to mean that these were by nature incapable of receiving the word. How could those be of an incapable nature, who had heard from the Father? And how again could they be of a blessed nature, who sought to kill our Savior, and would not receive His words. They answered and said to Him, Abraham is our father. This answer of the Jews is a great falling off from our Lord’s meaning. He had referred to God, but they take Father in the sense of the father of their nature, Abraham.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Vel dicendum, quod supra in Graeco habetur: scio quod semen Abrahae estis. Ut ergo haec pateant, videamus primo corporalis seminis et filii differentiam. Manifestum enim est quod semen in seipso habet rationes eius cuius est semen, adhuc manentes et pausantes; filius vero, transmutato semine, et agente in appositam sibi materiam a muliere, per superinducta nutrimenta similitudinem accipit generantis: et quantum ad corporalia si aliquis est filius alicuius, subsistit ex semine; si vero aliquod est semen, non omnino filius efficitur. Quoniam autem ex operibus iudicantur aliqui semen Abrahae, videndum est ne forte ex aliquibus seminalibus rationibus, infusis quibusdam animabus, oporteat imaginari eos qui semen sunt Abrahae. Non omnes igitur homines semen sunt Abrahae: neque enim omnes habent huiusmodi rationes consitas in eorum animabus. Oportet igitur eum qui Abrahae semen est, eius fieri per similitudinem et filium. Possibile vero est ex negligentia et otio destruere hoc quod est eius semen. Hi autem ad quos sermo erat, adhuc in spe erant: unde sciebat Iesus quod adhuc semen erant Abrahae, et nondum peremerant possibilitatem fiendi filii Abrahae: propter quod eis dicit si filii Abrahae estis, opera Abrahae facite. Si autem super hoc quod erant semen Abrahae, ad augmentum magnitudinis adolevissent, verbum Iesu caperent. Sed quia non accesserant ad hoc quod essent filii, verbum non capiunt, sed interficere volunt verbum, et quasi confringere, non capientes magnitudinem eius. Si igitur aliquis vestrum semen est Abrahae, et adhuc verbum Dei non capit, non quaerat interficere verbum; sed transmutet se ad hoc quod sit filius Abrahae, et tunc poterit capere filium Dei. Quidam autem unum ex operibus eligunt Abrahae, illud scilicet: credidit Abraham Deo, et reputatum est illi ad iustitiam. Ut autem concedatur eis quod fides sit opus, cur non dictum est singulariter: opus Abrahae facite, sed pluraliter? Puto enim quod hoc dictum aequipollet ei quod est: cuncta opera Abrahae facite; ut tamen ex historia Abrahae allegorice sumpta opera eius spiritualiter prosequamur. Neque enim oportet eum qui vult esse filius Abrahae, adire ancillarum coniugia, nec post obitum coniugis in senectute aliam ducere coniugem. Sequitur nunc autem quaeritis me interficere, hominem qui veritatem locutus sum vobis.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or we may explain the difficulty thus. Above it is in the Greek, I know that you are Abraham’s seed. So let us examine whether there is not a difference between a bodily seed and a child. It is evident that a seed contains in itself all the proportions of him whose seed it is, as yet however dormant, and waiting to be developed; when the seed first has changed and molded the material it meets within the woman, derived nourishment from thence and gone through a process in the womb, it becomes a child, the likeness of its begetter. So then a child is formed from the seed: but the seed is not necessarily a child. Now with reference to those who are from their works judged to be the seed of Abraham, may we not conceive that they are so from certain seminal proportions implanted in their souls? All men are not the seed of Abraham, for all have not these proportions implanted in their souls. But he who is the seed of Abraham, has yet to become his child by likeness. And it is possible for him by negligence and indolence even to cease to be the seed. But those to whom these words were addressed, were not yet cut off from hope: and therefore Jesus acknowledged that they were as yet the seed of Abraham, and had still the power of becoming children of Abraham. So He says, If you are the children of Abraham, do the works of Abraham. If as the seed of Abraham, they had attained to their proper sign and growth, they would have taken in our Lord’s words. But not having grown to be children, they cared not; but wish to kill the Word, and as it were break it in pieces, since it was too great for them to take in. If any of you then be the seed of Abraham, and as yet do not take in the word of God, let him not seek to kill the word; but rather change himself into being a son of Abraham, and then he will be able to take in the Son of God. Some select one of the works of Abraham, viz. that in Genesis, And Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him for righteousness. But even granting to them that faith is a work, if this were so, why was it not, Do the work of Abraham: using the singular number, instead of the plural? The expression as it stands is, I think, equivalent to saying, Do all the works of Abraham: i.e. in the spiritual sense, interpreting Abraham’s history allegorically. For it is not incumbent on one, who would be a son of Abraham, to marry his maidservants, or after his wife’s death, to marry another in his old age. But now you seek to kill Me, a man that has told you the truth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hanc scilicet veritatem, quod est patri aequalis; propter hoc enim Iudaei quaerebant eum interficere. Et ut ostendat quod hoc non est contrarium patri, subdit quam audivi a Deo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This truth, that is, that He was equal to the Father: for it was this that moved the Jews to kill Him. To show, however, that this doctrine is not opposed to the Father, He adds, Which I have heard from God.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. To kill Me, He says, a man. I say nothing now of the Son of God, nothing of the Word, because the Word cannot die; I speak only of that which you see. It is in your power to kill that which you see, and offend Him Whom you see not. This did not Abraham.

Sed dicendum, quod in temporibus Abrahae natus fuerat homo, qui quam audierat a domino veritatem, dicebat; non tamen quaesitus est ab Abraham, ut eum occideret. Et scias quod spiritualis adventus Iesu nullo tempore defuit sanctis. Ex hoc igitur comprehendo, omnem hominem, qui post regenerationem et ceteras apud se factas divinitus gratias, peccat, denuo crucifigere Dei filium propriis reatibus, in quos rediit; sed hoc Abraham non fecit. Sequitur vos facitis opera patris vestri.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. It might seem to some, that it were superfluous to say that Abraham did not this; for it were impossible that it should be; Christ was not born at that time. But we may remind them, that in Abraham’s time there was a man born who spoke the truth, which he heard from God, and that this man’s life was not sought for by Abraham. Know too that the Saints were never without the spiritual advent of Christ. I understand then from this passage, that every one who, after regeneration, and other divine graces bestowed upon him, commits sin, does by this return to evil incur the guilt of crucifying the Son of God, which Abraham did not do. You do the works of your father.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord says this with a view to put down their vain boasting of their descent; and persuade them to rest their hopes of salvation no longer on the natural relationship, but on the adoption. For this it was which prevented them from coming to Christ; viz. their thinking that their relationship to Abraham was sufficient for their salvation.

Cum enim prius dixissent: pater noster Abraham est, et audissent: si filii Abrahae estis, opera Abrahae facite, fatentur se habere maiorem patrem quam Abraham, scilicet Deum, et non ex fornicatione sumpsisse exordium. Non enim ex sponsa, sed ex meretrice, seu materia, Daemon, qui nihil facit ex se, producit eos qui carnalibus usi inhaerent materiae.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or their sonship to Abraham having been disproved, they reply by bitterly insinuating, that our Savior was the offspring of adultery. But perhaps the tone of the answer is disputatious, more than any thing else. For whereas they have said shortly before, We have Abraham for our father, and had been told in reply, If you are Abraham’s children, do the works of Abraham; they declare in return that they have a greater Father than Abraham, i.e. God; and that they were not derived from fornication. For the devil, who has no power of creating any thing from himself, begets not from a spouse, but a harlot, i.e. matter, those who give themselves up to carnal things, that is, cleave to matter.

Yet true it was, that many of them were born of fornication, for people then used to form unlawful connections. But this is not the thing our Lord has in view.

Non utique dici potest idipsum esse ex Deo exire, quod venisse. Sed cum ab his qui sibi Deum patrem dicerent, idcirco se diligendum ait, quia ex Deo exiisset; causam dilectionis ex causa docuit esse nascendi. Exiisse enim ad incorporalis nativitatis retulit nomen: quia religio profitendi sibi patrem Deum, ex dilectione Christi, qui ex eo genitus est, merenda sit. Nec enim in Deum patrem fit religiosus qui non diligit filium, cum diligendi filii non alia causa sit quam quod ex Deo sit. Ex Deo igitur filius est, non adventu, sed nativitate. Dilectio autem in patrem hinc erit omnis, si filius ex eo esse credatur.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. It was not that the Son of God condemned the assumption of so religious a name; that is, condemned them for professing to be the sons of God, and calling God the Father; but that He blamed the rash presumption of the Jews in claiming God for their Father, when they did not love the Son. For I proceeded forth, and came from God. To proceed forth is not the same with to come. When our Lord says that those who called God their Father, ought to love Him, because He came forth from God, He means that His being born of God was the reason why He should be loved: the proceeding forth, having reference to His incorporeal birth. Their claim to be the sons of God, was to be made good by their loving Christ, Who was begotten from God. For a true worshiper of God the Father must love the Son, as being from God. And he only can love the Father, who believes that the Son is from Him.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic ergo, quod de Deo processit verbum, aeterna processio est: ab illo enim processit ut verbum patris, et venit ad nos, quia verbum caro factum est. Adventus eius, humanitas eius; mansio eius, divinitas eius. Dicitis Deum patrem, cognoscite me vel fratrem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This then is the eternal procession, the proceeding forth of the Word from God: from Him. It proceeded as the Word of the Father, and came to us: The Word was made flesh.

Si ergo verum est quod hic dicitur si Deus pater vester esset, diligeretis me, palam est quoniam et recte convertitur: si non diligeretis, nequaquam Deus pater vester esset. Paulus autem aliquo tempore non diligebat Iesum: fuit ergo tempus quo Deus pater Pauli non extitit. Non igitur natura Paulus Dei filius fuit, sed postmodum Dei filius factus est. Quando vero Deus alicuius fit pater, nisi quando mandata eius custodit?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. This was said, I think, in allusion to some who came without being sent by the Father, of whom it is said in Jeremiah, I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran. Some, however, use this passage to prove the existence of two natures. To these we may reply, Paul hated Jesus when he persecuted the Church of God, at the time, viz. that our Lord said, Why persecute you Me? Now if it is true, as is here said, If God were your Father, you would love Me; the converse is true, If you do not love Me, God is not your Father. And Paul for some time did not love Jesus. There was a time when God was not Paul’s father. Paul therefore was not by nature the son of God, but afterwards was made so. And when does God become any one’s Father, except when he keeps His commandments?

Here we must guard against the heresy of the Manicheans, who hold a certain original nature of evil, and a nation of darkness with princes at their head, whence the devil derives his existence. And thence they say our flesh is produced; and in this way interpret our Lord’s speech, You are of your father the devil: viz. to mean that they were by nature evil, drawing their origin from the opposite seed of darkness.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. And this seems to be the same mistake, as if one said, that an eye which saw right was different in kind from an eye which saw wrong. For just as in these there is no difference of kind, only one of them for some reason sees wrong; so, in the other case, whether a man receives a doctrine, or whether he does not, he is of the same nature.

You are his children then, because you have such lusts, not because you are born of him: for you seek to kill Me, a man that has told you the truth: and he envied man, and killed him: he was a murderer from the beginning; i.e. of the first man on whom a murder could be committed: man could not he slain, before man was created. The devil did not go, girt with a sword, against man: he sowed an evil word, and slew him. Do not suppose therefore that you are not guilty of murder, when you suggest evil thoughts to your brother. The very reason why you rage against the flesh, is that you cannot assault the soul.

Huic sententiae quisquis acquiescit, non cum Manichaeis sapit, ut suam quamdam propriam, tamquam ex adverso quodam principio, Diabolus habeat naturam mali; qui tanta vanitate desipiunt, ut non attendant non dixisse dominum: a veritate alienus fuit; sed in veritate non stetit; ubi a veritate lapsum intelligi voluit. Illud etiam quod ait Ioannes: ab initio Diabolus peccat, hoc intelligunt, si naturale est, nullo modo esse peccatum. Sed quid respondetur propheticis testimoniis? Sive quod ait Isaias sub figurata persona principis Babyloniae Diabolum notans: quomodo cecidit Lucifer, qui mane oriebatur? Sive quod Ezechiel: in deliciis Paradisi Dei fuisti: quae si aliter convenientius intelligi nequeunt, oportet ut quod dictum est, in veritate non stetit, sic accipiamus, quod in veritate fuerit, sed non permanserit; et illud quod ab initio Diabolus peccat, non ab initio ex quo creatus est, peccare putandus est, sed ab initio peccati: coepit enim in ipso peccatum, et ipse initium peccati fuit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But it will be objected perhaps, that if from the beginning of his existence, the devil stood not in the truth, he was never in a state of blessedness with the holy angels, refusing, as he did, to be subject to his Creator, and therefore false and deceitful; unwilling at the cost of pious subjection to hold that which by nature he was; and attempting in his pride and loftiness to simulate that which he was not. This opinion is not the same with that of the Manichaeans, that the devil has his own peculiar nature, derived as it were from the opposite principle of evil. This foolish sect does not see that our Lord says not, Was alien from the truth, but Stood not in the truth, meaning, fell from the truth. And thus they interpret John, The devil sins from the beginning, not seeing that if sin is natural, it is no sin. But what do the testimonies of the prophets reply? Isaiah, setting forth the devil under the figure of the prince of Babylon, says, How are you fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the morning! Ezekiel says, You have been in Eden, the garden of God. Which passages, as they cannot be interpreted in any other way, show that we must take the word, He stood not in the truth, to mean, that he was in truth, but did not remain in it; and the other, that the devil sins from the beginning, to mean, that he was a sinner not from the beginning of his creation, but from the beginning of sin. For sin began in him, and he was the beginning of sin.

Causa igitur cur Diabolus veritatem non colat, subditur quia veritas non est in eo: scilicet quod vana suspicatur et seductus est ipse a seipso: in hoc deterior, quod illi quidem ab eo falluntur, is autem sibi ipsi deceptionis auctor existit. Sed oportet investigare quomodo dicitur, quod veritas in ipso non est: utrum quia nullam unquam veram habet doctrinam, sed cuncta quae opinatur, falsa sunt; vel quia Christi particeps non est, qui dixit: ego sum veritas. Impossibile autem est aliquam rationalem substantiam de cunctis opinari falso, et de nullo vel exiliter rectitudinem conspicere.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. There is only one way of standing in the truth; many and various of not standing in it. Some try to stand in the truth, but their feet tremble and shake so, they cannot. Others are not come to that pass, but are in danger of it, as we read in the Psalms, My feet were almost gone: others fall from it. Because the truth is not in him, is the reason why the devil did not stand in the truth. He imagined vain things, and deceived himself; wherein He was so far worse than others, in that, while others are deceived by him, he was the author of his own deception. But farther; does the truth is not in him, mean that he holds no true doctrine, and that every thing he thinks is false; or that he is not a member of Christ, who says, I am the truth? Now it is impossible that any rational being should think falsely on every subject and never be even ever so slightly right in opinion. The devil therefore may hold a true doctrine, by the mere law of his rational nature: and therefore his nature is not contrary to truth, i.e. does not consist of simple error and ignorance; otherwise he could never have known the truth.

But our Lord calls the devil the father of a lie for this reason: Every one who lies is not the father of his own lie; for you may tell a lie, which you have received from another; in which ease you have lied, but are not the father of the lie. But the lie wherewith, as with a serpent’s bite, the devil slew man, had no source but himself: and therefore he is the father of a lie, as God is the Father of the truth.

Here then our Lord means by the father of the Jews, Cain; whom they wished to imitate, by killing the Savior: for he it was who set the first example of murdering a brother.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. God seeks Christ’s s glory, in every one of those who receive Him: which glory He finds in those who cultivate the seeds of virtue implanted in them. And those in whom He finds not His Son’s glory, He punishes: There is one that seeks and judges.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Meaning of course the Father. But is it then that He says in another place, The Father judges no man, but has committed all judgment to the Son. Judgment is sometimes put for condemnation, whereas here it only stands for trial: as if to say, There is one, even My Father, who distinguishes My glory from yours; you glory after this world, I not after this world. The Father distinguishes the glory of the Son, from that of all men: for that He has been made man, does not bring us to a comparison with Him. We men have sin: He was without sin, even when He was in the form of a servant; for, as the Word which was in the beginning, who can speak worthily of Him?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Si vere dictum est a salvatore: omnia mea tua sunt, palam est quoniam et ipsum iudicium filii, patris est.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. As the perversity of the wicked increases, preaching so far from giving way, ought even to become more active. Thus our Lord, after He had been accused of having a devil, imparts the treasures of preaching in a still larger degree: Verily, verily, I say to you, If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Ipsa est vera mors, nam ista migratio est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. See is put for experience. But since, about to die Himself, He spoke with those about to die, what means this, If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death? What, but that He saw another death from which He came to free us, death eternal, the death of the damned, which is shared with the devil and his angels! That is the true death: the other is a passage only.

Quod autem dicit in aeternum, communiter est sumendum, ut sit talis intellectus: si quis sermonem meum servaverit in aeternum, mortem non videbit in aeternum: quia eousque non videt aliquis mortem, quousque Iesu verbum custodit. Cum vero quis torpens in observantia sermonis, et circa sui custodiam negligens factus, eum cessat custodire, subinde mortem videt, non apud alium quam apud seipsum. Sic igitur a salvatore instructi, prophetae quaerenti: quis est homo qui vivet, et non videbit mortem? Respondere possumus: qui custodit verbum Christi.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. We must understand Him, as it were, to say, If a man keep My light, he shall not see darkness forever; forever being taken as common to both clauses, as if the sentence were, If a man keep My saying for ever, He shall not see death for ever: meaning that a man does not see death, so long as he keeps Christ’s word. But when a man, by becoming sluggish in the observance of His words, and negligent in the keeping of his own heart, ceases to keep them, he then sees death; he brings it upon himself. Thus taught then by our Savior, to the prophet who asks, What man is he that lives, and shall not see death? we are able to answer, He who keeps Christ’s word.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Servaverit autem dicit non solum fide, sed etiam per vitam puram. Simul autem et occulte insinuat quoniam nihil possunt ei facere. Si enim qui sermonem eius servabit, non morietur in aeternum, multo magis et ipse non potest mori.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He says, keep, i.e. not by faith, but by purity of life. And at the same time too He means it as a tacit intimation that they can do nothing to Him. For if whoever keeps His word, shall never die, much less is it possible that He Himself should die.

Cum aliqua differentia sit inter mortem gustare et videre, pro eo quod mortem non videbit, mortem non gustabit protulerunt, velut incauti auditores confundentes dominicum sermonem. Sicut enim dominus inquantum panis vivus est, gustabilis est; in eo vero quod est sapientia, est visibilis pulchritudinis: sic etiam adversaria eius mors et gustabilis est et visibilis. Cum ergo quis steterit per Iesum in intellectuali loco, mortem non gustabit, si statum servat, secundum illud Matth. 16, 28: sunt de hic stantibus qui non gustabunt mortem.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Those who believe the Holy Scriptures, understand that what men do contrary to right reason, is not done without the operation of devils. Thus the Jews thought that Jesus had spoken by the influence of the devil, when He said, If a man keep My saying, he shall never see death. And this idea they labored under, because they did not know the power of God. For here He was speaking of that death of enmity to reason, by which sinners perish: whereas they understand Him of that death which is common to all; and therefore blame Him for so speaking, when it was certain that Abraham and the Prophets were dead: Abraham is dead, and the Prophets; and you say, If man keep My saying, be shall never taste of death. Shall never taste of death, they say, instead of, shall not see death; though between tasting and seeing death there is a difference. Like careless hearers, they mistake what our Lord said. For as our Lord, in that He is the true bread, is good to taste; in that He is wisdom, is beautiful to behold; in like manner His adversary death is both to be tasted and seen. When then a man stands by Christ’s help in the spiritual place pointed out to him, he shall not taste of death if he preserves that state: according to Matthew, There those standing here, which shall not taste of death. But when a man hears Christ’s words and keeps them, he shall not see death.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. In answer then to their question, Are you greater than our father Abraham, He shows them that He is greater than Abraham; Your father Abraham rejoiced to see My day: he saw it, and was glad; he must have rejoiced, because My day would benefit him, which is to acknowledge Me greater than himself.

Sed ego non dubito patrem Abraham totum scisse: ait enim servo suo quem mittebat: pone manum sub femore meo, et iura mihi per Deum caeli.

It admits of doubt whether He is speaking here of the temporal day of the Lord, that, viz. of His coming in the flesh, or of that day which knows s neither rising or setting. I doubt not however that our father Abraham knew the whole: as he says to his servant whom he sent, Put your hand under my thigh, and swear to me by the God of heaven. What did that oath signify, but that the God of heaven was to come in the flesh, out of the stock of Abraham.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Christ was then thirty-three years old. Why then do they not say, You are not yet forty years old, instead of fifty? A needless question this: they simply spoke as chance led them at the time. Some however say that they mentioned the fiftieth year on account of its sacred character, as being the year of jubilee, in which they redeemed their captives, and gave up the possessions they had bought.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Our Savior mildly draws them away from their carnal view, to the contemplation of His Divinity; Jesus said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, Before Abraham was, I am. Before is a particle of past time, am, of present. Divinity has no past or future, but always the present; and therefore He does not say, Before Abraham was, I was: but, Before Abraham was, I am: as it is in Exodus, I am that I am. Before and after might be said of Abraham with reference to different periods of his life; to be, in the present, is said of the truth only.

But now that He had done all that He could do as a teacher, and they in return wished to stone Him, since they could not bear correction, He leaves them: Jesus hid Himself, and went out of the temple. He did not hide Himself in a corner of the temple, as if He was afraid, or take refuge in a house, or run behind a wall, or a pillar; but by His heavenly power, making Himself invisible to His enemies, went through the midst of them: Jesus hid Himself, and, went out of the temple.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia Iudaei sermonum Christi altitudinem non susceperant, exiens de templo curavit caecum, sui absentia eorum furorem mitigans, et per operationem signi, eorum duritiam molliens, et de his quae dicta sunt a se, faciens fidem; unde dicitur et praeteriens Iesus, vidit hominem caecum a nativitate. Ubi considerandum, quod egrediens de templo, studiose venit ad opus sui manifestativum: ipse enim vidit caecum, non caecus ad eum accessit; et ita studiose respexit ut discipuli eius videntes eum studiose aspicientem interrogarent; sequitur enim et interrogaverunt eum discipuli eius: Rabbi, quis peccavit, hic, an parentes eius, ut caecus nasceretur?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Jews having rejected Christ’s words, because of their depth, He went out of the temple, and healed the blind man; that His absence might appease their fury, and the miracle soften their hard hearts, and convince their unbelief. And as Jesus passed by, He saw a man which was blind from his birth. It is to be remarked here that, on going out of the temple, He betook Himself intently to this manifestation of His power. He first saw the blind man, not the blind man Him: and so intently did He fix His eye upon him, that His disciples were struck, and asked, Rabbi, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. This question does not seem a proper one. For the Apostles had not been taught the fond notion of the Gentiles, that the soul has sinned in a previous state of existence. It is difficult to account for their putting it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Venerunt enim ad hanc interrogationem, quia prius paralyticum curans dixit: ecce sanus factus es: non ultra pecces. Illi igitur cogitantes quia propter peccata fuerat ille paralysi resolutus, quaerunt de isto si hic peccavit; quod non est dicere: a nativitate enim caecus est; aut parentes eius; sed neque hoc: filius enim pro patre non sustinet poenam. Sequitur respondit Iesus: neque hic peccavit, neque parentes eius.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They were led to ask this question, by our Lord having said above, on healing the man sick of the palsy, Lo, you are made whole; sin no more. Thinking from this that the man had been struck with the palsy for his sins, they ask our Lord of the blind man here, whether he did sin, or his parents; neither of which could have been the reason of his blindness; the former, because he had been blind from his birth; the latter, because the son does not suffer for the father. Jesus answered, Neither has this man sinned, nor his parents.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Numquid vel ipse sine originali peccato natus erat, vel vivendo nihil addiderat?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Was he then born without original sin, or had he never added to it by actual sin? Both this man and his parents had sinned, but that sin was not the reason why he was born blind. Our Lord gives the reason; viz. That the works of God should be made manifest in him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem ex hoc ostendit quod alii caeci facti sunt propter peccata parentum: neque enim contingit uno peccante alium puniri. Quod autem dicit ut manifestetur gloria Dei, de seipso dicit, non de patre: illius enim gloria iam manifesta erat. Sed numquid iste iniuste passus est? Sed ego eum beneficium accepisse dico per caecitatem: per hanc enim interioribus respexit oculis. Qui vero ex non ente ad esse eum deduxit, potestatem habebat absque iniuria et ita eum dimittere. Dicunt autem quidam, quoniam ut hic non est causativum, sed significat eventum, sicut et illud: lex subintravit, ut abundaret delictum; sic et hoc consecutum est, ut dominus oculos clausos aperiens, et alia naturalis infirmitatis nocumenta corrigens, suam demonstravit virtutem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He is not to be understood as meaning that others had become blind, in consequence of their parents’ sins: for one man cannot be punished for the sin of another. But had the man therefore suffered unjustly? Rather I should say that that blindness was a benefit to him: for by it he was brought to see with the inward eye. At any rate He who brought him into being out of nothing, had the power to make him in the event no loser by it. Some too say, that the that here, is expressive not of the cause, but of the event, as in the passage in Romans, The law entered that sin might abound, the effect in this case being, you our Lord by opening the closed eye, and healing other natural infirmities, demonstrated His own power.

Sed dum inopinata salus percussionem sequitur, salvantis virtus cognita ardentius amatur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. One stroke falls on the sinner, for punishment only, not conversion; another for correction; another not for correction of past sins, but prevention of future; another neither for correcting past, nor preventing future sins, but by the unexpected deliverance following the blow, to excite more ardent love of the Savior’s goodness.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That the glory of God should be made manifest, He said of Himself, not of the Father; the Father’s glory was manifest already. I must work the works of Him that sent Me; i.e. I must manifest Myself, and show that I do the same that My Father does.

Nox dicta est, secundum illud: proicite eum in tenebras exteriores. Ibi ergo erit nox, ubi nemo potest operari, sed recipere quod operatus est. Cum vivis, fac si quid facturus es: ultra enim neque fides est, neque labores, neque poenitentia.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. While it is day, He adds; i.e. while men have the opportunity of believing in Me; while this life lasts; The night comes, when none can work. Night here means that spoken of in Matthew, Cast him into outer darkness. Then will there be night, wherein none can work, but only receive for that which he has worked. While you live, do that which you will do: for beyond it is neither faith, nor labor, nor repentance.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if we work now, now is the day time, now is Christ present; as He says, As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. This then is the day. The natural day is completed by the circuit of the sun, and contains only a few hours: the day of Christ’s presence will last to the end of the world: for He Himself has said, Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.

Qui autem maiores substantias de nihilo ad esse perduxit, multo magis oculos sine materia fecisset; sed voluit docere seipsum esse creatorem, qui in principio usus est luto ad hominis formationem. Ideo autem non aqua utitur ad lutum faciendum, sed sputo, ut nihil ascribatur fonti; sed discas quoniam virtus oris oculos aperuit et plasmavit: et deinde ut non videatur eis ex virtute terrae esse curatio, iussit lavari; unde sequitur et dixit ei: vade, et lava ad natatoria Siloe, quod interpretatur missus: ut discas quoniam non indigeo luto ad faciendos oculos. Et quia in Siloe erat virtus Christi, quae omnia operabatur, propter hoc et interpretationem nobis Evangelista adiecit, dicens quod interpretatur missus: ut discas quoniam et illic Christus eum curavit. Sicut enim apostolus dicit quod petra erat Christus, ita et Siloe spiritualis erat, cuius repentinus aquae defluxus occulte insinuat nobis Christi manifestationem praeter omnem spem. Sed quare non statim eum fecit lavari, sed ad Siloe misit? Ut destruatur Iudaeorum indevotio: conveniens enim erat omnes eum videre euntem, et lutum super oculos habentem. Et etiam volens ostendere quoniam non alienus est a lege et veteri testamento, mittit eum ad Siloe. Non autem erat timendum ne Siloe sumeret hanc gloriam: multi enim lavantes ibi oculos, nullo tali beneficio sunt potiti. Et iterum ut discas caeci fidem, qui non contradixit, neque cogitavit apud seipsum: lutum solet magis excaecare: multoties lavi in Siloe, et in nullo sum adiutus: si quam virtutem haberet, praesens utique curasset. Sed simpliciter obedivit; unde sequitur abiit ergo, et lavit, et venit videns. Sic igitur manifestavit suam gloriam: non enim parva gloria est ut aestimetur auctor creationis: ea enim quae de maiori est fides, quod minus est certificat. In universa autem creatione honorabilior est homo, eorum autem quae in nobis sunt membrorum honorabilior est oculus: hic enim corpus gubernat, hic ornat visum; et quod sol est in orbe terrarum, hoc est oculus in corpore: unde superiorem locum sortitur, sicut in quodam regali loco collocatus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He then confirms His words by deeds: When He had thus spoken, He spat on the ground, and made clay of the spittle, and anointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. He who had brought greater substances into being out of nothing, could much more have given sight without the use of any material: but He wished to show that He was the Creator, Who in the beginning used clay for the formation of man. He makes the clay with spittle, and not with water, to make it evident that it was not the pool of Siloam, whither He was about to send him, but the virtue proceeding from His mouth, which restored the man’s sight. And then, that the cure might not seem to be the effect of the clay, He ordered the man to wash: And He said to him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam. The Evangelist gives the meaning of Siloam, which is by interpretation, Sent, to intimate that it was Christ’s power that cured him even there. As the Apostle says of the rock in the wilderness, that that Rock was Christ, so Siloam had a spiritual character: the sudden rise of its water being a silent figure of Christ’s unexpected manifestation in the flesh. But why did He not tell him to wash immediately, instead of sending him to Siloam? That the obstinacy of the Jews might be overcome, when they saw him going there with the clay on his eyes. Besides which, it proved that He was not averse to the Law, and the Old Testament. And there was no fear of the glory of the case being given to Siloam: as many had washed their eyes there, and received no such benefit. And to show the faith of the blind man, who made no opposition, never argued with himself, that it was the quality of clay rather to darken, than give light, that He had often washed in Siloam, and had never been benefited; that if our Lord had the power, He might have cured him by His word; but simply obeyed: he went his way therefore, and washed and came seeing. Thus our Lord manifested His glory: and no small glory it was, to be proved the Creator of the world, as He was proved to be by this miracle. For on the principle that the greater contains the less, this act of creation included in it every other. Man is the most honorable of an creatures; the eye the most honorable member of man, directing the movements, and giving him sight. The eye is to the body, what the sun is to the universe; and therefore it is placed aloft, as it were, upon a royal eminence.

The man did not see immediately as he was anointed; i.e. was, as it were, only made a catechumen. But he was sent to the pool which is called Siloam, i.e. he was baptized in Christ; and then he was enlightened. The Evangelist then explains to us the name of this pool: which is by interpretation, Sent: for, if He had not been sent, none of us would have been delivered from our sins.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or thus: By His spittle understand the savor of inward contemplation. It runs down from the head into the mouth, and gives us the taste of revelation from the Divine splendor even in this life. The mixture of His spittle with clay is the mixture of supernatural grace, even the contemplation of Himself with our carnal knowledge, to the soul’s enlightenment, and restoration of the human understanding from its original blindness.

They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind; i.e. that they might examine him still more closely. The Evangelist adds, And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his eyes; in order to expose their real design, which was to accuse Him of a departure from the law, and thus detract from the miracle: as appears from what follows, Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. But mark the firmness of the blind man. To tell the truth to the multitude before, from whom he was in no danger, was not so great a matter: but it is remarkable, now that the danger is so much greater, to find him disavowing nothing, and not contradicting any thing that he said before: He said to them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. He is more brief this time, as his interrogators were already informed of the matter: not mentioning the name of Jesus, nor His saying, Go, and wash; but simply, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see; the very contrary answer to what they wanted. They wanted a disavowal, and they receive a confirmation of the story. Therefore said some of the Pharisees.

And this God admonishes us of, when He enjoins the sabbath, saying, In it you shall do no servile work. What servile work is, our Lord tells us above, Whosoever commits sin, is the servant of sin.

For whereas such might have strewn them, that the sabbath was not broken; they had not yet any idea that He v as God, and therefore did not know that it was the Lord of the sabbath who had worked the miracle. Nor did any of them dare to say openly what his sentiments were, but spoke ambiguously; one, because he thought the fact itself improbable; another, from his love of station.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia Pharisaei caecum attonitum facere non valuerunt, sed videbant eum cum omni propalatione benefactorem suum praedicantem, per parentes putabant Christi miraculum annihilare; unde dicitur non crediderunt ergo Iudaei de illo quia caecus fuisset et vidisset, donec vocaverunt parentes eius qui viderat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Pharisees being unable, by intimidation, to deter the blind man from publicly proclaiming his Benefactor, try to nullify the miracle through the parents. But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, and received his sight, until they had called the parents of him that had received his sight.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Idest, caecus fuerat et viderat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. i.e. had been blind, and now saw.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed haec est veritatis natura: per quae putatur insidias pati, per haec fortior fit: mendacium enim sibi ipsi quidem obviat, et per ea per quae laedere veritatem videtur, per ea clariorem eam ostendit, quod et nunc factum est. Ne enim aliquis diceret quod vicini nihil certum dixerunt, sed per quamdam assimilationem locuti sunt, parentes in medium ducuntur, qui maxime suum filium cognoscebant. Statuentes autem eos in medium, cum multo furore interrogant; unde sequitur et interrogaverunt eos, dicentes: hic est filius vester? Et non dicunt: qui quandoque fuit caecus, sed quem dicitis quia natus est caecus. O iniqui. Quis pater eligeret talia mentiri de filio? Solum non dicunt: quem vos fecistis caecum. Duobus autem his ad negationem eos inducere conantur: et in hoc quod dicunt quem dicitis quia natus est caecus, et in hoc quod subdunt quomodo ergo nunc videt?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But it is the nature of truth, to be strengthened by the very snares that are laid against it. A lie is its own antagonist, and by its attempts to injure the truth, sets it off to greater advantage: as is the case now. For the argument which might otherwise have been urged, that the neighbors knew nothing for certain, but spoke from a mere resemblance, is cut off by introduction of the parents, who could of course testify to their own son. Having brought these before the assembly, they interrogate them with great sharpness, saying, Is this your son, (they say not, who was born blind, but) who you say was born blind? Say. Why what father is there, that would say such things of a son, if they were not true? Why not say at once, Whom you made blind? They try two ways of making them deny the miracle: by saying, Who you say was born blind, and by adding, How then does he now see?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicant: aut hoc falsum est quod nunc videat, aut primum quod caecus fuerit; sed constat hoc esse verum quod videt: falsum ergo fuit quod caecum eum dicebatis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Either, say they, it is not true that he now sees, or it is untrue that he was blind before: but it is evident that he now sees; therefore it is not true that he was born blind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Tribus ergo interrogationibus factis: si filius eorum est, si caecus fuit, et qualiter vidit, duas confitentur; unde sequitur responderunt ergo eis parentes eius, et dixerunt: scimus quia hic est filius noster, et quia caecus natus est. Tertiam autem abiciunt; unde subdunt quomodo autem nunc videat nescimus, aut quis eius aperuit oculos nos nescimus. Et hoc etiam pro veritate factum est, ut nullus alius, sed is qui curatus est, et qui dignus fide erat, hoc confiteretur; unde sequitur ipsum interrogate: aetatem habet, ipse de se loquatur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Three things then being asked, - if he were their son, if he had been blind, and how he saw, - they acknowledge two of them: his parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and that he was born blind. But the third they refuse to speak to: But by what means he now sees, we know not. The inquiry in this way ends in confirming the truth of the miracle, by making it rest upon the incontrovertible evidence of the confession of the healed person himself; He is of age, they say, ask him; he can speak for himself.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quasi dicant: iuste cogeremur loqui pro infante, quia ipse pro se loqui non posset. Caecum a nativitate novimus, sed loquentem.

Rursus et hic opinionem Iudaeorum et mentem Evangelista inducit; unde sequitur iam enim conspiraverant Iudaei ut si quis eum confiteretur esse Christum, extra synagogam fieret.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What sort of gratitude is this in the parents; concealing what they knew, from fear of the Jews? as we are next told; These words spoke his parents, because they feared the Jews. And then the Evangelist mentions again what the intentions and dispositions of the Jews were: For the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that He was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Iam non erat malum fieri extra synagogam: illi expellebant, Christus suscipiebat. Sequitur propterea parentes eius dixerunt: quia aetatem habet, ipsum interrogate.

Absit; sed voluit Christum a rei testimonio, et non a sua voce ab incusatione eripere, et suam responsionem facere fide dignam ab accepto beneficio; unde subdit unum scio, quia caecus cum essem, modo video; quasi dicat: nihil modo de hoc dico utrum sit peccator, sed iterum dico quod manifeste novi. Quia igitur nequiverant evertere quod factum est, ad priores redeunt sermones, rursus modum curationis inquirentes; sicut canes quidem venationem nunc huc, nunc illuc investigantes; unde sequitur dixerunt ergo illi: quid fecit tibi?

Quasi dicat: non attenditis ad ea quae dicuntur: unde ultra non respondebo vobis inaniter interrogantibus, et non volentibus addiscere, sed cavillari quae dicuntur; unde sequitur numquid et vos vultis discipuli eius fieri?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But how comes this, whether He be a sinner, I know not, from one who had said, He is a Prophet? Did the blind fear? far from it: he only thought that our Lord’s defense lay in the witness of the fact, more than in another’s pleading. And he gives weight to his reply by the mention of the benefit he had received: One thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see: as if to say, I say nothing as to whether He is a sinner; but only repeat what I know for certain. So being unable to overturn the fact itself of the miracle, they fall back upon former arguments, and inquire the manner of the cure: just as dogs in hunting pursue wherever the scent takes them: Then said they to him again, What did He do to you? How opened He your eyes? i.e. was it by any charm. For they do not say, How did you see? but, How opened He your eyes? to give the man an opportunity of detracting from the operation. So long now as the matter wanted examining, the blind man answers gently and quietly; but, the victory being gained, he grows bolder: He answered them, I have told you already, and you did not hear: wherefore would you hear it again? i.e. you do not attend to what is said, and therefore I will no longer answer you vain questions, put for the sake of cavil, not to gain knowledge: Will you also be His disciples?

So argues the blind man: The man answered and said, Why herein is a marvelous thing, that you know not whence He is, and yet He has opened mine eyes. He brings in the miracle every where, as evidence which they could not invalidate: and, inasmuch as they had said that a man that was a sinner could not do such miracles, he turns their own words against them; Now we know that God hears not sinners; as if to say, I quite agree with you in this opinion.

It is not enough to know God, we must do His will. Then he extols His creed: Since the world began, was it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one that was born blind: as if to say, If you confess that God hears not sinners; and this Man has worked a miracle; such an one, as no other man has; it is manifest that the virtue whereby He has wrought it, is more than human: If this Man were not of God, He could do nothing.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Qui propter veritatem et Christi confessionem iniuria opprimuntur, hi maxime honorantur; quod in caeco factum est: eiecerunt enim eum ex templo Iudaei, et invenit eum dominus templi, et eum suscepit sicut agonotheta athletam multum laborantem, et coronavit; unde dicitur audivit Iesus quia eiecerunt eum foras, et cum invenisset eum, dixit ei: tu credis in filium Dei? Ostendit autem Evangelista quoniam propter hoc venit Iesus ut ei loqueretur. Interrogat autem non ignorans, sed volens seipsum notum facere, et ostendens quoniam multum appretiatur eius fidem; quasi dicat: plebs conviciata est mihi, sed nulla mihi est cura illorum: unius cura est: ut tu credas. Melior est faciens voluntatem Dei, quam decies mille iniqui.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Those who suffer for the truth’s sake, and confession of Christ, come to greatest honor; as we see in the instance of the blind man. For the Jews cast him out of the temple, and the Lord of the temple found him; and received him as the judge cloth the wrestler after his labors, and crowned him: Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when He had found him, He said to him, Do you believe in the Son of God? The Evangelist makes it plain that Jesus came in order to say this to him. He asks him, however, not in ignorance, but wishing to reveal Himself to him, and to show that He appreciated his faith; as if He said, The people have cast reproaches on Me, but I care not for them; one thing only I care for, that you may believe. Better is he that does the will of God, than ten thousand of the wicked.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Si autem sola Christi qualiscumque confessio fidei esset consummatio, dictum fuisset: tu credis in Christum? Sed quia haereticis pene omnibus hoc nomen in ore esset futurum ut Christum confiterentur, et filium tamen negarent, id quod proprium Christo est, ad fidem poscitur, idest ut credatur in Dei filium. Credidisse autem in Dei filium quid proficit, si credatur in creaturam, cum a nobis fides in Christo non creaturae Dei, sed filii Dei postuletur?
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. If any mere confession whatsoever of Christ were the perfection of faith, it would have been said, Do you believe in Christ? But inasmuch as all heretics would have had this name in their mouths, confessing Christ, and yet denying the Son, that which is two of Christ alone, is required of our faith, viz. that we should believe in the Son of God. But what avails it to believe on the Son of God as being a creature, when we are required to have faith in Christ, not as a creature of God, but as the Son of God.

Non autem dixit ei dominus: ego sum qui curavi te; sed medie adhuc loquitur; unde sequitur et vidisti eum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But the blind man did not yet know Christ, for before he went to Christ he was blind, and after his cure, he was taken hold of by the Jews: He answered and said, Who is He, Lord, that I might believe on Him? The speech this of a longing and inquiring mind. He knows not who He is for whom he had contended so much; a proof to you of his love of truth. The Lord however says not to him, I am He who healed you; but uses a middle way of speaking, You have both seen Him.

But what is that which follows: And that they which see might be made blind. Hear what comes next. Some of the Pharisees were moved by these words: And some of the Pharisees which were with Him heard these words, and said to Him, Are we blind also? What had moved them were the words, And that they which see might be made blind. It follows, Jesus said to them, If you were blind, you should have no sin; i.e. If you called yourselves blind, and ran to the physician. But now you say, We see; therefore your sin remains: for in that saying, We see, you seek not a physician, you shall remain in your blindness. This then which He has just before said, I came, that they that see not might see; i.e. they who confess they cannot see, and seek a physician, in order that they may see: and that they which see not may be made blind; i.e. they which think they can see, and seek not a physician, may remain in their blindness. This act of division He calls judgment, saying, For judgment have I come into this world: not that judgment by which He will judge quick and dead at the end of the world.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. In iudicium dixit, id est in maius supplicium, ostendens quoniam qui condemnaverunt eum, ipsi sunt qui condemnati sunt.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, for judgment, He said; i.e. for greater punishment, showing that they who condemned Him, were the very ones who were condemned. Respecting what He says, that they which see not might see, and that they which see might be made blind; it is the same which St. Paul says, The Gentiles which followed not after righteousness, have attained to righteousness, even the righteousness which is of faith.

Et primo ostendit quis est erroneus et fur, dicens amen, amen, dico vobis: qui non intrat per ostium in ovile ovium, sed ascendit aliunde, ille fur est et latro. Hic autem et eos qui ante eum fuerunt, occulte insinuat, et eos qui post eum futuri sunt, Antichristum et pseudochristos. Ostium autem Scripturas vocavit; hae enim Dei cognitionem aperiunt, hae oves custodiunt, et lupos supervenire non permittunt, haereticis introitum praecludentes. Qui ergo non Scripturis utitur, sed aliunde ascendit, hoc est aliam sibi et non legitimam viam facit, hic fur est. Dicit autem ascendit, et non intrat, ad similitudinem furis maceriam transcendere volentis, et periculose omnia agentis. Dicens autem aliunde, etiam Scribas occulte insinuavit, qui docebant mandata et doctrinas hominum, et legem praevaricabantur. Si autem infra seipsum ostium dicit, non oportet turbari: etenim pastorem seipsum et ovem differenter praedicat: quia enim adducit nos patri, ostium se dicit; quia vero procurat, pastorem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord having reproached the Jews with blindness, they might have said, We are not blind, but we avoid you as a deceiver. Our Lord therefore gives the marks which distinguish a robber and deceiver from a true shepherd. First come those of the deceiver and robber: Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. There is an allusion here to Antichrist, and to certain false Christs who had been, and were to be. The Scriptures He calls the door. They admit us to the knowledge of God, they protect the sheep, they shut out the wolves, they bar the entrance to heretics. He that uses not the Scriptures, but climbs up some other way, i.e. some self-chosen, some unlawful way, is a thief. Climbs up, He says, not, enters, as if it were a thief getting over a wall, and running all risks. Some other way, may refer too to the commandments and traditions of men which the Scribes taught, to the neglect of the Law. When our Lord further on calls Himself the Door, we need not be surprised. According to the office which He bears, He is in one place the Shepherd, in another the Sheep. In that He introduces us to the Father, He is the Door, in that He takes care of us, He is the Shepherd.

Quia vero omnia ista quae faciunt, et nesciunt ad quem finem referant, inaniter faciunt, dominus de grege suo et ostio quo intratur ad ovile, similitudinem posuit, dicens amen, amen, dico vobis: qui non intrat per ostium in ovile ovium, sed ascendit aliunde, ille fur est et latro. Dicant ergo Pagani vel Iudaei vel haeretici: bene vivimus: si per ostium non intrant, quid eis prodest? Ad hoc enim debet unicuique prodesse bene vivere, ut detur illi semper vivere: quia nec bene vivere dicendi sunt qui finem bene vivendi vel caecitate nesciunt, vel inflatione contemnunt. Non est autem cuiquam spes vera semper vivendi, nisi cognoscat vitam, quod est Christus, et per hanc ianuam intret in ovile. Quicumque ergo vult intrare ad ovile, per ostium intret: non solum Christum praedicet, sed Christi gloriam quaerat, non suam. Humilis autem ianua est Christus: qui intrat per hanc ianuam, oportet humilem esse, ut sano capite possit intrare. Qui autem se non humiliat, sed extollit, per maceriam vult ascendere; ideo exaltatur ut cadat. Quaerunt ergo plerumque tales homines etiam persuadere hominibus ut bene vivant et Christiani non sint: per aliam partem volunt ascendere et rapere et occidere. Tales ergo fures sunt, quia quod alienum est, suum dicunt; latrones, quia quod furantur occidunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: Many go under the name of good men according to the standard of the world, and observe in some sort the commandments of the Law, who yet are not Christians. And these generally boast of themselves, as the Pharisees did; Are we blind also? But inasmuch as all that they do they do foolishly, without knowing to what end it tends, our Lord said of them, Verily, verily, I say to you, He that enters not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbs up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber. Let the Pagans then, the Jews, the Heretics, say, “We lead a good life;” if they enter not by the door, what avails it? A good life only profits, as leading to life eternal. Indeed those cannot be said to lead a good life, who are either blindly ignorant of, or willfully despise, the end of good living. No one can hope for eternal life, who knows not Christ, who is the life, and by that door enters into the fold. Whoso wishes to enter into the sheepfold, let him enter by the door; let him preach Christ; let him seek Christ’s glory, not his own. Christ is a lowly door, and he who enters by this door must be lowly, if he would enter with his head whole. He that does not humble, but exalt himself, who wishes to climb up over the wall, is exalted that he may fall. Such men generally try to persuade others that they may live well, and not be Christians. Thus they climb up by some other way, that they may rob and kill. They are thieves, because they call that their own, which is not; robbers, because that which they have stolen, they kill.

If you seek another person for porter, take the Holy Spirit, of whom our Lord below said, He will guide you into all truth.

That He might not appear one of this number, He gives many marks of difference between Him and them.

Sed dicet aliquis: quando non audiebant, oves non erant; vox audita eos mutavit, et ex lupis oves fecit. Me autem adhuc movet quod per Ezechielem obiurgat dominus pastores, et dicit inter cetera de ovibus: errantem non revocastis: et errantem dicit, et ovem appellat. Non erraret, si vocem pastoris audiret; sed ideo erravit, quia vocem alieni audivit. Dico ergo: novit dominus qui sunt eius: novit praescitos, novit praedestinatos. Ipsi sunt oves, aliquando se ipsi nesciunt; sed pastor novit eas: multae enim oves foris sunt, et multi lupi intus. De praedestinatis ergo loquitur. Est autem aliqua vox pastoris in qua oves non audiunt alienos, in qua non oves non audiunt Christum. Quae est ista vox? Qui perseveraverit usque in finem, hic salvus erit.

            <b>AUG</b>. But here is a difficulty. Sometimes they who are not sheep hear Christ’s voice; for Judas heard, who was a wolf. And sometimes the sheep hear Him not; for they who crucified Christ heard not; yet some of them were His sheep. You will say, While they did not hear, they were not sheep; the voice, when they heard it, changed them from wolves to sheep. Still I am disturbed by the Lord’s rebuke to the shepherds in Ezekiel, Neither have you brought again that which strayed. He calls it a stray sheep, but yet a sheep all the while; though, if it strayed, it could not have heard the voice of the Shepherd, but the voice of a stranger. What I say then is this; The Lord knows them that are His. He knows the foreknown, he knows the predestinated. They are the sheep: for a time they know not themselves, but the Shepherd knows them; for many sheep are without the fold, many wolves within. He speaks then of the predestinated. And now the difficulty is solved. The sheep do hear the Shepherd’s voice, and they only. When is that? It is when that voice said, He that endures to the end shall be saved. This speech His own hear, the alien hear not.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord feeds by plain words, exercises by obscure. For when two persons, one godly, the other ungodly, hear the words of the Gospel, and they happen to be such that neither can understand them; one says, What He said is true and good, but we do not understand it: the other says, It is not worth attending to. The former, in faith, knocks, yes, and, if he continue to knock, it shall be opened to him. The latter shall hear the words in Isaiah, If you will not believe, surely you shall not be established.

He, the Word, the Truth, sent heralds before Him, but the hearts of those whom He sent were His own. They came with Him, inasmuch as He is always, though He assumed the flesh in time: In the beginning was the Word. His humble advent in the flesh was preceded by just men, who believed on Him as about to come, as we believe on Him come. The times are different, the faith is the same. Our faith knits together both those who believed that He was about to come, and those who believe that He has come. All that ever came at variance with Him were thieves and robbers; i.e. they came to steal and to kill; but the sheep did not hear them. They had not Christ’s voice; but were wanderers, dreamers, deceivers. Why He is the Door, He next explains, I am the Door; by Me if any man enter in he shall be saved.

Si ergo ipse est ostium, quomodo per seipsum intrat? Sicut ergo ipse per seipsum novit patrem, nos autem per illum; sic intrat in ovile per seipsum, nos autem per ipsum: nos, quia Christum praedicamus, per ostium intramus; Christus autem seipsum praedicat: lumen enim et alia demonstrat et seipsum. Si autem praepositi Ecclesiae, qui filii sunt, pastores sunt; quomodo unus pastor est, nisi quia sunt illi omnes unius membra pastoris? Et quidem quod pastor est dedit et membris suis: nam et Petrus pastor, et ceteri apostoli pastores, et omnes boni episcopi: ostium vero nemo nostrum se dicit: hoc sibi ipse proprie tenuit. Non autem adderet bonus, nisi essent et pastores mali: ipsi sunt fures et latrones, aut certe ut multum mercenarii.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord has acquainted us with two things which were obscure before; first, that He is the Door; and now again, that He is the Shepherd: I am the good Shepherd. Above He said that the shepherd entered by the door. If He is the Door, how does He enter by Himself? Just as He knows the Father by Himself, and we by Him; so He enters into the fold by Himself, and we by Him. We enter by the door, because we preach Christ; Christ preaches Himself. A light shows both other things, and itself too. There is but one Shepherd. For though the rulers of the Church, those who are her sons, and not hirelings, are shepherds, they are all members of that one Shepherd. His office of Shepherd He has permitted His members to bear. Peter is a shepherd, and all the other Apostles: all good Bishops are shepherds. But none of us calls himself the door. He could not have added good, if there were not bad shepherds as well. They are thieves and robbers; or at least mercenaries.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Atque eius bonitatis formam, quam nos imitemur, adiungit, dicens bonus pastor animam suam ponit pro ovibus suis. Fecit quod monuit, ostendit quod iussit: pro ovibus suis animam suam posuit, ut in sacramento nostro corpus suum et sanguinem verteret, et oves quas redemerat carnis suae alimento satiaret. Ostensa est nobis de contemptu mortis via quam sequamur, apposita forma cui imprimamur. Primum nobis est exteriora nostra misericorditer ovibus eius impendere; postremum vero, si necesse sit, etiam in mortem animam nostram pro eisdem ovibus ministrare. Qui autem non dat pro ovibus substantiam suam, quando pro his daturus est animam suam?
          <td><b>GREG</b>. And He adds what that goodness is, for our imitation: The good Shepherd gives His life for the sheep. He did what He bade, He set the example of what He commanded: He laid down His life for the sheep, that He might convert His body and blood in our Sacrament, and feed with His flesh the sheep He had redeemed. A path is shown us wherein to walk, despising death; a stamp is applied to us, and we must submit to the impression. Our first duty is to spend our outward possessions upon the sheep; our last, if it be necessary, is to sacrifice our life for the same sheep. Whoso does not give his substance to the sheep, how can he lay down his life for them?

Non autem omnes qui corpora sua in passione etiam ignibus tradunt, aestimandi sunt sanguinem fudisse pro ovibus, sed potius contra oves; dicit enim apostolus: si tradidero corpus meum ita ut ardeam, caritatem autem non habeam, nihil mihi prodest. Quomodo autem habet vel exiguam caritatem, qui etiam convictus non amat unitatem? Quam dominus commendans, noluit multos appellare pastores, sed pastorem unum, dicens ego sum pastor bonus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. All these however were good shepherds, not because they shed their blood, but because they did it for the sheep. For they shed it not in pride, but in love. Should any among the heretics suffer trouble in consequence of their errors and iniquities, they forthwith boast of their martyrdom; that they may be the better able to steal under so fair a cloak: for they are in reality wolves. But not all who give their bodies to be burned, are to be thought to shed their blood for the sheep; rather against the sheep; for the Apostle said, Though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity, it profits me nothing. And how has he even the smallest charity, who does not love connection with Christians? to command which, our Lord did not mention many shepherds, but one, I am the good Shepherd.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord shows here that He did not undergo His passion unwillingly; but for the salvation of the world. He then gives the difference between the shepherd and the hireling: But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, sees the wolf coming, and leaves the sheep, and flees.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Sunt enim nonnulli qui dum plus terrenam substantiam quam oves diligunt, merito nomen pastoris perdunt: non enim pastor, sed mercenarius vocatur qui non pro amore intimo oves dominicas, sed ad temporales mercedes pascit. Mercenarius quippe est qui pastoris locum tenet, sed lucrum animarum non quaerit, terrenis commodis inhiat, honore praelationis gaudet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Some there are who love earthly possessions more than the sheep, and do not deserve the name of a shepherd. He who feeds the Lord’s flock for the sake of temporal hire, and not for love, is an hireling, not a shepherd. An hireling is he who holds the place of shepherd, but seeks not the gain of souls, who pants after the good things of earth, and rejoices in the pride of station.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Aliud ergo quaerit in Ecclesia, non Deum quaerit: si Deum quaereret, castus esset, quia legitimum maritum anima Deum habet: quisquis a Deo praeter Deum aliquid quaerit, non caste Deum quaerit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He seeks therefore in the Church, not God, but something else. If he sought God he would be chaste; for the soul has but one lawful husband, God. Whoever seeks from God any thing beside God, seeks unchastely.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Utrum vero pastor sit, vel mercenarius, cognosci veraciter non potest, si occasio necessitatis deest: tranquillitatis enim tempore plerumque ad gregis custodiam sicut verus pastor, sic etiam mercenarius stat; sed lupus veniens indicat quo quisque animo super gregis custodiam stabat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But whether a man be a shepherd or an hireling, cannot be told for certain, except in a time of trial. In tranquil times, the hireling generally stands watch like the shepherd. But when the wolf comes, then every one shows with what spirit he stood watch over the flock.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Lupus autem Diabolus est, et qui illum sequuntur: nam dictum est quod induti quidam pellibus ovium, intus sunt lupi rapaces.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The wolf is the devil, and they that follow him; according to Matthew, Which come to you in sheep’s’ clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ecce lupus ovis guttur apprehendit, Diabolus fideli adulterium persuasit, excommunicandus est: sed excommunicatus inimicus erit, insidiabitur, nocebit cum potuerit: unde taces, non increpas: lupum venientem vidisti, et fugisti: corpore stetisti, animo fugisti; affectiones enim nostrae motus animorum sunt: laetitia animi diffusio est, tristitia autem contractio, cupiditas animi progressio, timor animi fuga est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Lo, the wolf has seized a sheep by the throat, the devil has enticed a man into adultery. The sinner must be excommunicated But if he is excommunicated, he will be an enemy, he will plot, he will do as much harm as he can. Wherefore you are silent, you do not censure, you have seen the wolf coming, and fled. Your body has stood, your mind has fled. For as joy is relaxation, sorrow contraction, desire a reaching forward of the mind; so fear is the flight of the mind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Lupus etiam super oves venit cum quilibet iniustus et raptor fideles quosque atque humiles opprimit. Sed is qui pastor esse videbatur et non erat, reliquit oves et fugit: quia dum sibi ab eo periculum metuit, resistere eius iniustitiae non praesumit. Fugit autem non mutando locum, sed subtrahendo solatium. Sed contra haec mercenarius nullo zelo accenditur: quia dum solum exteriora commoda requirit, interiora gregis damna negligenter patitur; unde subditur mercenarius autem fugit, quia mercenarius est, et non pertinet ad eum de ovibus. Sola ergo causa est ut mercenarius fugiat quia mercenarius est, ac si dicat: stare in periculo ovium non potest qui in eo quod ovibus praeest, non oves diligit, sed lucrum terrenum quaerit; et ideo opponere se contra periculum trepidat, ne hoc quod diligit amittat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. The wolf too comes upon the sheep, whenever any spoiler and unjust person oppresses the humble believers. And he who seems to be shepherd, but leaves the sheep and flees, is he who dares not to resist his violence, from fear of danger to himself. He flees not by changing place, but by withholding consolation from his flock. The hireling is inflamed with no zeal against this injustice. He only looks to outward comforts, and overlooks the internal suffering of his flock. The hireling flees, because he is a hireling, and cares not for the sheep. The only reason that the hireling flees, is because he is a hireling; as if to say, He cannot stand at the approach of danger, who does not love the sheep that he is set over, but seeks earthly gain. Such a one dares not face danger, for fear he should lose what he so much loves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Si autem apostoli pastores fuerunt, non mercenarii, quare fugiebant quando persecutionem patiebantur? Et hoc domino dicente: si vos persecuti fuerint, fugite. Pulsemus, aderit qui aperiet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if the Apostles were shepherds, not hirelings, why did they flee in persecution? And why did our Lord say, When they persecute you in this city, flee you into another? Let us knock, then will come one, who will explain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Augustinus ad Honoratum. <i>Fugiant ergo omnino de civitate in civitatem servi Christi, ministri verbi et sacramenti eius, quando eorum quisquam specialiter a persecutoribus quaeritur, ut ab aliis qui non ita requiruntur non deseratur Ecclesia. Cum autem omnium, idest episcoporum, et clericorum, et laicorum est commune periculum, hi qui aliis indigent, non deserantur ab his quibus indigent. Aut igitur ad loca munita omnes transeant; aut qui habent remanendi necessitatem, non relinquantur ab eis, per quos eorum ecclesiastica est implenda necessitas. Tunc ergo de locis in quibus sumus, premente persecutione, fugiendum est Christi ministris, quando ibi aut plebs Christi non fuerit cui ministretur, aut potest impleri per alios necessarium ministerium, quibus eadem non est causa fugiendi. Cum autem plebs manet et ministri fugiunt, ministeriumque subtrahitur, quid erit nisi mercenariorum illa fuga damnabilis, quibus non est cura de ovibus?</i>
          <td><b>AUG</b>. A servant of Christ, and minister of His Word and Sacraments, may flee from city to city, when he is specially aimed at by the persecutors, apart from his brethren; so that his flight does not leave the Church destitute. But when all, i.e. Bishops, Clerics, and Laics, are in danger in common, let not those who need assistance be deserted by those who should give it. Let all flee together if they can, to some place of security; but, if any are obliged to stay, let them not be forsaken by those who are bound to minister to their spiritual wants. Then, under pressing persecution, may Christ’s ministers flee from the place where they are, when none of Christ’s people remain to be ministered to, or when that ministry may be fulfilled by others who have not the same cause for flight. But when the people stay, and the ministers flee, and the ministry ceases, what is this but a damnable flight of hirelings, who care not for the sheep?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: In bonis ergo nominantur ostium, ostiarius, pastor et oves; in malis fures et latrones, mercenarii, lupus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. On the good side are the door, the porter, the shepherd, and the sheep; on the bad, the thieves, the robbers, the hirelings, the wolf.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Diligendus est pastor, cavendus latro, tolerandus mercenarius. Tamdiu enim est utilis mercenarius, quamdiu non videt lupum, furem vel latronem; cum autem viderit, fugit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We must love the shepherd, beware of the wolf, tolerate the hireling. For the hireling is useful so long as he sees not the wolf, the thief, and the robber. When he sees them, he flees.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Nec enim mercenarius diceretur, nisi acciperet a conducente mercedem. Filii aeternam hereditatem patris patienter expectant, mercenarius temporalem mercedem conducentis festinanter exoptat; et tamen per linguas utrorumque divina Christi gloria diffamatur. Inde ergo laedit unde mala facit, non unde bona dicit: botrum carpe, spinam cave: quia botrus aliquando de radice vitis exortus, pendet in spinis: multi quippe in Ecclesia commoda terrena sectantes, Christum praedicant, et per eos vox Christi auditur; et sequuntur oves, non mercenarium, sed vocem pastoris per mercenarium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Indeed he would not be a hireling, did he not receive wages from the hirer. Sons wait patiently for the eternal inheritance of their father; the hireling looks eagerly for the temporal wages from his hirer; and yet the tongues of both speak abroad the glory of Christ. The hireling hurts, in that he does wrong, not in that he speaks right: the grape bunch hangs amid thorns; pluck the grape, avoid the thorn. Many that seek temporal advantages in the Church, preach Christ, and through them Christ’s voice is heard; and the sheep follow not the hireling, but the voice of the Shepherd heard through the hireling.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Duos superius malos praemisit dominus: unum qui furatur et mactat et rapit; alterum qui non prohibet: per illum seditiosos insinuans, per hunc Iudaeorum magistros confundens, et non procurantes creditas oves. Sed ab utrisque seipsum Christus distinxit: ab illis quidem qui ad laedendum venerunt, in hoc quod dixit: veni ut vitam habeant; ab his qui contemnunt luporum rapinas, ex eo quod pro ovibus animam ponit; et ideo quasi concludens subdit: ego sum pastor bonus. Sed quia superius dixerat, quod oves pastoris vocem audiunt, et sequuntur eum, ne quis dicat: quid ergo dicis de his qui tibi non credunt? Consequenter subdit et cognosco oves meas, et cognoscunt me meae; quod et Paulus ostendit, dicens: non repellit dominus plebem suam, quam praescivit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Two evil persons have been mentioned, one that kills, and robs the sheep, another that does not hinder: the one standing for those movers of seditions; the other for the rulers of the Jews, who did not take care of the sheep committed to them. Christ distinguishes Himself from both; from the one who came to do hurt by saying, I am come that they might have life; from those who overlook the rapine of the wolves, by saying that He gives His life for the sheep. Wherefore He said again, as He said before, I am the good Shepherd. And as He had said above that the sheep heard the voice of the Shepherd and followed Him, that no one might have occasion to ask, What say you then of those that believe not; He adds, And I know My sheep, and am known of Mine. As Paul too said, God has not cast away His people, whom He foreknew.

Then that you may not attribute to the Shepherd and the sheep the same measure of knowledge, He adds, As the Father knows Me, even so know I the Father: i.e. I know Him as certainly as He knows Me.

Or He says, in condescension to our weakness, Though there were nothing else which made Me love you, this would, that you are so loved by My Father, that, by dying for you, I shall win His love. Not that He was not loved by the Father before, or that we are the cause of such love. For the same purpose He shows that He does not come to His Passion unwillingly: No man takes it from Me, but I lay it down of Myself:

I have such power over My own life, that no one can take it from Me, against My will. This is not true of men. We have not the power of laying down our own lives, except we put ourselves to death. Our Lord alone has this power. And this being true, it is true also that He can take it again when He pleases: And I have power to take it again: which words declare beyond a doubt a resurrection. That they might not think His death a sign that God had forsaken Him, He adds, This commandment have I received from My Father; i.e. to lay down My life, and take it again. By which we must not understand that He first waited to hear this commandment, and had to learn His work; He only shows s that that work which He voluntarily undertook, was not against the Father’s will.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. For the Word does not receive a command by word, but contains in Himself all the Father’s commandments. When the Son is said to receive what He possesses of Himself, His power is not lessened, but only His generation declared. The Father gave the Son every thing in begetting Him. He begat Him perfect.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. After declaring Himself the Master of His own life and death, which was a lofty assumption, He makes a more humble confession; thus wonderfully uniting both characters; showing that He was neither inferior to or a slave of the Father on the one hand, nor an antagonist on the other; but of the same power and wild.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Per hoc autem quod dixit de anima sua, instruimur contra Apollinaristas, qui dicunt Christum non habuisse animam humanam, idest rationalem. Quaeramus autem quomodo dominus animam suam ponit. Christus enim est verbum et homo, idest verbum et anima et caro. Christus ergo ex eo quod verbum est, ponit animam, et iterum sumit eam; an ex eo quod anima humana est, ipsa se ponit, et iterum ipsa se sumit; an iterum ex eo quod caro est, caro animam ponit, et iterum sumit? Si autem dixerimus quia verbum Dei posuit animam suam et iterum sumpsit eam: ergo aliquando anima illa separata est a Dei verbo. Mors enim corpus ab anima separavit; a verbo autem animam separatam non dico. Si autem dixerimus quia ipsa se anima posuit, absurdissimus sensus est: si enim a verbo separata non erat, a seipsa poterat separari? Caro ergo ponit animam suam, et iterum sumit eam, non tamen potestate sua, sed potestate inhabitantis carnem, scilicet verbi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. How does our Lord lay down His own life? Christ is the Word, and man, i.e. in soul and body. Does the Word lay down His life, and take it again; or does the human soul, or does the flesh? If it was the Word of God that laid down His soul and took it again, that soul was at one time separated from the Word. But, though death separated the soul and body, death could not separate the Word and the soul. It is still more absurd to say that the soul laid down itself; if it could not be separated from the Word, how could it be from itself? The flesh therefore lays down its life and take it again, not by its own power, but by the power of the Word which dwells in it. This refutes the Apollinarians, who say that Christ had not a human, rational soul.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Et quia lux in tenebris lucebat, et tenebrae eam non comprehenderunt, subiungitur dissensio itaque facta est inter Iudaeos propter sermones hos. Dicebant autem multi ex ipsis: Daemonium habet et insanit.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. But the light shined in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. There was a division among the Jews for these sayings. And many of them said, He has a devil, and is mad.

            <b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia enim maiora erant quam secundum hominem ea quae dicebantur, Daemonium eum habere dicebant. Sed quod Daemonium non habebat ostendunt alii ab his quae fecit; unde sequitur alii autem dicebant: haec verba non sunt Daemonium habentis. Numquid Daemonium potest caecorum oculos aperire? Quasi dicant: nec ipsa verba Daemonium habentis videntur. Si vero non suademini a verbis, ab operibus moveamini. Quia ergo dominus eam quae per res est tribuerat demonstrationem, silebat de reliquo: neque enim responsione erant digni.
            <p>Sed et nos erudivit mansuetudinem et longanimitatem omnem. Ipsi etiam seipsos compescebant, quando ab invicem divisi altercabantur.
          <td>
            <b>CHRYS</b>. Because He spoke as one greater than man, they said He had a devil. But that He had not a devil, others proved from His works: Others said, These are not the words of Him that has a devil. Can a devil open the eyes of the blind? As if to say, Not even the words themselves are those of one that has a devil; but if the words do not convince you, be persuaded by the works. Our Lord having already given proof who He was by His works, was silent. They were unworthy of an answer. Indeed, as they disagreed amongst themselves, an answer was unnecessary. Their opposition only brought out, for our imitation, our Lord’s gentleness, and long suffering.
            <p><b>ALCUIN</b>. We have heard of the patience of God, and of salvation preached amid revilings. They obstinately preferred tempting Him to obeying Him.

There is great malice in that speech, Tell us plainly. He had spoken plainly, when up at the feasts, and had hid nothing.

Wherefore no man takes His sheep out of His hand, any more than from His Father’s hand: And no man is able to pluck them out of My Father’s hand. If by hand we understand power, the power of the Father and the Son is one, even as Their divinity is one. If we understand the Son, the Son is the hand of the Father, not in a bodily sense, as if God the Father had limbs, but as being He by Whom all things were made. Men often call other men hands, when they make use of them for any purpose. And sometimes a man’s work is itself called his hand, because made by his hand; as when a man is said to know his own hand, when be recognizes his own handwriting. In this place, however, hand signifies power. If we take it for Son, we shall be in danger of imagining that if the Father has a hand, and that hand is His Son, the Son must have a Son too.

Sed per naturae nativitatem, dum nihil Deus in ea ex se gignendo eum degenerat, unum sunt. Dumque de manu eius non rapiuntur, non rapiuntur de manu patris; dum in operante se operatur pater, dum ipse in patre, et in eo pater est. Hoc non praestat creatura, sed nativitas; non efficit voluntas, sed potestas; non loquitur unanimitas, sed natura. Non negamus igitur unanimitatem inter patrem et filium: nam hoc solent haeretici mentiri, ut cum solam concordiam ad unitatem non recipimus, discordes eos a nobis affirmari loquantur. Sed audiant quam a nobis unanimitas non negetur. Unum sunt pater et filius natura, honore et virtute; nec natura eadem potest velle diversa.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. The heretics, since they cannot gainsay these words, endeavor by an impious lie to explain them away. They maintain that this unity is unanimity only; a unity of will, not of nature, i.e. that the two are one, not in that they are the same, but in that they will the same. But they are one, not by any economy merely, but by the nativity of the Son’s nature, since there is no falling off of the Father’s divinity in begetting Him. They are one whilst the sheep that are not plucked out of the Son’s hand, are not plucked out of the Father’s hand: whilst in Him working, the Father works; whilst He is in the Father, and the Father in Him. This unity, not creation but nativity, not will but power, not unanimity but nature accomplishes. But we deny not therefore the unanimity of the Father and Son; for the heretics, because we refuse to admit concord in the place of unity, accuse us of making a disagreement between the Father and Son. We deny not unanimity, but we place it on the ground of unity. The Father and Son are one in respect of nature, honor, and virtue: and the same nature cannot will different things.

In another place He makes a threefold division of the Scriptures; All things must he fulfilled which were written in the Law of Moses, and in the Prophets, and in the Psalms concerning Me. Now He calls the Psalms the Law, and thus argues from them; If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot be broken, say you of Him whom the Father has sanctified, and sent into tile world, you blaspheme, because I said, I am the Son of God?

Cum enim lex huius nominis appellationem sanctis hominibus decerneret, et sermo Dei indissolubilis confirmaret hanc impartiti nominis professionem; iam ergo non est criminis, quod se Deum, cum homo sit, faciat, cum eos qui homines sunt, deos lex dixerit. Et si a ceteris hominibus non irreligiosa huius nominis usurpatio est: ab eo homine quem sanctificavit pater, non impudenter usurpari videtur, quia Dei filium se dixerit, cum praecellat ceteros per id quod sanctificatus in filium est, beato Paulo dicente quod praedestinatus est filius in virtute secundum spiritum sanctificationis: omnis enim haec de homine responsio est, quod Dei filius etiam hominis filius est.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Before proving that He and His Father are one, He answers the absurd and foolish charge brought against Him, that He being man made Himself God. When the Law applied this title to holy men, and the indelible word of God sanctioned this use of the incommunicable name, it could not be a crime in Him, even though He were man, to make Himself God. The Law called those who were mere men, gods; and if any man could bear the name religiously, and without arrogance, surely that man could, who was sanctified by the Father, in a sense in which none else is sanctified to the Sonship; as the blessed Paul said, Declared to be the Son, of God with power, according to the Spirit of holiness. For or all this reply refers to Himself as man; the Son of God being also the Son of man.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or sanctified, i.e. in begetting, gave Him holiness, begat Him holy. If men to whom the word of God came were called gods, much more the Word of God Himself is God. If men by partaking of the word of God were made gods, much more is the Word of which they partake, God.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, sanctified, i.e. set apart to be sacrificed for the world: a proof that He was God in a higher sense than the rest. To save the world is a divine work, not that of a man made divine by grace.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, we must consider this a speech of humility, made to conciliate men. After it he leads them to higher things; If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not; which is as much as to say, that He is not inferior to the Father. As they could not see His substance, He directs them to His works, as being like and equal to the Father’s. For the equality of their works, proved tile equality of their power.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hilarius</b>: Quid hic adoptio, quid indulgentia nominis loci invenit, ne ex natura Dei filius sit, cum Dei filius ex naturae paternae operibus credendus sit? Non exaequatur ac similis est Deo creatura, neque ei naturae alienae potestas comparatur. Gerere autem se, non sua, sed quae patris sunt, testatur, ne per magnificentiam gestorum naturae nativitas auferatur. Et quia sub sacramento assumpti corporis nati ex Maria hominis, Dei filius non intelligebatur, fides nobis intimatur ex gestis, cum ait si autem facio, et si mihi non vultis credere, operibus credite. Cur enim sacramentum nati hominis intelligentiam divinae nativitatis impediat, cum divina nativitas omne opus suum sub mysterio assumpti hominis exequatur? Faciens igitur opera patris, demonstrare debuit quid esset operibus credendum; nam sequitur ut cognoscatis et credatis quia pater in me est, et ego in patre. Hoc est illud Dei filius sum; hoc est illud ego et pater unum sumus.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. What place has adoption, or the mere conception of a name then, that we should not believe Him to be the Son of God by nature, when He tells us to believe Him to be the Son of God, because the Father’s nature showed itself in Him by His works? A creature is not equal and like to God: no other nature has power comparable to the divine. He declares that He is carrying on not His own work, but the Father’s, lest in the greatness of the works, the nativity of His nature be forgotten. And as under the sacrament of the assumption of a human body in is the womb of Mary, the Son of God was not discerned, this must be gathered from His work; But if I do, though you believe not Me, believe the works. Why does the sacrament of a human birth hinder the understanding of the divine, when the divine birth accomplishes all its work by aid of the human? Then He tells them what they should gather from His works; That you may know and believe that the Father is in Me, and I in Him. The same declaration again, I am the Son of God: I and the Father are one.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non enim filius sic dicit in me est pater et ego in illo, quomodo possunt dicere homines: si enim bene cogitemus et bene vivamus, in Deo sumus, et Deus in nobis est, quasi participantes eius gratiam et illuminati ab ipso: unigenitus autem Dei filius in patre est, et pater in illo tamquam aequalis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Son does not say, The Father is in Me, and I in Him, in the sense in which men who think and act aright may say the like; meaning that they partake of God’s grace, and are enlightened by His Spirit. The Only-begotten Son of God is in the Father, and the Father in Him, as an equal in an equal.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Dixerat Evangelista, dominum trans Iordanem abiisse, tuncque Lazarum contigit infirmari; unde dicitur erat quidam languens Lazarus a Bethania. Hinc est quod in quibusdam exemplaribus copulativa coniunctio et posita invenitur, ut sequentia verba superioribus connexa videantur. Interpretatur autem Lazarus adiutus. Inter omnes enim mortuos quos dominus suscitavit, hic magis ab eo adiuvatur, quem non solum mortuum, sed quatriduanum suscitavit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. After our Lord had departed to the other side of Jordan, it happened that Lazarus fell sick: A certain man was sick, named Lazarus, of Bethany. In some copies the copulative conjunction precedes, to mark the connection with the words preceding. Lazarus signifies helped. Of all the dead which our Lord raised, he was most helped, for he had lain dead four days, when our Lord raised him to life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Inter omnia enim miracula quae fecit dominus, Lazari resurrectio praecipue praedicatur. Sed si attendamus quis fecerit, delectari debemus potius quam mirari. Ille suscitavit hominem qui fecit hominem: plus enim est hominem creare quam resuscitare. Infirmabatur autem in Bethania Lazarus; unde dicitur a Bethania de castello Mariae et Marthae sororum eius; quod castellum erat proximum Hierosolymis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The resurrection of Lazarus is more spoken of than any of our Lord’s miracles. But if we hear in mind who He was who wrought this miracle, we shall feel not so much of wonder; as of delight. He who made the man, raised the man; and it is a greater thing to create a man, than to revive him. Lazarus was sick at Bethany, the town of Mary and her sister Martha. The place was near Jerusalem.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Et quia plures feminae huius nominis erant, ne erraremus in nomine, ostenditur ex notissima actione; nam sequitur Maria autem erat quae unxit dominum unguento, et extersit pedes eius capillis suis, cuius frater Lazarus infirmabatur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. And as there were many women of this name, He distinguishes her by her well-known act: It was that Mary which anointed the Lord with ointment, and wiped His feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Igitur primum quidem illud necessarium discere, quoniam haec non fuit illa meretrix quae in Luca legitur: haec enim honesta fuit, et studiosa circa Christi susceptionem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. First we are to observe that this was not the harlot mentioned in Luke, but an honest woman, who treated our Lord with marked reverence.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Vel aliter. Hoc dicens Ioannes attestatur Lucae, qui hoc in domo Pharisaei cuiusdam Simonis factum esse narravit: iam itaque hoc Maria fecerat. Quod autem in Bethania rursus fecit, aliud est, quod ad Lucae narrationem non pertinet, sed pariter narratur a tribus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. John here confirms the passage in Luke, where this is said to have taken place in the house of one Simon a Pharisee: Mary had done this act therefore on a former occasion. That she did it again at Bethany is not mentioned in the narrative of Luke, but is in the other three Gospels.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Invaserat igitur Lazarum pernicies inimica languoris; miserandi hominis corpus quotidie edax febris incendium consumebat. Aderant autem duae sorores languenti, et casum dolentes, iuvenis aegrotantis lectulo iugiter inhaerebant; unde de eis mox subditur miserunt ergo sorores eius ad eum, dicentes: domine, ecce quem amas infirmatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. A cruel sickness had seized Lazarus; a wasting fever was eating away the body of the wretched man day by day: his two sisters sat sorrowful at his bedside, grieving for the sick youth continually. They sent to Jesus: Therefore his sisters sent to Him, saying, Lord, behold he whom you love is sick.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non dixerunt: veni et sana; non ausae sunt dicere: ibi iube, et hic fiet; sed tantummodo ecce quem amas infirmatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They did not say, Come and heal; they dared not say, Speak the word there, and it shall be done here; but only, Behold, he whom you love is sick. As if to say, It is enough that you know it, you are not one to love and then to desert whom you love.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per hoc enim ad miserendum volunt attrahere Christum; adhuc enim ei quasi homini intendebant. Ideo autem non iverunt ad Christum, sicut centurio et regulus, sed mittunt, quia vehementer confidebant de Christo, propter multam familiaritatem quam habebant ad eum, et quia a luctu detinebantur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They hope to excite Christ’s pity by these words, Whom as yet they thought to be a man only. Like the centurion and nobleman, they sent, not went, to Christ; partly from their great faith in Him, for they knew Him intimately, partly because their sorrow kept them at home.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>
            <b>Theophylactus</b>: Et quia mulieres erant, quas non decet de facili domo exire. Multam autem devotionem et fidei magnitudinem exprimunt, dicentes ecce quem amas infirmatur: tantam enim potentiam in domino esse credebant, quod mirum videretur qualiter virum sibi dilectum infirmitas potuerit occupare.
            <p>Sequitur audiens autem Iesus dixit eis: infirmitas haec non est ad mortem: quia ipsa mors non erat ad mortem, sed potius ad miraculum: quo facto crederent homines in Christum et vitarent veram mortem; unde sequitur sed pro gloria Dei. Ubi ex obliquo dominus Deum se dixit, contra haereticos qui dicunt, quod filius Dei non sit Deus. Pro gloria ergo cuius Dei? Audi quod sequitur: ut glorificetur filius Dei per eam, scilicet infirmitatem.
          <td>
            <b>THEOPHYL</b>. And because they were women and it did not become them to leave their home if they could help it. Great devotion and faith is expressed in these words, Behold, he whom you love is sick. Such was their idea of our Lord’s power, that they were surprised, that one, whom He loved, could be seized with sickness.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. When Jesus heard that, He said, This sickness is not to death. For this death itself was not to death, but to give occasion for a miracle; whereby men might be brought to believe in Christ, and so escape real death. It was for the glory of God, wherein observe that our Lord calls Himself God by implication, thus confounding those heretics who say that the Son of God is not God. For the glory of what God? Hear what follows, That the Son of God might be glorified thereby, i.e. by that sickness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc autem ut non est causale, sed eventus; nam evenit quidem aliunde infirmitas, usus est autem ea in gloriam Dei. Sequitur diligebat autem Iesus Martham et sororem eius Mariam et Lazarum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That here signifies not the cause, but the event. The sickness sprang from natural causes, but He turned it to the glory of God. Now Jesus loved Martha, and her sister, and Lazarus.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ille languens, illae tristes, omnes dilecti. Habebant ergo spem, quoniam diligebantur ab eo qui est dolentium consolator, languentiumque sanator.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He is sick, they sorrowful, all beloved. Wherefore they had hope, for they were beloved by Him Who is the Comforter of the sorrowful, and the Healer of the sick.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Per hoc etiam erudit nos Evangelista non tristari, si qua infirmitas facta fuerit circa bonos viros et Dei amicos.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Wherein the Evangelist instructs us not to be sad, it sickness ever falls upon good men, and friends of God.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Our Lord heard of the sickness of Lazarus, but suffered four days to pass before He cured it; that the recovery might be a more wonderful one. When He had heard therefore that he was sick, He abode two days still in the place where He was.

Formidabant enim et pro eo et pro seipsis: nondum enim erant in fide firmati.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He had not as yet told His disciples where He was going; but now He tells them, in order to prepare them beforehand, for they are in great alarm, when they hear of it: His disciples say to Him, Master, the Jews sought to stone you, and you go there again? They feared both for Him, and for themselves; for they were not yet confirmed in faith.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Cum autem vellent dare consilium homines Deo, discipuli magistro, corripuit eos; unde sequitur respondit Iesus: nonne duodecim horae sunt diei? Ut enim diem se ostenderet, duodecim discipulos elegit. In hoc autem verbo non ipsum Iudam, sed successorem eius praevidebat. Iuda enim cadente, successit Mathias, et duodenarius numerus mansit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. When men presumed to give advice to God, disciples to their Master, our Lord rebuked them: Jesus answered, Are there not twelve hours in the day? He showed Himself to be the day, by appointing twelve disciples: i.e. reckoning Matthias in the place of Judas, and passing over the latter altogether. The hours are lightened by the day; that by the preaching of the hours, the world may believe on the day. Follow Me then, says our Lord, if you wish not to stumble: If any man walk in the day, he stumbles not, because he sees the light of this world. But if a man walk in the night he stumbles, because there is no light in him.

After He had comforted His disciples in one way, He comforts them in another, by telling them that they were not going to Jerusalem, but to Bethany: These things says He and after that He says to them, Our friend Lazarus sleeps; but I go that I may awake him out of sleep: as if to say, I am not going to dispute again with the Jews, but to awaken our friend.

Ergo secundum potentiam suam dixit dormientem, sicut et apostolus dicit: de dormientibus autem nolo vos ignorare. Dormientes appellavit, quia resurrecturos praenuntiavit. Sed quomodo interest in ipsis qui quotidie dormiunt et exurgunt, quid quisque videat in somnis; alii sentiunt laeta somnia, alii torquentia: sic unusquisque cum causa sua dormit, cum causa sua surgit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It was really true that he was sleeping. To our Lord, he was sleeping; to men who could not raise him again, he was dead. Our Lord awoke him with as much ease from his grave, as you awake a sleeper from his bed. He calls him then asleep, with reference to His own power, as the Apostle says, But I would not have you to be ignorant, concerning them which are asleep. Asleep, He says, because He is speaking of their resurrection which was to be. But as it matters to those who sleep and wake again daily, what they see in their sleep, some having pleasant dreams, others painful ones, so it is in death; every one sleeps and rises again with his own account.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The disciples, checked by our Lord’s answer to them, dared no longer oppose; and Thomas, more forward than the rest, says, Let us also go that we may die with him. What an appearance of firmness! He speaks as if he could really do what he said; unmindful, like Peter, of his frailty.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Our Lord delayed His coming for four days, that the resurrection of Lazarus might be the more glorious: Then when Jesus came, He found that He had lain in the grave four days already.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Manserat enim dominus duobus diebus, et ante duos dies venerat nuntius, in qua die Lazarus est defunctus: ipse autem quarta die accessit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Our Lord had stayed two days, and the messenger had come the day before; the very day on which Lazarus died. This brings us to the fourth day.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: De quatuor autem diebus multa dici possunt. Diversis enim modis una res significari potest. Est enim unus dies mortis quem homo trahit de mortis propagine. Sed et legem naturalem transgrediuntur homines: ecce alter dies mortis. Lex etiam Scripturae data est divinitus per Moysen, et ipsa contemnitur: adde tertium diem mortis. Venit Evangelium, et ipsum transgrediuntur homines: ecce quartus dies mortis. Et ad tales excitandos dominus non dedignatur accedere.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Of the four days many things may be said. They refer to one thing, but one thing viewed in different ways. There is one day of death which the law of our birth brings upon us. Men transgress the natural law, and this is another day of death. The written law is given to men by the hands of Moses, and that is despised - a third day of death. The Gospel comes, and men transgress it - a fourth day of death. But Christ cloth not disdain to awaken even these.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Aliter. Primum peccatum extitit elatio in corde, secundum consensus, tertium factum, quartum consuetudo. Sequitur erat autem Bethania iuxta Hierosolymam quasi stadiis quindecim.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The first sin was elation of heart, the second assent, the third act, the fourth habit. Now Bethany was nigh to Jerusalem, about fifteen furlongs off.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quod erat milliaria duo. Hoc autem inducitur ad ostendendum quod congruum fuit multos Iudaeorum a Hierosolymis adesse; unde subditur multi autem ex Iudaeis venerant ad Martham et Mariam, ut consolarentur eas de fratre suo. Sed quomodo Iudaei consolabantur dilectas a Christo, cum iam statuissent quod si quis Christum confiteretur, extra synagogam fieret? Sed propter calamitatis necessitatem, aut quasi nobiles has mulieres reverentes, eas consolabantur; aut quia hi aderant qui non mali erant: multi enim ex ipsis credebant. Hoc autem dicebat Evangelista ad ostendendum quod Lazarus vere mortuus erat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Two miles. This is mentioned to account for so many coming from Jerusalem: And many of the Jews came to Martha and Mary, to comfort them concerning their brother. But how could the Jews be consoling the beloved of Christ, when they had resolved that whoever confessed Christ should be put out of the synagogue? Perhaps the extreme affliction of the sisters excited their sympathy; or they wished to show respect for their rank. Or perhaps they who came were of the better sort; as we find many of them believed. Their presence is mentioned to do away with all doubt of the real death of Lazarus.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nondum autem dominus castellum introierat; unde adhuc extra castellum posito occurrit Martha; unde sequitur Martha ergo, ut audivit quia Iesus veniret, occurrit illi; Maria autem domi sedebat.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Our Lord had not yet entered the town, when Martha met Him: Then Martha, as soon as she heard that Jesus was t coming, went and met Him: but Mary sat still in the house.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem assumit sororem obviam Christo vadens; vult enim singulariter Christo loqui, et quod factum est ei annuntiare; cum vero eam in bonam spem duxit, tunc abiit et vocavit Mariam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Martha does not take her sister with her, because she wants to speak with Christ alone, and tell Him what has happened. When her hopes had been raised by Him, then she went her way, and called Mary.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Primo itaque non pandit sorori, volens astantes hoc latere; quoniam si percepisset Maria Christum accedere, obviam iret, et comitarentur eam praesentes Iudaei, quibus notum fore adventum Iesu Martha nolebat. Sequitur dixit autem Martha ad Iesum: domine, si fuisses hic, frater meus non fuisset mortuus.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. At first she does not tell her sister, for fear, if she came, the Jews, present might accompany her. And she did not wish them to know of our Lord’s coming. Then says Martha to Jesus, Lord, if You had been here, my brother had not died.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Credebat enim in Christum, sed non ut oportebat: nondum enim cognoscebat quoniam Deus erat; et ideo dicebat si fuisses hic, frater meus non fuisset mortuus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. She believed in Christ, but she believed not as she ought. She did not speak as if He were God: If You had been here, my brother had not died.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi diffidens quoniam etiam absens, si vellet, posset prohibere mortem fratris sui.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. She did not know that He could have restored her brother as well absent as present.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Nondum etiam cognoscebat quod propria virtute hoc faceret; quod apparet ex hoc quod subditur: sed nunc scio quia quaecumque poposceris a Deo, dabit tibi Deus: ut de virtuoso quodam et approbato viro loquens.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Nor did she know that He wrought His miracles by His own independent power: But I know that even now, whatsoever You will ask of God, God will give it to you. She only thinks Him some very gifted man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non autem dicit ei: rogo te ut resuscites fratrem meum; unde enim sciebat, si fratri eius resurgere utile fuerat? Hoc tamen dixit: scio quia potes, si vis, facere: utrum facias, iudicii tui est, non praesumptionis meae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. She does not say to Him, Bring my brother to life again; for how could she know that it would be good for him to come to life again; she says, I know that You can do so, if You will but what You will do is for your judgment, not for my presumption to determine
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dominus autem vera quae non cognoscebat eam docuit; unde sequitur dixit ei Iesus: resurget frater tuus. Non dixit: petam ut resurgat. Sed si diceret: non indigeo adiutorio, a me ipso omnia facio, valde fuisset grave mulieri; sed hoc dicere: resurget, medium erat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But our Lord taught her the truths which she did not know: Jesus says to her your brother shall rise again. Observe, He does not say, I will ask God, that he may rise again, nor on the other hand does He say, I want no help, I do all things of Myself, a declaration which would have been too much for the woman; but something between the two, He shall rise again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ambiguum autem fuit quod dixit resurget: non enim ait: modo; et ideo sequitur dicit ei Martha: scio quia resurget in resurrectione in novissimo die. De illa resurrectione secura sum, de hac incerta sum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Shall rise again, is ambiguous: for He does not say, now. And therefore it follows: Martha says to Him, I know that he shall rise again in the resurrection at the last day; of that resurrection I am certain; of this I am doubtful.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Audierat autem mulier multa a Christo de resurrectione loquente; dominus autem manifestius suam ostendit auctoritatem: nam subditur dicit ei Iesus: ego sum resurrectio et vita: ostendens quoniam non indiget alio adiutorio: si enim alio adiutorio indigeret, qualiter erit resurrectio? Si vero ipse est vita, non loco circumcluditur, sed ubique existens potest sanare.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. She had often heard Christ speak of the resurrection. Jesus now declares His power more plainly: Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life. He needed therefore none to help Him; for if He did, how could He be the resurrection. And if He is the life, He is not confined by place, but is everywhere, and can heal every where.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Ideo ego sum resurrectio, quia vita: per quem tunc cum aliis resurget, per eumdem potest et modo resurgere.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. I am the resurrection, because I am the life; as through Me he will rise at the general resurrection, through Me he may rise now.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Illa ergo dicente: quaecumque petieris, ipse dicit qui credit in me, etiam si mortuus fuerit, vivet: ostendens quoniam ipse est tributor bonorum, et ab ipso oportet petere. Per hoc autem eius intellectum elevat: non enim hoc erat solum quod quaerebatur, ut solum Lazarum suscitaret; sed etiam oportebat eam et qui praesentes erant discere resurrectionem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To Martha’s, Whatsoever You shall ask, He replies, He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: showing her that He is the Giver of all good, and that we must ask of Him. Thus He leads her to the knowledge of high truths; and whereas she had been inquiring only about the resurrection of Lazarus, tells her of a resurrection in which both she and all present would share.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dicit ergo qui credit in me, etiam si mortuus fuerit in carne, vivet in anima, donec resurget caro, nunquam postea moritura: nam vita animae fides est. Sequitur et omnis qui vivit in carne, et credit in me, etiam si moriatur ad tempus propter mortem carnis, non morietur in aeternum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He that believes in Me, though he were dead: i.e. though his flesh die, his soul shall live till the flesh rise again, never to die more. For faith is the life of the soul. And whomsoever lives, in the flesh, and believes in Me, though he die for a time in the flesh, shall not die eternally.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Propter vitam spiritus, et immortalitatem resurrectionis. Sciebat autem dominus, quem nihil latet, quod hoc credebat; sed confessionem qua salvaretur quaerit; unde sequitur credis hoc? Ait illi: utique, domine, ego credidi quia tu es Christus filius Dei vivi, qui in hunc mundum venisti.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Because He has attained to the life of the Spirit, and to an immortal resurrection. Our Lord, from Whom nothing was hid, knew that she believed, but sought from her a confession to salvation: Do you believe this She says to Him, Yea, Lord, I believe that You are the Christ the Son of God, which should come into the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Videtur mihi non intellexisse mulier quod dictum est; sed quoniam magnum quid erat intellexit, non tamen cognovit quid est: propterea aliud interrogata, aliud respondit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. She seems not to have understood His words; i.e. she saw that He meant something great, but did not see what that was. She is asked one thing, and answers another.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Quando hoc credidi quod filius es Dei, credidi quia tu es vita: quia et qui credit in te, etiam si moriatur, vivet.
          <td><b>AUG</b> When I believed that You were the Son of God, I believed that you were the resurrection, that You were life, and that he that believes in you, though he were dead, shall live.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ’s words had the effect of stopping Martha’s grief. In her devotion to her Master she had no time to think of her afflictions: And when she had so said, she went her way, and called Mary her sister secretly.

He went slowly that He might not seem to catch at an occasion of working a miracle, but to have it forced upon Him by others asking Mary, it is said, arose quickly, and thus anticipated His coming.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. She is more fervent than her sister. Forgetful of the crowd around her, and of the Jews, some of whom were enemies to Christ, she threw herself at her Master’s feet. In His presence all earthly things were nothing to her; she thought of nothing but giving Him honor.

Sed condescendit, et humiliatur, humanam naturam denudans: quia enim miraculum magnum erat futurum, et multos per id lucraturus, sua condescensione attrahit testes, et humanam monstrat naturam; unde dicitur Iesus ergo ut vidit eam plorantem, et Iudaeos qui venerant cum ea plorantes, infremuit spiritu, et turbavit semetipsum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ did not answer Mary, as He had her; sister, on account of the people present. In condescension to them He humbled Himself, and let His human nature be seen, in order to gain them as witnesses to the miracle: When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews also weeping which came with her, He groaned in His spirit, and was troubled.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quis enim eum posset nisi ipse turbare? Turbatus est Christus, quia voluit; esurivit, quia voluit; in illius potestate erat sic vel sic affici, vel non affici. Verbum enim animam suscepit et carnem, totius hominis sibi coaptans in personae unitate naturam; ac per hoc ubi summa potestas est, secundum voluntatis nutum turbatur infirmitas.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For who but Himself could trouble Him? Christ was troubled, because it pleased Him to be troubled; He hungered, because it pleased Him to hunger. It was in His own power to be affected in this or that way or not. The Word took up soul and flesh, and whole man, and fitted it to Himself in unity of person. And thus according to the nod and will of that higher nature in Him, in which the sovereign power resides, He becomes weak and troubled.

Nam ex toto nec compati nec moerere ferinum, ac horum exuberantia muliebre. Sequitur et dixit: ubi posuistis eum?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. To prove His human nature He sometimes gives it free vent, while at other times He commands, and restrains it by, the power of the Holy Ghost. Our Lord allows His nature to be affected in these ways both to prove that He is very Man, not Man in appearance only; and also to teach us by His own example the due measures of joy and grief. For the absence altogether of sympathy and sorrow is brutal, the excess of them is womanly.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Non locum sepulti ignorare credi debuerat, sed fidem populi approbare volebat.

Sequitur dicunt ei: domine, veni et vide.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The question has an allusion too to our hidden calling. That, predestination by which we are called, is hidden; and the sign of its being so is our Lord asking the question. He being as it were in ignorance, so long as we are ignorant ourselves. Or because our Lord elsewhere shows that He knows not sinners, saying, I know you not, because in keeping His commandments there is no sin. They said to Him, Lord, come and see.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Videt autem dominus quando miseretur; unde illi dicit: vide humilitatem meam et laborem meum, et dimitte omnia peccata mea. Sequitur et lacrymatus est Iesus.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Loved him. Our Lord came not to call the righteous but sinners to repentance. And some of them said, Could not this Man which opened the eyes of the blind, have caused that even this man should not have died? He was about to do more than this, to raise him from death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Erant autem ex inimicis eius qui hoc dixerunt. Ex quibus igitur oportebat eius admirari virtutem, ex his ei detrahunt, scilicet ex illuminatione caeci nati, quasi nec illo miraculo facto. In hoc etiam se ostendunt esse corruptos, quia nondum Christo adveniente ad monumentum, praeassumunt accusationes, non exspectantes rei finem. Sequitur Iesus ergo rursum fremens in semetipso venit ad monumentum. Studiose Evangelista frequenter dicit quod lacrymatus est, et quod fremuit, ut discas quod vere nostram naturam induit. Quia enim hic magis aliis Evangelistis magna de eo loquitur, etiam in rebus corporalibus humiliora dicit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It was His enemies who said this. The very works, which should have evidenced His power, they turn against Him, as if He had not really done them. This is the way that they speak of the miracle of opening the eyes of the man that was born blind. They even prejudge Christ before He has come to the grave, and have not the patience to wait for the issue of the matter. Jesus therefore again groaning in Himself, comes to the grave. That He wept, and He groaned, are mentioned to show us the reality of His human nature. John who enters into higher statements as to His nature than any of the other Evangelists, also descends lower than any in describing His bodily affections.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Fremas autem et in te, si disponis reviviscere; omni homini dicitur qui premitur pessima consuetudine. Sequitur erat autem spelunca, et lapis superpositus ei. Mortuus sub lapide, reus sub lege: lex enim quae data est Iudaeis, in lapide scripta est. Omnes autem rei sub lege sunt, iusto autem non est lex posita.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And do you too groan in yourself, if you would rise to new life. To every man is this said, who is weighed down by any vicious habit. It was a cave, and a stone lay upon it. The dead under the stone is the guilty under the Law. For the Law, which was as given to the Jews, was as graven on stone. And all the guilty are under the Law, for the Law was not made for a righteous man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Est autem spelunca rupes cavata. Porro monumentum dicitur eo quod mentem moneat; hoc est, mortuos ad memoriam revocat. Sequitur ait Iesus: tollite lapidem.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. A cave is a hollow in a rock. It is called a monument, because it reminds us of the dead. Jesus said, Take away the stone.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed quare non lapide iacente fecit resuscitari? Nonne poterat qui corpus movit mortuum voce, etiam multo magis lapidem movere? Non autem hoc fecit, ut eos testes faciat miraculi, ut non dicant quod in caeco dixerant: non est hic. Manus enim, et accessus ad monumentum testabantur quod ipse est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why did He not raise him without taking away the stone? Could not He who moved a dead body by His voice, much more have moved a stone? He purposely did not do so, in order that the miracle might take place in the sight of all; to give no room for saying, as they had said in the case of the blind man, This is not he. Now they might go into the grave, and feel and see that this was the man.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Mystice autem dicit removete lapidem, removete legis pondus, gratiam praedicate.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Mary and Martha, the sisters of Lazarus, though they had often seen Christ raise the dead, did not fully believe that He could raise their brother; Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said to Him, Lord, by this time he stinks, for he has been dead four days.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Martha said this from weakness of faith, thinking it impossible that Christ could raise her brother, so long after death.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Thus everything tends to stop the mouths of the unbelieving. Their hands take away the stone, their ears hear Christ’s voice, their eyes see Lazarus come forth, they perceive the smell of the dead body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Christus autem rememorat mulieri ea de quibus secum contulerat, et pene ut obliviscenti loquitur; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: nonne dixi tibi, quoniam si credideris, videbis gloriam Dei?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Christ reminds Martha of what He had told her before, which she had forgotten: Jesus said to her, Said I to you, that, if you would believe, you should see the glory of God?

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non enim memor erat mulier eius quod Christus dixerat supra: qui credit in me, etiam si mortuus fuerit, vivet. Et discipulis quidem dixit: ut glorificetur filius Dei in ea: hic autem gloriam Dei de patre dicit. Infirmitates enim eorum qui audiebant, causa erant differentiae eorum quae dicebantur. Nolebat dominus interim turbare adstantes; et ideo dicit videbis gloriam Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. She did not remember what He said above, He that believes in Me, though he were dead, yet shall he live. To the disciples He had said That the Son of God might be glorified thereby; here it is the glory of the Father He speaks of. The difference is made to suit the different hearers. Our Lord could not rebuke her before such a number, but only says, You shall see the glory of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: In hoc autem est gloria Dei, quia et foetentem et quatriduanum resuscitat. Sequitur tulerunt ergo lapidem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Herein is the glory of God, that he that stinks and has been dead four days, is brought to life again. Then they took away the stone.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Mora tollendi lapidem adiacentem ex sorore defuncti causata est: nisi enim dixisset iam foetet, est enim quatriduanus, non diceretur dixit Iesus: tollite lapidem. Sustulerunt ergo lapidem: nunc ergo longe tardius ablatus est. Commodum est igitur nihil interponere inter iussa Iesu et ipsorum executionem.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. The delay in taking away the stone was caused by the sister of the dead, who said, By this time he stinks, for he has been dead four days. If she had not said this, it would not be said, Jesus said, Take away the stone. Some delay had arisen; it is best to let nothing come between the commands of Jesus and doing them.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. He lifted up His eyes; mystically, He lifted up the human mind by prayer to the Father above. We should pray after Christ’s pattern, Lift up the eyes of our heart, and raise them above present things in memory, in thought, in intention. If to them who pray worthily after this fashion is given the promise in Isaiah, You shall cry, and He shall say, Here I am; what answer, think we, our Lord and Savior would receive? He was about to pray for the resurrection of Lazarus He was heard by the Father before He prayed; His request was granted before made.

It is a phrase that is used between friends and equals. That the prayer is not really necessary for Him, appears from the words that follow, And I knew that You heard Me always: as if He said, I need not prayer to persuade You; for Ours is one will. He hides His meaning on account of the weak faith of His hearers. For God regards not so much His own dignity, as our salvation; and therefore seldom speaks loftily of Himself, and, even when He does, speaks in an obscure way; whereas humble expressions abound in His discourses.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem dixit: surge tu; sed veni foras, ut viventi loquens ei qui mortuus fuerat: propter quod non dixit: in nomine patris mei veni foras; aut: resuscita eum, pater; sed haec omnia dimittens, postquam orantis formam acceperat, per res auctoritatem ostendit: quoniam et hoc sapientiae suae est, per verba quidem condescensionem, per res vero ostendere potestatem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He does not say, Arise, but, Come forth, speaking to the dead as if he were alive. For which reason also He does not say, Come forth in My Father’s name, or, Father, raise him, but throwing off the whole appearance of one praying, proceeds to show His power by acts. This is His general way. His words show humility, His acts power.

Altius etiam clamavit, ut gentilium ora refrenet fabulantium, in tumulis esse animas defunctorum: nam quasi foras manentem eam advocat per clamorem. Sicut autem universalis resurrectio in ictu oculorum proveniet, sic et haec resurrectio singularis; et ideo sequitur et statim prodiit qui mortuus fuerat, ligatus manus et pedes institis, et facies eius sudario erat ligata. Iam mancipatur effectui quod dicitur: venit hora cum audient defuncti vocem filii Dei, et qui audierint vivent.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The voice which roused Lazarus, is the symbol of that trumpet which will sound at the general resurrection. (He spoke loud, to contradict the Gentile fable, that the soul remained in the tomb. The soul of Lazarus is called to as if it were absent, and a loud voice were necessary to summon it.) And as the general resurrection is to take place in the twinkling of an eye, so did this single one: And he that was dead came forth, bound hand and foot with grave clothes, and his face was as bound about with a napkin. Now is accomplished what was said above, The hour is coming, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Nam vox elata et clamor non inconvenienter dicitur excitasse illum; et sic adimpletum est quod dixerat: vado ut excitem eum. Sed et pater, qui filium orantem exaudivit, suscitavit Lazarum, ut sic resurrectio Lazari commune opus sit filii orantis et patris exaudientis. Sicut enim pater suscitat mortuos et vivificat, sic et filius quos vult vivificat.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. His cry and loud voice it was which awoke him, as Christ had said, I go to awake him. The resurrection of Lazarus is the work of the Father also, in that He heard the prayer of the Son. It is the joint work of Father and Son, one praying, the other hearing; for as the Father raises up the dead and quickens them, even so the Son quickens whom He will.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Exiit autem ligatus, ut non putaretur esse phantasma. Sed et hoc quod exibat ligatus, non minus videbatur esse quam resuscitare. Sequitur dicit eis Iesus: solvite eum, ut videlicet tangentes, et ei appropinquantes, videant quia vere est ille. Sequitur et sinite abire; et hoc propter humilitatem; non enim ducit eum, neque iubet secum ambulare ad sui demonstrationem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He came forth bound, that none might suspect that he was a mere phantom. Besides, that this very fact, viz. of coming forth bound, was itself a miracle, as great as the resurrection. Jesus said to them, Loose him, that by going near and touching him they might be certain he was the very person. And let him go. His humility is strewn here; He does not take Lazarus about with Him for the sake of display.

          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Dixerat autem supra dominus: propter populum qui circumstat, dixi, ut credant quia tu me misisti: nullo autem eorum credente hoc dixisset, velut aliquis hominum inscius futurorum; unde ad hoc removendum subditur multi ergo ex Iudaeis qui venerant ad Mariam et Martham, et viderant quae fecit crediderunt in eum. Quidam autem ex ipsis abierunt ad Pharisaeos et dixerunt eis quae fecit Iesus. Continet quid ambiguum sermo praesens: verum qui iverunt ad Pharisaeos, fuerint ex illis multis qui crediderant, proponentes conciliare Christo hostiliter se habentes ad eum; vel alii a credentibus, irritare volentes invidum Pharisaeorum zelum in ipsum. Et videtur mihi hoc magis Evangelistam exprimere velle: multos enim dixit qui per hoc quod viderunt crediderunt, veluti paucis existentibus aliis, de quibus subdit quidam autem ex ipsis abierunt ad Pharisaeos, et dixerunt eis quae fecit Iesus.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Our Lord had said above, Because of the people that stand by I said it, that they may believe that You have sent Me. It would have been ignorance of the future, if He had said this, and none believed, after all. Therefore it follows: Then many of the Jews which came to Mary, and had seen the things which Jesus did, believed on Him. But some of them went their way to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done. It is doubtful from these words, whether those who went to the Pharisees, were of those many who believed, and meant to conciliate the opponents of Christ; or whether they were of the unbelieving party, and wished to inflame the envy of the Pharisees against Him. The latter seems to me the true supposition; especially as the Evangelist describes those who believed as the larger party. Many believed; whereas it is only a few who go to the Pharisees: Some of them went to the Pharisees, and told them what things Jesus had done.

Christ troubles Himself, to signify to you that you should be troubled, when you are pressed and weighed down with such a mass of sin. Faith groans, he that is displeased with himself groans, and accuses his own evil deeds; that so the habit of sin may yield to the violence of repentance. When you say, I have done such a thing, and God has spared me; I have heard the Gospel, and despised it; what shall I do? Then Christ groans, because faith groans; and in the voice of your groaning appears the hope of your rising again.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. That Lazarus came forth from the grave, signifies the soul’s deliverance from carnal sins. That he came bound up in grave clothes means, that even we who are delivered from carnal things, and serve with the mind the law of God, yet cannot, so long as we are in the body, be free from the besetments of the flesh. That his face was bound about with a napkin means, that we do not attain to full knowledge in this life.

But even after the dead man has come forth, he remains bound for some time, i.e. is as yet only a penitent.

This speech is an evidence of their audacity and blindness: of their audacity, because they testified that He had done many miracles, and yet thought that they could contend successfully against Him, and that He would have no power of withstanding their plots; of their blindness, because they did not reflect that He who had wrought such miracles could easily escape out of their hands; unless indeed they denied that these miracles were done by Divine power.

Nam si verum dicit, salvantur hi qui in praetorio adversus Iesum nituntur, mortuo Iesu pro populo, et pertingunt ad id quod expedit. Quod si inconveniens est, manifestum est quod non fuit spiritus sanctus qui dedit haec proferri, quia spiritus sanctus non mentitur. Si autem quis velit veridicum et in hoc esse Caipham, concederetur illi quod gratia Dei pro omnibus gustet mortem, et quod est salvator omnium hominum, maxime fidelium. Fatebitur etiam cuncta quae sunt in hoc loco prophetiam esse veridicam, incipiendo ab illo vos nihil scitis; nihil enim noverant qui Iesum ignorabant esse veritatem, sapientiam, iustitiam et pacem, et quod ipsis quoque erat expediens ut hic unus inquantum est homo moriatur pro populo; non enim inquantum est imago invisibilis Dei, est susceptibilis mortis. Pro populo autem obiit, velut potens totius orbis culpam, in seipsum retorquens, dissipare ac delere. Ex hoc vero quod dicitur hoc autem a semetipso non dixit, docemur quod aliqua nos homines per nos dicimus, nulla inducente virtute ad proferendum; quaedam vero suadente nobis quadam virtute, etsi non integre exprimamus, et sic inconsequenter disponamur ad ea, insectantes ea quae dicimus, sed non intentionem dictorum; velut Caiphas ex se nihil protulit, nec dixit intentionem, quia prophetiam dicti non accipiebat. Sed etiam apud Paulum quidam legisperiti sunt non intelligentes nec ea quae proferunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Not everyone that prophesies is a prophet; as not everyone that does a just action is just, he, for example, that does one for vainglory. Caiaphas prophesied without being a prophet, as did Balaam. Perhaps some will deny that Caiaphas prophesied by the Holy Spirit, on the ground that evil spirits may bear witness to Christ, as the one in Luke, who says, I know You who You are, the Holy One of God; the intention of Caiaphas too being not to induce his hearers to believe on Him, but to excite them to kill Him. It is expedient for us. Is this part of his prophecy true or false? If it is true, then those who contended against Jesus in the council, since Jesus died for the people, and they participate in the advantage of His death, are saved. This you say is absurd; and hence argue that the prophecy is false, and, if false, not dictated by the Holy Spirit, since the Holy Spirit does not lie on the other side it is argued, for the truth of the prophecy that these words only meant that He by the grace of God should taste death for all men; that He is the Savior of all men, specially of them that believe. And in the same way the former part of the speech, You know nothing at all, is made out to be an assertion of the truth. They knew nothing of Jesus, who did not know that He was truth, wisdom, justice, an peace. And again, That one man should die for the people. It was as man that He died for the people: in so far as He is the image of the invisible God, He was incapable of death. And He died for the people, in that He took upon Himself, made away with, blotted out the sins of the whole world. And this spoke he not of himself. Hence we see, what men say sometimes proceeds from themselves, sometimes from the influence of some power upon them. In the latter case though they may not be taken quite out of themselves, and in a certain sense go along with their own words, yet they do not go along with the meaning of them. Thus Caiaphas says nothing of himself; and therefore does not interpret his own prophecy, because he does not understand it. Thus Paul too speaks of some teachers of the law, who understand neither what they say, nor whereof they affirm.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hic docemur, etiam homines malos prophetiae spiritu futura praedicere; quod tamen Evangelista divino attribuit sacramento, quia pontifex fuit, idest summus sacerdos.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We learn hence that even bad men may foretell things to come by the spirit of prophecy, which power the Evangelist ascribes to a divine sacrament, he being Pontifex, i.e. High Priest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vide autem quanta spiritus sancti virtus est: a mente enim mala valuit verba proferre prophetiae. Vide etiam quanta est pontificalis virtus potestatis: pontifex enim effectus, etsi indignus existens, tamen prophetavit nesciens quid diceret: ore enim solum usa est gratia, contaminatum autem cor non tetigit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. See the great virtue of the Holy Spirit, in drawing forth a prophecy from a wicked man. And see too the virtue of the pontifical office, which made him, though an unworthy High Priest, unconsciously prophesy. Divine grace only used his mouth; it touched not his corrupt heart.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Caiphas igitur de sola gente Iudaeorum prophetavit, in qua erant oves, de quibus ait ipse dominus: non sum missus nisi ad oves quae perierunt domus Israel. Sed noverat Evangelista alias esse oves, quae non erant de hoc ovili, quas oportebat adduci; et ideo addidit et non tantum pro gente, sed ut filios Dei, qui erant dispersi, congregaret in unum. Haec autem secundum praedestinationem dicta sunt: nam neque oves eius, neque filii Dei adhuc erant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Caiaphas prophesied of the Jewish nation alone; in which nation were the sheep, of which our Lord says, I am not sent but to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. But the Evangelist knew that there were other sheep, not of this fold, which were to be brought in, and therefore adds, And not for that nation only, but also that He should gather together in one the children of God that were scattered abroad; i.e. those who were predestined to be so: for as yet there were neither sheep, nor children of God.

Ille enim ad pietatis suae obsequium redegit quod contra illum humana crudelitas extorsit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. His persecutors accomplished this wicked purpose, and put Him to death, thinking to extinguish the devotion of His followers; but faith grew from the very thing which these cruel and unbelieving men thought would destroy it. That which human cruelty had executed against Him, He turned to the purposes of His mercy.

Et quidem si non spiritu sancto Caiphas prophetaverat, alius spiritus fuit qui valuit et per impium loqui, et sibi compares adversum Christum incitare. Qui autem vult respondere pro spiritu sancto, dicet quod sicut sacrarum intentionem Scripturarum ad utilitatem prolatam aliqui prave suscipiunt ad constituendam enormem disciplinam, sic edita pro salvatore prophetiam veridicam non debito modo percipientes, consiliati sunt ut interficerent Christum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Inflamed by the speech of Caiaphas, they determined on killing our Lord: Then from that day forth they took counsel together to put Him to death. Was this then the work of the Holy Spirit, as well as the former, or was it another spirit which did both first speak by the mouth of a wicked man, and then excite others like him to kill Christ? Answer: It is not necessary that both should be the work of the same spirit. As some turn the Scriptures themselves which were given for our good, to the support of bad doctrines; so this true prophecy respecting our Savior was understood in a wrong sense as if it were a call to put Him to death.

          <td><b>AUG</b> Not that His power had failed Him; for, had He pleased He might still have walked openly among the Jews, and they done nothing to Him. But He wished to show the disciples, by His own example, that believers did not sin by retiring out of the sight of their persecutors, and hiding themselves from the fury of the wicked, rather than inflame that fury in their presence.

And it is no less praiseworthy now to avoid giving occasion for such trial. Which we should take care to do, not only on account of the uncertainty of the event of a trial in our own case, but also not to be the occasion of increasing the impiety and guilt of others. For he who is the cause of sin in another, shall be punished. If we do not avoid our persecutor, when we have the opportunity, we make ourselves responsible for his offence.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Mystically, Jesus walked openly among the Jews, when the Word of God used to come to them by the Prophets. But this Word ceased, i.e. Jesus went from there. And He went to that town near the wilderness, whereof Isaiah says, More are the children of the desolate, than the children of the married wife. Ephraim signifies fertility. Ephraim was the younger brother of Manasses: Manasses stands for the elder people forgotten; the word Manasses meaning forgotten. When the elder people were forgotten and passed over, there came an abundant harvest from the Gentiles. Our Lord left the Jews’ and went forth into a country - the whole world - near the wilderness, the deserted Church, to Ephraim, the fruitful city; and there continues with His disciples up to this day.

The Law obliged everyone to go up to the feast: And many went out of the country up to Jerusalem before the passover to purify them. But ours is the true Passover; the Jewish one was a shadow. The Jews held their passover in the dark, we in the light: their posts were stained with the blood of a slain animal, our foreheads are signed with the blood of Christ.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Mary did not take part in serving the guests generally, but gave all her attention to our Lord, treating Him not as mere man, but as God: Then took Mary, a pound of spikenard, very costly, and anointed the feet of Jesus, and wiped His feet with her hair.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod ait pistici, locum aliquem credere debemus, unde erat hoc unguentum pretiosum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The word <i>pistici</i> seems to be the name of some place, from which this precious ointment came.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel pistici, idest fidelis, nec extraneis speciebus adulterati. Haec est illa mulier quae quondam peccatrix in domo Simonis venit ad dominum cum alabastro unguenti.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or <i>pistici</i> means genuine, non-adulterated. She is the woman that was a sinner, who came to our Lord in Simon’s house with the box of ointment.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod autem hoc in Bethania rursus fecit, aliud est quod ad Lucae narrationem non pertinet, sed pariter narratur a tribus, Ioanne scilicet, Matthaeo et Marco. Quod ergo Matthaeus et Marcus caput domini unguento illo perfusum dicunt, Ioannes autem pedes; non solum caput, sed et pedes domini accipiamus perfudisse mulierem. Matthaeus et Marcus recapitulando ad illum diem redeunt in Bethaniam, qui erat ante sex dies Paschae, et narrant quod Ioannes de coena et unguento. Sequitur et domus impleta est ex odore unguenti.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That she did this on another occasion in Bethany is not mentioned in Luke’s Gospel, but is in the other three. Matthew and Mark say that the ointment was poured on the head, John says, on the feet. Why not suppose that it was poured both on the head, and on the feet? Matthew and Mark introduce the supper and the ointment out of place in the order of time (Matt 26:9 and Mark 14:3). When they are some way farther on in their narration, they go back to the sixth day before the passover. And the house was filled with the odor of the ointment.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ad apostolum revoca intentionem, qui dicit: aliis sumus odor vitae ad vitam, aliis sumus odor mortis ad mortem; denique audies hinc ex unguento isto, quomodo erat aliis odor bonus in vitam, aliis odor malus in mortem; unde sequitur dixit ergo unus ex discipulis suis, Iudas Iscariotes, qui erat eum traditurus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Remember the Apostle’s words: To the one we are the savor of death unto death; and to the other the savor of life unto life (2 Cor 11:16).

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Quod alii dicunt discipulos murmurasse de unguenti pretiosi effusione, Ioannes autem Iudam commemorat, puto discipulorum nomine Iudam significatum, plurali numero pro singulari usurpato. Potest etiam intelligi quod alii discipuli aut senserint hoc, aut dixerint, aut eis Iuda dicente persuasum sit: atque omnium voluntatem Matthaeus et Marcus verbis etiam expresserint; sed Iudas propterea dixerit quia fur erat, ceteri propter pauperum curam; Ioannem vero de solo illo id commemorare voluisse, cuius ex hac occasione furandi consuetudinem credidit intimandam; nam sequitur dixit autem hoc, non quia de egenis pertinebat ad eum; sed quia fur erat, et loculos habens, ea quae mittebantur portabat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Then said one of His disciples, Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, which should betray Him, Why was not this ointment sold for three hundred pence, and given to the poor? In the other Gospels it is the disciples who murmured at the waste of the ointment. I think myself that Judas is put for the whole body of disciples; the singular for the plural. But at any rate we may supply for ourselves, that the other disciples said it, or thought it, or were persuaded by this very speech of Judas. The only difference is, that Matthew and Mark expressly mention the concurrence of the others, whereas John only mentions Judas, whose habit of thieving He takes occasion to notice: This he said, not that he cared for the poor, but because he was a thief, and had the bag, and bare what was put therein.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Portabat ministerio, exportabat furto.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non tunc periit Iudas quando accepit a Iudaeis pecuniam, ut dominum traderet: iam fur erat, dominum perditus sequebatur non corde, sed corpore. Voluit autem per hoc dominus nos admonere ut malos toleremus, ne corpus Christi dividamus. Qui aliquid de Ecclesia furatur, Iudae perdito comparatur. Tolera malum bonus, ut venias ad praemium bonorum, ne immittaris in poenam malorum. Exemplum domini accipite conversantis in terra. Quare habuit loculos cui Angeli ministrabant, nisi quia Ecclesia ipsius loculos habitura erat? Quare fures admisit, nisi ut eius Ecclesia fures dum patitur toleraret? Sed ille, qui consueverat de loculis pecuniam tollere, non dubitavit accepta pecunia ipsum dominum vendere.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Judas did not perish at the time when he received money from the Jews to betray our Lord. He was already a thief, already lost, and followed our Lord in body, not in heart; wherein we are taught the duty of tolerating wicked men, lest we divide the body of Christ. He who robs the Church of anything may be compared to the lost Judas. Tolerate the wicked, you that are good, that you may receive the reward of the good, and not fall into the punishment of the wicked. Follow the example of our Lord’s conversation upon earth. Wherefore had He bags, to whom the Angels ministered, except because His Church should afterwards have bags? Why did He admit thieves, but to show that His Church should tolerate thieves, while it suffered from them. It is not surprising that Judas, who was accustomed to steal money from the bags, should betray our Lord for money.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Ideo etiam ei furi existenti loculos commisit pauperum, ut omnem abscinderet occasionem: non enim habuit dicere quoniam propter pecuniarum desiderium hoc fecit; etenim sufficientem habebat ex loculo concupiscentiae mitigationem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why was a thief entrusted with the bags of the poor? Perhaps it was to give him no excuse of wanting), money, for of this he had enough in the bag for all his desires.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam vero administrationem pecuniae suscepisse Iudam fatentur, tamquam minimum omnium. Nam pecuniae administratio, doctrinae administratione inferior est, secundum quod dicunt apostoli: non est aequum nos derelinquere verbum Dei, et ministrare mensis.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Some suppose that Judas had the keeping of the money, as being the lowest kind of service. For that the ministry of money matters ranks below the ministry of doctrine, we know from what the Apostle says in the Acts, It is not reason that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables (Acts 6:2).

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Christus autem multa condescensione ad Iudam utens, non increpavit eum surripientem, sed communem intulit excusationem; nam sequitur dixit ergo Iesus: sinite illam, ut in diem sepulturae meae servet illud.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Christ, with great forbearance, does not rebuke Judas for his thieving, in order to deprive him of all excuse for betraying Him.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Then said Jesus, Let her alone: against the clay of My burying has she kept this: meaning that He was about to die, and that this ointment was suitable for His burial. So to Mary who was not able to be present, though much wishing, at the anointing of the dead body, was it given to do Him this office in His lifetime.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Again, as if to remind His betrayer, He alludes to His burial; For the poor you have always with you, but Me you have not always: as if He said, I am a burden, a trouble to you; but wait a little, and I shall be gone.

Vel aliter. In Iudae persona significati sunt in Ecclesia mali: si enim bonus homo es, habes Christum et in praesenti per fidem et sacramentum, et habebis semper: quia cum hinc exieris, ad illum venies, qui dixit latroni: hodie mecum eris in Paradiso. Si autem male versaris, videris habere in praesenti Christum, quia baptizaris Baptismo Christi, accedis ad altare Christi; sed male vivendo non semper habebis. Non autem dixit: habes, sed habebis, quia unus malus corpus malorum significat. Sequitur cognovit ergo turba multa ex Iudaeis quia illic esset, et venerunt, non propter Iesum tantum, sed ut Lazarum viderent, quem suscitavit a mortuis. Curiositas eos adduxit, non caritas.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He was speaking of His bodily presence; for in respect of His majesty, providence, ineffable and invisible grace, those words are fulfilled, Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world (Matt 28:20). Or thus: In the person of Judas are represented the wicked in the Church; for if you are a good man, you have Christ now by faith, and the Sacrament, and you shall have Him always, for when you have departed hence, you shall go to Him who said to the thief, Today shall thou be with Me in paradise (Luke 23:43). But if you are wicked, you seem to have Christ, because you are baptized with the baptism of Christ, because you approach to the altar of Christ: but by reason of your wicked life, you shall not have Him always. It is not you have, but you have, the whole body of wicked men being addressed in Judas. Much people of the Jews therefore knew that He was there, and they came not for Jesus’ sake only, but that they might see Lazarus also, whom He had raised from the dead. Curiosity brought them, not love.

O caeca saevitia. Quasi dominus suscitare potuerit mortuum, et non possit occisum. Ecce utrumque dominus fecit: et Lazarum mortuum, et seipsum suscitavit occisum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. When the news of this great miracle had spread everywhere, and was supported by such clear evidence, that they could neither suppress or deny the fact, then, The chief priests consulted that they might put Lazarus to death. O blind rage! as if the Lord could raise the dead, and not raise the slain. Lo, the Lord has done both. He raised Lazarus, and He raised Himself.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Nullum autem miraculum Christi eos ita furere fecit: hoc enim mirabilius erat, et coram multis factum est; et erat inopinabile, mortuum quatriduanum videre ambulantem et loquentem. Aliter etiam isti in aliis putabant criminari sabbati solutionem, et hac via abducere turbas; hic autem quia a nullo habebant conqueri contra Iesum, adversum Lazarum faciunt conatum: itaque et in caeco hoc fecissent, nisi haberent accusationem de sabbato. Aliter autem. Ille quidem ignobilis erat, et eiecerunt eum de templo: hic vero clarus. Hoc etiam eos mordebat quod festivitatem instantem omnes dimittentes, Bethaniam veniebant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. No other miracle of Christ excited such rage as this. It was so public, and so wonderful, to see a man walking and talking after he had been dead four days. And the fact was so undeniable. In the case of some other miracles they had charged Him with breaking the Sabbath, and so diverted people’s minds: but here there was nothing to find fault with, and therefore they vent their anger upon Lazarus. They would have done the same to the blind man, had they not had the charge to make of breaking the Sabbath. Then again the latter was a poor man, and they cast him out of the temple, but Lazarus was a man of rank, as is plain from the number who came to comfort his sisters. It vexed them to see all leaving the feast, which was now coming on, and going to Bethany.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Mystice autem quod ante sex dies venerat Bethaniam, significat quod ille qui sex diebus omnia fecerat, et sexto die hominem creaverat, ipsa sexta mundi aetate, sexta feria, sexta hora redimere mundum venerat. Coena autem dominica, fides est Ecclesiae, quae per dilectionem operatur. Martha ministrat, cum fidelis anima opera suae devotionis domino impendit. Lazarus unus erat ex discumbentibus, cum ii qui post peccatorum mortem resuscitati sunt ad iustitiam, una cum eis qui in sua permanserunt iustitia, de praesentia veritatis exsultant, et caelestis gratiae muneribus aluntur. Et bene in Bethania celebratur, quae interpretatur domus obedientiae: nam Ecclesia est obedientiae domus.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Mystically, that He came to Bethany six days before the passover, means, that He who made all things in six days, who created man on the sixth, in the sixth age of the world, the sixth day, the sixth hour, came to redeem mankind. The Lord’s Supper is the faith of the Church, working by love. Martha serves, whenever a believing soul devotes itself to the worship of the Lord. Lazarus is one of them that sit at table, when those who have been raised from the death of sin, rejoice together with the righteous, who have been ever such, in the presence of truth, and are fed with the gifts of heavenly grace. The banquet is given in Bethany, which means, house of obedience, i.e. in the Church: for the Church is the house of obedience.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Unguentum autem quo Maria unxit pedes Iesu, iustitia fuit, ideo libra fuit. Erat autem unguentum nardi pistici pretiosi. Pistis Graece, Latine fides dicitur. Quaerebas operari iustitiam? Iustus ex fide vivit. Unge pedes Iesu bene vivendo, dominica sectare vestigia, capillis terge; si habes superflua, da pauperibus, et domini pedes tersisti: capilli enim superflua corporis videntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The ointment with which Mary anointed the feet of Jesus was justice. It was therefore a pound. It was ointment of spikenard (pistici) too very precious. Greek for faith. Do you seek to do justice? The just live by faith (Heb 10:38). Anoint the feet of Jesus by good living, follow the Lord’s footsteps: if you have a superfluity, give to the poor, and you have wiped the Lord’s feet; for the hair is a superfluous part of the body.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Et notandum, quod primo tantum pedes unxerat, hic autem pedes et caput unxit; ibi rudimenta poenitentium, hic iustitia perfectarum designatur animarum. Per caput enim domini sublimitas divinitatis, per pedes humilitas incarnationis exprimitur; vel per caput ipse Christus, per pedes pauperes, qui sunt membra eius.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. And observe, on the first occasion of her anointing, she anointed His feet only, but now she anoints both His feet and head. The former denotes the beginnings of penitence, the latter the righteousness of souls perfected. By the head of our Lord the loftiness of His Divine nature, by His feet the lowliness of His incarnation are signified; or by the head, Christ Himself, by the feet, the poor who are His members.

The words show us the divinity of Christ. Hosanna is, Save us; and salvation in Scripture is attributed to God alone. And comes, it is said, not is brought: the former befits a lord, the latter a servant. In the name of the Lord, goes to prove the same thing.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Iudaei autem regem Israel ipsum nuncupabant, quasi sensibilem regem somniantes: expectabant namque exurgere quemdam in regem maiorem quam secundum humanam naturam, salvaturum eos a Romanorum iurisdictione. Quomodo autem dominus venerit, ostendit Evangelista subdens et invenit Iesus asellum, et sedit super eum.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Jews, when they called Him King of Israel, dreamed of an earthly king. They expected a king to arise, of more that human greatness, who would deliver them from the government of the Romans. But how did our Lord come? The next words tell us; And Jesus when He had found a. young ass, sat thereon.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hoc breviter dictum est: nam quemadmodum sit factum, apud alios Evangelistas plenissime legitur. Pullum autem asinae in quo nemo sederat (hoc enim apud alios Evangelistas invenitur), intelligimus populum gentium, qui legem domini non acceperat; asinam vero (quia utrumque domino adductum est), plebem eius quae veniebat ex populo Israel.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. John relates the matter briefly, the other Evangelists are more full. The ass, we read in them, was the foal of an ass on which no man had sat: i.e. the Gentile world, who had not received our Lord. The other ass, which was brought, (not the foal, for there were two,) is the believing Jew.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Fecit ergo hoc, prophetice aliquid figurans: quoniam videlicet immundum gentium populum debebat subiectum habere; et prophetiam quamdam implens.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did this prophetically, to figure the unclean Gentiles being brought into subjection to the Gospel; and also as a fulfillment of prophecy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Adhibetur autem huic facto propheticum testimonium, ut appareat quoniam maligni principes Iudaeorum eum non intelligebant in quo implebantur quae legebant; unde sequitur sicut scriptum est: noli timere, filia Sion: ecce rex tuus venit tibi sedens super pullum asinae. In illo populo erat filia Sion: ipsa est Ierusalem, quae est Sion, cui dicitur: noli timere illum, agnosce qui a te laudatur; et noli trepidare cum patitur, quia ille sanguis funditur per quem tuum delictum deleatur, et vita redimatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This act of our Lord’s is pointed to in the Prophets, though the malignant rulers of the Jews did not see in it any fulfillment of prophecy: As it is written, Fear not, daughter of Sion, behold your King comes sitting on an ass’s colt. Yea, in that nation though reprobate, though blind, there remained still the daughter of Sion; even Jerusalem. To her it is said, Fear not, acknowledge Him whom you praise, and tremble not when He suffers. That blood it is which shall wipe away your sins, and redeem your life
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Quia reges eorum iniusti fuerant, et eos obnoxios bellis faciebant, confide, ait, hic non talis, sed mitis et mansuetus; quod ostendit ab asino: non enim exercitum habens intrabat, sed asinum habens solum. Vide autem Evangelistae sapientiam: non verecundatur priorem ignorantiam divulgare; nam sequitur haec non cognoverunt discipuli eius primum, sed quando glorificatus est Iesus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: Whereas they had had wicked kings, who had subjected them to wars, He said to them, Trust Me, I am not such as they, but gentle and mild: which He showed by the manner of His entrance. For He did not enter at the head of an army, but simply riding on an ass. And observe the philosophy of the Evangelist, who is not ashamed of confessing his ignorance at the time of what these things meant: These things understood not the disciple at the first, but when Jesus was glorified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Idest, quando virtutem suae resurrectionis ostendit, tunc recordati sunt quod haec erant scripta de eo, et haec fecerunt ei, idest non alia quam quae scripta erant de eo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. i.e. When He showed the power of His resurrection, then they remembered that these things were written of Him, and that they had done these things to Him, i.e. those things that were written of Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc autem ignorabant, quoniam ipse non revelavit eis: scandalizasset enim eos, si rex existens talia passurus erat; et etiam non suscepissent statim cognitionem regni de quo hic dicebatur: de regno enim temporali hoc dici putassent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord had not then revealed these things to them. Indeed it would have been a scandal to them had they known Him to be King at the time of His sufferings. Nor would they have understood the nature of His kingdom, but have mistaken it for a temporal one.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Aspice autem consequentiam passionis. Suscitavit Lazarum, hoc omnium novissime reservans miraculum, et ob hoc plurimi concurrebant et credebant; unde sequitur testimonium ergo perhibebat turba, quae cum eo erat quando vocavit Lazarum de monumento, et suscitavit eum a mortuis: propterea et obviam venit ei turba, quia audierunt eum fecisse hoc signum. Exinde livor et insidiae; unde sequitur Pharisaei autem dicebant ad semetipsos: videtis quia nihil proficimus: ecce mundus totus post eum abiit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. See then the consequences of our Lord’s passion. It was not to no purpose that He had reserved His greatest miracle for the last. For the resurrection of Lazarus it was that made the crowd believe in Him. The people therefore that was with Him when He called Lazarus out of his grave, and raised him from the dead, bare record. For this cause the people also met Him, for that they heard that He had done this miracle. Hence the spite and plotting of the Pharisees: The Pharisees therefore said among themselves, Perceive you how you prevail nothing? behold the world is gone after Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Turba turbavit turbam. Quid autem invidet caeca turba, quia post eum abiit mundus per quem factus est mundus?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The crowd was disturbed by the crowd. But why grudge that blind crowd, that the world should go after Him, by Whom the world was made?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Mundum enim hic turbam dicunt. Videtur autem mihi hoc dictum esse eorum qui sani quidem erant, non audebant autem propalari: demum ab eventu deterrebant alios, quasi inconsummabilia tentantes.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The world means here the crowd. This seems to be the speech of that part who were sound in their faith, but dared not profess it. They try to deter the rest by exposing the insuperable difficulties they would have to contend with.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ac si dicerent: quantumcumque insidiemini, tanto hic augetur, et gloria eius intenditur: quis ergo profectus de tantis insidiis?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if they said, The more you attack Him, the more will His power and reputation increase. What use then of these attempts?

Forsitan aliquis putat ideo se dixisse glorificatum, quia gentiles volebant eum videre. Non ita est; sed videbat gentiles post passionem et resurrectionem suam in omnibus gentibus credituros. Ex occasione igitur istorum gentilium qui eum videre cupiebant, annuntiat futuram plenitudinem gentium, et promittit iam adesse horam glorificationis suae, qua facta in caelis gentes fuerant crediturae, secundum illud: exaltare super caelos, Deus, et super omnem terram gloria tua. Sed altitudinem glorificationis oportuit ut praecederet humilitas passionis; unde adiunxit amen, amen, dico vobis: nisi granum frumenti cadens in terram mortuum fuerit, ipsum solum manet; si autem mortuum fuerit, multum fructum affert. Se autem dicebat granum mortificandum in infidelitate Iudaeorum, multiplicandum in fide populorum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Listen we to the voice of the corner stone: And Jesus answered them, saying, The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. Did He think Himself glorified, because the Gentiles wished to see? No. But He saw that after His passion and resurrection, the Gentiles in all lands would believe in Him; and took occasion from this request of some Gentiles to see Him, to announce the approaching fullness of the Gentiles, for that the hour of His being glorified was now at hand, and that after He was glorified in the heavens, the Gentiles would believe; according to the passage in the Psalm, Set up Yourself, O God, above the heavens, and your glory above all the earth (Ps 56 and 107). But it was necessary that His exaltation and glory should be preceded by His humiliation and passion; wherefore He says, Verily, verily, I say to you, Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abides alone: out if it die, it brings forth much fruit. That corn was He, to be mortified in the unbelief of the Jews, to be multiplied in the faith of the Gentiles.

Si autem in seminibus hoc accidit, multo magis in me. Quia igitur de reliquo debebat mittere discipulos ad gentes, videt autem gentiles praesilientes ad fidem, ostendit quod tempus erat ut ad crucem veniret. Non enim prius eos ad gentes misit donec Iudaei offenderunt, donec crucifixerunt. Et quia de morte sua praevidit discipulos contristandos, superabundantiam facit sermonis, dicens: non solum si non mortem meam patienter sustinueritis, sed etiam si vos ipsi non moriamini, nullum vobis erit lucrum; et hoc est quod subdit qui amat animam suam, perdet eam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He illustrates His discourse by an example from nature. A grain of corn produces fruit, after it has cried. How much more then must the Son of God? The Gentiles were to be called after the Jews had finally offended; i.e. after His crucifixion. Now then that the Gentiles of their own accord offered their faith, He saw that His crucifixion could not be far off. And to console the sorrow of His disciples, which He foresaw would arise, He tells them that to bear patiently not only His death, but their own too, is the only way to good: He that loves his life shall lose it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hoc duobus modis intelligi potest: qui amat, perdet; id est: si amas, perdes: si cupis vitam tenere in Christo, noli mortem timere pro Christo. Item alio modo: qui amat animam suam, perdet eam. Noli amare in hac vita, ne perdas in aeterna vita. Hoc autem quod posterius dixi, magis habere videtur evangelicum sensum; sequitur enim et qui odit animam suam in hoc mundo, in vitam aeternam custodit eam. Ergo quod supra dictum est, qui amat, subintelligitur in hoc mundo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This may be understood in two ways: 1. If you love it, lose it: if you would preserve your life in Christ, fear not death for Christ. 2. Do not love your life here, lest you lose it hereafter. The latter seems to be the more evangelical sense; for it follows, And he that hates his life in this world, shall keep it to life eternal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Amat autem animam suam in hoc mundo qui desideria eius inconvenientia facit; odit autem eam qui non cedit ei noxia concupiscenti. Et non dixit: qui non cedit ei, sed qui odit eam: quemadmodum enim eorum qui odio habentur, nec vocem audire sustinemus nec vultum videre delectamus, ita et animam cum contraria iniungit quae Deo non placent, cum vehementia avertere oportet.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He loves his life in this world, who indulges its inordinate desires; he hates it, who resists them. It is not, who cloth not yield to, but, who hates. For as we cannot bear to hear the voice or see the face of them whom we hate; so when the soul invites us to things contrary to God, we should turn her away from them with all our might.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quia enim valde onerosum erat audire quod oportet odire animam, consolatur per hoc quod addit in hoc mundo, temporis indicans particularitatem: non enim in perpetuum iubet animam odio haberi; et emolumentum ponit cum dicit in vitam aeternam custodit eam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. It were harsh to say that a man should hate his soul; so He adds, in this world: i.e. for a particular time, not forever. And we shall gain in the end by so doing: shall keep it to life eternal.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed vide ne tibi subrepat ut teipsum interimere velis: sic intelligendo quod debes in hoc mundo odisse animam tuam; hinc enim quidam maligni atque perversi homicidae flammis se donant, aquis praefocant, praecipitatione collidunt et pereunt. Hoc Christus non docuit: immo et Diabolo praecipitium suggerenti respondit: vade, Satana. Cum ergo causae articulus venerit, ut haec conditio proponatur aut faciendum esse contra Dei praeceptum, aut ab hac vita migrandum, comminante mortem persecutore, ibi oderis in hoc mundo animam tuam, ut in vitam aeternam custodias eam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But think not for an instant, that by hating your soul, is meant that you may kill yourself. For wicked and perverse men have sometimes so mistaken it, and have burnt and strangled themselves, thrown themselves from precipices, and in other ways put an end to themselves. This did not Christ teach; nay, when the devil tempted Him to cast Himself down, He said, Get you hence, Satan. But when no other choice is given you; when the persecutor threatens death, and you must either disobey God’s law, or depart out of this life, then hate your life in this world, that you may keep it to life eternal.

Cum enim apparuerit melior, contemnitur peior. In hoc ergo nos inducens Christus, subdit qui mihi ministrat, me sequatur; idest, me imitetur. De morte hoc dicit, et de ea quae per opera assecutione; oportet enim eum qui ministrat, eum cui ministrat sequi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This present life is sweet to them who are given up to it. But he who looks heavenwards, and sees what good things are there, soon despises this life. When the better life appears, the worse is despised. This is Christ’s meaning, when He says, If any man serve Me, let him follow Me, i.e. imitate Me, both in My death, and life. For he who serves, should follow him whom he serves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid ergo sit ministrare Christo, in ipsis verbis agnoscimus, cum dicit si quis mihi ministrat. Ministrant ergo Iesu qui non quae sua sunt quaerunt, sed quae Iesu Christi; hoc est enim me sequatur: vias ambulet meas, non suas: non ea tantum quae ad misericordiam pertinent corporalem, sed omnia opera bona propter Christum faciens, usque ad illud opus magnae caritatis, quod est animam pro fratribus ponere. Sed quo fructu, qua mercede? Sequitur et ubi ego sum, illic et minister meus erit. Gratis ametur, ut operi quo ministratur illi, pretium sit esse cum illo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what is it to serve Christ? The very words explain. They serve Christ who seek not their own things, but the things of Jesus Christ, i.e. who follow Him, walk in His, not their own v ways, do all good works for Christ’s sake, not only works of mercy to men’s bodies, but all others, till at length they fulfill that great work of love, and lay down their lives for the brethren. But what fruit, what reward? you ask. The next words tell you: And where I am, there shall also My servant be. Love Him for His own sake, and think it a rich reward for your service, to be with Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ostendit autem per hoc, quod resurrectio morti succedet. Ubi autem sum, ait, quia in caelis ante resurrectionem Christus erat. Igitur illuc transmigremus animo et mente. Sequitur si quis mihi ministraverit, honorificabit eum pater meus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. So then death will be followed by resurrection. Where I am, He says; for Christ was in heaven before His resurrection. Thither let us ascend in heart and in mind. If any man serve Me, him will My Father honor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Per hoc intelligitur exposuisse quod supra dixerat illic et minister meus erit: nam quem maiorem honorem accipere poterit adoptatus quam ut sit ubi est unicus?
          <td>This must be understood as an explanation of the preceding. There also shall My servant be. For what greater honor can an adopted Son receive than to he where the Only Son is?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non autem dixit: ego honorificabo eum, sed pater meus: nondum enim de eo decentem opinionem habebant, sed maiorem de patre.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia dominus ad passionem discipulos exhortatus fuerat, ne dicant, quod ipse extra dolores existens humanos facile de morte philosophatur, et nos admonet, propter hoc quod ipse est sine periculo, ostendit quod et ipse in agonia sit, et tamen propter utilitatem mortem non renuit; unde dicit nunc anima mea turbata est.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To our Lord’s exhortation to His disciples to endurance, they might have replied that it was easy for Him, Who was out of the reach of human pain, to talk philosophically about death, and to recommend others to bear what He is in no danger of having to bear Himself. So He lets them see that He is Himself in an agony, but that He does not intend to decline death, merely for the sake of relieving Himself: Now is My soul troubled.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Audio qui in hoc mundo odit animam suam, in vitam aeternam custodit eam: et mundum contemnere accendor, et in conspectu meo nihil est vitae huius totus, quantumlibet fuerit prolixus, vapor; pro amore aeternorum temporalia mihi cuncta vilescunt; et rursum dominum audio dicentem nunc anima mea turbata est. Sequi iubes animam meam; sed turbari video animam tuam: quale fundamentum quaeram si petra succumbit? Agnosco, domine, misericordiam tuam: nam qui caritatis voluntate turbaris, multos in corpore tuo, qui suae infirmitatis necessitate turbantur, ne desperando pereant, consolaris. In se ergo caput nostrum suscepit membrorum suorum affectum; et ideo non est ab aliquo turbatus; sed, sicut de illo dictum est: turbavit semetipsum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. I hear Him say, He that hates his life in this world, shall keep it to life eternal; and I am ravished, I despise the world; the whole of this life, however long, is but a vapor in My sight; all temporal things are vile, in comparison with eternal. And again I hear Him say, Now is My soul troubled. you bid my soul follow You; but I see your soul troubled. What foundation shall I seek, if the rock gives way? Lord, I acknowledge your mercy. you of your love was of your own will troubled, to console those who are troubled through the infirmity of nature; that the members of your body perish not in despair. The Head took upon Himself the affections of His members. He was not troubled by anything, but, as was said above, He troubled Himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Appropinquans enim de reliquo cruci, quod humanum est ostendit, et naturam non volentem mori, sed praesenti adhaerentem vitae, ostendens quoniam non extra humanas passiones erat: sicut enim esurire non crimen est, ita neque praesentem vitam appetere. Christus autem corpus a peccato mundum habebat, non a naturalibus necessitatibus erutum. Hoc igitur dispensationis est, non deitatis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As He draws near to the Cross, His human nature appears, a nature that did not wish to die, but cleaved to this present life. He shows that He is not quite without human feelings. For the desire of this present life is not necessarily wrong, any more than hunger. Christ had a body free from sin, but not from natural infirmities. But these attach solely to the dispensation of His humanity, not to His divinity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Denique homo qui sequi vult, audiat qua hora sequatur. Accessit forte hora terribilis: proponitur optio aut faciendae iniquitatis, aut subeundae passionis: turbatur anima infirma; audi ergo quid subiungit: et quid dicam?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Lastly, let the man who would follow Him, hear at what hour he should follow. A fearful hour has perhaps come: a choice is offered, either to do wrong, or suffer: the weak soul is troubled. Hear our Lord. What shall I say?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Hoc est, quid aliud nisi ut membra mea instruantur? Pater, salvifica me ex hac hora.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. i.e. What but something to confirm My followers? Father, save Me from this hour.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Docuit te quem invoces, cuius voluntatem tuae voluntati praeponas. Non ideo tibi videatur ex alto diffidere, quia te vult ab initio proficere. Hominis suscepit infirmitatem ut doceat contristatum dicere: non quod ego volo, sed quod tu vis; unde subditur sed propterea veni in horam hanc. Pater, glorifica nomen tuum, in sua scilicet passione et resurrectione.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He teaches you Whom you should call on, whose will prefer to your own. Let Him not seem to fall from His greatness, because He wishes you to rise from your meanness. He took upon Him man’s infirmity, that He might teach the afflicted to say, Not what I will, but what you will. Wherefore He adds, But for this cause came I to this hour. Father, glorify your name: i.e. in My passion and resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: non habeo quid dicam, ereptionem quaerens: propterea enim veni in horam hanc; ac si dicat: etsi turbemur et tumultum patiamur, non fugiamus mortem: quia ego nunc turbatus, non dico ut effugiam; oportet enim ferre quod supervenit; non dico: eripe me ex hac hora; sed contrarium dico, scilicet clarifica nomen tuum. Ostendit enim quoniam pro veritate moritur, gloriam Dei hoc vocans; et hoc evenit: futurum enim erat ut post crucem converteretur orbis terrarum, et cognosceret nomen Dei, et coleret, non solum patris, sed etiam filii. Sed tamen hoc silet. Sequitur venit ergo vox de caelo dicens: et clarificavi, et iterum clarificabo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if He said, I cannot say why I should ask to be saved from it; For this cause came I to this hour. However you may be troubled and dejected at the thought of dying, do not run away from death. I am troubled, yet I ask not to be spared. I do not say, Save Me from this hour, but the contrary, Glorify your name. To die for the truth was to glorify God, as the event showed; for after His crucifixion the whole world was to be converted to the knowledge and worship of God, both the Father and the Son. But this He is silent about. Then came there a voice from heaven, saying, I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Huiusmodi verbis per Angelum loquitur Deus, cum nil in imagine ostenditur, sed supernae vocis verba audiuntur: et nimirum de caelestibus loquens, verba sua quae audiri ab hominibus voluit, rationali creatura administrante formavit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. When God speaks audibly, as He does here, but no visible appearance is seen, He speaks through the medium of a rational creature: i.e. by the voice of an Angel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Clarificavi autem dicit, antequam facerem mundum, et iterum clarificabo, cum resurget a mortuis. Vel aliter. Clarificavi, cum de virgine natus est, cum miracula multa fecit, cum descendente spiritu sancto in specie columbae monstratus est; et iterum clarificabo, cum resurget a mortuis, cum exaltabitur super caelos Deus et super omnem terram gloria eius. Sequitur turba ergo quae stabat et audierat, dicebat tonitruum factum esse.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. I have glorified it, i.e. before I made the world; and will glorify it again, i.e. when you shall rise from the dead. Or, I have gloried it, when you were born of a Virgin, did work miracles, was made manifest by the Holy Ghost descending in the shape of a dove; and will glorify it again, when you shall rise from the dead, and, as God, be exalted above the heavens, and your glory above all the earth. The people therefore that stood by and heard it, said that it thundered.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Aperta quidem et bene significativa erat vox: sed cito ab eis evolavit quasi a grossioribus, et carnalibus, et desidiosis. Et hi quidem sonitum tantum retinuerunt; alii vero quoniam articulata erat vox noverant; quid autem significavit non adhuc; de quibus subditur: alii dicebant: Angelus ei locutus est. Sequitur respondit Iesus, et dixit: non propter me haec vox venit, sed propter vos.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The voice though loud and distinct, soon passed off from their gross, carnal, and sluggish minds; only the sound remaining. Others perceived an articulate voice, but did not catch what it said: Others said, An Angel spoke to Him. Jesus answered and said, This voice came not because of Me, but for your sakes.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hic ostendit, illa voce non sibi indicatum quod iam sciebat, sed eis quibus indicari oportebat. Sicut autem vox illa non propter eum facta est, sed propter eos; sic anima eius, non propter ipsum, sed propter eos turbata est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. i.e. It did not come to tell Him what He knew already, but them what they ought to know. And as that voice did not come for His sake, but for theirs, so His soul was not troubled for His sake, but for theirs.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ad illud enim instat vox patris quod semper dicebant, quoniam non est ex Deo: qui enim a Deo glorificatur, qualiter non est ex Deo? Ubi vide quod humilia propter eos facta sunt, non quasi filio auxilio indigente. Quia ergo dixit clarificabo, ostendit consequenter et modum gloriae; nam sequitur nunc iudicium est mundi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The voice of the Father proved what they were so fond of denying, that He was from God. For He must be from God, if He was glorified by God. It was not that He needed encouragement of such a voice Himself, but He condescended to receive it for the sake of those who were by. Now is the judgment of this world: this fits on to the preceding, as strewing the mode of His being glorified.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Iudicium enim quod in fine expectant, erit praemiorum poenarumque aeternarum. Dicitur etiam iudicium, non damnationis, sed discretionis: hoc vocabat hic iudicium, discretionem scilicet, et a suis redemptis Diaboli expulsionem; unde sequitur nunc princeps mundi huius eicietur foras. Absit ut Diabolum principem mundi ita dictum existimemus ut eum caeli et terrae dominari posse credamus; sed mundus appellatur in malis hominibus, qui toto orbe terrarum diffusi sunt. Sic ergo dictum est princeps huius mundi, idest princeps malorum hominum, qui habitant in mundo. Appellatur etiam mundus in bonis, qui similiter per totum orbem terrarum diffusi sunt; ideo dicit apostolus: Deus erat in Christo, mundum reconcilians sibi. Hi sunt ex quorum cordibus princeps mundi eicietur foras. Praevidebat enim dominus, post passionem et glorificationem suam, per universum mundum multos populos credituros, in quorum cordibus Diabolus intus erat, cui quando ex fide renuntiant, eicitur foras. Sed numquid de cordibus veterum iustorum non est eiectus foras? Quomodo ergo dictum est nunc eicietur foras, nisi quia tunc quod in hominibus paucissimis factum est, nunc in multis magnisque populis iam mox futurum esse praedictum est? Quid ergo ait quispiam: quia Diabolus eicitur foras, iam fidelium neminem tentat? Immo tentare non cessat; sed aliud est intrinsecus regnare, aliud forinsecus oppugnare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The judgment at the end of the world will be of eternal rewards and punishments. But there is another judgment, not of condemnation, but of selection, which is the one meant here; the selection of His own redeemed, and their deliverance from the power of the devil: Now shall the prince of this world be cast out. The devil is not called the prince of this world, in the sense of being Lord over heaven and earth; God forbid. The world here stands for the wicked dispersed over all the world. In this sense the devil is the prince of the world, i.e. of all the wicked men who live in the world. The world also sometimes stands for the good dispersed throughout the world: God, was in Christ reconciling the world, to Himself (2 Cor 5:19). These are they from whose, hearts the prince of this world shall be cast out. Our Lord foresaw that after His passion and glorifying, great nations all over the world would be converted, in whom the devil was then, but from whose hearts, on their truly renouncing him, he would be cast out. But was he not cast out of the hearts of re righteous men of old? Why is it, Now shall be cast out? Because that which once took place in a very few persons, was now to take place in whole nations. What then, does the devil not tempt at all the minds of believers? Yea, he never ceases to tempt them. But it is one thing to reign within, another to lay siege from without.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed quale est istud iudicium quo Diabolus foras eicitur, exemplo id faciam manifestum. Sit aliquis debitores expetens, et feriat, et in vincula mittat: deinde ex eadem dementia et eum qui nihil debet sub eumdem carcerem ducat: hic et eorum quae in alios fecit, dabit vindictam. Ita et in Christo factum est: eorum enim quae Diabolus in nos fecit, per ea quae in Christum ausus est, sustinebit vindictam. Et ne quis dicat: qualiter mittetur foras, si te superabit? Subiungit et ego si exaltatus fuero a terra, omnia traham ad meipsum. Qualiter enim superatur qui et alios trahit? Hoc autem, plus fuit dicere, quam: resurgam. Si enim hoc dixisset, nondum manifestum esset quod traheret; dicendo vero traham, utrumque demonstrat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What kind of judgment it is by which the devil is cast out, I will explain by an example. A man demands payment from his debtors, beats them, and sends them to prison. He treats with the same insolence one who owes him nothing. The latter will take vengeance both for himself and the others too. This Christ does. He revenges what He has suffered at the devil’s hands, and with Himself He revenges us too. But that none may say, How will he be cast out, if he overcome you? He adds, And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Me. How can He be overcome, who draws others to Him? This is more than saying, I shall rise again. Had He said this, it would not have proved that He would draw all things to Him; but, I shall draw, includes the resurrection, and this besides.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed quae omnia trahit, nisi ex quibus Diabolus eicitur foras? Non autem dixit: omnes, sed omnia: non enim omnium est fides. Non itaque hoc ad universitatem hominum retulit, sed ad creaturae integritatem, idest spiritum, et animam, et corpus; ad illud scilicet quod intelligimus, quod vivimus, quod visibiles sumus: aut si omnia ipsi homines intelligendi sunt, omnia praedestinata ad salutem possumus dicere; aut certe omnia hominum genera secundum innumerabiles differentias, quibus inter se praeter sola peccata homines distant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What is this all that He draws, but that from which the devil is cast out? He does not say, All men, but, All things; for all men have not faith. He does not mean then all mankind, but the whole of a man, i.e. spirit, soul, and body; by which respectively we understand, and live, and are visible. Or, if all means all men, it means those who are predestined to salvation: or all kinds of men, all varieties of character, excepting in the article of sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Qualiter igitur supra dixit, quoniam pater trahit? Quia scilicet filio trahente, pater trahit. Dicit autem traham, quasi a tyranno detentos, et per seipsos nequeuntes accedere, et illius manus effugere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Why then did He say above, that the Father drew men? Because the Father draws, by the Son who draws. I shall draw, He says, as if men were in the grasp of some tyrant, from which they could not extricate themselves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed si exaltatus, inquit, fuero a terra; hoc est, cum exaltatus fuero; non enim dubitat futurum esse quod venit implere: nam exaltationem suam dixit in cruce passionem; unde Evangelista subdit hoc autem dixit significans qua morte esset moriturus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If I be lifted up from the earth, He says, i.e. when I shall be lifted up. He does not doubt that the work will be accomplished which He came to do. By His being lifted up, He means His passion on the cross, as the Evangelist adds: This He said, signifying by what death He should die.

Memoriter tenuerunt quod dominus assidue dicebat se esse filium hominis: nam hoc loco non dixit: si exaltatus fuerit filius hominis; sed superius dixerat: venit hora ut clarificetur filius hominis. Hoc ergo in animo retinentes, inquiunt: si Christus manet in aeternum, quomodo exaltabitur a terra; idest, quomodo crucis passione morietur?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Jews when they understood that our Lord spoke of His own death, asked how that could be: The people answered Him, We have heard out of the law that Christ abides for ever: and how say you, The Son of man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of man? Though our Lord did not call Himself the Son of man here, they remembered that He often called Himself so; as He had just before: The hour is come, that the Son of man should be glorified. They remember this, and ask, If Christ abides forever, how will He be lifted up from the earth; i.e. how will He die upon the cross?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Hinc est videre quoniam multa eorum quae parabolice dicebantur, intelligebant: quia enim praevenit de morte disputans, audientes hic exaltationem, suspicati sunt hoc.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Hence we see, that they understood many of the things that He spoke in parables. As He had talked about death a little time before, they saw now what was meant by His being lifted up.

Sed aestimaverunt per hoc ostendere eum non esse Christum, quoniam Christus manet in aeternum. Deinde subdunt: quis est filius hominis? Et hoc malitiose; quasi dicant: non dicas quod propter odium tuum hoc dicamus: ecce enim non novimus de quo dicis.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And see how maliciously they put the question. They do not say, We have heard out of the law, that Christ cloth not suffer; for in many places of Scripture His passion and resurrection are spoken of together, but, abides forever. And yet His immortality was not inconsistent with the fact of His suffering. They thought this proved however that He was not Christ. Then they ask, Who is this Son of man? another malicious question; as if to say, Do not charge us with putting this question out of hatred to you; for we simply ask for information. Christ shows them in His answer that His passion does not prevent Him from abiding for ever: Then Jesus said to them, Yet a little while is the light with you: as if His death were but going away for a time, as the sun’s light only sets to rise again.

Yes: the Prophets had prohibited this very unbelief, and He came that it might be made manifest, to their confusion and condemnation; That the saying of Esaias the prophet might be fulfilled, which He spoke, Lord, who has believed, our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Satis autem ostendit brachium domini ipsum Dei filium nuncupatum: non quod Deus pater figura detinetur carnis humanae: sed quia omnia per ipsum facta sunt, ideo brachium domini dictum est. Si enim aliquis homo tanta potestate praevaleret ut sine ullo motu corporis sui, quod diceret fieret, verbum eius, brachium eius esset. Non autem patet occasio erroris his qui dicunt quia solus pater est, si brachium eius est filius (non enim duae, sed una persona est homo et brachium eius), non intelligentes quomodo verba de rebus aliis ad res alias propter aliquam similitudinem transferantur. Quidam autem inter se mussitant: quae culpa fuit Iudaeorum, si necesse erat ut sermo Isaiae impleretur? Quibus respondemus, Deum praescium futurorum per prophetam praedixisse infidelitatem Iudaeorum, non fecisse: non enim propterea quemquam Deus ad peccandum cogit, quia futura hominum peccata iam novit: ipsorum enim praescivit peccata, non sua. Fecerunt ergo peccatum Iudaei quod facturos esse praedixit quem nihil latet.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is evident here that the arm of the Lord is the Son of God Himself. Not that the Father has a human fleshly form; He is called the arm of the Lord, because all things v ere made by Him. If a man had power of such a kind, as that without any motion of his body, what he said was forthwith done, the word of that man would be his arm. Here is no ground to justify, however, the error of those who say that the Godhead is one Person only, because the Son is the arm of the Father, and a man and his arm are not two persons, but one. These men do not understand, that the commonest things require to be explained often by applying language to them taken from other things in which there happens to be a likeness, [and that, when we are upon things incomprehensible, and which cannot be described as they actually are, this is much more necessary. Thus one man calls another man, whom he makes great use of, his arm; and talks of having lost his arm, of having his arm taken away from him.] But some mutter, and ask, What fault was it of the Jews, if it was necessary that the sayings of Esaias should be fulfilled? We answer, that God, foreseeing the future, predicted by the Prophet the unbelief of the Jews, but did not cause it. God does not compel men to sin, because He knows they will sin. He foreknows their sins, not His own. The Jews committed the Sin, which He who knows all things foretold they would commit.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed ea quae sequuntur, profundiorem faciunt quaestionem; adiungit enim et dicit propterea non poterant credere, quia iterum dixit Isaias: excaecavit oculos eorum, et induravit cor eorum, ut non videant oculis, et non intelligant corde, et convertantur, et sanem eos. Si enim credere non poterant, quod peccatum est hominis non facientis quod non potest facere? Et, quod est gravius, ad Deum causa refertur, quandoquidem ipse excaecavit oculos eorum et induravit eorum cor: non enim hoc saltem de Diabolo dicitur, sed de Deo. Sed quare non poterant credere? Respondeo: quia nolebant. Sicut enim quod dominus negare seipsum non potest, laus est voluntatis divinae, ita quod illi non poterant credere, culpa est voluntatis humanae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what follows involved a deeper question: Therefore they could not believe, because that Esaias said again, He has blinded their eyes, and hardened their hearts, that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their heart, and be converted, and 1 should heal them. That they should not believe; but if so, what sin is there in a man doing what he cannot help doing? And what is a graver point still, the cause is assigned to God; since He it is who blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart. This is not said to be the devil’s doing, but God’s. Yet if any ask why they could not believe, I answer, because they would not. For as it is to the praise of the Divine will that God cannot deny Himself, so is it the fault of the human will that they could not believe.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quod ergo dixit ut sermo Isaiae prophetae impleretur, ly ut non causale est, sed eventus: non enim quia dixit Isaias, non crediderunt; sed quia non erant credituri, propterea Isaias dixit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That the saying of Esaias might be fulfilled: that here is expressive not of the cause, but of the event. They did not disbelieve because Esaias said they would; but because they would disbelieve, Esaias said they would.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc autem et in communi consuetudine custoditur, ut cum quis dicit: non possum amare illum: vehementiam voluntatis impotentiam dicit. Sed Evangelista dicit non poterant, ut ostendat quoniam impossibile est mentiri prophetam: non tamen propterea impossibile erat eos credere; non enim haec praedixisset, si credituri essent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This is a common form of speech among ourselves. I cannot love such a man, meaning by this necessity only a vehement will. The Evangelist says could not, to show that it was impossible that the Prophet should lie, not that it was impossible that they should believe.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed aliam causam, inquis, dicit propheta, non voluntates eorum: quia scilicet excaecavit oculos eorum, et induravit cor eorum. Sed hoc etiam eorum voluntatem meruisse respondeo. Sic enim excaecat et obdurat Deus deserendo et non adiuvando; quod occulto iudicio facere potest, iniquo non potest.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But the Prophet, you say, mentions another cause, not their will; viz. that God had blinded their eyes, and hardened their heart. But I answer, that they well deserved this. For God hardens and blinds a man, by forsaking and not supporting him; and this He may by a secret sentence, by an unjust one He cannot.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Neque enim derelinquit nos nisi voluerimus nos, secundum illud: oblitus es legis Dei tui; obliviscar et ego tui. Haec dicit ostendens nos incipere derelictionem et causam fieri perditionis. Sicut enim sol infirmum offendit visum non ex propria natura; ita fit in his qui non attendunt Dei sermones. Terrens autem auditores Scriptura dicit excaecavit et induravit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For He does not leave us, except we wish Him, as He said in Hosea, Seeing you have forgotten the law of your God, I will also forget your children. Whereby it is plain that we begin to forsake first, and are the cause of our own perdition. For as it is not the fault of the sun, that it hurts weak eyes, so neither is God to blame for punishing those who do not attend to His words.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod autem addidit et convertantur, et sanem eos, utrum subaudiendum sit non, idest non convertantur, etenim conversio de illius gratia est; an forte et hoc de supernae medicinae misericordia factum intelligendum, ut quoniam superbe suam iustitiam constituere volebant, adhuc desererentur et excaecarentur, ut offenderent in lapidem offensionis, et impleretur facies eorum ignominia, atque humiliati quaererent non suam, qua inflatur superbus, sed iustitiam Dei, qua iustificatur impius? Hoc enim multis eorum profecit in bonum, qui de suo scelere compuncti, in Christum postea crediderunt. Sequitur haec dixit Isaias quando vidit gloriam eius, et locutus est de eo. Vidit autem non sicuti est, sed modo quodam significativo, sicut prophetae visio fuerat informanda. Nemo ergo vos fallat eorum qui dicunt invisibilem patrem et visibilem filium, qui putant eum esse creaturam: in forma enim Dei, in qua aequalis est patri, etiam filius invisibilis est: ut autem ab hominibus videretur, formam servi accepit. Ostendit etiam se, antequam susciperet carnem, oculis hominum, sicut voluit in subiecta creatura, non sicuti est.
          <td><b>AUG</b> And be converted, and I should heal them. Is not to be understood here, from the beginning of the sentence - that they should not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts, nor be converted; conversion being the free gift of God? or, shall we suppose that a heavenly remedy is meant; whereby those who wished to establish their own righteousness, were so far deserted and blinded, as to stumble on the stumbling stone, till, with confusion of face, they humbled themselves, es, and sought not their own righteousness which puffs up the proud, but God’s righteousness, which justifies the ungodly. For many of those who put Christ to death, were afterward troubled with a sense of their guilt; which led to their believing in Him. These things said Esaias, when he saw His glory, and spoke of Him. He saw Him not really, but figuratively, in prophetic vision. Be not deceived by those who say that the Father is invisible, the Son visible, making the Son a creature. For in the form of God, in which He is equal to the Father, the Son also is invisible; though He took upon Him the form of a servant, that He might be seen by men. Before His incarnation too, He made Himself visible at times to human eyes; but visible through the medium of created matter, not visible as He is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Gloriam autem hic dicit visionem sedentis in throno excelso, et alia quae ibi dicuntur; unde sequitur et locutus est de eo, hoc scilicet: vidi Deum sedentem, et quod audivit vocem dicentem: quem mittam, et quis ibit nobis? Sequitur verumtamen ex principibus multi crediderunt in eum; sed propter Pharisaeos non confitebantur, ut de synagoga non eicerentur. Dilexerunt enim magis gloriam hominum, quam gloriam Dei.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. His glory means the vision of Him sitting on His lofty throne: I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne. Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Gloria Dei est publice confiteri Christum; gloria hominum est in mundanis gloriari.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Nevertheless, among the chief rulers also many believed on Him; but because of the Pharisees they did not confess Him, lest they should be put out of the synagogue. For they loved the praise of men more than the praise of God. The praise of God is publicly to confess Christ: the praise of men is to glory in earthly things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hos ergo improbavit Evangelista qui in hoc gressu fidei si proficerent per amorem, quae humanae gloriae sunt proficiendo superarent.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As their faith grew, their love of human praise grew still more, and outstripped it.

Nam si putaverit eum habere filios secundum gratiam, non autem habere filium aequalem sibi atque coaeternum, nec credit in patrem qui eum misit, quia non est hoc pater qui eum misit. Ne autem putarent sic voluisse intelligi patrem tamquam multorum filiorum per gratiam generatorem, non unici verbi aequalis sibi, continuo subiecit qui videt me, videt eum qui misit me; quasi dicat: usque adeo nihil distat inter eum et me, ut qui me videt, videat eum qui misit me. Apostolos suos certe ipse dominus misit; numquam tamen aliquis eorum dicere auderet: qui credit in me. Credimus enim apostolo, sed non credimus in apostolum.

Such as the Father is, such am I in nature and in dignity; He that believes in Me, believes not in Me, i.e. on that which He sees, but in Him that sent Me, i.e. on the Father. [He that believes in the Father must believe in Him as the Father, i.e. must believe that He has a Son; and reversibly, he who believes in the Son thereby believes in the Father.] And again, if anyone thinks that God has sons by grace, but not a Son equal and coeternal with Himself, neither does he believe in the Father, who sent the Son; because what he believes in is not the Father who sent Him. And to show that He is not the Son, in the sense of one out of many, a son by grace, but the Only Son equal to the Father, He adds And He that sees Me, sees Him that sent Me; so little difference is there between Me and Him that sent Me, that He that sees Me, sees Him. Our Lord sent His Apostles, yet none of them dared to say, He that believes in Me. We believe an Apostle, but we do not believe in an Apostle. Whereas the Only Begotten says, He that believes in Me, does not believe in Me, but on Him that sent Me. Wherein He does not withdraw the believer’s faith from Himself, but gives him a higher object than the form of a servant, for that faith.

By no means; seeing here is the mind’s vision. What follows still further shows His union with the Father. I am come a light into the world. This is what the Father is called in many places. He calls Himself the light, because he delivers from error, and disperses the darkness of the understanding; that whosoever believes in Me should not abide in darkness.

This, viz. that I have not spoken of Myself, but the Father which sent Me gave Me a commandment what I should say, and what I should speak.

The commandment is said to be given, because it is not from him to whom it is said to be given. But to give the Son that which He never was without, is the same as to beget the Son who never was not.

Dixit ergo pater filio id sine quo numquam filius fuit, sicut dedit vitam filio: non quod nesciebat vel non habebat, sed quod ipse filius erat. Quid est autem sicut dixit mihi, sic loquor, nisi verbum loquor? Ita ille dixit ut verax, ita iste loquitur ut veritas; verax autem genuit veritatem: quid ergo iam diceret veritati?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. If life everlasting is the Son Himself, and the commandment is life everlasting, what is this but saying, I am the commandment of the Father? And in the same way in the following; Whatsoever I speak therefore, even as the Father said to Me, so I speak, we must not understand, said to Me, as if words were spoken to the Only Word. The Father spoke to the Son, as He gave life to the Son; not that the Son knew not, or had not, but that He was the Son. What is meant by, as He said to Me, so I speak, but that I am the Word who speaks. The Father is true, the Son is truth: the True, begat the Truth. What then could He say to the Truth, if the Truth was perfect from the beginning, and no new truth could be added to Him? That He spoke to the Truth then, means that He begat the Truth.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Our Lord being about to depart out of this life, shows His great care for His disciples: Now before the feast of the Passover, when Jesus knew that His hour was come that He should depart out of this world to the Father, having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them to the end.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Pascha, non sicut quidam existimant, Graecum nomen est, sed Hebraeum; opportunissime tamen occurrit in hoc nomine quaedam congruentia utrarumque linguarum: quia enim pati Graece paschin dicitur, ideo Pascha passio putata est, ut hoc nomen a passione sit appellatum: in sua vero lingua, hoc est in Hebraea, Pascha transitus dicitur, propterea quia tunc primum Pascha celebravit populus Dei quando ex Aegypto fugientes, rubrum mare transierunt. Nunc ergo figura illa prophetica in veritate completa est, cum sicut ovis ad immolandum ducitur Christus, cuius sanguine illinitis postibus nostris, idest cuius signo crucis signatis frontibus nostris, a perditione huius saeculi, tamquam a captivitate Aegyptiaca, liberamur, et agimus saluberrimum transitum, cum de Diabolo transimus ad Christum, et ab isto instabili saeculo ad eius fundatissimum regnum. Hoc itaque nomen, idest Pascha, velut interpretans nobis Evangelista, dicit sciens quia venit hora eius ut transeat ex hoc mundo ad patrem. Ecce Pascha, ecce transitus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Pascha is not a Greek word, as some think, but Hebrew: though there is remarkable agreement of the two languages in it. The Greek word to suffer being pascha has been thought to mean passion, as being derived from the above word. But in Hebrew, pascha is a passing over; the feast deriving its name from the passing, of the people of God over the Red Sea into Egypt. All was now to take place in reality, of which that passover was the type. Christ was led as a lamb to the slaughter; whose blood sprinkled upon our doorposts, i.e. whose sign of the cross marked on our foreheads, delivers us from the dominion of this world, as from Egyptian bondage. And we perform a most wholesome journey or passover, when we pass over from the devil to Christ, from this unstable world to His sure kingdom. In this way the Evangelist seems to interpret the word: When Jesus knew that His hour was come when He should pass over out of this world to the Father. This is the pascha, this the passing over.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Non solum autem tunc sciens, sed olim. Transitum autem eius mortem vocat. Relicturus autem discipulos maiorem eis demonstravit amorem; et hoc est quod dicit cum dilexisset suos qui erant in mundo, in finem dilexit eos; hoc est, nihil dereliquit, eorum quae eum qui valde amat, decens est facere. Non autem a principio hoc fecit, sed maiora postea adiecit ut eorum augeat familiaritatem, et multam eis praeparet consolationem ad ea quae superventura erant; suos autem eos vocat secundum familiaritatis rationem, quia et alios suos dicit secundum conditionis rationem, ut cum dicitur: sui eum non receperunt. Addit autem qui erant in mundo: quia sui erant etiam defuncti, ut Abraham, Isaac et Iacob; sed in mundo non erant. Hos ergo suos qui erant in mundo, mansit amans continue, et tandem perfectam amicitiam circa eos ostendit; et hoc est in finem dilexit eos.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did not know then for the first time: He had known long before. By His departure He means His death, Being so near leaving His disciples, He shows the more love for them: Having loved His own which were in the world, He loved them to the end; i.e. He left nothing undone which one who greatly loved should do. He reserved this for the last, that their love might be increased by it, and to prepare them by such consolation for the trials that were coming. His own He calls them, in the sense of intimacy. The word was used in another sense in the beginning of the Gospel: His own received Him not. It follows, which were in the world: for those were dead who were His own, such as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who were not in the world. These then, His own which were in the world, He loved all along, and at the last manifested His love in completeness: He loved them to the end.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter in finem dilexit eos, ut et ipsi de hoc mundo ad suum caput dilectione transirent. Quid est enim in finem, nisi in Christum? Finis enim legis Christus ad iustitiam omni credenti, finis perficiens, non interficiens. Video autem posse ista verba quodam humano modo etiam sic accipi tamquam usque ad mortem Christus dilexerit suos. Sed absit ut dilectionem morte finierit qui non est morte finitus: nisi forte sit ita intelligendum: usque ad mortem dilexit eos: idest, usque ad mortem illum dilectio ipsa perduxit. Sequitur et coena facta, idest iam peracta, et ad convivantium mensam usumque perducta. Non enim ita debemus intelligere coenam factam, veluti iam consumptam atque transactam: adhuc enim coenabatur cum surrexit, et pedes lavit discipulis: nam postea recubuit, et buccellam traditori dedit. Quod autem ait cum iam Diabolus misisset in cor ut traderet eum Iudas Simonis Iscariotis, missio ista spiritualis suggestio est, et non fit per aurem, sed per cogitationem: diabolicae enim suggestiones immittuntur, et humanis cogitationibus immiscentur. Factum ergo iam fuerat in corde Iudae per immissionem diabolicam ut traderet discipulus magistrum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He loved them to the end, i.e. that they themselves too might pass out of this world, by love, to Him their head. For what is to the end, but to Christ? For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that believes (Rom 10:4). But these words may be understood after a human sort, to mean that Christ loved His own up to His death. But God forbid that He should end His love by death, who is not ended by death: except indeed we understand it thus: He loved His own to death: i.e. His love for them led Him to death. And supper having been made, i.e. having been got ready, and laid on the table before them; not having been consumed and finished: for it was during supper that He rose, and washed His disciples’ feet; as after this He sat at table again, and gave the sop to the traitor. What follows: The devil having now put it into the heart of Judas Iscariot, Simon’s son, to betray Him, refers to a secret suggestion, not made to the ear, but to the mind; the suggestions of the devil being part of our own thoughts. Judas then had already conceived, through diabolical instigation, the intention of betraying his Master.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Evangelist inserts this as if in astonishment: our Lord being about to wash the feet of the very person who had resolved to betray Him. It shows the great wickedness too of the traitor, that even the partaking of the same table, which is a check to the worst of men, did not stop him.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Had given all things into His hand. What is given Him is the salvation of the believers. Think not of this giving up in a human way. It signifies His honor for, and agreement with, the Father. For as the Father has given up all things to Him, so has He given up all things to the Father.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The Father having given up all things into His hands, i.e. having given up to Him the salvation of the faithful, He deemed it right to show them all things that pertained to their salvation; and gave them a lesson of humility, by washing His disciples’ feet. Though knowing that He was from God, and went to God, He thought it in no way took from His glory, to wash His disciples’ feet; thus proving that He did not usurp His greatness. For usurpers do not condescend, for fear of losing what they have irregularly got.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Cum ergo illi pater omnia dedisset in manus, ille discipulorum non manus, sed pedes lavit; et cum se sciret a Deo exisse et pergere ad Deum, non Dei domini, sed hominis servi implevit officium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Since the Father had given all things into His hands, He washed not His disciples’ hands indeed, but their feet; and since He knew that He came from God, and went to God, He performed the work not of God and Lord, but of a man and servant.

Deinde misit aquam in pelvim, et coepit lavare pedes discipulorum, et extergere linteo quo erat praecinctus. Vide qualiter humilitatem ostendit non solum in lavando pedes, sed etiam aliter. Non enim antequam recumberet, sed postquam resederunt omnes, tunc surrexit: deinde non solum lavit, sed vestimenta deposuit, linteum praecinxit, et pelvim implevit, et non alii impleri iussit; sed omnia operatur, ostendens quod cum omni studio oportet talia facere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It was a thing worthy of Him, Who came from God, and went to God, to trample upon all pride; He rises from supper, and laid aside His garment, and took a towel, and, girded Himself.; After that He pours water into a basin, and began to wash His disciples’ feet, anal to wipe them with the towel wherewith He was girded. See what humility He shows, not only in washing their feet, but in other things. For it was not before, but after they had sat down, that He rose; and He not only washed them, but laid aside His garments, and girded Himself with a towel, and filled a basin; He did not order others to do all this, but did it Himself, teaching us that we should be willing and ready to do such things.

Aliter quoque poterit quis asserere prandium fore intellectionem Scripturarum antiquarum, coenam vero recondita in novo testamento mysteria. Puto autem quod qui una cum Iesu coenant, et in finali vitae praesentis die secum convivantur, egent lavacro quodam, non utique erga quod primorum, ut ita loquar, corporis et animae, sed quod ad ultima et postrema, quae terrae necessario haerent. Dicit autem, quod coepit lavare pedes; nam postmodum lavit, et finivit loturam: quia pedes apostolorum fuerunt contaminati, iuxta illud: omnes vos scandalizabimini ista nocte in me. Postea autem perfecit eos lavare, purgans eos, ut ultra non foedentur.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Mystically, dinner is the first meal, taken early in the spiritual day, and adapted to those who have just entered upon this day. Supper is the last meal, and is set before those who are farther advanced. According to another sense, dinner is the understanding of the Old Testament, the supper the understanding the mysteries hid in the New. Yet even they who sup with Jesus, who partake of the final meal, need a certain washing, not indeed of the top parts of their body, i.e. the soul, but its lower parts and extremities, which cleave necessarily to earth. It is, And began to wash; for He did not finish His washing till afterwards. The feet of the Apostles were defiled now: All of you shall be offended because of Me this night (Matt 26:31). But afterwards He cleansed them, so that they needed no more cleansing.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He laid aside His garments, when, being in the form of God, He emptied Himself; He girded Himself with a towel, took upon Him the form of a servant; He poured water into a basin, out of which He washed His disciples’ feet. He shed His blood on the earth, with which He washed away the filth of their Sins; He wiped them with the towel wherewith He was girded; with the flesh wherewith He was clothed, He established the steps of the Evangelists; He laid aside His garments, to gird Himself with the towel; that He might take upon Him the form of a servant, He emptied Himself, not laying aside indeed what He had, but assuming what He had not. Before He was crucified, He was stripped of His garments, and when dead was wound up in linen clothes: the whole bole of His passion is our cleansing.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Sicut medicus plurium aegrotorum intentus curae, ab his qui magis indigent, propriam curam incipit; sic et Christus, qui foedos abluit pedes discipulorum, exorditur ab his qui magis erant foedi, et sic ultimo venit ad Petrum, quasi minus aliis indigentem lotura pedum; unde dicitur venit ergo ad Simonem Petrum; cui quodammodo ad resistendum pene munda pedum conscientia persuadebat; unde sequitur et dixit ei Petrus: domine, tu mihi lavas pedes?
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. As a physician, who has many sick under his care, begins with those who want his attention most, so Christ, in washing His disciples’ feet, begins with the most unclean, and so comes at last to Peter, who needed the washing less than any: Then comes He to Simon Peter. Peter resisted being washed, perhaps because his feet were nearly clean: and Peter said to Him, Lord, do you wash my feet?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid est tu? Quid est mihi? Cogitanda sunt potius quam dicenda; ne forte quod ex his verbis aliquatenus quidem digne concepit anima, non explicet lingua.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What is the meaning of you and my feet? It is better to think than speak of this; lest one should fail in explaining adequately what might have been rightly conceived.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Though Peter was the first of the Apostles, yet it is possible that the traitor petulantly placed himself above him; and that this may be the reason why our Lord first began to wash, and then comes to Peter.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Ex quo patet quod non primitus lavit Petrum; ex ceteris vero discipulis nullus tentavisset ante Petrum lavari.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. It is plain that our Lord did not wash Peter first, but none other of the disciples would have attempted to be washed before him.

          <td>
            <b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quaereret autem utique quis quare nullus eum aliorum prohibuit, sed solus Petrus; quod non parvi amoris et verecundiae erat. Ex hoc igitur mihi videtur prius solum proditorem lavisse; deinde ad Petrum venisse, et alios discipulos per eum de reliquo castigatos. Si enim quemquam ex ceteris lavare coepisset, prohibuisset dominum, et dixisset quae Petrus dixit.
            <p>Vel aliter. Omnes porrigebant pedes, decernentes quod tantus non irrationabiliter eorum lavaret pedes: solus autem Petrus nullam aliam considerationem conferens, tamquam reverens Iesum, non praebebat pedes suos ad lavandum: saepe enim Scriptura designavit Petrum fervidum ad insinuandum quae sibi visa sunt utiliora et meliora.
          <td>
            <b>CHRYS</b> Some one will ask why none of them prevented Him, except Peter, this being a sign not of want of love, but of reverence. The reason seems to be, that He washed the traitor first, and came next to Peter, and that the other disciples were checked by the reply to Peter. Any of the rest would have said what Peter did, had his turn come first.
            <p><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or thus: All the rest put out their feet, certain that so great a one would not want to wash them without reason: but Peter, looking only to the thing itself, and seeing nothing beyond it, refused out of reverence to let his feet be washed. He often appears in Scripture as hasty in putting forth his own ideas of what is right and expedient.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Non debemus putare hoc Petrum inter ceteros formidasse atque recusasse, cum et id alii ante ipsum libenter vel aequanimiter fieri permisissent; non enim ita intelligendum est quasi aliquibus iam lavisset, et post eos venisset ad primum: quis enim nesciat primum apostolorum esse beatissimum Petrum? Sed quod ab illo coeperit. Quando ergo pedes discipulorum lavare coepit, venit ad eum a quo coepit, idest ad Petrum; et tunc Petrus expavit; quod etiam quilibet eorum expavesceret. Sequitur respondit Iesus, et dixit ei: quod ego facio, tu nescis modo, scies autem postea.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: We must not suppose that Peter was afraid and refused, when the others had willingly and gladly submitted to the washing. Our Lord did not go through the others first, and to the first of the Apostles afterwards; (for who is ignorant that the most blessed Peter was the first of all the Apostles?) but began with him: and Peter being the first to whom He came, was afraid; as indeed any of the others would have been. Jesus answered and said to him, What I do you know not now; but you shall know hereafter.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Idest humilitatem huius doctrinae, et quomodo humilitas sufficit in Deum perducere.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. i.e. How useful a lesson of humility it teaches you, and how, directly this virtue leads to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Vel insinuat dominus quod hoc erat mysterium. Lavando enim et exsiccando pedes eorum, faciebat eos decoros, debentes evangelizare honesta, ut ostendere valeant iter sanctum, ac pergere per eum qui dixit: ego sum via. Oportebat autem lavari pedes discipulorum a Iesu deponente vestimenta, ut mundos pedes mundiores efficiat, vel ut immunditiam pedum discipulorum suscipiat in proprium corpus per linteum, quo solo praecinctus manebat: ipse namque languores nostros portavit. Attende etiam, quod cum debeat pedes discipulorum abluere, non aliud tempus elegit quam cum Diabolus iam intraverat in cor Iudae ut eum proderet, et futura pro hominibus dispensatio imminebat: nam ante hoc non erat opportunum pedes discipulorum lavari a Iesu. Quis enim pedum eorum sorditiem intermedii temporis usque ad passionem lavasset? Sed neque tempore passionis; alter enim Iesus non aderat qui pedes eorum lavaret; sed neque post dispensationem; illo namque tempore spiritu sancto superveniente, eorum loti sunt pedes. Huius ergo mysterii, dicit dominus Petro, tu non es capax; sed post haec nosces, cum illud perceperis illustratus.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or our Lord insinuates that this is a mystery. By washing and wiping, He made beautiful the feet of those who were to preach glad tidings (Isaiah 52:7), and to walk on that way of which He tells them, I am the way. Jesus laid aside His garments that He might make their clean feet still cleaner, or that He might receive the uncleanness of their feet to His own body, by the towel with which alone He was girded: for He has borne our griefs. Observe too, He chose for washing His disciples’ feet the very time that the devil had put it into the heart of Judas to betray Him, and the dispensation for mankind was about to take place. Before this the time was not come for washing their feet. And who would have washed their feet in the interval between this and the Passion? During the Passion, there was no other Jesus to do it. And after it the Holy Ghost came upon them, by which time they should already have had their feet washed. This mystery, our Lord says to Peter, is too great for you to understand now, but you shall know it hereafter when you are enlightened.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Nec tamen ille dominici facti altitudine exterritus permittit fieri, quod cur fieret ignorabat; sed usque ad suos pedes humilem Christum videre non potest sustinere; nam sequitur dicit ei Petrus: non lavabis mihi pedes in aeternum; hoc est, nunquam hoc patiar. Hoc quippe in aeternum non fit quod nunquam fit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He did not refuse, because our Lord’s act was above his understanding, but he could not bear to see Him bending at his feet: Peter says to Him, you shall not wash my feet; i.e. I will never suffer it: not for ever is the same as never.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Ex hoc autem accipimus exemplum, quoniam possibile est quemquam secundum purum propositum dicere propter ignorantiam quod sibi non prodest. Petrus enim ignorans hoc esse conveniens, primo quidem quasi dubitans suaviter dixit: domine, tu mihi lavas pedes? Secundo: non lavabis mihi pedes in aeternum: quod erat prohibitivum operis perducentis eum ad habendum partem cum Iesu: in quo etiam non tantum Iesum arguit inconvenienter lavantem pedes discipulorum, sed etiam condiscipulos indecenter suos pedes porrigentes. Cum ergo non esset expediens Petro proprium responsum, non permisit illud dominus verificari; nam subditur respondit ei Iesus: si non lavero te, non habebis partem mecum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. This is an instance, that a man may say a thing with a good intention, and yet ignorantly to His hurt. Peter, ignorant of our Lord’s deep meaning, at first, as if in doubt, says mildly, Lord, do you wash my feet? and then, you shall never wash my feet; which was in reality to cut himself off from having a part with Jesus. Whence he not only blames our Lord for washing the disciples’ feet, but also his fellow-disciples for giving their feet to be washed. As Peter then did not see his own good our Lord did not allow His wish to be fulfilled: Jesus answered and said to him, If I wash you not, you have no part with Me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ita dictum est: si non lavero te, cum de solis pedibus ageretur, quomodo dici solet: calcas me, quando sola planta calcatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If I wash you not, He says, though it was only his feet that He was going to wash, just as we say, you tread on me; though it is only our foot that is trodden on.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Qui autem recusant haec et similia tropologizare, dicant quomodo probabile est eum qui ob reverentiam Iesu dixit non lavabis mihi pedes in aeternum, non habiturum partem cum Dei filio, propter non lavari pedes ab eo, sicut propter immane scelus: et ideo praestandi sunt pedes, idest mentis affectus, lavandi a Iesu, ut sint pedes nostri decori, et praesertim cum aemulantes potiora dona, volumus adnumerari eis qui evangelizant bona.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Let those who refuse to allegorize these and like passages, say how it is probable that he who out of reverence for Jesus said, you shall never wash my feet, would have had no part with the Son of God; as if not having his feet washed was a deadly wickedness. Wherefore it is our feet, i.e. the affections of our mind, that are to be given up to Jesus to be washed, that our feet may be beautiful; especially if we emulate higher gifts, and wish to be numbered with those who preach glad tidings.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ideo autem non dixit cuius gratia hoc faciebat, sed minas imposuit, quia ille nequaquam persuasus esset; audiens enim scies autem postea, non dixit: doce igitur me ut permittam; sed quando comminatus est id quod maxime timebat, scilicet separari ab eo, tunc permisit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He does not say on what account He performs this act of washing, but only threatens him. For Peter was not persuaded by the first answer: you shall know hereafter he did not say, Teach me then that I may submit. But when he was threatened with separation from Christ, then he submitted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Hoc dicto utemur contra eos qui indiscretius se facere statuerunt quod eis non prodest: nam ostendendo illis quod non sunt habituri partem cum Iesu, dum praesumptuosum decretum observant, admonebimus illos ne immorentur male decretis, etiam si iureiurando ex multo impetu illud firmaverunt.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. This saying we may use against those who make hasty and indiscreet resolutions. By strewing them, that if they adhere to these, they will have no part with Jesus, we disengage them from such resolves; even though they may have bound themselves by oath.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: At ille amore et timore perturbatus plus expavit Christum sibi negari quam usque ad suos pedes humiliari; unde sequitur dicit ei Simon Petrus: domine, non tantum pedes, sed et manus et caput.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But he, agitated by fear and love, dreaded more the being denied Christ, than the seeing Him at His feet: Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, not my feet only, but also my hands and my head.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Manus autem lavare nolebat Iesus, contemnens quae dicebantur quoniam discipuli tui non lavant manus, cum panem manducant, caput autem submergi nolebat, in quo imago et gloria patris extiterat: satis est autem ei ut pedes lavandos porrigeret; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: qui lotus est, non indiget nisi ut pedes lavet, sed est mundus totus.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Jesus was unwilling to wash hands, and despised what was said of Him in this respect: Your disciples wash not their hands when they eat bread (Matt 15:2). And He did not wish the head to be submerged, in which was apparent the image and glory of the Father; it was enough for Him that the feet were given Him to wash: Jesus answered and said, He that is washed needs not save to wash his feet, but is clean every whit: and you are clean, but not all.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Totus utique praeter pedes, vel nisi pedes, quos habet opus lavare: homo enim in Baptismo totus abluitur, non praeter pedes, sed totus omnino; verumtamen cum in rebus humanis postea vivitur, utique terra calcatur. Ipsi igitur humani affectus, sine quibus in hac mortalitate non vivitur, quasi pedes sunt, ubi ex humanis rebus afficimur, ut si dixerimus quia peccatum non habemus, nos ipsos decipiamus. Si autem confitemur peccata nostra, qui pedes discipulorum lavit, nobis peccata dimittit usque ad pedes, quibus conversamur in terra.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Clean all except the feet. The whole of a man is washed in baptism, not excepting his feet; but living in the world afterwards, we tread upon the earth. Those human affections then, without which we cannot live in this world, are, as it were, our feet, which connect us with human things, so that if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves (1 Jn 1:8). But if we confess our sins, He who washed the disciples’ feet, forgives us our sins even down to our feet, wherewith we hold our converse with earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Impossibile autem puto non contaminari extrema animae et infima eius, quamquam quo ad homines perfectus quis esse putetur; plurimi autem et post Baptismum implentur pulvere scelerum usque ad verticem; qui vero legitime discipuli Christi sunt, erga solos pedes indigent lavatione.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. It was impossible that the lowest parts and extremities of a soul should escape defilement, even in one perfect as far as man can be; and many, even after baptism, are covered up to their head with the dust of wickedness; but the real disciples of Christ only need washing for their feet.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus ad Seleucianum</b> Ex hoc autem quod hic dicitur, intelligitur quod iam Petrus baptizatus fuerat: intelligimus enim eius discipulos, per quos baptizabat, iam fuisse baptizatos, sive Baptismo Ioannis, sicut nonnulli arbitrantur, sive, quod magis credibile est, Baptismo Christi. Neque enim renuit ministerium baptizandi, ut haberet baptizatos servos per quos ceteros baptizaret, qui non defuit humilitatis ministerio, quando eis pedes lavit; unde sequitur et vos mundi estis, sed non omnes.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. From what is here said, we understand that Peter was already baptized, indeed that He baptized by His disciples, shows that His disciples must have been baptized, either with John’s baptism, or, which is more probable, Christ’s. He baptized by means of baptized servants; for He did not refuse the ministry of baptizing, Who had the humility to wash feet.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc quid sit ne quaeramus, ipse Evangelista patefecit adiungens sciebat enim quisnam esset qui traderet eum: propterea dixit: non estis mundi omnes.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And you are clean, but not all: what this means the Evangelist immediately! explains: For He knew who should betray Him; therefore said He, you are not all clean.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Quod ergo dicit vos mundi estis, refertur ad undecim; quod vero subditur sed non omnes, dicitur propter Iudam existentem immundum: primo quidem quia pauperes non erant sibi curae, sed fur erat; demum Diabolo ingresso in cor eius, ut proderet Christum. Lavat autem pedes postquam mundi erant: quoniam gratia transcendit necessitatem; et, sicut dicit Ioannes: mundus mundificetur adhuc.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. you are clean, refers to the eleven; but not all, to Judas. He was unclean, first, because he cared not for the poor, but was a thief; secondly, because the devil had put it into his heart to betray Christ washes their feet after they are clean, strewing that grace goes beyond necessity, according to the text, He that is holy, let him be holy still.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel ipsi discipuli, cum loti essent, non opus habebant nisi pedes lavare; quia dum in isto saeculo vivit homo, humanis affectibus terram velut pedibus calcans contrahit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, the disciples when washed had only to have their feet washed; because while man lives in this world, he contracts himself with earth, by means of his human affections, which are as it were his feet.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Non dicit eos mundos, ut a peccatis erutos aestimes, victima nondum oblata; sed eam quae cognitionis est mundationem dicit: iam enim ab errore Iudaico eruti erant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: When He calls them clean, you must not suppose that they were delivered from sin before the victim was offered. He means cleanness in respect of knowledge; for they were now delivered from Jewish error.

Ille autem qui super omnia est, quantumcumque se laudet, non se extollit excelsius. Nec potest recte dici arrogans Deus: nobis namque expedit Deum nosse, non illi; nec eum quisque cognoscit, si non se indicet ipse qui novit. Si ergo se laudando quasi arrogantiam vitare voluerit, nobis sapientiam denegabit. Quomodo autem arrogantiam veritas timet? Et quidem quod magistrum se dicit, nemo reprehenderet, etiam qui eum nihil aliud quam hominem crederet; quoniam id profitetur quod et ipsi homines in quibuslibet artibus usque adeo sine arrogantia profitentur, ut professores vocentur; quod vero dominum discipulorum se dicit, cum sint secundum saeculum ingenui, quis ferat in homine?

But He who is above all things, howsoever He praise Himself, extols not Himself too highly. Nor can God be called arrogant: for that we should know Him is no gain to Him, but to us. Nor can anyone know Him, unless He who knows, show Himself. So that if to avoid arrogance He did not praise Himself, He would be denying us wisdom. But why should the Truth fear arrogance? To His calling Himself Master, no one could object, even were He man only, since professors in different arts call themselves so without presumption. But what free man can bear the title of lord in a man? Yet when God speaks, height cannot exalt itself; truth cannot lie; it is for us to submit to that height, to obey that truth.

If then I your Lord and Master have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another’s feet.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. But it is not necessary for one who wishes to do all the commandments of Jesus, literally to perform the act of washing feet. This is merely a matter of custom; and the custom is now generally dropped.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Est enim apud plerosque consuetudo huius humilitatis, cum se invicem hospitio suscipiunt, et faciunt hoc sibi invicem fratres, etiam opere ipso visibili. Multo enim melius est et sine controversia verius, ut etiam manibus fiat, ne dedignetur quod fecit Christus, facere Christianus. Cum enim ad pedes fratrum inclinatur corpus, etiam in corde ipso excitatur, vel, si iam inerat, confirmatur humilitatis affectus. Sed excepto hoc morali intellectu, numquid etiam frater fratrem a delicti poterit contagione mundare? Sed confiteamur invicem delicta nostra, invicem nos delicta donemus, et pro nostris delictis invicem oremus; atque ita quodammodo invicem pedes nostros lavemus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This act is done literally by many, when they receive one another in hospitality. For it is unquestionably better that it should be done with the hands, and that the Christian disdain not to do what Christ did. For when the body is bent at the feet of a brother, the feeling of humility is made to rise in the heart, or, if it be there already, is confirmed. But besides this moral meaning, is not a brother able to change a brother from the pollution of sin? Let us confess our faults one to another, forgive one another’s faults, pray for one another’s faults. In this way we shall wash one another’s feet.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Vel aliter. Hoc lavacrum spirituale pedum, de quo dictum est, principaliter quidem a nullo nisi a solo Iesu potest effici: secundario vero a discipulis eius quibus dixit vos debetis ad invicem lavare pedes. Iesus enim lavit pedes discipulorum inquantum magister, et servorum in eo quod dominus. Hic autem est finis magistri, ut discipulum faciat sicut se: quod de salvatore apparet, qui, prae ceteris magistris et dominis, vult ut fiant eius discipuli quasi magister et dominus, non habentes spiritum servitutis, sed spiritum filiationis, in quo clamant: abba, pater. Prius ergo quam fiant et magister et dominus, egent lavacro pedum, velut insufficientes discipuli, et adhuc sapientes spiritum servitutis; cum autem aliquis eorum statum magistri attingit et domini, tunc imitari poterit eum qui lavit discipulorum pedes, ac lavare pedes per doctrinam quasi magister.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or thus: This spiritual washing of the feet is done primarily by Jesus Himself, secondarily by His disciples, in that He said to them, you ought to wash one another’s feet. Jesus washed the feet of His disciples as their Master, of His servants as their Lord. But the object of the master is to make His disciples as Himself; and our Savior beyond all other masters and lords, wished His disciples to be as their Master and Lord, not having the spirit of bondage, but the spirit of adoption, whereby they, cry, Abba, Father (Rom 8:19). So then before they become masters and lords, they need the washing of the feet, being as vet insufficient disciples, and savoring of the spirit of bondage. But when they have attained to the state of master and lord, they then are able to imitate their Master, and to wash the disciples’ feet by their doctrine.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Adhuc autem provocans eos ad lavandum pedes, subiungit amen, amen dico vobis: non est servus maior domino suo, neque apostolus maior eo qui misit illum; quasi dicat: si ergo haec a me facta sunt, multo magis a vobis oportet haec fieri.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> He continues to urge them to wash one another’s feet; Verily, verily, I Say to you, The servant is not greater than his lord, neither He that is sent greater than He that sent Him; as if to say, If I do it, much more ought you.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Necessario etiam hic apostolos admonet: quia enim ad dignitates habebant attingere, et hic quidem maiores, hic minores, ne insurgant ad invicem, serenat conscientiam omnium.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. This was a necessary admonition to the Apostles, some of whom were about to rise higher, others to lower degrees of eminence. That none might exult over another, He changes the hearts of all.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. To know what is good, and not to do it, tends not to happiness, but to condemnation; as James said, To him that knows to do good, and does it not, to him it is sin (James 4:17). Wherefore He adds, If you know these things, happy are you if you do them.

An ipse ad aliquid est electus, ad quod erat utique necessarius, non autem ad beatitudinem, de qua dicit beati eritis, si feceritis ea.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As if to say, There is one among you who will not be blessed, nor does these things. I know whom I have chosen. Whom, but those who shall be happy by doing His commandments? Judas therefore was not chosen. But if so, why does He say in another place, Have not I chosen you twelve? Because Judas was chosen for that for which he was necessary, but not for that happiness of which He says, Happy are you, if you do them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter.

Reducemus autem haec ad illud dictum: non est servus maior domino suo, nec apostolus maior eo qui misit illum. Iudas enim, cum esset servus peccati, non erat servus divini verbi, nec apostolus, Diabolo ingresso in cor eius. Cum ergo dominus novisset qui sunt sui, alienos a se non novit: propter quod non ait: ego scio cunctos praesentes; sed ego scio quos elegerim; quasi dicat: electos meos novi.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or thus: I speak not of you all, does not refer to, Happy are you if you do them. For of Judas, or any other person, it may be said, Happy is he if he do them. The words refer to the sentence above, The servant is not greater than his lord, neither He that is sent greater than He that sent Him. For Judas, being a servant of sin, was not a servant of the Divine Word; nor an Apostle, when the devil had entered into him. Our Lord knew those who were His, and did not know who were not His, and therefore says, not, I know all present, but, I know whom I have chosen, i.e. I know My Elect.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Deinde ut non multos contristet suo sermone, subiungit sed ut impleatur Scriptura: qui manducat mecum panem, levabit calcaneum suum contra me; ostendens quod non ignorans traditur; quod maxime sufficiens erat Iudam retinere. Et non dixit: tradet me; sed levabit contra me calcaneum suum, dolum et occultationem insidiarum repraesentare volens.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Then, that He might not sadden them all, He c adds, But that the Scripture must be fulfilled, He that eats bread with Me, has lifted up his heel against Me: strewing that He knew who the traitor was, an intimation that would surely have checked him, if anything would. He does not say, shall betray Me, but, shall lift up his heel against Me, alluding to his deceit and secret plotting.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid est enim levabit calcaneum suum super me, nisi conculcabit me? In quo Iudas traditor eius attingitur.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Dicit autem qui manducat mecum panem; idest, qui a me nutritus est, qui mea mensa communicavit: ut si quando a famulis aut aliquibus vilioribus patiamur aliquod malum, non scandalizemur, respicientes Iudae exemplum, qui infinitis potitus bonis, in contrarium remuneravit benefactorem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He that eats bread with Me; i.e. who was fed by Me, who partook of My table. So that if injured ever by our servants or inferiors, we need not be offended. Judas had received infinite benefits, and yet thus requited his Benefactor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Illi ergo qui electi erant, manducabant dominum; ille manducabat panem domini contra dominum: illi vitam, ille poenam.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. They then who were chosen ate the Lord; he ate the bread of the Lord, to injure the Lord; they ate life, he damnation; for he that eats unworthily, eats damnation to himself (1 Cor 11:27). Now I tell you before it come, that when it is come, you may believe that I am He, i.e. of whom that Scripture foretold.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Non autem dictum est apostolis ut credatis, quasi non credentibus; sed dictum est tamquam aequipolleat ei quod est: ut credentes operemini, perseverantes in credulitate, nec aliquam occasionem ad repulsam captantes: super ea enim quae obtinebant discipuli ad fidem facientia, hoc etiam adepti sunt, videre perfici Scripturam praedictam.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. That you may believe, is not said, as if the Apostles did not believe already, but is equivalent to saying, Do as you believe, and persevere in your belief, seeking for no occasion of falling away. For besides the evidences the disciples had already seen, they had now that of the fulfillment of prophecy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia ergo discipuli exituri erant ad praedicandum et multa passuri, duobus modis eos consolatur: uno modo a seipso, cum dicit: beati eritis, si feceritis ea; alio vero modo consolatus est eos ab aliis, eo scilicet quod ab hominibus multa potientur procuratione; unde subdit amen, amen, dico vobis: qui accipit si quem misero, me accipit: qui autem me accipit, accipit eum qui me misit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As the disciples were about to go forth and to suffer many things, He consoles them by promising His own assistance and that of others; His own, when He says, Happy are you if you do them; that of others, in what follows, Verily, verily, I say to you, He that receives whomsoever I send, receives Me; and he that receives Me receives Him that sent Me.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes</b>: Qui enim recipit quem mittit Iesus, Iesum, qui in misso consistit, recipit; qui autem Iesum recipit, patrem recipit. Igitur qui recipit quem mittit Iesus, mittentem recipit patrem. Potest etiam et hic sermo fore: qui recipit quem ego misero, usque ad mei receptionem attingit; qui vero non per aliquem apostolorum meorum me recipit, sed recipit me venientem ad animas, patrem recipit, ut non tantum ego in eo maneam, sed et pater.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. For he that receives him whom Jesus sends, receives Jesus who is represented by him; and he that receives Jesus, receives the Father. Therefore he that receives whom Jesus sends, receives the Father that sent. The words may have this meaning too: He that receives whom I send, had attained unto receiving Me: he who receives Me not by means of any Apostle, but by My own entrance into his soul, receives the Father; so that not only I abide in him, but the Father also.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ariani autem cum hoc audiunt, statim ad gradus sui dogmatis currunt, dicentes: quantum apostolus distat a domino, tantum filius a patre. Sed ubi dominus dixit: ego et pater unum sumus, nullam distantiae suspicionem reliquit. Quoniam ergo nos accepturi sumus haec verba dominica qui me accipit, accipit eum qui me misit, quod unius naturae sunt pater et filius, consequens videbitur, quia dixit qui accipit si quem misero, me accipit, ut unius naturae sint filius et apostolus. Ita dixisse possit videri: qui accipit si quem misero, me secundum hominem accipit; qui autem me secundum Deum accipit, accipit eum qui me misit. Sed cum ista dicebat, non ab illo naturae unitas, sed in eo qui mittitur, mittentis commendabatur auctoritas. Si ergo attendas Christum in Petro, discipuli praeceptorem; si autem patrem in filio, invenies unigeniti genitorem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Arians, when they hear this passage, appeal immediately to the gradations in their system, that as far as the Apostle is from the Lord, so far is the Son from the Father. But our Lord has left us no room for doubt on this head; for He said, I and My Father are one. But how shall we understand those words of our Lord, He that receives Me, receives Him that sent Me? If we take them to mean that the Father and the Son are of one nature it will seem to follow, when He says, He that receives whomsoever 1 send, receives Me, that the Son and an Apostle are of one nature. May not the meaning be, He that receives whosoever I send, receives Me, i.e. Me as man: But He that receives Me, i. e as God, receives Him that sent Me. But it is not this unity of nature, which is here put forth, but the authority of the Sender, as represented by Him who is sent. In Peter hear Christ, the Master of the disciple, in the Son the Father, the Begotten of the Only Begotten.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord after His twofold promise of assistance to the Apostles in their future labors, remembers that the traitor is cut off from both, and is troubled at the thought: When Jesus had thus said, He was troubled in spirit, and testified, and said, Verily, verily, I say to you, that one of you shall betray Me.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non illi hoc tunc primum venit in mentem; sed quia proditorem iam fuerat expressurus, ut non lateret in ceteris, ideo turbatus est spiritu: et quia ipse traditor iam fuerat exiturus, ut Iudaeos, quibus dominus ab eo traderetur, adduceret. Turbavit eum imminens passio, et periculum proximorum, et traditoris impendentes manus, cuius fuerat praecognitus animus. Hoc etiam dominus significare sua turbatione dignatus est, quod quando ex falsis fratribus aliquos separari, etiam ante messem, urgens causa compellit, fieri sine Ecclesiae turbatione non possit. Turbatus est autem non carne, sed spiritu: spiritus enim in huiusmodi scandalis non perversitate, sed caritate turbatur; ne forte in separatione aliquorum zizaniorum, simul aliquod eradicetur et triticum. Sive ergo ipsum Iudam pereuntem miserando, sive sua morte appropinquante, turbatus est; non animi infirmitate, sed potestate turbatur: non enim aliquo cogente turbatur, sed turbavit semetipsum, ut supra dictum est. Quod autem turbatur, infirmos in suo corpore, hoc est in sua Ecclesia, consolatur, ut si qui suorum morte imminente turbantur, non se reprobos putent.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This did not come into His mind then for the first time; but He was now about to make the traitor known, and single him out from the rest, and therefore was troubled in spirit. The traitor too was now just about to go forth to execute his purpose. He was troubled at the thought of His Passion being so near at hand, at the dangers to which His faithful followers would be brought at the hand of the traitor, which were even now impending over Him. Our Lord deigned to be troubled also, to show that false brethren cannot be cut off; even in the most urgent necessity, without the troubling of the Church. He was troubled not in flesh, but in spirit; for on occasion of scandals of this kind, the spirit is troubled, not perversely, but in love, lest in separating the tares, some of the wheat too be plucked up with them. But whether He was troubled by pity for perishing Judas, or, by the near approach of His own death, He was troubled not through weakness of mind, but power: He was not troubled because anything compelled Him, but He troubled Himself, as was said above. And in that He was troubled, He consoles the weak members of His body, i.e. His Church, that they may not think themselves reprobate, should they be troubled at the approach of death.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. His being troubled in spirit, was the human part, suffering under the excess of the spiritual. For if every Saint lives, acts, and suffers in the spirit, how much more is this true of Jesus, the Rewarder of Saints.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Away then with the reasonings of the Stoics, who deny that perturbation of mind can come upon a wise man; who, as they take vanity for truth, so make their healthy state of mind insensibility. It is good that the mind of the Christian may be perturbed, not by misery, but by pity. One of you, He said, i.e. one in respect of number, not of merit, in appearance not in virtue.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. This is John, whose Gospel this is, as he afterwards declares. It is the custom of the sacred writers, when they come to any thing relating to themselves, to speak of themselves, as if they were speaking of another.

This John says to show his own innocence, and also why it was that Peter beckoned to him, inasmuch as he was not Peter’s superior: Simon Peter therefore beckoned to him, that he should ask who it should be of whom he spoke. Peter had been just reproved, and therefore, checking the customary vehemence of his love, he did not speak himself now, but made John speak for him. He always appears in Scripture as zealous, and an intimate friend of John’s.

Or, he lay first in Jesus’ bosom, and then ascended higher, and lay upon His breast; as if, had he remained lying in His bosom, and not ascended to lie on His breast, our Lord would not have told him what Peter wanted to know.

            <b>CHRYS</b>. But not even then did our Lord expose the traitor by name; Jesus answered, He it is, to whom I shall give a sop when I have dipped it. Such a mode of declaring him, should itself have turned him from his purpose. Even if a partaking of the same table did not shame him, a partaking of the same bread might have. And when He had dipped the sop, He gave it to Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. Not as some careless readers think, that then Judas received singly Christ’s body. For our Lord had already distributed the sacraments of His body and blood to all of them, while Judas was as there, as Luke relates; and after this He dipped the sop, as John relates, and gave it to the traitor; the dipping of the bread perhaps signifying the deep dye of his sin; for some dipping cannot be wasted out again; i.e. when things are dipped, in order to receive a permanent dye. If however this dipping meant anything good, he was as ungrateful for it, and deserved the damnation which followed him; And after the sop, Satan entered into him.

If he is reproved who does not discern, i.e. who does not distinguish, the Lord’s body from other food, how is he condemned who, feigning himself a friend, comes an enemy to the Lord’s table?

Dixit: cui ego intingens panem dabo, et tamen non intellexerunt: nisi dicatur, quod latenter dixit, ut nullus audiret; et propterea supra pectus Ioannes residens interrogat, quasi ad aurem, ut non fieret proditor manifestus. Fortasse enim si Christus eum manifestum fecisset, Petrus utique eum interfecisset. Propterea dicit, quod nullus cognovit recumbentium, sed neque Ioannes: nequaquam enim putavit quod discipulus in tantum iniquitatis prodiret: quia enim procul a tali iniquitate erat, non de aliis hoc suspicabatur.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That which you do, do quickly, is not a command, or a recommendation, but a reproof, meant to show too that He was not going to offer any hindrance to His betrayal. Now no man at the table knew for what intent He spoke this to him. It is not easy to see, when the disciples had asked, Who is he, and He had replied, He it is to whom I shall give a sop, how it was that they did not understand Him; unless it was that He spoke too low to be heard; and that John lay upon His breast, when he asked the question, for that very reason, i.e. that the traitor might not be made known. For had Christ made him known, perhaps Peter would have killed him. So it was then, that none at the table knew what our Lord meant. But why not John? Because he could not conceive how a disciple could fall into such wickedness: he was far from such wickedness himself, and therefore did not suspect it of others. What they thought He meant we are told in what follows: For some of them thought, because Judas had the bag, that Jesus had said to him, Buy those things that we have need of against the feast, or, that he should give something to the poor.

It was to show you, that even the very poor, those who are crucified to this world, ought to attend to this duty. He did many things in order to instruct us in our duty.

Et revera exiit, non solum recedendo de domo in qua tenebatur; sed omnino egressus est a Iesu.

Post panem enim forsan acceptum a Iuda, non esum, qui semel in cor eius immiserat ut magistrum prodat, timore ductus ne quod immissum fuerat evanesceret usu panis, quam cito panem Iudas recepit, introivit in eum, et statim domum excessit. Aliter quoque non inepte dicetur, quod sicut qui indigne manducat panem domini, aut bibit eius calicem, in praeiudicium sibi comedit atque bibit; sic panis Iesu datus aliis fuit ad salutem, Iudae in damnum, ut post panem intraret in eum Satanas.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Our Lord then said to Judas, That which you do, do quickly, and the traitor this once obeyed his Master. For having received the sop, he started immediately on his work: He then having received the sop, went immediately out. And indeed he did go out, not only from the house in which he was, but from Jesus altogether. It would seem that Satan, after he had entered into Judas, could not bear to be in the same place with Jesus: for there is no agreement between Jesus and Satan. Nor is it idle inquiring why after he had received the sop, it is not added, that he ate it. Why did not Judas eat the bread, after he received it? Perhaps because, as soon as he had received it, the devil, who had put it into his heart to betray Christ, fearful that the bread, if eaten, might drive out what he had put in, entered into him, so that he went out immediately, before he ate it. And it may be serviceable to remark, that as he who eats our Lord’s bread and drinks His cup unworthily, eats and drinks to his own damnation; so the bread which Jesus gave him was eaten by the rest to their salvation, but by Judas to his damnation, inasmuch as after it the devil entered into him.

Non enim immortalis unigeniti verbi, sed hominis qui factus est ex semine David, gloria hic narratur. Si enim in morte Christi glorificantis Deum illud verum est: exuens principatus et potestates, traduxit confidenter triumphans in ligno, et illud: concilians per sanguinem crucis suae sive quae in terris sive quae in caelis sunt, in his omnibus glorificatus est filius hominis, Deo etiam glorificato in eo; unde sequitur et Deus clarificatus est in eo; quia non est Christum glorificari, nisi cum eo quoque glorificetur et pater.

          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. After the glory of His miracles, and His transfiguration, the next glorifying of the Son of man began, when Judas went out with Satan, who had entered into him; Therefore when he was gone out, Jesus said, Now is the soil of man glorified, and God is glorified in Him. For it is not the eternal only-begotten Word, but the glory of the Man born of the seed of David, which is here meant. Christ at His death, in which He glorified God, having spoiled principalities and powers, made a show of them, openly triumphing over them (Col 2:15). And again, Made peace by the blood of His cross, to reconcile all things to Himself, whether they be things in earth, or things in heaven (Col 1:20). Thus the Son of man was glorified, and God glorified in Him; for Christ cannot be glorified, except the Father be glorified with Him. But whoever is glorified, is glorified by someone. By whom then is the Son of man glorified? He tells you; If God be glorified in Him, God shall also glorify if Him in Himself, and shall straightway glorify Him.

Thus will it be when the tares are separated from the wheat; The righteous shall shine forth as the sale in the kingdom of their Father (Matt 13:43). Our Lord, foreseeing this, said, when Judas went out, as if the tares were now separated, and He left alone with the wheat, the holy Apostles. Now is the Son of man glorified; as if to say, Behold what will take place at My glorifying, at which none of the wicked shall be present, none of the righteous shall perish. He does not say, Now is the glorifying of the Son of man signified; but, Now is the Son of man glorified; as it is not that rock signified Christ, or but, That Rock was Christ (1 Cor 10:4). Scripture often speaks of the things signifying, as if they were the things signified. But the glorifying of the Son of man, is the glorifying of God in Him; as He adds, And God is glorified in Him, which He proceeds to explain; If God is glorified in Him - for He came not to do His own will, but the will of Him that sent Him - God shall also glorify Him in Himself, so that the human nature which was assumed by the eternal Word, shall also be endowed with eternity. And shall straightway glorify Him. He predicts His own resurrection, which was to follow immediately, not at the end of the world, like ours. Thus it is; Now is the Son of man glorified; the now referring not to His approaching Passion, hut the resurrection which was immediately to follow it: as if that which was so very soon to be, had already taken place.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Quod autem Deus in eo glorificatus est, ad corporis gloriam spectat, per quam Dei intellecta est gloria, quasi corpus ex naturae divinae consociatione gloriam mutuaret. Quod vero quia glorificatus in eo Deus est, ideo glorificavit eum in se, ut qui regnat in gloria quae ex Dei gloria est, ipse exinde in Dei gloriam transeat, toto iam in Deo ex ea qua homo est dispensatione mansuro. Nec sane de tempore tacuit, dicens et continuo clarificabit eum: ut quia prodeunte ad proditionem Iuda, gloriam quae sibi post passionem, consecuta resurrectione, futura esset, significasset in praesens, eam qua in se Deus eum clarificaturus esset, in posterum reservaret, Dei in eo gloria per virtutem resurrectionis ostensa; ipso vero in Dei gloria ex subiectionis dispensatione mansuro.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. That God is glorified in Him, refers to the glory of the body, which glory is the glory of God, in that the body borrows its glory from its association with the Divine nature because God is glorified in Him, therefore He will; glorify Him in Himself, in that He who reigns in the glory arising from the glory of God, He forthwith passes over into God’s glory, leaving the dispensation of His manhood wholly to abide in God. Nor is He silent as to the time And shall straightway glorify Him. This referring to the glory of His resurrection which was immediately to follow His passion, which He mentions as present, because Judas had now gone out to betray Him; whereas that God would glorify Him in Himself, He reserves for the future. The glory of God was strewn in Him by the miracle of the resurrection; but He will abide in the glory of God when He has left the dispensation of subjection.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Primam autem significationem huius dicti non ambiguam existimo, cum ait nunc clarificatus est filius hominis: gloria enim non verbo, sed carni acquirebatur. Hoc vero quod sequitur, et Deus clarificatus est in eo, quid significet interrogo; et cum non alius sit filius hominis, neque alius filius Dei: verbum enim caro factum est, requiro quis in hoc filio hominis, qui et filius Dei est, glorificatus sit Deus. Et videamus quid sit hoc quod tertio dicitur si Deus clarificatus est in eo, et Deus clarificabit eum in semetipso. Homo utique non per se glorificatur, neque rursum qui in homine glorificatur Deus, licet gloriam accipiat, non tamen aliud ipse quam Deus est. Utique aut Christum necesse est esse qui glorificatur in carne, aut patrem qui glorificatur in Christo. Si Christus est Deus, certe Christus est qui glorificatur in carne: si pater, sacramentum est unitatis, cum pater glorificatur in filio. De eo vero quod glorificatum in filio hominis Deum Deus glorificat in seipso, in quo relicta facultas exerendae impietatis existimatur, ne secundum naturae veritatem verus Deus Christus sit? Numquid enim extra se est quod glorificat in seipso? Quem enim in seipso pater glorificat, in eius gloria confitendus est; et qui in patris gloria glorificandus est, in his intelligendus est esse in quibus est pater.
          <td>The sense of these first words, Now is the Son of man glorified, is not doubtful: it is the glory of the flesh which is meant, not that of the Word But what means the next, And God is glorified in Him? The Son of man is not another Person from the Son of God for, the Word was made flesh (John 1:14). How is God glorified in this Son of man, who is the Son of God? The next clause helps us; If God is glorified in Him, God also will glorify Him in Himself. A man is not glorified in himself, nor, on the other hand, does God who is glorified in man, because He receives glory, cease to be God. So the words, God is glorified in Him, either mean that Christ is glorified in the flesh, or that God is glorified in Christ. If God means Christ, it is Christ who is glorified in the flesh; if the Father, then it is the Sacrament of unity, the Father glorified in the Son. Again, God glorifies in Himself God glorified in the Son of man. This overthrows the impious doctrine that Christ is not very God, in verity of nature. For how can that which God glorifies in Himself be out of Himself? He whom the Father glorifies must be confessed to be in His glory, and He who is glorified in the glory of the Father, must be understood to be in the same case with the Father.

          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Nomen gloriae non hic accipitur iuxta quosdam Paganorum, qui definiunt gloriam esse a pluribus collata praeconia. Palam est enim quod hoc aliud est ab eo quod in Exodo dicitur, quod gloria Dei repletum est tabernaculum, et quod aspectus Moysi glorificatus erat: quantum enim ad corporalia divinior quaedam apparitio contigit in tabernaculo, necnon in facie Moysi cum Deo locuti; quantum ad anagogiam vero gloria Dei dicitur esse quae apparuit: quoniam deificatus ac transcendens cuncta materialia intellectus, ut scrutetur divinam visionem in his quae cernit, deificatur: ut hoc sit tropice quod glorificata est facies Moysi, eo facto divino secundum intellectum. Nulla autem comparatio fuit excellentiae Christi ad cognitionem Moysi glorificantem faciem animae eius: totius enim divinae gloriae fulgorem esse filium aestimo, dicente Paulo: qui cum sit splendor gloriae et figura substantiae eius; quinimmo proveniunt ab hac totius gloriae luce singulares splendores ad totam rationalem creaturam: non enim arbitror quempiam totum posse capere totius divinae gloriae fulgorem, nisi filium eius. Inquantum igitur non erat notus filius mundo, nondum in mundo glorificatus erat; cum autem pater aliquibus de mundo existentibus tradidit Iesu notitiam, tunc glorificatus est filius hominis in his qui cognoverunt eum; et hoc dedit gloriam cognoscentibus: nam qui libera facie divinam gloriam intuentur, secundum eamdem transfigurantur imaginem a gloria glorificati in glorificantium gloriam. Cum igitur appropinquavit ad eam dispensationem, qua mundo notus debebat gloriam promereri in gloria glorificantium ipsum, ait nunc clarificatus est filius hominis. Et quia nullus novit patrem nisi filius, et cui revelaverit filius, debebat autem ex dispensatione depromere patrem filius, ob hoc etiam Deus glorificatus in illo dignoscitur. Vel hoc quod est et Deus clarificatus est in eo, cum illo perscrutaberis: qui me videt, et patrem meum videt: nam videbitur in verbo, cum Deus existat, et imago invisibilis Dei, qui genuit eum pater. Amplius autem sic quoque clarius quae sunt in hoc loco capientur. Velut enim per quosdam nomen Dei blasphematur in gentibus, sic per sanctos, quorum bona gesta coram hominibus plenissime discernuntur, celsi patris nomen extollitur. In quo vero adeo glorificatus est, ut in Iesu, dum peccatum non fecit, nec dolus inventus est in ore eius? Cum ergo talis est filius, glorificatus est, et Deus glorificatus est in eo. At si Deus in eo glorificatus est, recompensat ei pater maius illo quod filius hominis exercuit. Longe enim superstans est gloria in filio hominis cum glorificat eum pater, quam in patre cum in illo glorificatus est: et decebat praepotentem maiorem rependere gloriam. Deinceps quoniam statim haec erant futura (dico autem filium hominis in Deo glorificari), ob hoc subiecit et continuo glorificabit eum.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. Or thus: The word glory is here used in a different sense from that which some Pagans attach to it, who defined glory to be the collected praises of the many. It is evident that glory in such a sense is a different thing from that mentioned in Exodus, where it is said, that the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle (Exod 40:34), and that the face of Moses was glorified. The glory here mentioned is something visible, a certain divine appearance in the temple, and on Moses’ face; but in a higher and more spiritual sense we are glorified, when with the eye of the understanding we penetrate into the things of God. For the mind when it ascends above material things, and spiritually sees God, is defied: and of this spiritual glory, the visible glory on the face of Moses is a figure: for his mind it was that was defied by converse with God. But there is no comparison between the excellent glory of Christ, and the knowledge of Moses, whereby the face of his soul was glorified: for the whole of the Father’s glory shines upon the Son, who is the brightness of His glory, and the express image of His Person (Heb 1:3). Yea, and from the light of this whole glory there go forth particular glories, throughout the whole rational creation; though none can take in the whole of the divine glory, except the Son. But so far as the Son was known to the world, so far only was He glorified. And as yet He was not fully known. But afterward the Father spread the knowledge of Him over the whole world, and then was the Son of man glorified in those who knew Him. And of this glory He has made all who know Him partakers: as said the Apostle: We all, with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image, from glory to glory (2 Cor 3:18), i.e. from His glory receive glory. When He was approaching then that dispensation, by which He was to become known to the world, and to be glorified in the glory of those who glorified Him, He says, Now is the Son of man glorified (Matt 11:27). And because no man knows the Father but the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal Him, and the Son by the dispensation was about to reveal the Father; for this reason He said, And God is glorified in Him. Or compare this with the text below: He that has seen Me, has seen the Father. The Father who begat the Word is seen in the Word, who is God, and the image of the invisible God. But the words may be taken in a larger sense. For as through some the name of God was blasphemed among the Gentiles, so through the saints whose good deeds are seen and acknowledged by the world, the name of the Father in heaven is magnified. But in whom was He so glorified as in Jesus, Who did no sin, neither was guile found in His mouth? Such being the Son, He is glorified, and God is glorified in Him. And if God is glorified in Him, the Father returns Him more than He gave. For the glory of the Son of man, when the Father glorifies Him, far exceeds the Father’s glory, when He is glorified in the Son: it being fit that the greater should return the greater glory. And as this, viz. the glorifying of the Son of man, was just about to be accomplished, our Lord adds, And will straightway glorify Him.

After He had said, And shall straightway glorify Him, that they might not think that God was going to glorify Him in such a way, as that He would no longer have any converse with them on earth, He says, Little children, yet a little while I am with you: as if He said, I shall indeed straightway be glorified by My resurrection, but I shall not straightway ascend to heaven.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Potest etiam et sic intelligi: adhuc sicut vos in hac infirmitate carnis etiam ipse sum, donec scilicet moreretur atque resurgeret. Cum illis quidem fuit postquam resurrexit, exhibitione praesentiae corporalis; sed non cum illis fuit consortio infirmitatis humanae. Apud alium enim Evangelistam post resurrectionem ait: haec locutus sum vobis, dum adhuc essem vobiscum; idest, in carne mortali cum essem sicut et vos. Tunc enim in eadem quidem carne erat, sed cum illis in eadem mortalitate iam non erat. Est et alia divina praesentia sensibus ignota mortalibus, de qua idem dicit: ecce ego vobiscum sum usque ad consummationem saeculi. Hoc non est adhuc modicum sum vobiscum: non enim modicum est usque ad consummationem saeculi; aut si et hoc modicum est, quia in oculis Dei mille anni sunt dies unus, non tamen hoc significare voluisse credendus est nunc, quando secutus adiunxit quo ego vado, vos non potestis venire. Numquid enim post consummationem saeculi, quo ipse vadit, venire non poterant? De quibus postea dicturus est: pater, volo ut ubi ego sum, et ipsi sint mecum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It may be understood too thus: I am as yet in this frail flesh, even as you are, until I die and rise again. He was with them after His resurrection, by bodily presence, not by participation of human frailty. These are the words which I spoke to you, while I was yet with you (Luke 24:44). He says to His disciples after His resurrection; meaning, while I was in mortal flesh, as you are. He was in the same flesh then with them, but not subject to the same mortality. But there is another Divine Presence unknown to mortal senses, of which He said, Lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the world (Matt 28:20). This is not the presence meant by, A little while I am with you; for it is not a little while to the end of the world: or even if it is a little while, because that in the eye of God, a thousand years are as one day, yet what follows shows that it is not what our Lord is here alluding to; for He adds, Whither I go you cannot follow Me now. At the end of the world they were to follow Him, whither He went; as He said below; Father, I will that they be with Me, where I am.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Origenes in Ioannem</b>: Intrinsecus autem sciscitaberis, an post multum non fuit cum eis: non ideo quod non aderat illis secundum carnem; sed eo modico consummato, vos scandalizabimini in me in ista nocte, et sic non erit cum eis qui cum dignis tantummodo conversatur. Sed si cum eis non erat, nihilominus ipsi quaesituri erant Iesum; velut Petrus post negationem graviter plorabat quaerens puto Iesum; et ideo sequitur quaeritis me, et, sicut dixi Iudaeis, quo ego vado vos non potestis venire. Quaerere Iesum, est verbum quaerere, sapientiam, iustitiam, veritatem, divinam virtutem, quae omnia Christus est. Volentibus ergo discipulis sequi Iesum: non quippe velut rudiores arbitrantur corporaliter, sed ut significat illud: qui non tollit crucem suam et sequitur me, non potest meus esse discipulus, ait nunc dominus quo ego vado vos non potestis venire; nam etsi vellent sequi verbum et illud confiteri, tamen nondum erant validi circa hoc: cum nondum esset spiritus datus, eo quod Iesus non erat glorificatus.
          <td><b>ORIGEN</b>. But may there not be a deeper meaning in the words, yet a little while &amp;c. After a little while He was not with them. In what sense not with them? Not because He was not with them according to the flesh, in that He was taken from them, was brought before Pilate, was crucified, descended into hell: but because they all forsook Him, fulfilling His prophecy: All you shall be offended because of Me this night. He was not with them, because He only dwells with those who are worthy of Him. But though they thus wandered from Jesus for a little while, it was only for a little while; they soon sought Him again. Peter wept bitterly after his denial of Jesus, and by his tears sought Him: and therefore it follows, you shall seek Me, and as I said to the Jews, whither I go, you cannot follow Me now. To seek Jesus, is to seek the Word, wisdom, righteousness, truth, all which is Christ. To His disciples therefore who wish to follow Him, not in a bodily sense, as the ignorant think, but in the way He ordains, Whosoever does not bear his cross, and come after Me, cannot be My disciple. Our Lord said, Whither I go you cannot follow Me now. For though they wished to follow the Word, and to confess Him, they were not yet strong enough to do so; The Spirit was not yet given to them, because that Jesus was not yet glorified.

Or how could they follow our Lord to immortality, they who v ere to die, and not to rise again till the end of the world? Or how could tines follow Him to the bosom of the Father, when none could partake of that felicity, but they whose love was perfected? When He told the Jews this, He did not add now.

That it renews the hearer, or rather the doer of it? Love does do this; but it is that love which our Lord distinguishes from the carnal affection: As I have loved you, that you also love one another. Not the love with which men love one another, but that of the children of the Most High God, who would be brethren of His only-begotten Son, and therefore love one another with that love with which He loved them, and would lead them to the fulfillment of their desires.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Great is love, and stronger than fire; nothing can stop its course. Peter the most ardent of all, as soon as he hears our Lord say, Where I go you cannot follow Me now, asks, Lord, where do you go?

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sic utique hoc dixit magistro discipulus tamquam sequi paratus: propterea dominus, qui eius animum vidit, sic ei respondit; nam sequitur respondit ei Iesus: quo ego vado, non potes me modo sequi. Dilationem intulit, non spem abstulit, sed eam sequenti voce firmavit, dicens sequeris autem postea. Quid festinas, Petre? Nondum te suo spiritu solidaverat petra: noli extolli praesumendo, non potes modo: noli deici desperando; sequeris enim postea.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The disciple asks this, as if he were ready to follow. But our Lord saw his heart; Jesus answered him, Where I go, you cannot follow Me now; He checks his forwardness, but does not destroy his hope; nay, confirms it; But you shall follow Me afterwards. Why do you hasten, Peter? The Rock has not yet established you with His spirit. Be not lifted up with presumptions, you can not now; be not cast down with despair, you shall follow Me afterwards.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Audiens autem hoc Petrus, neque ita desiderium detinuit, sed benignam spem accipiens properat: et quia timorem excussit proditionis, cum securitate per seipsum de reliquo interrogat, aliis silentibus; unde sequitur dicit ei Petrus: quare non possum te modo sequi? Animam meam pro te ponam. Quid dicis, Petre? Dixi quoniam non potes, et tu dicis quoniam possum; quocirca scies per experientiam quoniam nihil est tuus amor, nisi praesente superna liberatione; unde sequitur respondit Iesus: animam tuam pro me pones?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Peter, on receiving this answer, does not check his desire, but hastily conceives favorable hopes from it, and having got rid of the fear of betraying our Lord, feels secure, and becomes himself the interrogator, while the rest are silent: Peter said to Him, Lord, why cannot I follow you now? I will lay down my life for your sake. What say you, Peter? He has said, you can not, and you say, you can: wherefore you shall know by experience, that your love is nothing, unless you are enabled from above: Jesus answered him, Will you lay down your life for my sake?

Quid in animo eius esset cupiditatis videbat, quid virium non videbat: voluntatem suam iactabat infirmus; sed inspiciebat valetudinem medicus. An apostolus Petrus, sicuti cum favore perverso excusare quidam nituntur, Christum non negavit, quia interrogatus ab ancilla hominem se nescire respondit, sicut alii Evangelistae testantur expressius? Quasi qui hominem Christum negat, non Christum neget; et hoc in eo neget quod factus est propter nos, ne periret quod fecerat nos. Per quid autem caput est Ecclesiae, nisi per hominem? Quomodo est igitur in corpore Christi qui negat hominem Christum? Sed quid multis immorer? Non enim dominus ait non cantabit gallus, donec hominem aut filium hominis neges; sed donec me neges. Quid est me, nisi quod erat? Quicquid eius negavit, Christum negavit. Siquidem dubitare nefas est. Christus hoc dixit, verumque praedixit; proculdubio Petrus Christum negavit. Non accusemus Christum, cum defendimus Petrum. Agnovit plane peccatum suum infirmitas Petri. Et quantum mali Christum negando commiserit, plorando monstravit. Neque nos cum ita dicimus, primum apostolorum accusare delectat; sed hunc intuendo admoneri nos oportet, ne homo quisquam de humanis viribus fidat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Will you do that for Me, which I have not done yet for you? Can you go before, who can not come after? Why presume you so? Hear what you are: Verily, verily, I say to you, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied Me thrice, you who promises Me your death, shall thrice deny your life. Peter knew his great desire, his strength he knew not: he boasted of his will, while he was yet weak; but the Physician saw his weakness. Some who perversely favor Peter, excuse him, and say that he did not deny Christ, because when asked by the servant maid, he said he did not know Him, as the other Evangelist witness more expressly. As if to deny the man Christ, was not to deny Christ; yea, that in Christ, which He was made for our sakes, that that which He made us might not perish. By what is He the Head of the Church, but by His humanity? And how then is he in the body of Christ, who denies the man Christ? But why do I argue so long? Our Lord does not say, The cock shall not crow till you deny man, or the Son of man, but till you deny Me. What is Me, but that which He was? So then whatever Peter denied, he denied Christ: it is impious to doubt it. Christ said so, and Christ said true: beyond a doubt, Peter denied Christ. Let us not, to defend Peter, accuse Christ. The frailty of Peter himself, acknowledged its sin, when he witnessed by his tears the evil he had done in denying Christ. Nor do we say this, because we have pleasure in blaming the first of the Apostles; but that we may take warning from him, not to be confident of our own strength.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Unde manifestum est quoniam et casum Petri dominus concessit: nam poterat quidem et a principio revocare; sed quia permanebat in vehementia, ipse quidem non impulit ad negationem, sed dimisit desertum, ut discat propriam imbecillitatem, et ut post haec talia non patiatur, cum orbis terrarum dispensationem susceperit; sed reminiscens eorum quae passus est, cognoscat seipsum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is manifest that our Lord permitted Peter’s fall. He might have recalled him to begin with, but as he persisted in his vehemence, though He did not drive him to a denial, He let him go without assistance, that He might learn his own weakness, and not fall into such sin again, when the superintendence of the world had come to him, but that remembering what had happened to him, he might know himself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: In anima itaque contigit Petri quod offerebat in corpore; sed aliter quam putabat: nam ante mortem et resurrectionem domini, et mortuus est negando et revixit plorando.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That took place in the soul of Peter, which he offered in the body; though differently from what he meant. For before the death and resurrection of our Lord, he both died by his denial, and lived again by his tears.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hoc autem de praedicta negatione sua Petro non solum Ioannes, sed et ceteri tres commemorant; non sane omnes ex una eademque occasione sermonis ad eam commemorandam veniunt: nam Matthaeus et Marcus eam subnectunt postquam dominus egressus est ex illa domo ubi manducaverat Pascha; Lucas vero et Ioannes antequam inde esset egressus. Sed facile possumus intelligere, aut illos duos eam recapitulando posuisse, aut istis praeoccupando; nisi magis moveret quod tam diversa non tantum verba, sed etiam sententias domini praemittunt, quibus permotus Petrus illam praesumptionem proferret pro domino vel cum domino moriendi, ut magis cogant intelligi ter eum expressisse praesumptionem suam diversis locis sermonis Christi, et ter illi a domino responsum, quod eum esset ante galli cantum ter negaturus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This speech, The cock shall not crow, occurs in all the Evangelists, but not at the same time in all. Matthew and Mark: introduce it after they have left the house, in which they were eating; Luke and John before. We may suppose either that the two former are recurring to what had passed, or the two latter anticipating what is coming. Or the great difference not only of the words, but of the subjects which precede the speech, and which excite Peter to the presumption of offering to die, for or with our Lord, may lead us to conclude that he made this offer three times, and that our Lord three times replied, Before the cock crows, you shall deny Me thrice.

Our Lord consoles His disciples, who, as men, would be naturally alarmed and troubled at the idea of His death, by assuring them of His divinity: Let not your heart be troubled: you believe in God, believe also in Me; as if they must believe in Him, if they believed in God; which would not follow, unless Christ were God. you are in fear for this form of a servant; let not your heart be troubled; the form of God shall raise it up.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quia igitur etiam sibi metuebant discipuli, cum Petro dictum esset fidentiori atque promptiori: non cantabit gallus, donec ter me neges, subiunxit in domo patris mei mansiones multae sunt: per quod a turbatione recreantur, certi ac fidentes etiam post pericula tentationum, se apud Deum cum Christo esse mansuros: quia etsi alius est alio fortior, sapientior, iustior, sanctior, nullus alienabitur ab illa domo ubi mansionem pro suo quisque accepturus est merito. Denarius quidem ille aequalis est omnibus quem paterfamilias eis qui operati sunt in vinea, iubet dari: quo utique denario vita significatur aeterna, ubi amplius alio nemo vivit, quoniam vivendi non est diversitas in aeternitate mansura; sed multae mansiones diversas meritorum in una vita aeterna significant dignitates.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And as the disciples were afraid for themselves, when Peter, the boldest and most zealous of them, had been told, The cock shall not crow, till you have denied Me thrice, He adds, In My Father’s house are many mansions, by way of an assurance to them in their trouble, that they might with confidence and certainty look forward, after all their trials, to dwelling together with Christ in the presence of God. For though one man is bolder, wiser, juster, holier than another, yet no one shall be removed from that house of God, but each receive a mansion suited to his deserts. The penny indeed which the householder paid to the laborers who worked in his vineyard, was the same to all; for life eternal, which this penny signifies, is of the same duration to all. But there may be many mansions, many degrees of dignity, in that life, corresponding to people’s deserts.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. And thus God will be all in all; that is, since God is love, love will bring it to pass, that what each has, will be common to all. That which one loves in another is one’s own, though one have it not one’s self. And then there will be no envy et superior grace, for in all hearts will reign the unity of love.

Absit autem ut cum omnis domus regnantium filiorum non sit alibi nisi in regno, ipsius regiae domus pars aliqua non sit in regno; non enim ait dominus: in beatitudine sempiterna mansiones multae sunt, sed in domo patris mei.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But they are rejected by the Christians, who infer from there being many mansions that there is a place outside the kingdom of heaven, where innocent souls, that have departed this life without baptism, and could not there enter into the kingdom of heaven, remain happy. But God forbid, that when every house of every heir of the kingdom is in the kingdom, there should be a part of the regal house itself not in the kingdom. Our Lord does not say, In eternal bliss are many mansions, but they are in My Father’s house.

Having said, you can not follow Me now, that they might not think that they were cut off for ever, He adds: And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again area receive you to Myself, that where I am, there you may be also: a recommendation to them to place the strongest trust in Him.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed quomodo vadit et parat locum, si iam mansiones multae sunt? Sed nondum sunt sicut parandae sunt; easdem enim mansiones quas praedestinando praeparavit, praeparat operando. Iam ergo sunt in praedestinatione: si quo minus, dixisset: ibo et praeparabo, hoc est praedestinabo; sed quia nondum sunt in operatione, dicit et si abiero et praeparavero vobis locum. Parat autem modo mansiones, mansionibus praeparando mansores. Quippe cum dixit in domo patris mei mansiones multae sunt, quid putamus esse domum Dei, nisi templum Dei? De quo apostolus dicit: templum Dei sanctum est, quod estis vos. Haec ergo domus Dei adhuc aedificatur, adhuc praeparatur. Sed quid est quod ut praeparet abiit, cum nosipsos praeparet; quod non faciet, si reliquerit? Sed illud significat, quia ut parentur istae mansiones, vivere debet iustus ex fide: si autem vides, non est fides. Eat ergo ne videatur, lateat ut credatur. Tunc enim locus paratur, si ex fide vivatur: creditus desideretur, ut desideratus habeatur. Si bene intelligis, nec unde vadit, nec unde venit recedit. Vadit ergo latente eo, venit apparendo. Sed nisi maneat regendo, ut proficiamus bene vivendo, non parabitur locus ubi possimus manere perfruendo.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But why does He go and prepare a place, if there are many mansions already? Because these are not as yet so prepared as they will be. The same mansions that He has prepared by predestination, He prepares by operation. They are prepared already in respect of predestination; if they were not, He would have said, I will go and prepare, i.e. predestine, a place for you; but inasmuch as they are not yet prepared in respect of operation, He says, And if I go and prepare a place for you. And now He is preparing mansions, by preparing occupants for them. Indeed, when He says, In My Father’s house are many mansions, what think we the house of God to be but the temple of God, of which the Apostle said, The temple of God is holy, which temple you are (1 Cor 3:17). This house of God then is now being built, now being prepared. But why has He gone away to prepare it, if it is ourselves that He prepares: if He leaves us, how can He prepare us? The meaning is, that, in order that those mansions may be prepared, the just must live by faith and if you see, there is no faith. Let Him go away then, that He be not seen; let Him be hid, that He be believed. Then a place is prepared, if you live by faith: let faith desire, that desire may enjoy. If you rightly understands Him, He never leaves either the place He came from, or that He goes from. He goes, when He withdraws from sight, He comes, when He appears. But except He remain in power, that we may grow in goodness, no place of happiness will be prepared for us.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Utrumque illos dominus dixerat scire, utrumque dicit iste nescire; sed nescit ille mentiri; ergo isti sciebant, et se scire nesciebant. Convincit ergo eos hoc scire; unde subditur dicit ei Iesus: ego sum via, veritas et vita.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord had said that they knew both, Thomas says that they knew neither. Our Lord cannot lie; they knew not that they did know. Our Lord proves that they did: Jesus said to Him, I am the way, the truth, and the life.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Quasi dicat: qua vis ire, ego sum via; quo vis ire, ego sum veritas; ubi vis permanere, ego sum vita. Veritatem et vitam omnis homo capit; sed viam non omnis invenit. Deum esse quamdam vitam aeternam, veritatem scibilem, etiam huius saeculi philosophi viderunt. Verbum ergo Dei, quod apud patrem est veritas et vita, assumendo hominem, factum est via. Ambula per hominem, et pervenies ad Deum. Melius enim est in via claudicare, quam praeter viam fortiter ambulare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As it He said, I am the way, whereby you would go; I am the truth, whereto you would go; I am the life, in which you would abide. The truth and the life every one understands; but not everyone has found the way. Even the philosophers of the world have seen that God is the life eternal, the truth which is the end of all knowledge. And the Word of God, which is truth and life with the Father, by taking upon Him human nature, is made the way. Walk by the Man, and you will arrive at God. For it is better to limp on the right way, than to walk ever so stoutly by the wrong.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Non enim vos in erratica atque in invia deducit ille qui via est; neque illudit per falsa qui veritas est; neque in mortis relinquit errore qui vita est.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. For He who is the way does not lead us into devious courses out of the way; nor does He who is the truth deceive us by falsehoods; not does He who is the life leave us in the darkness of death.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Cum itaque activam exerces, fit tibi Christus via; cum autem in contemplativa perseveras, efficitur tibi veritas. Adiecta autem vita est activo et contemplativo: decet enim ire et praedicare pro futuro saeculo.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. When you art engaged in the practical, He is made your way; when in the contemplative, He is made your truth. And to the active and the contemplative is joined life: for we should both act and contemplate with reference to the world to come.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sciebant ergo viam, quia sciebant ipsum qui est via. Quid autem opus erat ut adderet veritas et vita, cum restaret nosse quo iret? Quia ad veritatem ibat et ad vitam. Ibat ergo ad seipsum per seipsum. Sed numquid, o domine, ut venires ad nos, reliqueras te? Scio quidem quod formam servi accepisti et in carne venisti, manens ubi eras: et per hanc rediisti, non relinquens quo veneras. Si ergo per hanc et venisti et rediisti; per hanc nobis non solum qua veniremus ad te, verum etiam tibi qua venires et redires via fuisti. Cum vero ad vitam, quod es ipse, ivisti, eamdem carnem tuam de morte ad vitam duxisti. Itaque dum caro de morte venit ad vitam, Christus venit ad vitam. Et quia verbum est vita, Christus venit ad seipsum; quoniam utrumque est Christus, una persona, scilicet verbum caro. Venerat etiam per carnem Deus ad homines, veritas ad mendaces: est enim Deus verax, omnis autem homo mendax. Cum itaque se ab hominibus abstulit, atque illuc ubi nemo mentitur, carnem suam levavit, idem ipse, qua verbum caro factum est, per seipsum, idest per carnem suam, ad veritatem, quod est ipse, remeavit: quam quidem veritatem, quamvis inter mendaces, etiam in morte servavit. Ecce ego ipse, si loquor vobis quod intelligatis, quodammodo ad vos procedo, nec me relinquo. Cum autem tacuero, quodammodo ad me redeo, et vobiscum maneo, si tenueritis quod audistis. Si hoc potest imago quam fecit Deus, quid potest ex Deo nata imago? Ac per hoc et ipse per seipsum, et ad seipsum, et ad patrem, et nos per ipsum, et ad ipsum, et ad patrem imus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They knew then the way, because they knew He was the way. But what need to add, the truth, and the life? Because they were yet to be told whither He went. He went to the truth; He went to the life. He went then to Himself, by Himself. But did you leave Yourself, O Lord, to come to us? I know that you took upon you the form of a servant; by the flesh you came, remaining where you were; by that you returned, remaining where you had come to. It by this then you came, and returned, by this you were the way, not only to us, to come to you, but also to Yourself to come, and to return again. And when you went to life, which is Yourself you raised that same flesh of Your from death to life. Christ therefore went to life, when His flesh arose from death to life. And since the Word is life, Christ went to Himself; Christ being both, in one person, i.e. Word-flesh. Again, by the flesh God came to men, the truth to liars; for God is true, but every man a liar. When then He withdrew Himself from men, and lifted up His flesh to that place in which no liar is, the same Christ, by the way, by which He being the Word became flesh, by Himself, i.e. by His flesh, by the same returned to Truth, which is Himself, which truth, even amongst the liars He maintained to death. Behold I myself, if I make you understand what I say, do in a certain sense go to you, though I do not leave myself. And when I cease speaking, I return to myself, but remain with you, if you remember what you have heard. If the image which God has made can do this, how much more the Image which God has begotten? Thus He goes by Himself, to Himself and to the Father, and we by Him, to Him and to the Father.

Qualiter autem dixerit: quo vado scitis, et viam scitis, ostendit subdens si cognovissetis me, et patrem meum utique cognovissetis; quasi dicat: si sciretis meam substantiam et dignitatem, et eam quae patris est sciretis. Noverant quidem eum, sed non ita ut oportebat: postea autem spiritus veniens perfectam in eis construxit cognitionem: et propter hoc subditur amodo cognoscetis eum: dicit autem eam quae secundum mentem cognitionem.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. For if, He says, you have Me for your guide to the Father, you shall certainly come to Him. Nor call you come by any other way. Whereas He had said above, No man can come to Me, except the Father draw him, now He says, No man comes to the Father but by Me, thus equaling Himself to the Father. The next words explain, Where I go you know, and the way you know. If you had known Me, He says, you should have known My Father also; i.e. If you had known My substance and dignity, you would have known the Father’s. They did know Him, but not as they ought to do. Nor was it till afterwards, when the Spirit came, that they were fully enlightened. On this account He adds, And from henceforth you know Him, know Him, that is, spiritually. And have seen Him, i.e. by Me; meaning that he who had seen Him, had seen the Father. They saw Him, however, not in His pure substance, but clothed in flesh.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. How can our Lord say, If you had known Me, you should have known My Father also; when He has just said, Where I go you know, and the way you know? We must suppose that some of them knew, and others not: among the latter, Thomas.

In sacramento enim assumpti corporis divinitatis paternae naturam confirmans, hunc ordinem tenuit; tempus autem visionis separavit a tempore cognitionis: nam quem cognoscendum ait, eumdem iam dixit et visum, ut naturae iam pridem in se conspectae scientiam ex tempore nunc huius revelationis acciperent.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Or thus: When it is said that the Son is the way to the Father, is it meant that He is so by His teaching, or by His nature? We shall be able to see from what follows: If you had known Me, you should have known My Father also. In His incarnation asserting His Divinity, He maintained a certain order of sight and knowledge: separating the time of seeing from that of knowing. For Him, who He said must be known, He speaks of as already seen: that henceforward they might from this revelation have knowledge of the Divine Nature which they had all along seen in Him.

Prorupit igitur apostolica familiaritas dominum interrogans; unde dicitur <i>dicit ei Philippus: domine, ostende nobis patrem, et sufficit nobis.</i> Non visum negavit, sed ostendi sibi rogavit; neque ostensionem veluti corporalis contemplationis intuitum desideravit, sed demonstrationem intelligendi eius qui visus est postulavit. Filium enim in habitu hominis viderat, sed quomodo per id patrem viderit, nescit: nam ut ostensio illa intelligendi potius esset demonstratio quam videndi, subiecit et sufficit nobis.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. A declaration so new startled Philip. Our Lord is seen to be man. He confesses Himself to be the Son of God, declares that, if He were known, the Father would be known, that, if He is seen, the Father is seen. The familiarity of the Apostle therefore breaks forth into questioning our Lord, Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us. He did not deny He could be seen, but wished to be shown him; nor did he wish to see with his bodily eyes, but that He whom he had seen might be made manifest to his understanding. He had seen the Son in the form of man, but how through that form He saw the Father, he did not know. This he wants to be strewn him, strewn to his understanding, not set before his eyes; and then he will be satisfied: And it suffices us.

Ut enim hoc intelligeret, responsum est ei a domino; unde sequitur dixit ei Iesus: tanto tempore vobiscum sum, et non cognovistis me?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For to that joy of beholding His face, nothing can be added. Philip understood this, and said, Lord, show us the Father, and it suffices us. But he did not yet understand that he could in the same way have said, Lord, show us Yourself, and it suffices us. But our Lord’s answer enlightens him, Jesus said to him, Have I been so long with you, and yet have you not known Me, Philip?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But how is this, when our Lord said that they knew where He was going, and the way, because they knew Him? The question is easily settled by supposing that some of them knew, and others not; among the latter, Philip.

          <td><b>Hilarius</b>: Arguit ergo apostolum in cognoscendo se ignorantem: cum enim ea quae gereret, propria Deo essent, calcare undas, iubere ventis, peccata dimittere, mortuis vitam reddere; hinc querelae omnis orta conquaestio est, quod in homine assumpto Dei non intellecta natura est. Et ideo postulanti ut sibi patrem ostenderet, ait Philippe, qui videt me, videt et patrem.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He reproves the ignorance of Philip in this respect. For whereas his actions had been strictly divine, such as walking on the water, commanding the winds, remitting sins, raising the dead, He complained that in His assumed humanity, the Divine nature was not discerned. Accordingly to Philip’s request, to be strewn the Father, Our Lord answers, He that has seen Me, has seen the Father.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Solemus enim de simillimis duobus ita loqui: vidistis illum? Vidistis istum. Sic ergo dictum est qui videt me, videt et patrem: non quod ipse sit pater et filius; sed quod a patris similitudine in nullo prorsus discrepet filius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. When two persons are very like each, we say, If you have seen the one, you have seen. n the other. So here, He that has seen Me, has seen the Father; not that He is troth the Father, and the Son, but that the Son is an absolute likeness of the Father.

          <td><b>Hilarius</b>: Non autem ille hic visum oculorum carnalium significat: non enim hoc quod ex partu virginis carnale est, ad contemplandam in eo Dei formam et imaginem proficit; sed intellectus Dei filius id praestat ut intellectus et pater sit, dum ita imago est ut non differat genere, sed significet auctorem; non enim solitarium sermo significat et indifferentem; tamen naturam professio docet: cum enim dicitur et patrem, exclusa est singularis atque unici intelligentia; et quid reliquum est, nisi ut per naturae unicam similitudinem pater per filium visus sit?
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He does not mean the sight of the bodily eye: for His fleshly part, born of the Virgin, does not avail towards contemplating the form and image of God in Him; but the Son of God being known with the understanding, it follows that the Father is known also, forasmuch as He is the image of God, not differing from but expressing His Author. For our Lord’s expressions do not spear; of one person solitary and without relationship, but teach us His birth. The Father also excludes the supposition of a single solitary person, and leaves us no other doctrine but that the Father is seen in the Son, by the incommunicable likeness of birth.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed numquid obiurgandus est qui cum similem viderat, etiam illum cui est similis, vult videre? Sed ideo discipulum dominus arguebat, quoniam cor postulantis videbat. Tamquam enim melior esset pater quam filius, ita Philippus patrem nosse cupiebat; et ideo nec filium sciebat, quo alium meliorem esse credebat. Ad hunc ergo sensum corrigendum dictum est non credis quia ego in patre, et pater in me est? Quasi dicat: si ad te multum est hoc videre, saltem quod non vides crede.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But is he to be reproved, who, when he has seen the likeness, wishes to see the man of whom he is the likeness? No, our Lord rebuked the question, only with reference to the mind of the asker. Philip asked, as if the Father were better than the Son; and so showed that He did not know the Son. Which opinion our Lord corrects: Believe you not that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me? as if He said, If it is a great wish with you to see the Father, at any rate believe what you do not see.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. For what excuse was there for ignorance of the Father, or what necessity to show Him, when the Father was seen in the Son by His essential nature, while by the identity of unity, the Begotten and the Begetter are one: Believe you not that I am in the Father and the Father in Me?

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. But the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, not by a conjunction of two harmonizing essences, nor by a nature grafted into a more capacious substance as in material bodies, in which it is impossible that what is within can be made external to that which contains it; but by the birth of a nature which is life from life; forasmuch as from God nothing but God can be born.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. The unchangeable God follows, so to speak, His own nature, by begetting unchangeable God. Nor does the perfect birth of unchangeable God from unchangeable God forsake His own nature.

Philippus hic corporeis oculis patrem volebat videre, quia et ipsum filium ita se existimabat vidisse, fortassis a prophetis audiens, quoniam vidi dominum, et ideo dixit ostende nobis patrem. Etenim Iudaei interrogaverunt: quis est pater tuus? Et Petrus et Thomas, quo iret: et nullus didicit manifeste. Ut ergo non videatur onerosus esse Philippus, et ipse interrogans ostende nobis patrem, adiungit et sufficit nobis; idest, nihil plus quaerimus. Dominus autem non dixit ei: impossibile petis; sed ostendit quoniam neque ipsum filium vidit: nam si hunc potuisset videre, et illum vidisset; et ideo dicit tanto tempore vobiscum sum, et non cognovistis me? Non dixit: non vidistis me, sed non cognovistis me, quantum ad hoc scilicet quod filius hoc manens quod pater, decenter in seipso ostendit eum qui genuit. Deinde dividens hypostases, ait qui videt me, videt et patrem: ne quis dicat, quod ipse est pater, ipse filius. Ostendit autem per hoc quoniam neque filium visu corporeo vidit. Si autem aliquis hic visum cognitionem dicere velit, non contradico; quasi dicat: qui cognovit me, cognovit et patrem. Sed non dixit hoc; sed consubstantialitatem repraesentare volens, dixit: qui meam substantiam vidit, vidit et eam quae patris. Unde patet quod non est creatura: creaturam enim videntes, Deum nesciunt omnes: Philippus etiam substantiam patris videre quaerebat. Si ergo alterius substantiae esset, non diceret qui videt me, videt et patrem. Sed nec aliquis in argento auri substantiam videre potest: non enim alia per aliam apparet naturam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: Philip, because [he thought] he had seen c the Son with his bodily eye, wished to see the Father in the same way; perhaps too remembering what the Prophet said, I saw the Lord (Isaiah 6:1), and therefore he says, Show us the Father. The Jews had asked, who was His Father; and Peter and Thomas, whither He went; and neither were told plainly. Philip therefore, that he might not seem burdensome, after saying, Show us the Father, adds, And it suffices us: i.e. we seek for no more. Our Lord in reply does not say, that he asked an impossible thing, but that he had not seen the Son to begin with, for that if he had seen Him, he would have seen the Father: Have I been so long time with you, and yet have you not known Me? He does not say, not seen Me, but, not known Me; not known that the Son, being what the Father is, does in Himself fitly show the Father. Then dividing the Persons, He says, He that has seen Me has seen the Father; that none might maintain that He was both the Father and the Son. The words show too that even the Son was not seen in a bodily sense. So if anyone takes seeing here, for knowing, I will not contradict him, but will take the sentence as if it was, He that has known Me, has known the Father. He shows here His consubstantiality with the Father: He that has seen My substance, has seen the Father. Whence it is evident He is not a creature: for all know and see the creature, but not all God; Philip, for instance, who wished to see the substance of the Father. If Christ then had been of another substance from the Father, He would never have said, He that has seen Me, has seen the Father. A man cannot see the substance of gold in silver: one nature cannot be made apparent by another.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He then addresses all of them, not Philip only: The word that I speak to you, I speak not of Myself. What is, I speak not of Myself, I but, I that speak am not of Myself? He attributes what He does to Him, from whom He Himself, the doer, is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Wherein He neither desires Himself to be the Son, nor hides the existence of His Father’s power in Him. In that He speaks, it is Himself that speaks in His own person; in that He speaks not of Himself, He witnesses His nativity, that He is God from God.

Sed quomodo a verbis incipiens, ad opera venit? Conveniens enim erat dicere: ipse loquitur verba; sed duo ponit de doctrina et signis; aut quia et verba opera erant.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Mark the abundant proof of the unity of substance. For He continues; But the Father that dwells in Me, He does the works. As if He said, My Father and I act together, not differently from each other; agreeing with what He said below: If I do not the works of My Father, believe Me not. But why does He pass from words to works? Why does He not say as we might have expected, He speaks the words? Because He means to apply what He says both to His doctrine, and to His miracles; or because His words are themselves works.

These two sentences are brought against us by different sects of heretics; the Arians saying that the Son is unequal to the Father, because He does not speak of Himself; the Sabellians, that the same who is the Father is the Son.

Et quia in se patrem loqui et operari docuerat, perfecte huius unitatis fidem statuit, dicens credite mihi quia ego in patre et pater in me est: ne scilicet per virtutis efficientiam, et non per naturae, quae secundum nativitatem est, proprietatem, pater in filio et operari crederetur et loqui: sic enim habetur in Graeco.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. That the Father dwells in the Son, show that He is not single, or solitary; that the Father works by the Son, shows that He is not different or alien. As He is not solitary who does not speak from Himself, so neither is He alien and separable who speaks by Him. Having shown then that the Father spoke and worked in Him, He formally states this union: Believe Me that I am in the Father, and the Father in Me: that they might not think that the Father works and speaks in the Son as by a mere agent or instrument, not by the unity of nature implied in His Divine birth.

Et eorum verborum fructus erat fides illorum. Verumtamen evangelizantibus discipulis non tam pauci quam illi erant, sed gentes etiam crediderunt. Nonne ab ore ipsius dives ille tristis abscessit? Et tamen postea quod ab illo auditum non fecit unus, fecerunt multi, cum per discipulos loqueretur. Ecce maiora fecit praedicatus a credentibus, quam locutus audientibus. Verum, hoc adhuc movet quod hic maiora per apostolos fecit. Non autem ipsos tantum significans ait qui credit in me. Numquid inter credentes in Christum non est computandus qui non fecerit opera maiora quam Christus? Durum est nisi intelligatur. Apostolus dicit: credenti in eum qui iustificat impium, reputatur fides ad iustitiam. In hoc opere faciemus opera Christi, quia et ipsum credere in Christum, opus est Christi: hoc operatur in nobis, non utique sine nobis. Audi ergo: qui credit in me, opera quae ego facio et ipse faciet. Prius ego facio, deinde et ipse faciet: quia facio ut faciat. Quae opera, nisi ut ex impio iustus fiat? Quod utique in illo, sed non sine illo Christus operatur. Prorsus hoc maius esse dixerim quam creare coelum et terram: caelum enim et terra transibunt: praedestinatorum autem salus et iustificatio permanebit. Sed in caelis Angeli opera sunt Christi: numquid etiam his operibus maiora facit qui cooperatur Christo ad suam iustificationem? Iudicet qui potest utrum maius sit iustos creare quam impios iustificare. Certe si aequalis sit utrumque potentiae, hoc maioris est misericordiae. Sed omnia opera intelligere Christi, ubi ait maiora horum faciet, nulla necessitas cogit: horum enim forsitan dixit quae illa hora faciebat; tunc autem verba fidei faciebat; et utique minus est verba iustitiae praedicare, quod fecit praeter nos, quam impios iustificare, quod ita facit in nobis ut faciamus et nos. Magnam autem spem dominus suis promisit orantibus, dicens quia ego ad patrem vado.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what are these greater works? Is it that the shadow of the Apostles, as they passed by, healed the sick; It is indeed a greater thing that a shadow should heal, than that the border of a garment should. Nevertheless, by works here our Lord refers to His words. For when He says, My Father that dwells in Me, He does the works, what are these works but the words which He spoke? And the fruit of those words was their faith. But these were but few converts in comparison with what those disciples made afterwards by their preaching: they converted the Gentiles to the faith. Did not the rich man go away sorrowful from His words? And yet that which one did not do at His own exhortation, many did afterwards when He preached through the disciples. He did greater works when preached by the believing, than when speaking to men’s ears. Still these greater works He did by His Apostles, whereas He includes others besides them, when He says, He that believes in Me. Are we not to compute any one among the believers in Christ, who does not do greater works than Christ? This sounds harsh if not explained. The Apostle says, To him that believes in Him that justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness (Rom 4:5). By this work then we shall do the works of Christ, the very believing in Christ being the work of Christ, for He works this in us, though not without us. Attend then; He that believes on Me, the works that I do, shall he do also. First I do them, then he will do them: I do them, that he may do them. Do what works but this, viz. that a man, from being a sinner, become just? which thing Christ works in us, though not without us. This in truth I call a greater work to do, than to create the heaven and the earth; for heaven and earth shall pass away, but the salvation and justification of the predestined shall remain. However, the Angels in heaven are the work of Christ; shall he who works with Christ for his own justification, do greater even than these? Judge any one which be the greater work, to create the just, or to justify the ungodly? At least, if both be of equal power, the latter has more of mercy. But it is not necessary to understand all the works of Christ, when He says, greater works than these shall he do. These perhaps refers to the works He had done that hour. He had then been instructing them in the faith. And surely it is a less work to preach righteousness, which He did without us, than to justify the ungodly, which He so does in us, as that we do it ourselves. Great things truly did our Lord promise His people, when He went to His Father: Because I go to My Father.

Quomodo ergo intelligendum est quodcumque petieritis, hoc faciam, si Deus aliqua petentibus fidelibus etiam consulendo non facit? An forte solis apostolis hoc dictum debemus accipere? Absit: superius enim dixerat: qui credit in me, opera quae ego facio, et ipse faciet. Ipsos quoque si cogitemus apostolos, inveniemus eum qui plus omnibus laboravit rogasse ut ab eo discederet Angelus Satanae, nec tamen quod rogaverat accepisse. Sed audi quod illic positum est in nomine meo, quod est Christus Iesus. Christus regem, Iesus salvatorem significat: et per hoc quodcumque petimus adversus utilitatem salutis, non petimus in nomine salvatoris: et tamen ipse salvator est, non solum quando facit quod petimus, verum etiam quando non facit: quoniam quod videt peti contra salutem, non faciendo se exhibet salvatorem.

Continuo autem subiecit ut glorificetur pater in filio, si quid petieritis in nomine meo, hoc faciam.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Whatsoever you shall ask. Then why do we often see believers asking, and not receiving? Perhaps it is that they ask amiss. When a man would make a bad use of what he asks for, God in His mercy does not grant him it. Still if God even in kindness often refuses the requests of believers, how are we to understand, Whatsoever you shall ask in My name, I will do? Was this said to the Apostles only? No. He says above, He that believes in Me, the works that I do shall he do also. And if we go to the lives of the Apostles themselves, we shall find that he who labored more than they all, prayed that the messenger of Satan might depart from him, but was not granted his request. But attend: does not our Lord lay down a certain condition? In My name, which is Christ Jesus. Christ signifies King, Jesus, Savior. Therefore whatever we ask for that would hinder our salvation, we do not ask in our Savior’s name and yet He is our Savior, not only when He does what we ask, but also when He does not. When He sees us ask any thing to the disadvantage of our salvation, He shows s Himself our Savior by not doing it. The physician knows whether what the sick man asks for is to the advantage or disadvantage of his health; and does not allow what would be to his hurt, though the sick man himself desires it; but looks to his final cure. And some things we may even ask in His name, and He will not grant them us at the time, though He will some time. What we ask for is deferred, not denied. He adds, that the Father may be glorified in the Son. The Son does not do any thing without the Father, inasmuch as He does it in order that the Father may be glorified in Him.

Mundus ergo, idest mundi dilectores, non potest eum accipere, quia non videt eum. Non enim habet invisibiles oculos mundana dilectio, per quos videri spiritus sanctus nisi invisibiliter non potest. Sequitur vos autem cognoscetis eum, quia apud vos manebit. Sed ne putarent quod dictum est, apud vos manebit, ita dictum quemadmodum apud hospes visibiliter manere consuevit, adiecit in vobis erit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Thus the world, i.e. the lovers of the world, cannot, He says, receive the Holy Spirit: that is to say, unrighteousness cannot be righteous. The world, i.e. the lovers of the world, cannot receive Him, because it sees Him not. The love of the world has not invisible eyes wherewith to see that which can only be seen invisibly. It follows: But you know Him, for He dwells with you. And that they might not think this I meant a visible dwelling, in the sense in which we use the phrase with respect to a guest, He adds, And shall be in you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: non ita apud vos manebit sicut ego, sed in vestris habitabit animabus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if He said, He will not dwell with you as I have done, but will dwell in your souls.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Prius autem est esse alicubi, post manere. Sed exposuit quod dixerat apud vos, cum adiunxit in vobis. Si enim non sit in vobis, non potest esse in vobis eius scientia: sic enim a vobis videtur in vobis et vestra conscientia.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. To be in a place is prior to dwelling. Be in you, is the explanation of dwell with you: i.e. shows that the latter means not that He is seen, but that He is known. He must be in us, that the knowledge of Him may be in us. We see the Holy Ghost then in us, in our consciences.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius Moralium</b>: Si autem spiritus sanctus in discipulis manet, quomodo iam singulare signum erit quod in mediatore permanet? Secundum illud: supra quem videris spiritum descendentem et manentem, hic est qui baptizat. Quod tamen citius cognoscimus, si dona eiusdem spiritus discernamus. In his enim donis sine quibus ad vitam perveniri non potest, spiritus sanctus in electis omnibus semper manet; in illis autem quibus non nostra vita servatur, sed aliorum quaeritur, nequaquam semper manet: aliquando enim se a signorum ostensionibus subtrahit, ut eo humilius virtutes eius habeamus: Christus autem in cunctis eum et semper habet praesentem.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But if the Holy Spirit abides in the disciples, how is it a special mark of the Mediator that He abides in Him. We shall better understand if we distinguish between the different gifts of the Spirit. In respect of those gifts without which we cannot attain to salvation, the Holy Spirit ever abides in all the Elect: but in respect of those which do not relate to our own salvation, but to the procuring that of others, He does not always abide in them. For He sometimes withdraws His miraculous gifts, that His grace may be possessed with humility. Christ has Him without measure and always.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hic autem sermo oppositas haereses velut uno ictu sustulit: nam dicere alium ostendit eius, idest spiritus, hypostaseos differentiam; dicere vero Paraclitum, substantiae cognitionem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. This speech levels at a stroke, as it were, the opposite heresies. The word another, shows the distinct personality of the Spirit: the word Paraclete, His consubstantiality.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus contra Arianos</b>: Consolatorem enim (quod officium tamquam personae infimae in Trinitate spiritui sancto deputant) Deum dicit apostolus, secundum illud: is qui consolatur humiles, consolatus est nos Deus. Deus est itaque spiritus sanctus qui consolatur humiles. Aut si hoc de patre vel filio dictum ab apostolo volunt accipi, desinant consolationis tamquam munere proprio separare a patre et filio spiritum sanctum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Comforter, the title of the Holy Spirit, the third Person in the Trinity, the Apostle applies to God: God that comforts those that are cast down, comforted us. The Holy Spirit therefore Who comforts those that are cast down, is God. Or if they still have this said by the Apostle of the Father or the Son, let them not any longer separate the Holy Spirit from the Father and the Son, in His peculiar office of comforting.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed cum caritas Dei diffusa sit in cordibus nostris per spiritum sanctum, qui datus est nobis, quomodo diligemus et mandata Christi servabimus, ut eum accipiamus quem nisi habuerimus, diligere et mandata servare non possumus? An forte praecedit in nobis caritas qua diligamus Christum, ut diligendo Christum eiusque faciendo mandata, mereamur accipere spiritum sanctum, ut caritas Dei patris diffundatur in cordibus nostris? Perversa est ista sententia. Qui enim se filium Dei diligere credit, et patrem non diligit, profecto nec filium diligit; sed quod sibi ipsi videtur confinxit. Restat ergo ut intelligamus, spiritum sanctum habere qui diligit, et habendo mereri ut plus habeat, et plus habendo plus diligat. Iam itaque habebant spiritum discipuli, quem dominus promittebat; sed dandus eis erat amplius; habebant occulte, accepturi erant manifeste. Proinde non solum non habenti, verum etiam habenti non incassum promittitur; non habenti quidem, ut habeatur; habenti autem, ut amplius habeatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us (Rom 5:5), how shall we love and keep the commandments of Christ, so as to receive the Spirit, when we are not able to love or to keep them, unless we have received the Spirit? Does love in us go first, i.e. do we so love Christ and keep His commandments as to deserve to receive the Holy Spirit, and to have the love of God the Father shod abroad in our hearts? This is a perverse opinion. For he who does not love the Father, does not love the Son, however he may think he does. It remains for us to understand, that he who loves has the Holy Spirit, and by having Him, attains to having more of Him, and by having more of Him, to loving more. The disciples had already the Spirit which our Lord promised; but they were to be given more of Him: they had Him secretly, they were to receive Him openly. The promise is made both to him who has the Spirit, and to him who has Him not; to the former, that he shall have Him; to the latter, that He shall have more of Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quando igitur discipulos purgaverat per sacrificium passionis, et peccatum solutum erat, et ipsi ad pericula et agones mittebantur, oportebat spiritum sanctum venire abundanter. Non autem statim post resurrectionem, ut in multo eius constituti desiderio, cum multa eum suscipiant gratia.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. When He had cleansed His disciples by the sacrifice of His passion, and their sins were remitted, and they were sent forth to dangers and trials, it was necessary that they should receive the Holy Spirit abundantly. But they were made to wait some time for this gift, in order that they might feel the want of it, and so be the more grateful for it when it came.

That no one might think, because our Lord was about to give the Holy Spirit, that He would therefore not be present Himself in Him, He adds, I will not leave you comfortless. The Greek word signifies “wards.” Although then the Son of God has made us the adopted sons of the Father, yet here He Himself shows the affection of a Father towards us.

Ne tamen rursus eamdem quaerant praesentiam, qualem et prius habuerunt, occulte hoc excludit, cum subdit adhuc modicum, et mundus me iam non videt; vos autem videtis me; ac si diceret: veniam quidem ad vos, non tamen ut prius vobiscum per unamquamque diem consistens. Et ne dicant: qualiter igitur Iudaeis dixisti: amodo non videbitis me? Solvit opinionem dicens ad vos solos veniam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. At the first He said, Where I go you shall come; but as this was a long time off, He promises them the Spirit in the interval. And as they knew not what that was, He promises them that they most desired, His own presence, I will come to you, but intimates at the same time that they are not to look for the same kind of presence over again: Yet a little while, and the world sees Me no more: as if He said, I will come to you, but not to live with you every day as I did before. And, I will come to you alone, He says, thus preventing any inconsistency with what He had said to the Jews: Henceforth you shall not see Me.

Sed quoniam post resurrectionem etiam carnem suam, quam non solum videndam, verum etiam contrectandam demonstravit suis, noluit demonstrare non suis; hinc dictum est adhuc modicum, et mundus iam me non videt; vos autem videbitis me. Sed quoniam in iudicio eum mundus videbit, quo nomine significati sunt a regno eius alieni; melius intelligitur illud etiam tempus significare voluisse quando in fine saeculi auferetur ab oculis damnatorum, ut eum de cetero videant diligentes. Modicum autem dixit, quia id quod prolixum videtur hominibus, brevissimum est ante oculos Dei. Sequitur quia ego vivo, et vos vivetis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For the world saw Him then with the carnal eye, manifest in the flesh, though it did not see the Word hidden under the flesh. But after the resurrection He was unwilling to show even His flesh, except to His own followers, whom He allowed to see and to handle it: Yet a little while, and the world sees Me no more; but you shall see Me. But, inasmuch as the world, by which are meant all who are aliens from His kingdom, will see Him at the last judgment, it is better perhaps to understand Him here as pointing to that time, when He will be taken for ever from the eyes of the wicked, to be seen thenceforth by those who love Him. A little while, He says, for that which seems a long lime to men, is but a moment in the eyes of God. Because 1 live, you shall live also.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But why does He speak of life as present to Him, future to them? Because His resurrection preceded, theirs was to follow. His resurrection was about so soon to take place, that He speaks of it as present; theirs being deferred till the end of the world, He does not say you live, but you shall live. Because He lives, therefore we shall live: As by man came death, by man came also the resurrection of the dead (1 Cor 15:21). It follows: In that day (the day of which He said, you shall live also) you shall know, i.e. whereas now you believe, then you shall see, that I am in the Father, and you in Me, and I in you. For when we shall have attained to that life in which death is swallowed up, then shall be finished that which is now begun by Him, that He should be in us, and we in Him.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel in illo die cum resurgam, cognoscetis; quia cum viderunt eum resurrexisse et esse cum eis, tunc certissimam fidem didicerunt. Magna enim erat virtus spiritus sancti, quae omnia eos docebat. Quod autem dictum est ego sum in patre, humilitatis est; quod autem dicit et vos in me et ego in vobis, humanitatis est, et auxilii quod est a Deo. Consuevit enim Scriptura multoties eisdem verbis in Deo et hominibus positis non similiter uti.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, in that day, on which I shall rise again, you shall know. For His resurrection it was that established their faith. Then the powerful teaching of the Holy Spirit began. His saying, I am in the Father, expresses His humility; the next, And you in Me, and I in you, His humanity and God’s assistance to Him. Scripture often uses the same words in different senses, as applied to God and to men.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Or He means by this, that whereas He was in the Father by the nature of His divinity, and we in Him by means of His birth in the flesh; He on the other hand should be believed to be in us by the mystery of the Sacrament: as He Himself testified above: Whosoever eats My flesh, and drinks My blood, dwells in Me, and I in Him.

He that has them in mind, and keeps them in life; he that has them in words, and keeps them in works; he that has them by hearing, and keeps them by doing; he that has them by doing, and keeps them by persevering, he it is that loves Me.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if He said, You think that by sorrowing, as you do, for my death you prove your affection; but I esteem the keeping of My commandments the evidence of love. And then He shows the privileged state of one who loves: And he that loves Me shall be loved of My Father, and I will love him.

He explains it in what follows: And will manifest Myself to him, i.e. I love him so far as to manifest Myself to him; so that, as the reward of his faith, he will have sight. Now He only loves us so that we believe; then He will love us so that we see. And whereas we love now by believing that which we shall see, then we shall love by seeing that which we have believed.

Est enim quaedam Dei manifestatio interior, quam prorsus impii non noverunt: quibus Dei patris et spiritus sancti manifestatio nulla est: filii vero esse potuit, sed in carne; quae nec talis est qualis illa, nec semper illis adesse potest, sed ad modicum tempus; et hoc ad iudicium, non ad gaudium; ad supplicium, non ad praemium; unde sequitur et ad eum veniemus. Veniunt quidem ad nos dum venimus ad eos; veniunt subveniendo, venimus obediendo; veniunt illuminando, venimus intuendo; veniunt implendo, venimus capiendo; ut sit nobis eorum non extranea visio, sed interna; et in nobis eorum non transitoria mansio, sed aeterna; unde sequitur et mansionem apud eum faciemus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Love distinguishes the saints from the world: it makes men to be of one mind in an house; in which house the Father and the Son take their abode; who give that love to those, to whom in the end they will manifest themselves. For these is a certain inner manifestation of God, unknown to the ungodly, to whom there is no manifestation made of the Father and the Holy Spirit, and only could be of the Son in the flesh; which latter manifestation is not as the former, being only for a little while, not for ever, for judgment, not for joy, for punishment, not for reward. And We will come to him: They come to us, in that we go to Them; They come by succoring, we go by obeying; They come by enlightening, we go by contemplating; They come by filling, we go by holding: so Their manifestation to us is not external, but inward; Their abode in us not transitory, but eternal. It follows, And will make Our abode with him.

Qui ergo Deum vere diligit, in eius corde dominus et venit et mansionem facit: quia sic eum divinitatis amor penetrat ut ab hoc amore tentationis tempore non recedat: ille enim vere amat cuius mentem delectatio prava ex consensu non superat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Into some hearts He comes, but not to make His abode with them. For some feel compunction for a season and turn to God, but in time of temptation forget that which gave them compunction, and return to their former sins, just as if they had never lamented them. But whoever loves God truly, into his heart the Lord both comes, and also makes His abode therein: for the love of the Godhead so penetrates him, that no temptation withdraws him from it. He truly loves, whose mind no evil pleasure overcomes, through his consent thereto.

Nisi forte quisquam sic absurdus est ut arbitretur, cum pater et filius venerint, discessurum inde spiritum sanctum, tamquam locum daturum maioribus. Sed et huic carnali cogitationi occurrit Scriptura, cum dicit: ut maneat vobiscum in aeternum. In eadem ergo mansione cum ipsis erit in aeternum: quia nec ille sine ipsis venit, nec illi sine eo: sed propter insinuationem Trinitatis, personis singulis nominatis dicuntur quaedam, non tamen aliis separatis intelliguntur, propter eiusdem Trinitatis substantiam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But while the Father and the Son make Their abode with the loving, soul, is the Holy Spirit excluded? What means that which is said of the Holy Spirit above: He dwells with you, and shall be in you, but that the Spirit makes His abode with us? Unless indeed a man be so absurd as to think that when the Father and the Son come, the Holy Spirit departs, as if to give place to His superiors. Yet even this carnal thought is met by Scripture, in that it says, Abide with you for ever. He will therefore be in the same abode with Them for ever. As He did not come without Them, so neither They without Him. As a consequence of the Trinity, acts are sometimes attributed to single persons in it: but the substance of the same Trinity demands, that in such acts the presence of the other Persons also be implied.

Or thus Judas thought that he should, see Him, as we see the dead in sleep: How is it, that you will manifest Yourself to us, and not to the world? meaning, Alas, as you art to die, you will appear to us but as one dead. To correct this mistake, He says, I and My Father will come to him, i.e. I shall manifest Myself, even as My Father manifests Himself. And will make our abode with Him; which is not like a dream. It follows, And the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father’s which sent Me; i.e. He that hears not My words, inasmuch as he loves not Me, so loves he not My Father. This He says to show that He spoke nothing which was not the Father’s, nothing beside what seemed good to the Father.

Filii quippe tantummodo est in nomine patris venire, salva proprietate filii ad patrem, et patris ad filium. Nullus autem alius venit in nomine patris; sed verbi gratia, in nomine domini, Dei, et omnipotentis. Quomodo igitur servi qui in nomine domini veniunt, per hoc ipsum quod subiecti sunt et serviunt, indicant dominum, servi quippe sunt domini; sic et filius qui venit in nomine patris, portat eius nomen per hoc quod unigenitus Dei filius approbatur. Quia ergo spiritus sanctus in nomine filii a patre mittitur, ostendit quia unitate sit iunctus ad filium; unde et filii dictus est spiritus, per adoptionem suam filios faciens eos qui se recipere voluissent. Iste autem spiritus sanctus, qui venit in nomine filii missus a patre, docebit omnia eos qui in fide Christi perfecti sunt: omnia autem illa quae spiritualia sunt et intellectualia veritatis et sapientiae sacramenta. Docebit vero, non sicut qui artes aliquas et sapientiam studio industriaque didicere; sed quasi ipsa ars atque doctrina et sapientia, veritatis spiritus invisibiliter menti insinuat scientiam divinorum.
          <td><b>DIDYMUS</b>. The Savior affirms that the Holy Spirit is sent by the Father, in His, the Savior’s, name; which name is the Son. Here an agreement of nature and propriety, so to speak, of persons is strewn. The Son can come in the Father’s name only, consistently with the proper relationship of the Son to the Father, and the Father to the Son. No one else comes in the name of the Father, but in the name of God, of the Lord, of the Almighty, and the like. As servants who come in the name of their Lord, do so as being the servants of that Lord, so the Son who comes in the name of the Father, bears that name as being the acknowledged only-begotten Son of the Father. That the Holy Spirit then is sent in the Son’s name, by the Father, shows that He is in unity with the Son: whence He is said too to be the Spirit of the Son, and to make those sons by adoption, who are willing to receive Him. The Holy Spirit then, Who comes in the name of the Son from the Father, shall teach them, who are established in the faith of Christ, all things; all things which are spiritual, both the understanding of truth, and the sacrament of wisdom. But He will teach not like those who have acquired an art or knowledge by study and industry, but as being the very art, doctrine, knowledge itself. As being this Himself, the Spirit of truth will impart the knowledge of divine things to the mind.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Unless the Spirit be present to the mind of the hearer, the word of the teacher is vain. Let none then attribute to the human teacher, the understanding which follows in consequence of his teaching: for unless there be a teacher within, the tongue of the teacher outside will labor in vain.

He left no peace in this world; in which we conquer the enemy, and have love one to another: He will give us peace in the world to come, when we shall reign without an enemy, and where we shall be able to avoid disagreement. This peace is Himself, both when we believe that He is, and when we shall see Him as He is. But why does He say, Peace I leave with you, without the My, whereas He puts in My in, My peace 1 give to you? Are we to understand My in the former; or is it not rather left out with a meaning? His peace is such peace as He has Himself; the peace which He left us in this world is rather our peace than His. He has nothing to fight against in Himself, because He has no sin: but ours is a peace in which we still say, Forgive us our debts (Matt 6:12). And in like manner we have peace between ourselves, because we mutually trust one another, that we mutually love one another. But neither is that a perfect peace; for we do not see into each other’s minds. I could not deny however that these words of our Lord’s may be understood as a simple repetition. He adds, Not as the world gives, give I unto you: i.e. not as those men, who love the world, give. They give themselves peace, i.e. free, uninterrupted enjoyment of the world. And even when they allow the righteous peace, so far as not to persecute them, yet there cannot be true peace, where there is no true agreement, no union of heart.

Per quod ergo filius non est aequalis patri, per hoc erat iturus ad patrem, a quo et venturus est, iudicaturus vivos et mortuos; per illud autem in quo est aequalis gignenti, nunquam recedit a patre, sed cum illo est ubique totus pari divinitate, quam nullus continet locus. Ipse ergo filius Dei aequalis patri in forma Dei, quia semetipsum exinanivit, non formam Dei amittens, sed formam servi accipiens, maior est etiam seipso: quia maior est forma Dei, quae amissa non est, quam forma servi, quae accepta est. Haec igitur est forma servi, in qua Dei filius minor est non patre solo, sed etiam spiritu sancto: secundum hanc formam servi puer Christus etiam parentibus minor erat, quando parvus maioribus, sicut scriptum est, subditus erat.

Though He was only going for a time, their hearts would be troubled and afraid for what might happen before He returned; lest in the absence of the Shepherd the wolf might attack the flock: you have heard how I said to you, I go away, and come again to you. In that He was man, He went; in that He was God, He stayed. Why then be troubled and afraid, when He left the eye only, not the heart? To make them understand that it was as man that He said, I go away, and come again to you; He adds, If you loved Me you would rejoice, because I said, I go to My Father; for My Father is greater than I. In that the Son then is unequal with the Father, through that inequality He went to the Father, from Him to come again to judge the quick and dead: in that He is equal to the Father, He never goes from the Father, but is everywhere altogether with Him in that Godhead, which is not confined to place. Nay, the Son Himself, because that being equal to the Father in the form of God, He emptied Himself, not losing the form of God, but taking that of a servant, is greater even than Himself: the form of God which is not lost, is greater than the form of a servant which was put on. In this form of a servant, the Son of God is inferior not to the Father only, but to the Holy Ghost; in this the Child Christ was inferior even to His parents; to whom we read, He was subject. Let us acknowledge then the twofold substance of Christ, the divine, which is equal to the Father, and the human, which is inferior. But Christ is both together, not two, but one Christ else the Godhead is a quaternity, not a Trinity. Wherefore He says, If you loved Me, you would rejoice, because I said, I go to the Father; for human nature should exult at being thus taken up by the Only Begotten Word, and made immortal in heaven; at earth being raised to heaven, and dust sitting incorruptible at the right hand of the Father. Who, that loves Christ, will not rejoice at this, seeing, as he does, his own nature immortal in Christ, and hoping that He Himself will be so by Christ.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Nondum noverant apostoli quid sit resurrectio, quam praedixerat dicens vado, et venio ad vos; neque qualem oportebat de eo opinionem, habebant; patrem vero magnum esse aestimabant. Dicit igitur eis: etsi de me formidatis quod me defendere nequeam, nec confiditis quod post crucem rursus vos videam; tamen audientes quoniam ad patrem vado, laetandum vobis est, quoniam ad maiorem vado, et potentem omnia versuta dissolvere. Haec autem omnia ad imbecillitatem discipulorum dicebantur: et ideo subdidit et nunc dixi vobis priusquam fiat, ut cum factum fuerit, credatis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: The Apostles did not yet know what the resurrection was of which He spoke when He said, I go, and come again to you: or what they ought to think of it. They only knew the great power of the Father. So He tells them: Though you fear I shall not be able to save Myself, and do not trust to My appearing again after My crucifixion; yet when you hear that I go to My Father, you should rejoice, because I go to one greater, one able to dissolve and change all things. All this is said in accommodation to their weakness: as we see from the next words: And now I have told you before it come to pass; that when it does come to pass, you may believe.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid est hoc, cum magis credere homo debeat antequam fiat id quod credendum est? Haec est enim laus fidei, si quod creditur non videtur: nam et ille cui dictum est: quia vidisti, credidisti, aliud vidit, aliud credidit: vidit hominem, credidit Deum. Sed si dicuntur credi quae videntur, sicut dicit unusquisque oculis suis se credidisse, non tamen ipsa est quae in nobis aedificatur fides; sed ex rebus quae videntur, acquiritur in nobis, ut ea credantur quae non videntur. Illud itaque dicit cum factum fuerit, quod eum post mortem visuri erant viventem et ad patrem ascendentem; quo viso, fuerant credituri quod ipse esset Christus filius Dei, qui hoc potuit facere, et praedicere antequam faceret; credituri autem hoc, non fide nova, sed aucta; aut certe cum mortuus esset, defecta; cum resurrexisset, refecta.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But is not the time for belief before a thing takes place? Is it not the praise of faith, that it believes what it does not see? according to what is said below to Thomas: Because you have seen, you has believed. He saw one thing, believed another: what he saw was man, what he believed was God. And if belief can be talked of with reference to things seen, as when we say that we believe our eyes; yet it is not mature faith, but is merely preparatory to our believing what we do not see. When it has come to pass, then He says, because after His death they would see Him alive again, and ascending to His Father; which sight would convince them that He was the Christ, the Son of God; able as He was to do so great a thing, and to foretell it. Which faith however would not be a new, but only an enlarged faith; or a faith which had failed at His death, and been renewed by His resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hilarius</b>: Gloriae autem resumendae meritum continuo subiecit dicens iam non multa loquar vobiscum.

Unde apostolus cum dixisset: adversus rectores mundi sequenti verbo exposuit quid dixisset mundi, cum subiungit: tenebrarum harum, idest hominum impiorum. Et in me non habet quidquam. Quia neque cum peccato Deus venerat, nec eius carnem de peccati propagine virgo pepererat. Et tamquam ei diceretur: cur ergo morieris, si non habes peccatum, cui debetur mortis supplicium? Continuo subiungit sed ut cognoscat mundus quia diligo patrem, et sicut mandatum dedit pater, sic facio; surgite, eamus hinc. Discumbens enim discumbentibus loquebatur.

Or, as He immediately adds by way of explanation, this darkness, meaning, the ungodly. And has nothing in Me. God had no sin as God, nor had His flesh contracted it by a sinful birth, being born of the Virgin. But how, it might be asked, can you die, if you have no sin: He answers, But that the world may know that I love the Father, and as the Father gave Me commandment, even so I do. Arise, let us go hence. He had been sitting at table with them all this time. Let us go, i.e. to the place, where He, Who had done nothing to deserve death, was to be delivered to death. But He had a commandment from His Father to die.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus contra Arianos</b>: Quod autem voluntati et praecepto patris obediens est filius nec in hominibus demonstrat diversam imparemque naturam patris praecipientis et filii obedientis. Huc accedit quod Christus non tantum Deus est, qua natura aequalis est patri, sed etiam homo, qua natura minor est patre.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That the Son is obedient to the will and commandment of the Father, no more shows a difference in the two, than it would in a human father and son. But over and above this comes the consideration that Christ is not only God, and as such equal to the Father, but also man, and as such inferior to the Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel hoc quod dicit surgite, eamus hinc, principium est alterius sententiae: consequens enim erat eos formidare et a tempore et a loco, in villa manifeste existentes: etenim nox profunda erat; et erat consequens eos non attendere his quae dicebantur; sed semper circumvolvere oculos, et imaginari eos qui aggressuri eos erant, et maxime audientes: adhuc modicum vobiscum sum, et: venit princeps mundi huius. Quia igitur haec et huiusmodi audientes, turbabantur, ut mox capiendi, ducit eos in locum alium, ut aestimantes se in cautela esse, cum otio de reliquo audiant: magna enim dogmata erant audituri.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Arise, let us go hence, is the beginning of the sentence which l, follows. The time and the place (they were in the midst of a town, and it was night time) had excited the disciples’ fears to such a degree, that they could not attend to any thing that was said, but rolled their eyes about, expecting persons to enter and assault them; especially when they heard our Lord say, Yet a little while I am with you; and, The prince of this world comes. To quiet their alarm then, He takes them to another place, where they imagine themselves safe, and would be able to attend to the great doctrines which He was going to set before them.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He rises in haste to perform the sacrament of His final passion in the flesh (such is His desire to fulfill His Father’s commandment) and therefore takes occasion to unfold the mystery of His assumption of His flesh, whereby He supports us, as the vine does its branches: I am the true vine.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quod secundum hoc dicit quod est caput Ecclesiae, nosque membra eius, homo Christus Iesus. Unius quippe naturae sunt vitis et palmites. Sed cum dicit ego sum vitis vera, numquid ut adderet vera, ad eam vitem retulit, unde ista similitudo translata est? Sic autem dicitur vitis per similitudinem, non per proprietatem: sicut agnus, ovis et cetera huiusmodi: ut magis ipsa sint vera, ex quibus ducuntur istae similitudines. Sed dicendo ego sum vitis vera, ab illa se discernit cui dicitur: quomodo conversa es in amaritudinem, vitis aliena?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He says this as being the Head of the Church, of which we are the members, the Man Christ Jesus; for the vine and the branches are of the same nature. When He says, I am the true vine, He does not mean really a vine; for He is only called so metaphorically, not literally, even as He is called the Lamb, the Sheep, and the like; but He distinguishes Himself from that vine to whom it is said, How you are turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me (Jer 11:21). For how is that a true vine, which when grapes are expected from it, produces only thorns?

          <td><b>AUG</b>. For we cultivate God, and God cultivates us. But our culture of God does not make Him better: our culture is that of adoration, not of plowing: His culture of us makes us better. His culture consists in extirpating all the seeds of wickedness from our hearts, in opening our heart to the plow, as it were, of His word, in sowing in us the seeds of His commandments, in waiting for the fruits of piety.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And forasmuch as Christ was sufficient for Himself, but His disciples needed the help of the Husbandman, of the vine He says nothing, but adds concerning the branches, Every branch in Me that bears not fruit, He takes away. By fruit is meant life, i.e. that no one can be in Him without good works.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And inasmuch as even the best of men require the work of the husbandman, He adds, And every branch that bears fruit, He purges it, that it may bring forth more fruit. He alludes here to the tribulations and trials which were coming upon them, the effect of which would be to purge, and so to strengthen them. By pruning the branches we make the tree shoot out the more.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quis autem est in hac vita sic mundus ut non sit magis magisque mundandus? Ubi si dixerimus quia peccatum non habemus, nosmetipsos seducimus. Mundat itaque mundos, idest fructuosos, ut tanto sint fructuosiores quanto sunt mundiores. Secundum hoc ergo vitis est Christus quod ait: pater maior me est; secundum illud autem quod ait supra: ego et pater unum sumus, et ipse agricola est; nec talis quales sunt qui extrinsecus operando exhibent ministerium, sed talis ut det intrinsecus incrementum: unde continuo etiam seipsum mundatorem palmitum ostendit, dicens iam vos mundi estis propter sermonem quem locutus sum vobis. Ecce ipse mundator est palmitum: quod est agricolae, non vitis officium. Sed quare non ait: mundi estis propter Baptismum quo abluti estis, nisi quia et in aqua verbum mundat? Detrahe verbum: et quid est aqua nisi aqua? Accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit sacramentum. Unde ista tanta virtus aquae ut corpus tangat et cor abluatur, nisi faciente verbo, non quia dicitur, sed quia creditur? Nam in ipso verbo aliud est sonus transiens, aliud virtus immanens. Hoc verbum fidei tantum valet in Ecclesia Dei ut per ipsum credentem, offerentem, benedicentem, tingentem mundet infantem, quamvis credere non valentem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And who is there in this world so clean, that he cannot be more and more changed? Here, if we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves. He cleans then the clean, i.e. the fruitful, that the cleaner they be, the more fruitful they may be. Christ is the vine, in that He said, My Father is greater than I; but in that He said, I and My Father are one, He is the husbandman; not like those who carry on an external ministry only; for He gives increase within. Thus He calls Himself immediately the cleanser of the branches: Now you are clean through the word, which I have spoken to you. He performs the part of the husbandman then, as well as of the vine. But why does He not say, you are clean by reason of the baptism wherewith you are washed? Because it is the word in the water which cleans. Take away the word, and what is the water, which but water. Add the word to the element, and you have a sacrament. Whence has the water such virtue as that by touching the body, it cleans the heart, but by the power of the word, not spoken only, but believed? For in the word itself the passing sound is one thing, the abiding virtue another. This word of faith is of such avail in the Church of God that by Him who believes, presents, blesses, sprinkles the infant, it cleanses that infant, though itself is unable to believe.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Magna gratiae commendatio. Corda instruit humilium, ora obstruit superborum. Nonne huic resistunt veritati, ad bona opera facienda Deum sibi necessarium non putantes, non assertores, sed praecipitatores liberi arbitrii? Qui enim a semetipso se fructum aestimat ferre, in vite non est; qui in vite non est, in Christo non est; qui in Christo non est, Christianus non est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Abide in Me, and I in you: not they in Him, as He in them; for both are for the profit not of Him, but them. The branches do not confer any advantage upon the vine, but receive their support from it: the vine supplies nourishment to the branches, takes none from them: so that the abiding in Christ, and the having Christ abiding in them, are both for the profit of the disciples, not of Christ; according to what follows, As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself, except it abide in the vine, no more can you, except you abide in Me. Great display of grace! He strengthens the hearts of the humble, stops the mouth of the proud. They who hold that God is not necessary for the doing of good works, the subverters, not the asserters, of free will, contradict this truth. For he who thinks that he bears fruit of himself, is not in the vine; he who is not in the vine, is not in Christ; he who is not in Christ, is not a Christian.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. All the fruit of good works proceeds from this root. He who has delivered us by His grace, also carries us onward by his help, so that we bring forth more fruit. Wherefore He repeats, and explains what He has said: I am the vine, you are the branches. He that abides in Me, by believing, obeying, persevering, and I in Him, by enlightening, assisting, giving perseverance, the same, and none other, brings forth much fruit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. But lest any should suppose that a branch could bring forth a little fruit of itself, He adds, For without Me you can do nothing. He does not say, you can do little. Unless the branch abides in the vine, and lives from the root, it can bear no fruit whatever. Christ, though He would not be the vine, except He were man, yet could not give this grace to the branches, except He were God.

And again, the cleansing is attributed to the Son also, and the abiding in the root to the Father who begot the root. It is a great loss to be able to do nothing, but He goes on to say more than this: If a man abide not in Me, he is cast forth as a branch, i.e. shall not benefit by the care of the husbandman, and withers, i.e., shall lose all that it desires from the root, all that supports its life, and shall die.

Sed absit ut faciat nobis, si maneamus in Christo, qui non facit quando petimus nisi quod expedit nobis. Ad verba autem eius pertinet oratio pater noster, ab huius orationis verbis et sensibus non recedamus in petitionibus nostris; et quidquid petimus, fiet nobis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For then may His words be said to abide in us, when we do what He has commanded, and love what He has promised. But when His words abide in the memory and are not found in the life, the branch is not accounted to be in the vine, because it derives no life from its root. So far as we abide in the Savior we cannot will any thing that is foreign to our salvation. We have one will, insofar as we are in Christ, another, insofar as we are in this world And by reason of our abode in this world, it sometimes happens that we ask for that which is not expedient, through ignorance. But never, if we abide in Christ, will He grant it us, Who does not grant except what is expedient for us. And here we are directed to the prayer, Our Father. Let us adhere to the words and the meaning of this prayer in our petitions, and whatever we ask will be done for us.

Qui autem fructum facit, ille est discipulus Christi; unde subdit et efficiamini mei discipuli.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord showed above, that those who plotted against them should be burned, inasmuch as they abode not in Christ: now He shows that they themselves would be invincible, bringing forth much fruit; Herein is My Father glorified, that you bear much fruit: as if He said, If it appertains to My Father’s glory that you bring forth fruit, He will not despise His own glory.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sive enim clarificatus, sive glorificatus dicatur, ex uno verbo Graeco utrumque translatum est. Doxa enim Graece dicitur, Latine gloria est. Quod ideo commemorandum putavi, ne hoc nostrae gloriae tribuamus, tamquam ex nobis ipsis habeamus: eius est enim haec gratia; et ideo in hoc non nostra, sed eius est gloria. A quo enim faciemus fructum nisi ab illo cuius misericordia praevenit nos? Unde subditur sicut dilexit me pater, et ego dilexi vos. Ecce unde sunt nobis opera bona; nam unde nobis essent, nisi quia fides per dilectionem operatur? Unde autem diligeremus, nisi prius diligeremur? Quod autem ait sicut dilexit me pater, et ego dilexi vos, non aequalitatem naturae ostendit nostrae et suae, sicut est patris et ipsius; sed gratiam, qua mediator est Dei et hominum, homo Christus Iesus. Mediator quippe monstratur, cum dicit pater dilexit me, et ego dilexi vos: nam pater utique diligit et nos, sed in ipso.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Made bright or glorified; the Greek word may be translated in either way. In Greek it signifies glory; not our own glory, we must remember, as if we had it of ourselves: it is of His grace that we have it; and therefore it is not our own but His glory. For from whom shall we derive our fruitfulness, but from His mercy preventing us. Wherefore He adds, As My Father has loved Me, even so love I you. This then is the source of our good works. Our good works proceed from faith which works by love: but we could not love unless we were loved first: As My Father has loved Me, even so love I you. This does not prove that our nature is equal to His, as His is to the Father’s, but the grace, whereby He is the Mediator between God and man, the man Christ Jesus. The Father loves us, but in Him.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si igitur pater amat nos, confidite: si patris est gloria, fructificate. Deinde ut non pigros eos faciat, subdit manete in dilectione mea. Qualiter autem hoc erit, ostendit subdens si praecepta mea servaveritis, manebitis in dilectione mea.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. If then I love you, be of good cheer; if it is the Father’s glory that you bring forth good fruit, bear no evil. Then to rouse them to exertion, He adds, Continue you in My love; and then shows how this is to be done: If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quis ambigat quod dilectio praecedat observantiam praeceptorum? Unde enim praecepta servet, non habet qui non diligit. Quod ergo hic ait, ostendit non unde dilectio generetur, sed unde monstretur; ut nemo se fallat dicendo quod eum diligat, si eius praecepta non servat. Quamvis quod dicit manete in dilectione mea, non apparet quam dixerit dilectionem: utrum qua eum diligimus, an qua ipse nos diligit; sed ex verbo superiori dignoscitur; dixerat quippe ego dilexi vos, et continuo subiecit manete in dilectione mea, illa utique qua dilexit eos. Quid est ergo manete in dilectione mea, nisi manete in gratia mea? Et quid est si praecepta mea servaveritis, manebitis in dilectione mea, nisi ex hoc scietis quod in dilectione mea, qua vos diligo, manetis, si mea praecepta servatis. Non ergo ut nos diligat, prius praecepta eius servamus; sed nisi nos diligat, praecepta eius servare non possumus. Haec est gratia quae humilibus patet, superbos latet. Sed quid illud est quod adiungit sicut et ego praecepta patris mei servavi et maneo in eius dilectione? Utique eam hic dilectionem patris intelligi voluit, qua eum diligit pater. Sed numquid et haec gratia intelligenda est qua pater diligit filium, sicut gratia est qua nos diligit filius; cum simus nos filii gratia, non natura, unigenitus autem natura, non gratia? An hoc etiam in ipso filio ad hominem referendum est? Ita sane: nam dicendo sicut dilexit me pater, et ego dilexi vos, gratiam mediatoris ostendit; mediator autem Dei et hominum, non inquantum Deus, sed inquantum homo, est Christus. Igitur hoc recte possumus dicere, quod cum ad naturam Dei non pertineat humana natura, ad personam tamen filii Dei per gratiam pertinet, qua nulla est maior, nulla prorsus aequalis. Neque enim illam susceptionem ulla hominis merita praecesserunt, sed ab illa susceptione merita eius cuncta coeperunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Who doubts that love precedes the observance of the commandments? For who loves not, has not that whereby to keep the commandments. These words then do not declare whence love arises, but how it is shown, that no one might deceive himself into thinking that he loved our Lord, when he did not keep His commandments. Though the words, Continue you in My love, do not of themselves make it evident which love He means, ours to Him, or His to us, yet the preceding words do: I love you, He says: and then immediately after, Continue you in My love. Continue you in My love, then, is, continue in My grace; and, If you keep My commandments, you shall abide in My love, is, Your keeping of My commandments will be evidence to you that you abide in My love. It is not that we keep His commandments first, and that then He loves; but that He loves us, and then we keep His commandments. This is that grace, which is revealed to the humble, but hidden from the proud. But what means the next words, Even as I have kept My Father’s commandments, and abide in His love: i.e., the Father’s love, wherewith He loves the Son. Must this grace, wherewith the Father loves the Son, be understood to be like the grace wherewith the Son loves us? No; for whereas we are sons not by nature, but by grace, the Only Begotten is Son not by grace, but by nature. We must understand this then to refer to the manhood in the Son, even as the words themselves imply: As My Father has loved Me, even so love I you. The grace of a Mediator is expressed here; and Christ is Mediator between God and man, not as God, but as man. This then we may say, that since human nature does not pertain to the nature of God, but does by grace pertain to the Person of the Son, grace also pertains to that Person: such grace as has nothing superior, nothing equal to it. For no merits on man’s part preceded the assumption of that nature.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quod est autem gaudium Christi in nobis, nisi quod dignatur gaudere de nobis? Et quod est gaudium nostrum, quod dicit implendum, nisi eius habere consortium? Gaudium autem iam ipse perfectum de nobis habebat, quando nos praesciendo et praedestinando gaudebat; sed illud gaudium in nobis non erat, quia nec nos, in quibus esse posset, eramus; coepit autem esse in nobis quando vocavit nos. Et hoc gaudium nostrum merito dicimus, quo nos beati futuri sumus; quod inchoatur in fide renascentium, implebitur in praemio resurgentium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And what is Christ’s joy in us, but that He deigns to rejoice on our account? And what is our joy, which He says shall be full, but to have fellowship with Him? He had perfect joy on our account, when He rejoiced in foreknowing, and predestinating us; but that joy was not in us, because then we did not exist: it began to be in us, when He called us. And this joy we rightly call our own, this joy wherewith we shall be blessed; which is begun in the faith of them who are born again, and shall be fulfilled in the reward of them who rise again.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. But when all our Lord’s sacred discourses are full of His commandments, why does He give this special commandment respecting love, if it is not that every commandment teaches love, and all precepts are one? Love and love only is the fulfillment of every thing that is enjoined. As all the boughs of a tree proceed from one root, so all the virtues are produced form one love: nor has the branch, i.e. the good work, any life, except it abide in the root of love.

Ad hoc ergo et nos invicem diligamus, ut dilectionem nostram discernamus a ceteris, qui non ad hoc se invicem diligunt ut Deus diligatur, quia nec vere diligunt. Qui autem se propter habendum Deum diligunt, ipsi se diligunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Where then love is, what can be wanting? Where it is not, what can profit? But this love is distinguished from men’s love to each other as men, by adding, As I have loved you. To what end did Christ love us, but that we should reign with Him? Let us therefore so love one another, as that our love be different from that of other men; who do not love one another, to the end that God may be loved, because they do not really love at all. They who love one another for the sake of having God within them, they truly love one another.

Cuius dilectionis summam exprimit cum subiungit maiorem hac dilectionem nemo habet, quam ut animam suam ponat quis pro amicis suis.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. The highest, the only proof of love, is to love our adversary; as did the Truth Himself, who while He suffered on the cross, showed His love for His persecutors: Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do (Luke 23:34). Of which love the consummation is given in the next words Greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Our Lord came to die for His enemies, but He says that He is going to lay down His life for His friends, to show us that by loving, we are able to gain over our enemies, so that they who persecute us are by anticipation our friends.

Hoc martyres ardenti dilectione fecerunt; ideo ad mensam Christi non sic eos commemoramus quemadmodum alios, ut etiam pro eis oremus; sed magis ut eorum vestigiis haereamus.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Having said, This is My commandment: that you love one another, even as I have loved you (1 Jn 3); it follows, as John said in his Epistle, that as Christ laid down His life for us, so we should lay down our lives for the brethren. This the martyrs have done with ardent love And therefore in commemorating them at Christ’s table, we do not pray for them, as we do for others, but we rather pray that we may follow their steps.

Quomodo autem intellecturi sumus et servum et amicum esse servum bonum, declarat cum subdit iam non dicam vos servos, quia servus nescit quid faciat dominus eius. Itaque tunc servi non erimus quando boni servi fuerimus. Numquid servo bono et probato dominus eius non etiam sua secreta committit? Sed sicut sunt duo timores, sic sunt duae servitutes. Est timor quem perfecta caritas mittit foras, in quo etiam est servitus simul foras cum ipso timore mittenda; et est alius timor castus, permanens in saeculum saeculi. Ad primam ergo servitutem servos pertinentes intuebatur dominus dicens iam non dicam vos servos, quia servus nescit quid faciat dominus eius: non ille utique servus ad timorem pertinens castum, cui dicitur: euge, serve bone (...) intra in gaudium domini tui; sed ille servus pertinens ad timorem foras a caritate mittendum, de quo alibi dicitur: servus non manet in domo in aeternum: filius autem manet in aeternum. Quoniam itaque dedit nobis potestatem filios Dei fieri, ut miro modo servi, non servi esse possimus, hoc dominum facere scimus. Hoc servus ille nescit, qui nescit quid faciat dominus eius; et cum aliquid boni facit, sic extollitur quasi hoc ipse faciat, et non dominus eius; et in se, et non in domino gloriatur.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Great condescension! Though to keep his Lord’s commandments is only what a good servant is obliged to do, yet, if they do so, He calls them His friends. The good servant is both the servant and the friend. But how is this? He tells us: Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knows not what his Lord does. Shall we therefore cease to be servants, as soon as ever we are good servants? And is not a good and tried servant sometimes entrusted with his master’s secrets, still remaining a servant? We must understand then that there are two kinds of servitude, as there are two kinds of fear. There is a fear which perfect love casts out; which also has in it a servitude, which will be cast out together with the fear. And there is another, a pure fear, which remains forever. It is the former state of servitude, which our Lord refers to, when He says, Henceforth I call you not servants, for the servant knows not what his Lord does; not the state of that servant to whom it is said, Well done, you good servant, enter you into the joy of your Lord (Matt 25:21), but of him of whom it was said below, The servant abides not in the house for ever, but the Son abides ever. Forasmuch then as God has given us power to become the sons of God, so that in a wonderful way, we are servants, and yet not servants, we know that it is the Lord who does this. This that servant is ignorant of, who knows not what his Lord does, and when he does any good thing, is exalted in his own conceit, as if he himself did it, and not his Lord; and boasts of himself, not of his Lord.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Vel omnia quae audivit a patre, quae nota fieri voluit servis suis, sunt gaudia internae caritatis et festa supernae patriae, quae nostris quotidie mentibus per aspirationem sui amoris imprimit: dum enim audita superna caelestia amamus, amata iam novimus, quia amor ipse notitia est. Omnia ergo nota eis fecerat, quia a terrenis desideriis immutati, amoris summi facibus ardebant.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Or all things which He heard from the Father, which He wished to be made known to His servants: the joys of spiritual love, the pleasures of our heavenly country, which He impresses daily on our minds by the inspiration of His love. For while we love the heavenly things we hear, we know them by loving, because love is itself knowledge. He had made all things known to them then, because being withdrawn from earthly desires, they burned with the fire of divine love.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. But let no one who has attained to this dignity of being called the friend of God, attribute this superhuman gift to his own merits: You have not chosen Me, but I have chosen you.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Haec est ineffabilis gratia: quid enim eramus quando Christum nondum elegeramus, nisi iniqui et perditi? Neque enim credideramus in eum, ut eligeret nos: nam si credentes elegit, eligentes elegit. Hic certe vacat vana illorum ratio qui ideo nos dicunt electos ante mundi constitutionem, quia praescivit nos Deus futuros bonos, non seipsum nos facturum bonos: quoniam si propterea nos elegisset quia bonos futuros esse praescierat, simul etiam praescisset quod eum nos fuissemus prius electuri: non enim aliter possumus esse boni; nisi forte dicendus est bonus qui non elegit bonum. Quid ergo elegit in non bonis? Non est ut dicas: ideo electus sum quia iam credebam; si enim credebas in eum, iam elegeras eum. Nec est ut dicas: antequam crederem iam bona operabar, ideo electus sum. Quid enim est boni operis ante fidem? Quid ergo dicturi sumus, nisi quia mali eramus, et electi sumus ut boni per gratiam nos eligentis essemus?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Ineffable grace! For what were we before Christ had chosen us, but wicked, and lost? We did not believe in Him, so as to be chosen by Him: for had He chosen us believing, He would have chosen us choosing. This passage refutes the vain opinion of those who say that we were chosen before the foundation of the world, because God foreknew that we should be good, not that He Himself would make us good. For had He chosen us, because He foreknew that we should be good, He would have foreknown also that we should first choose Him, for without choosing Him we cannot be good; unless indeed he can be called good, who has not chosen good. What then has He chosen in them who are not good? you can not say, I am chosen because I believed; for had you believed in Him, you had chosen Him. Nor can you say, Before I believed I did good works, and therefore was chosen. For what good work is there before faith? What is there for us to say then, but that we were wicked, and were chosen, that by the grace of the chosen we might become good?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Praedest. Sanct</b>: Electi sunt itaque ante mundi constitutionem ea praedestinatione in qua Deus sua futura facta praescivit; electi autem de mundo ea vocatione qua Deus id quod praedestinavit implevit: quos enim praedestinavit, hos et vocavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They are chosen then before the foundation of the world, according to that predestination by which God foreknew His future acts. They are chosen out of the world by that call whereby God fulfills what He has predestined: whom He did predestine, them He also called (Rom 8:30).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Et videte quemadmodum non eligat bonos, sed quos elegit, faciat bonos; nam sequitur et posui vos ut eatis et fructum afferatis. Iste est fructus de quo iam dixerat: sine me nihil potestis facere. Ipse est via, in qua nos posuit, ut eamus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Observe, He does not choose the good; but those, whom He has chosen, He makes good: And I have ordained you that you should go, and bring forth fruit. This is the fruit which He meant, when He said, Without Me you can do nothing. He Himself is the way in which He has set us to go.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Posui ergo vos, scilicet ad gratiam plantavi, ut eatis volendo, quia velle iam mente ire est; et fructum afferatis operando. Qualem vero fructum afferre debeant significat cum addit et fructus vester maneat: omne enim quod secundum praesens saeculum laboramus, vix usque ad mortem sufficit: mors namque interveniens fructum nostri laboris abscindit. Quod vero pro aeterna vita agitur, etiam post mortem servatur; et tunc apparere incipit, cum laborum carnalium fructus coeperit non videri. Tales ergo fructus operemur qui maneant, qui, cum mors cuncta interimat, ipsi exordium a morte sumant.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. I have set you, i.e., have planted you by grace, that you should go by will: to will being to go in mind, and bring forth fruit, by works. What kind of fruit they should bring forth He then shows: And that your fruit may remain; for worldly labor hardly produces fruit to last our life; and if it does, death comes at last, and deprives us of it all. But the fruit of our spiritual labors endures even after death; and begins to be seen at the very time that the results of our carnal labor begin to disappear. Let us then produce such fruits as may remain, and of which death, which destroys every thing, will be the commencement.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dilectio ergo est fructus noster; quae nunc est in desiderio, nondum in saturitate. Et ipso desiderio quodcumque petierimus in nomine unigeniti filii, dat nobis pater; unde sequitur ut quodcumque petieritis patrem in nomine meo, det vobis. Hoc petimus in nomine salvatoris quod pertinet ad rationem salutis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Love then is one fruit, now existing in desire only, not yet in fullness. Yet even with this desire whatever we ask in the name of the Only-Begotten Son, the Father gives us: That whatsoever you shall ask the Father in My name, He may give it you. We ask in the Savior’s name, whatever we ask, that will be profitable to our salvation.

Wherefore, He proceeds: These things I command you, that you love one another. Hence the Apostle said, The fruit of the Spirit is love(Gal 5:22), and enumerates all other graces as springing from this source.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or thus: I have said that I lay down My life for you, and that I first chose you. I have said this not by way of reproach, but to induce you to love one another. Then as they were about to suffer persecution and reproach, He bids them not to grieve, but rejoice on that account: If the world hates you, you know that it hated Me before it hated you: as if to say, I know it is a hard trial, but you will endure it for My sake.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Cur enim se membra supra verticem extollunt? Recusas esse in corpore, si non vis mundi odium sustinere cum capite.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As if Christ’s suffering were not consolation enough, He consoles them still further by telling them, the hatred of the world would be an evidence of their goodness; so that they ought rather to grieve if they were loved by the world, as that would be evidence of their wickedness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Universae autem hoc dicit Ecclesiae, quam plurimum mundi nomine appellat, sicut est illud: Deus erat in Christo, mundum reconcilians sibi. Totus ergo mundus Ecclesia est, et totus mundus odit Ecclesiam. Mundus igitur odit mundum, inimicus reconciliatum, inquinatus mundatum. Quaeri ergo potest: si etiam mali faciunt persecutionem malis, sicut impii reges et iudices cum essent persecutores piorum, utique et homicidas et adulteros puniebant; quomodo intelligendum est quod dominus ait si de mundo essetis, mundus quod suum erat diligeret? Nisi quia mundus est in eis a quibus talia scelera puniuntur, et mundus est in eis a quibus diliguntur. Mundus ergo odit quod suum est ex ea parte hominum qua sceleratis nocet, et diligit quod suum est ex ea parte qua ipsis favet. Si etiam quaeratur quomodo se diligat mundus qui odit modum redemptionis; diligit utique falsa dilectione, non vera: quoniam quod ei nocet hoc diligit: odit naturam, diligit vitium: unde et nos prohibemur diligere in illo quod ipse diligit, et iubemur diligere quod ipse odit in seipso. Vitium quippe in illo diligere prohibemur, iubemurque naturam. Ut autem de hoc mundo damnato non essent, electi sunt inde non meritis suis, quorum nulla bona praecesserant opera; non natura, quae tota fuerat in ipsa radice vitiata, sed gratia; unde sequitur quia vero de mundo non estis, sed ego elegi vos de mundo, propterea odit vos mundus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He said this to the whole Church which is often called the world; as God was in Christ, reconciling the world to Himself (2 Cor 5:19). The whole world then is the Church, and the whole world hates the Church. The world hates the world, the world in enmity, the world reconciled, the defiled world, the changed world. Here it may be asked, If the wicked can be said to persecute the wicked; e. g., if impious kings, and judges, who persecute the righteous, punish murderers and adulterers also, how are we to understand our Lord’s words, If you were of the world, the world would love his own? In this way; The world is in them who punish these offenses, and the world is In them who love them. The world then hates its own so far as it punishes the wicked, loves its own so far as it favors them. Again, if it be asked how the world loves itself, when it hates the means of its redemption, the answer is, that it loves itself with a false, not a true love, loves what hurts it; hates nature, loves vice. Wherefore we are forbidden to love what it loves in itself; commanded to love what it hates in itself. The vice in it we are forbidden, the nature in it we are commanded, to love. And to separate us from this lost world, we are chosen out of it, not by merit of our own, for we had no merits to begin with, not by nature which was radically corrupt, but by grace: But because you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hates you.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. For the dispraise of the perverse, is our praise. There is nothing wrong in not pleasing those who do not please God. For no one can by one and the same act please God, and the enemies of God.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord, in exhorting His servants to bear patiently the hatred of their world, proposes to them an example than which there can be no better and higher one, viz.

Tanto igitur miseriores qui propter hoc nomen ista faciunt, quanto beatiores qui propter hoc nomen ista patiuntur. Faciunt autem et ista malis; sed utrique miseri, et qui faciunt, et qui patiuntur. Quomodo autem hoc erit verum haec omnia facient vobis propter nomen meum, cum illi non propter nomen Christi faciant, hoc est propter iustitiam, sed propter iniquitatem suam? Haec quaestio ita solvitur, si totum referatur ad iustos, tamquam dictum sit: haec patiemini ab eis propter nomen meum. Si autem propter nomen meum sic accipitur, idest quod in vobis oderunt, et propter iustitiam quam in vobis oderunt: similiter recte dici possunt et boni, cum persecutionem faciunt malis, et propter iustitiam facere, quam diligendo persequuntur malos; et propter iniquitatem, quam oderunt in ipsis malis.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. All these things, viz. what He had mentioned, that the world would hate them, persecute them, despise their word. For My Name’s sake, i.e., in you they will hate Me, in you persecute Me, your word they will not keep, because it is mine. They who do these things for His name’s sake are as miserable, as they who suffer them are blessed: except when they do them to the wicked as well; for then both they who do, and they who suffer, are miserable. But how do they do all these things for His name’s sake, when they do nothing for Christ’s name’s sake, i.e., for justice sake? We shall do away with this difficulty, if we take the words as applying to the righteous; as if it were, All these things will you suffer from them, for My name’s sake. If for My name’s sake mean this, i.e., My name which they hate in you, justice which they hate in you; of the good, when they persecute the wicked, it may be said in the same way, that they do so both for righteousness’ sake, which they love, which love is their motive in persecuting, and for unrighteousness’ sake, the unrighteousness of the wicked, which they hate. Because they know not Him that sent Me, i.e. know not according to that knowledge of which it is said, To know you is perfect righteousness (Wisdom 15:3).

Numquid ergo sine peccato erant Iudaei, quibus Christus locutus est, antequam Christus in carne venisset? Sed magnum quoddam peccatum, non omne peccatum sub generali nomine vult intelligi: hoc est enim peccatum quo tenentur cuncta peccata, quod unusquisque si non habeat, dimittuntur ei cuncta peccata; hoc autem est, quia non crediderunt in Christum, qui propterea venit ut credatur in eum. Hoc ergo peccatum, si non venisset, non utique haberent: adventus enim eius quantum credentibus salutaris, tantum non credentibus exitialis factus est. Sequitur nunc autem excusationem non habent de peccato suo. Si autem hi ad quos non venit Christus, nec locutus est eis, excusationem non habent de peccato suo; cur hic dictum est, propterea istos non habere, quia venit et locutus est eis? Si autem habent, utrum ad hoc habent ut a poenis alienentur, aut ut mitius puniantur? Ad haec inquisita respondeo, eos habere excusationem, non de omni peccato suo, sed de hoc peccato suo, quo in Christum non crediderunt. Sed non in eo sunt numero illi ad quos per discipulos venit: non sunt enim in poena leviori ponendi qui omnino legem Christi accipere noluerunt, et eam, quantum ad ipsos attinet, omnino nullam esse voluerunt. Hanc etiam excusationem possunt habere qui priusquam Evangelium Christi audirent, vitae huius fine praeventi sunt; sed non ideo possunt effugere damnationem. Quicumque enim homines, nisi in eo salvatore salventur qui venit quaerere quod perierat, ad perditionem sine dubio pertinebunt. Quamvis dici possit, alios leviores, alios graviores poenas passuros. Ille enim perire Deo dicitur, qui ab illa beatitudine quam dat sanctis suis, per supplicium separatur.

By sin here He means not every sin, but a certain great sin, which includes all, and which alone hinders the remission of other sins, viz. unbelief. They did not believe in Christ, who came that they might believe in Him. This then they would not have had, had not Christ come; for Christ’s advent, as it was the salvation of the believing, so was it the perdition of the unbelieving. But now they have no cloak for their sin. If those to whom Christ had not come or spoken, had not an excuse for their sin, why is it said here that these had no excuse, because Christ had come and spoken to them? If the first had excuse, did it do away with their punishment altogether, or only mitigate it? I answer that this excuse covered, not all their sin, but only this one, viz. that they did not believe in Christ. But they are not of this number to whom Christ came by His disciples; they are not to be let off with a lighter punishment, who altogether refilled to receive Christ’s love, and, as far as concerned them, wished its destruction. This excuse they may have who died before they heard of Christ’s Gospel; but this will not shield them from damnation. For whoever are not saved in the Savior, who came to seek what was lost, shall without doubt go to perdition: though some will have lighter, others severer punishments. He perishes to God, who is punished with an exclusion from that happiness which is given to the saints. But there is as great a diversity of punishments, as there is of sins: though how this is settled is a matter known to the Divine Wisdom indeed, but too deep for human conjecture to examine or pronounce upon.

Et de hominibus quidem fieri potest ut eos saepe quos numquam vidimus oderimus vel diligamus, fama de aliquo sermocinante vel bene vel male. Sed quomodo de quo natura nobis intimatur, dicendus est ignotus? Non enim eius facie corporali nobis intimatur; sed tunc nobis ad cognitionem patet quando eius mores et vita non latent: alioquin nec seipsum nosse quisquam potest, qui videre faciem suam non potest. Sed plerumque in eis nostra credulitas fallitur: quia nonnunquam et historia, et multo magis fama mentitur. Pertinet autem ad nos ut, quia non possumus hominum indagare conscientiam, de ipsis rebus habeamus veram certamque sententiam. Quando ergo non erratur in rebus, ut recta sit improbatio vitiorum, virtutumque approbatio; si erratur in hominibus, venialis est humana tentatio. Proinde, sicut fieri potest ut homo bonus hominem bonum oderit, nesciens, non ipsum, sed quod putat esse ipsum; vel potius diligat nesciens, cum bonum diligit, quod est ille; ita fieri potest ut homo iniustus hominem oderit iustum; et tamen dum eum credit iniustum, diligat non ipsum, sed quod putat esse ipsum; quemadmodum autem homines, sic et Deum. Deinde, si interrogarentur Iudaei utrum diligerent Deum, se diligere responderent, non ex animo mentientes, sed errando potius opinantes: quomodo enim diligerent patrem veritatis qui habent odio veritatem? Nolunt enim sua facta damnari; et hoc habet veritas. Tantum igitur oderunt veritatem quantum oderunt suas poenas, quas talibus irrogat. Nesciunt autem illam esse veritatem, quae tales quales ipsi sunt damnat; ac per hoc quia veritatem, qua iudicante damnantur, de patre Deo natam nesciunt, etiam ipsum et nesciunt et oderunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But He has just said, Because they know not Him that sent Me. How could they hate one whom they did not know? For if they hated God, believing Him to be something else; and not God, this was not hatred of God. In the case of men, it often happens that we hate or love persons whom we have never seen, simply in consequence of what hat we have heard of them. But if a man’s character is known to us, he cannot properly be said to be unknown. And a man’s character is not shown by his face, but by his habits and way of life: else we should not be able to know ourselves, for we cannot see our own face. But history and fame sometimes lie, and our faith is imposed upon. We cannot penetrate into men’s hearts; we only know that such things are right, and others wrong; and if we escape error here, to be mistaken in men is a venial matter. A good man may hate a good man ignorantly, or rather love him ignorantly, for he loves the good man, though he hates the man whom he supposes him to be. A bad man may love a good man supposing him to be a bad man like himself, and therefore not, properly speaking, loving him, but the person whom he takes him to be. And in the same way with respect to God. If the Jews were asked whether they loved God, they would reply that they did love Him, not intending to lie, but only being mistaken in so saying. For how could they who hated the Truth, love the Father of the Truth? They did not wish their actions to be judged, and this the Truth did. They hated the Truth then, because they hated the punishment which He would inflict upon such as they. But at the same time they did not know that He was the Truth, who came to condemn them. They did not know that the Truth was born of God the Father, and therefore they did not know God the Father Himself. Thus they both hated and also knew not, the Father.

Sed respondetur nobis, et alios fecisse quae nec ipse nec alius fecit. Sed quod tam multa vitia et malas valetudines vexationesque mortalium tanta potestate sanaret, nullus omnino legitur antiquorum.

Haec nemo alius fecit in eis. Sic enim intelligendum est quod ait in eis, non inter eos vel coram eis, sed prorsus in eis: quia sanavit eos. Nemo tamen alius fecit quicumque talia opera in eis fecit: quoniam quisquis alius homo aliquid eorum fecit, ipso faciente facit; haec autem ipse non illis facientibus fecit.

Christ did no work greater than the raising of the dead, which we know the ancient Prophets did before Him. Is it that He did some things which no one else did? But others also did what neither He nor anyone else did. True; yet none of the ancient prophets that we read of healed so many bodily defects, sicknesses, infirmities. For to say nothing of single cases, Mark says, that wherever He entered, into villages, or cities, or country, they laid the sick in the streets, and besought Him that they might touch if it were but the border of His garment; and as many as touched Him were made whole (Mark 6:56). Such works as these no one else had done in them. In them, meaning, not amongst them, or before them, but within them. But even where particular works, like some of these, had been done before, whoever worked such did not really do them, for He did them through them, whereas He performs these miracles by His own power. For even if the Father or the Holy Spirit did them, yet it was none other than He, for the Three Persons are of one substance. For these benefits then they ought to have returned Him not hatred, but love. And this He reproaches them with But now they have both seen and hated both Me and My Father.

Sicut ergo nonnumquam gravius est peccatum diligere quam perpetrare, ita nequius est odisse iustitiam quam non fecisse. Sunt ergo nonnulli in Ecclesia, qui non solum bona non faciunt, sed etiam persequuntur; et quae ipsi facere negligunt, etiam in aliis detestantur. Horum peccatum non ex infirmitate aut ignorantia, sed ex solo studio perpetratur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. It is one thing not to do good, another to hate the teacher of goodness; as there is a difference between sudden and deliberate sins. Our state generally is that we love what is good, but from infirmity cannot perform it. But to sin of set purpose, is neither to do nor to love what is good. As then it is sometimes a heavier offense to love than to do, so is it more wicked to hate justice than not to do it. There are some in the Church, who not only do not do what is good, but even persecute it, and hate in others what they neglect to do themselves. The sin of these men is not that of infirmity or ignorance, but deliberate willful sin.

Iste spiritus consolator a filio mittitur, non secundum Angelorum aut prophetarum aut apostolorum ministerium, sed ut mitti decet a sapientia et virtute spiritum Dei indivisam habentem cum eadem sapientia et virtute naturam. Etenim filius missus a patre non separatur atque disiungitur ab eo, manens in illo, et habens illum in semetipso. Qui spiritus sanctus supradicto modo missus a filio, de patre egreditur, non aliunde ad alia transmigrans. Quomodo enim pater non consistit in loco, cum ultra omnem corporum sit naturam; ita et spiritus veritatis nequaquam locorum fine clauditur, cum sit incorporalis, et excedens universam creaturarum essentiam.
          <td><b>DIDYMUS</b>. The Holy Spirit He calls the Comforter, a name taken from His office, which is not only to relieve the sorrows of the faithful, but to fill them with unspeakable joy. Everlasting gladness is in those hearts, in which the Spirit dwells. The Spirit, the Comforter, is sent by the Son, not as Angels, or Prophets, or Apostles, are sent, but as the Spirit must be sent which is of one nature with the Divine wisdom and power that sends Him. The Son when sent by the Father, is not separated from Him, but abides in the Father, and the Father in Him. In the same way the Holy Spirit is not sent by the Son, and proceeds from the Father, in the sense of change of place. For as the Father’s nature, being incorporeal, is not local, so neither has the Spirit of truth, Who is incorporeal also, and superior to all created things, a local nature.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He calls Him not the Holy Spirit, but the Spirit of truth, to show the perfect faith that was due to Him.

That He might not be thought however to be opposed to the Father, and to be another and rival source, as it were, of the Spirit, He adds, From the Father, i.e., the Father agreeing, and taking an equal part in sending Him. When it is said that He proceeds, do not understand His procession to be an external mission, such as is given to ministering spirits, but a certain peculiar, and distinct procession, such as is true of the Holy Spirit alone. To proceed is not the same as being sent, but is the essential nature of the Holy Ghost, as coming from the Father.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Hic aliquis forsitan quaerit utrum et a filio procedat spiritus sanctus: filius enim solius patris est filius, et pater solius filii est pater: spiritus autem sanctus non est unius eorum spiritus, sed amborum, quandoquidem dicit ipse Christus: spiritus patris vestri qui loquitur in vobis; et dicit apostolus: misit Deus spiritum filii sui in corda vestra. Nec ob aliud aestimo ipsum proprie vocari spiritum, cum etiam si de singulis interrogemur, non possimus nisi et patrem et filium spiritum dicere. Quod ergo communiter vocantur et singuli, hoc proprie vocari oportuit eum qui non est unus eorum, sed in quo communitas apparet eorum amborum. Cur ergo non credamus quod etiam de filio procedat spiritus sanctus, cum filii quoque ipse sit spiritus? Si enim ab eo non procederet, non post resurrectionem discipulis suis insufflasset, dicens: accipite spiritum sanctum. De hac quoque virtute credendus est dicere Evangelista: virtus de illo exibat, et sanabat omnes. Si ergo et de patre et de filio procedat spiritus sanctus, cur filius dixit de patre procedit, nisi quemadmodum solet ad eum referre et quod ipsius est de quo ipse est? Unde illud est quod ait: mea doctrina non est mea, sed eius qui me misit. Si igitur haec intelligatur eius doctrina, quam tamen dixit non suam, sed patris: quanto magis intelligendus est et de ipso procedere spiritus sanctus, ubi sic ait de patre procedit, ut non diceret: de me non procedit. A quo autem habet filius ut sit Deus, ab illo habet utique ut procedat ab eo spiritus sanctus. Hinc utcumque et illud intelligitur, cur non dicatur natus esse, sed potius procedere spiritus sanctus: quoniam si et ipse filius diceretur, amborum utique filius diceretur, quod absurdissimum est: filius quippe nullus est duorum, nisi patris et matris. Absit autem ut inter Deum patrem et Deum filium tale aliquid suspicemur, quia nec filius hominum simul ex patre et ex matre procedit; sed cum in matrem procedit ex patre, non tunc procedit et ex matre. Spiritus autem sanctus non de patre procedit in filium et de filio procedit ad sanctificandam creaturam; sed simul de utroque procedit. Neque enim possumus dicere quod non sit vita spiritus sanctus, cum vita pater, vita sit filius; ac per hoc sicut pater, cum habeat vitam in semetipso, dedit et filio vitam habere in semetipso, sic ei dedit vitam procedere de illo, sicut procedit et de seipso.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If it be asked here whether the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Son also, we may answer thus: The Son is the Son of the Father alone, and the Father is the Father of the Son only; but the Holy Spirit is not the Spirit of one, but of both; since Christ Himself said, The Spirit of your Father which speaks in you (Mat 10:20). And the Apostle says, God has sent the Spirit of His Son into your hearts (Gal 4:6). This indeed, I think, is the reason why He is called peculiarly the Spirit. For both of the Father and the Son separately we may pronounce, that each is a Spirit. But what each is separately in a general sense, He who is not either one separately, but the union of both, is spiritually. But if the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Son, why should we not believe that He proceeds from the Son? Indeed if He did not proceed from the Son, Christ would not after the resurrection have breathed on His disciples, and said, Receive you the Holy Ghost. This too is what is meant by the virtue which went out of Him, and healed all. If the Holy Ghost then proceeds both from the Father and the Son, why does Christ say, Who proceeds from the Father? He says it in accordance with His general way of referring all that He has to Him from whom He is; as where He says, My doctrine is not Mine, but His that sent Me. If the doctrine was His, which He says was not His own, but the Father’s, much more does the Holy Spirit proceed from Him, consistently with His proceeding from the Father. From whom the Son has His Godhead, from Him He has it that the Holy Ghost proceeds from Him. And this explains why the Holy Ghost is not said to be born, but to proceed. For if He were born, He would be the Son of both Father and Son, an absurd supposition; for if two together have a Son, those two must be father and mother. But to imagine any such relation as this between God the Father, and God the Son, is monstrous. Even the human offspring does not proceed from father or mother at the same time; when it proceeds from the father, it does not proceed from the mother. Whereas the Holy Spirit does not proceed from the Father into the Son, and from the Son into the creature to be sanctified; but proceeds from Father and Son at once. And if the Father is life, and the Son is life, so the Holy Ghost is life also. Just then as the Father when He had life in Himself, gave also to the Son to have life in Himself; so He gave to the Son also that life should proceed from Him, even as it proceeded from Himself.

For when the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit which is given to us (Romans 5:5), then great peace have they that love God’s law, and they are not offended at it (Psalms 118). What they were about to suffer follows next: They shall put you out of the synagogues.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid autem mali erat apostolis expelli de Iudaicis synagogis, quasi non fuerint inde exituri, etiam si eos nullus expelleret? Sed voluit denuntiare, quia Iudaei Christum non fuerant recepturi, a quo isti non fuerant recessuri. Nam quia non erat ullus alius populus Dei quam illud semen Abrahae; si cognoscerent Christum, non aliae fierent Ecclesiae Christi, aliae synagogae Iudaeorum. Quod quia noluerunt, quid restabat nisi ut remanentes extra Christum, extra synagogam facerent eos qui non reliquerunt Christum? Deinde cum hoc eis dixisset, adiecit sed venit hora ut omnis qui interficit vos, arbitretur obsequium se praestare Deo. Quae verba ita subiecit tamquam ex hoc consolaretur eos qui de synagogis Iudaicis pellerentur. An forte de synagogis illa separatio sic eos fuerat turbatura ut mori vellent potius quam in hac vita sine Iudaeorum congregationibus morari? Absit ut sic turbarentur qui Dei, non hominum, gloriam requirebant. Iste itaque sensus est in his verbis. Extra synagogam facient vos; sed nolite solitudinem formidare. Separati quippe a congregationibus eorum, tam multos in nomine meo congregabitis, ut illi metuentes ne templum quod erat apud eos, et omnia legis veteris sacramenta deserantur, sic interficient vos ut Deo arbitrentur se praestare obsequium, zelum Dei habentes, sed non secundum scientiam. Hoc enim de Iudaeis dictum debemus accipere, de quibus dixerat: extra synagogam facient vos. Nam testes, idest martyres Christi, etiam si occisi sunt a gentilibus, non tamen illi arbitrati sunt Deo, sed diis suis falsis obsequium se praestare; Iudaeorum autem omnis qui occidit praedicatores Christi, Deo se putavit praestare obsequium, credens quod desererent Deum Israel quicumque converterentur ad Christum. Hinc ergo accensi et zelum Dei habentes, sed non secundum scientiam, obsequium se Deo praestare credentes, occidebant eos.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Bu what evil was it to the Apostles to be put out of the Jewish synagogues, which they would have gone out of, even if none had put them out? Our Lord wished to make known to them, that the Jews were about not to receive Him, while they on the other hand were not going to desert Him. There was no other people of God beside the seed of Abraham; if they acknowledged Christ, the Churches of Christ would be none other than the synagogues of the Jews. But inasmuch as they refused to acknowledge Him, nothing remained but that they should put out of the synagogue those who would not forsake Christ. He adds: But the time comes that whoever kills you will think that he does God service. Is this intended for a consolation, as if they would so take to heart their expulsion from the synagogues, that death would be a positive relief to them after it? God forbid that they who sought God’s glory, not men’s, should be so disturbed. The meaning of the words is this: They shall put you out of the synagogue, but do not be afraid of being left alone. Separated from their assemblies, you shall assemble so many in my name, that they, fearing that the temple and rites of the old law will be deserted, will kill you and think to do God service thereby, having a zeal for God but not according to knowledge. These who kill are the same with those who put out of the synagogues, viz. the Jews. For Gentiles would not have thought that they were doing God service, by killing Christ’s witnesses, but their own false gods; whereas every one of the Jews, who killed the preacher of Christ, thought he was doing God service, believing that whoever was converted to Christ, deserted the God of Israel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Deinde consolationem inducit, dicens et haec omnia facient vobis, quia non noverunt patrem neque me; quasi dicat: sufficit vobis in consolationem, propter me et patrem haec pati.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Then He consoles them: And all these things will they do to you, because they have not known the Father nor Me. As if He said, Let this consolation content you.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ne autem ignaros atque imparatos animos mala improvisa, quamvis cito transitura, turbarent, hanc fuisse causam ut haec eis praenuntiaret, ostendit subdens haec locutus sum vobis, ut cum venerit hora eorum, reminiscamini quia dixi vobis. Hora eorum, hora tenebrosa, hora nocturna; sed nox Iudaeorum separatum a se diem Christianorum nulla confusione fuscavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And He mentions these things beforehand, because trials, however soon to pass away, when they come upon men unprepared for them, are very overwhelming: But these things have I told you, that when the hour shall come, you may remember that 1 told you of them: the hour, the hour of darkness, the hour of night. But the night of the Jews was not allowed to mix with or darken the day of the Christians.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed et propter aliam causam hoc praedixit, ut non dicerent, quoniam non praevidit futura; et hoc significat cum dicit reminiscamini quia ego dixi vobis. Et ut non possent dicere, quoniam blandiens nobis, ea quae ad gratiam dicebat solum. Cuius autem gratia hoc a principio non dixit, ostendit dicens haec autem ab initio vobis non dixi, quia vobiscum eram: quia scilicet in custodia mea eratis, et licitum erat interrogare quando volebatis, et super me totum praelium vertebatur: unde superfluum erat hoc a principio vobis dicere; non quia haec tunc non noveram, propterea non dixi.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. And He predicted these trials for another reason, viz. that they might not say that He had not foreseen them; That you may remember that I told you of them, or that He had only spoken to please them, and given false hopes. And the reason is added why He did not reveal these things sooner: And these things I said not to you at the beginning, because I was with you; because, that is, you were in My keeping, and might ask when you pleased, and the whole battle rested upon Me. There was no need then to tell you these things at the first, though I myself knew them.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed alii tres Evangelistae eum praedixisse ista demonstrant, antequam ventum esset ad coenam, qua peracta, secundum Ioannem, ista locutus est. An forte hinc ista solvitur quaestio, quia et illi eum narrant proximum fuisse passioni cum hoc diceret? Non ergo ab initio quando cum illis erat. Sed Matthaeus non solum imminente passione, verum etiam ab initio haec denuntiata esse commemorat. Quid sibi ergo vult quod hic dicit haec autem ab initio non dixi, nisi quia ea quae hic dicit de spiritu sancto, quod sit venturus ad eos, et testimonium perhibiturus quando mala passuri sunt, haec eis ab initio non dixit, quoniam cum ipsis erat et eius praesentia consolabantur? Abscessurus autem, oportebat ut diceret illum esse venturum, per quem caritate diffusa in cordibus suis verbum Dei cum fiducia praedicarent.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In the other three Evangelists these predictions occur before the supper; John gives them after. Still if they relate them as given very near His Passion, that is enough to explain His saying, These things I said not to you at the beginning. Matthew however relates these prophecies as given long before His Passion, on the occasion of His choosing the twelve. How do we reconcile this with our Lord’s words? By supposing them to apply to the promise of the Holy Spirit, and the testimony He would give amidst their suffering. This was what He had not told them at the beginning, and that because He was with them, and His presence was a sufficient consolation. But as He was about to depart, it was meet that He should tell them of His coming, by whom the love of God would be shed abroad in their hearts, to preach the word of God with boldness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel praedixit quidem quoniam flagella patientur; non autem quod mors eorum reputaretur ut Dei cultura: quod maxime poterat eos attonitos facere. Vel quia illic ea quae a gentibus debebant pati dixit; hic autem et quae a Iudaeis dicit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, He had foretold that they should suffer scourgings, but not that their death could be thought doing God service; which was the strangest thing of all. Or, He there told them what they would suffer from the Gentiles, here what from the Jews.

Audientes enim quoniam qui interficiet vos, opinabitur se obsequium praestare Deo, ita ceciderunt ut nihil ei loquerentur; et ideo subditur sed quia haec locutus sum vobis, tristitia implevit cor vestrum. Non parva autem est haec mitigatio, scire eos quoniam sciverat dominus tristitiae eorum superabundantiam, et propter desertionem eius, et propter mala quae didicerant se passuros, et nesciebant si possent viriliter ferre.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The disciples, not as yet perfected, being overcome by sorrow, our Lord blames and corrects them, saying, But now I go My way to Him that sent Me; and none of you asks Me, Where do you go? They were so struck down at hearing that whoever killed them would think that he was doing God service, that they could say nothing. Wherefore He adds, But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your hearts. It was no small consolation to them to know that the Lord knew their superabundant sorrow, because of His leaving them, and because of the evils which they heard they were to suffer, but knew not whether they should suffer manfully.

Euntem enim in caelum non verbis quaesierunt, sed oculis deduxerunt. Videbat autem dominus quid sua verba in eorum cordibus agerent: spiritualem quippe nondum interius habentes consolationem quam per spiritum sanctum fuerant habituri, id quod exterius in Christo videbant, amittere metuebant; et quia se amissuros esse, illo vera denuntiante, dubitare non poterant, contristabatur humanus affectus, quia carnalis desolabatur aspectus; unde sequitur sed quia haec locutus sum vobis, tristitia implevit cor vestrum. Noverat autem ille quid eis potius expediret: quia visus interior ipse est melior, quo eos consolaturus erat spiritus sanctus; unde subdit sed ego veritatem dico vobis: expedit vobis ut ego vadam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or whereas they had asked Him above, where He was going, and He had replied that He was going where they would not come; now He promises that He will go in such a way that no one will ask Him where He goes: and none of you asks Me, Where do you go? Going up to heaven, they questioned Him not in words, but followed with their eyes. But our Lord saw what effect His words would produce upon their minds. Not having yet that inward consolation which the Holy Ghost was to impart, they were afraid to lose the outward presence of Christ, and so, when they could no longer doubt from His own words that they were going to lose Him, their human affections were saddened, for the loss of their visible object. Wherefore it follows; But because I have said these things to you, sorrow has filled your heart. But He knew that it would be for their good, forasmuch as that inward sight wherewith the Holy Ghost would console them was the better one: Nevertheless I tell you the truth: It is expedient for you that I go away.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quasi dicat: et si millies contristemini, oportet vos audire, quia me recedere vobis confert. Quid autem conferat, ostendit subdens si enim non abiero, Paraclitus non veniet ad vos.

Oportebat ergo ut auferretur ab eorum oculis forma servi, quam intuentes hoc solum Christum esse putabant quod videbant; unde sequitur si autem abiero, mittam eum ad vos.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This He says not on account of any inequality between the Word of God and the Holy Ghost, but because the presence of the Son of man amongst them would impede the coming of the latter. For the Holy Ghost did not humble Himself as did the Son, by taking upon Him the form of a servant. It was necessary therefore that the form of the servant should be removed from their eyes; for so long as they looked upon that, they thought that Christ was no more than what they saw Him to be. So it follows: But if I depart, I will send Him unto you.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Holy Ghost the Comforter brought this, that the form of a servant which our Lord had received in the womb of the Virgin, being removed from the fleshly eye, He was manifested to the purified mental vision in the very form of God in which He remained equal to the Father, even while He deigned to appear in the flesh.

Spiritus autem sanctus in discipulis eius toto orbe diffusis, non unam gentem intelligitur arguisse, sed mundum. Sed quis audeat dicere quod per discipulos Christi arguat mundum spiritus sanctus, et non arguat Christus, cum clamet apostolus: an experimentum quaeritis eius qui in me loquitur Christus? Quos itaque arguit spiritus sanctus, utique et Christus. Sed dixit ille arguet mundum, quasi dicat: ille diffundet in cordibus vestris caritatem; sic enim timore depulso, arguendi habebitis libertatem. Exponit deinde quid dixerit, dicens de peccato quidem, quia non crediderunt in me; hoc enim peccatum solum prae ceteris posuit, quia hoc manente, cetera detinentur, et hoc discedente, cetera dimittuntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But how is it that Christ did not reprove the world? Is it because Christ spoke among the Jews only, whereas the Holy Spirit, poured into His disciples throughout the whole world, reproved not one nation only, but the world? But who would dare to say that the Holy Ghost reproved the world by Christ’s disciples, and that Christ did not when the Apostle exclaims, Do you seek a proof of Christ speaking in Me? (2 Cor 13:3) Those then whom the Holy Ghost reproves, Christ reproves also. He shall reprove the world, means, He shall pour love into your hearts, insomuch, that fear being cast out, you shall be free to reprove. He then explains what He has said: Of sin, because they believed not in Me. He mentions this as the sin above all others, because while it remains, the others are retained; when it departs, the others are remitted.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Sed multum interest utrum quisque credat ipsum esse Christum et utrum credat in Christum; nam ipsum esse Christum, et Daemones crediderunt: ille vero credit in Christum qui et sperat in Christum et diligit Christum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But it makes a great difference whether one believes in Christ, or only that He is Christ. For that He was Christ, even the devils believed; but he believes in Christ who both hopes in Christ and loves Christ.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Arguitur ergo mundus de peccato, quia in Christum non credit; et arguitur de iustitia eorum qui credunt. Ipsa quippe fidelium comparatio, infidelium est vituperatio. De iustitia vero, quia ad patrem vado. Et quoniam ista vox infidelium esse consuevit: quomodo credimus quod non videmus? Ideo credentium iustitiam sic oportuit definiri: quia ad patrem vado, et iam non videbitis me. Beati enim qui non vident et credunt. Nam et qui viderunt Christum, non in eo laudata est fides eorum quia credebant quod videbant, idest filium hominis; sed quia credebant quod non videbant, idest filium Dei. Cum vero et ipsa forma servi subtracta eorum esset aspectibus, tunc ex omni parte impletum est: iustus ex fide vivit. Erit itaque vestra iustitia, de qua mundus arguetur, quoniam in me, quem non videbitis, credetis; et quandoque me videbitis: quoniam tunc sicut ero videbitis me, non quod sum vobiscum modo; idest, non videbitis mortalem, sed sempiternum; dicendo enim iam non videbitis me, velut nunquam eos de cetero visuros Christum praenuntiavit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The world is reproved of sin, because it believes not in Christ, and reproved of righteousness, the righteousness of those that believe. The very contrast of the believing, is the censure of the unbelieving. Of righteousness because I go to the Father: as it is the common objection of unbelievers, How can we believe what we do not see? So the righteousness of believers lies in this: Because I go to the Father, and you see Me no more. For blessed are they which see not, and believe. The faith even of those who saw Christ is praised, not because they believed what they saw, i.e., the Son of man, but because they believed what they saw not, i.e., the Son of God. And when the form of the servant was withdrawn from their sight altogether, then only was fulfilled in completeness the text, The just live by faith (Heb 10:38). It will be your righteousness then, of which the world will be reproved, that you shall believe in Me, not seeing Me. And when you shall see Me, you shall see Me as I shall be, not as I am now with you, i.e., you shall not see Me mortal, but everlasting. For in saying, you see Me no more, He means that they should see Him no more forever.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Verb. Dom</b>: Vel aliter. Illi non crediderunt: ipse ad patrem vadit. Illorum ergo peccatum, ipsius autem iustitia. Quod enim a patre ad nos venit, misericordia est; iustitia vero quod ad patrem vadit; secundum illud apostoli: propter quod et Deus exaltavit illum. Sed si solus vadit ad patrem, quid nobis prodest? An ideo solus, quia Christus unus est cum omnibus membris suis, tamquam caput cum corpore suo? Arguitur ergo mundus de peccato in eis qui non credunt in Christum, et de iustitia in eis qui resurgunt in membris Christi. Sequitur de iudicio autem, quia princeps mundi huius iam iudicatus est, idest Diabolus princeps iniquorum, qui corde non habitant nisi in hoc mundo quem diligunt. Hoc autem ipso quo foris missus est, iudicatus est; et de hoc iudicio mundus arguitur: quia frustra de Diabolo queritur qui non vult credere in Christum, quem iudicatum, idest foras missum, et propter nostram exercitationem forinsecus expugnare permissum, non solum viri, sed etiam mulieres et pueri et puellae martyres vicerunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus: They believed not, He went to the Father. Theirs therefore was the sin, His the righteousness. But that He came from the Father to us was mercy; that He went to the Father was righteousness; according to the saying of the Apostle, Wherefore God also has highly exalted Him (Phil 2:9). But if He went to the Father alone, what profit is it to us? Is He not alone rather in the sense of being one with all His members, as the head is with the body? So then the world is reproved of sin, in those who believe not in Christ; and of righteousness, in those who rise again in the members of Christ. It follows, Of judgment, because the prince of this world is judged--i.e., the devil, the prince of the wicked--who in heart dwell only in this world which they love. He is judged in that he is cast out; and the world is reproved of this judgment; for it is vain for one who does not believe in Christ to complain of the devil, whom judged, i.e., cast out, and permitted to attack us from without, only for our trial, not men only but women, boys and girls, have by martyrdom overcome.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel iudicatus est, quoniam iudicio ignis aeterni irrevocabiliter destinatus est; et de hoc iudicio mundus arguitur, quoniam cum suo principe iudicatur, quem superbum atque impium imitatur. Credant itaque homines in Christum, ne arguantur de peccato infidelitatis suae, quo peccata omnia detinentur; transeant in numerum fidelium, ne arguantur de iustitia eorum quos iustificatos non imitantur; caveant futurum iudicium, ne cum mundi principe iudicentur, quem iudicatum imitantur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or, judged, i.e., is destined irrevocably for the punishment of eternal fire. And of this judgment is the world reproved, in that it is judged with its prince, the proud and ungodly one whom it imitates. Let men therefore believe in Christ, lest they be reproved of the sin of unbelief, by which all sins are retained; pass over to the number of the believing, lest they be reproved of the righteousness of those whom justified they do not imitate; beware of the judgment to come, lest with the prince of this world whom they imitate, they too be judged.

Sed alia sunt mala quae portare non potest qualiscumque pudor humanus, et alia sunt bona quae portare non potest parvus sensus humanus. Ista sunt in corporibus impudicis, illa remota sunt a corporibus universis. Quis autem nostrum audeat eorum se dicere iam capacem quae illi capere non valebant? Ac per hoc nec a me expetenda sunt ut dicantur. Sed dicet aliquis: sic multi possunt quod tunc non poterat Petrus, sicut multi possunt martyrio coronari, quod tunc non poterat Petrus, praesertim iam misso spiritu sancto, qui tunc nondum erat missus. Sed numquid ideo scimus quae sunt quae dicere voluit? Absurdissime enim mihi videtur dici, tunc non potuisse portare discipulos quae de altissimis rebus invenimus in apostolicis litteris quae postmodum scriptae sunt, nec ea dominum dixisse narratur. Perversarum quidem sectarum homines ferre non possunt quod in Scripturis sanctis de fide Catholica reperitur, sicut nos ferre non possumus sacrilegas eorum vanitates: quid enim est ferre non posse, nisi aequo animo non habere? Quis autem fidelis, vel etiam catechumenus, antequam spiritum sanctum baptizatus accipiat, non aequo animo legit atque audit, etiam si non intelligit ea quae post ascensionem domini scripta sunt? Dicet autem aliquis: nihil ne spirituales viri habent in doctrina quod carnalibus taceant, et spiritualibus eloquantur? Nulla quidem necessitas est ut aliqua secreta doctrinae taceantur fidelibus parvulis, seorsum dicenda maioribus; sed spirituales spiritualia carnalibus non omnino taceant propter Catholicam fidem, quae omnibus praedicanda est: nec tamen sic edisserant ut volentes ea perducere ad intelligentiam non capacium, facilius fastidire faciant in veritate sermonem, quam in sermone percipi veritatem. Non ergo in his domini verbis nescio quae secreta suscipimus quae cum dici a docente possint, portari a discente non possint.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. All heretics, when their fables are rejected for their extravagance by the common sense of mankind, try to defend themselves by this text; as if these were the things which the disciples could not at this time bear, or as if the Holy Spirit could teach things, which even the unclean spirit is ashamed openly to teach and preach. But bad doctrines such as even natural shame cannot bear are one thing, good doctrines such as our poor natural understanding cannot bear are another. The one are allied to the shameless body, the other lie far beyond the body. But what are these things which they could not bear; I cannot mention them for this very reason; for who of us dare call himself able to receive what they could not? Some one will say indeed that many, now that the Holy Ghost has been sent, can do what Peter could not then, as earn the crown of martyrdom. But do we therefore know what those things were, which He was unwilling to communicate; for it seems most absurd to suppose that the disciples were not able to bear then the great doctrines, that we find in the Apostolic Epistles, which were written afterwards, which our Lord is not said to have spoken to them. For why could they not bear then what every one now reads and bears in their writings, even though he may not understand? Men of perverse sects indeed cannot bear what is found in Holy Scripture concerning the Catholic faith, as we cannot bear their sacrilegious vanities; for not to bear means not to acquiesce in. But what believer or even catechumen before he has been baptized and received the Holy Ghost, does not acquiesce in and listen to, even if he does not understand, all that was written after our Lord’s ascension; But some one will say, Do spiritual men never hold doctrines which they do not communicate to carnal men, but do to spiritual? There is no necessity why any doctrines should be kept secret from the babes and revealed to the grown up believers. Spiritual men ought not altogether to withhold spiritual doctrines from the carnal, seeing the Catholic faith ought to be preached to all; nor at the same time should they lower them in order to accommodate them to the understanding of persons who cannot receive them, and so make their own preaching contemptible, rather than the truth intelligible. So then we are not to understand these words of our Lord to refer to certain secret doctrines which if the teacher revealed, the disciple would not be able to bear, but to those very things in religious doctrine which are within the apprehension of all of us. If Christ chose to communicate these to us, in the same way in which He does to the Angels, what men, yea what spiritual men, which the Apostles were not now, could bear them? For indeed every thing which can be known of the creature is inferior to the Creator; and yet who is silent about Him? While in the body we cannot know all the truth, as the Apostle says, We know in part (1 Cor 13); but the Holy Spirit sanctifying us fits us for enjoying that fullness of which the same Apostle says, Then face to face. Our Lord’s promise, But when He the Spirit of truth shall come, He shall teach you all truth, or shall lead you into all truth, does not refer to this life only, but to the life to come, for which this complete fullness is reserved. The Holy Spirit both teaches believers now all the spiritual things which they are capable of receiving, and also kindles in their hearts a desire to know more.

Or He means that His hearers had not yet attained to all those things which for His name’s sake they were able to bear; so, revealing lesser things, He puts off the greater for a future time, such things as they could not understand till the Cross itself of their crucified Head had been their instruction. As yet they were slaves to the types, and shadows, and images of the Law, and could not bear the truth of which the Law was the shadow. But when the Holy Ghost came, He would lead them by His teaching and discipline into all truth, transferring them from the dead letter to the quickening Spirit, in Whom alone all Scripture truth resides.

Cum igitur spiritus sanctus nulla susceptione cuiusquam creaturae creatura sit factus, quomodo de illo hoc intelligendum est? Sic itaque debemus accipere, ut intelligamus non eum esse a se ipso: nam filius de patre natus est, et spiritus sanctus de patre procedit. Quid autem illic intersit inter procedere et nasci, et longum est disserere, et temerarium definire. Audire autem illi scire est, scire vero esse. Quia ergo non est a semetipso, sed ab illo a quo procedit; a quo illi est essentia, ab illo scientia: ab illo igitur audientia. Semper itaque audit spiritus sanctus, quia semper scit: ab illo ergo audivit, audit et audiet a quo est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This is like what He said of Himself above, i.e., I can of My own Self do nothing; as I hear I judge. But that may be understood of Hi m as man; how must we understand this of the Holy Ghost, Who never became a creature by assuming a creature? As meaning that He is not from Himself: The Son is born of the Father, and the Holy Ghost proceeds from the Father. In what the difference consists between proceeding and being born, it would require a long time to discuss, and would be rash to define. But to hear is with Him to know, to know to be. As then He is not from Himself, but from Him from Whom He proceeds, from Whom His being is, from the same is His knowledge. From the same therefore His hearing. The Holy Ghost then always hears, because He always knows; and He has heard, hears, and will hear from Him from Whom He is.

Dicere autem et loqui in Trinitate, non secundum consuetudinem nostram accipiendum est, sed iuxta formam incorporalium naturarum, et maxime Trinitatis, quae voluntatem suam inserit cordibus credentium, et eorum qui audire eum sunt digni. Loqui ergo patrem et audire filium, eiusdem naturae in patre et filio consensusque significatio est. Spiritus vero sanctus, qui est spiritus veritatis spiritusque sapientiae, non potest filio loquente audire quae nescit, cum hoc ipsum sit quod profertur a filio, idest procedens veritas a veritate, consolator manans a consolatore, Deus de Deo spiritus veritatis procedens. Denique ne quis illum a patris et filii voluntate et societate discerneret, scriptum est sed quae audiet loquetur.
          <td><b>DIDYMUS</b>. He shall not speak of Himself, i.e., not without Me, and Mine and the Father’s will: because He is not of Himself, but from the Father and Me. That He exists, and that He speaks, He has from the Father and Me. I speak the truth; i.e., I inspire as well as speak by Him, since He is the Spirit of Truth. To say and to speak in the Trinity must not be understood according to our usage, but according to the usage of incorporeal natures, and especially the Trinity, which implants Its will in the hearts of believers, all of those who are worthy to hear It. For the Father then to speak, and the Son to hear, is a mode of expressing the identity of their nature, and their agreement. Again, the Holy Spirit, Who is the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of wisdom, cannot hear from the Son what He does not know, seeing He is the very thing which is produced from the Son, i.e. truth proceeding from truth, Comforter from Comforter, God from God. Lastly, lest any one should separate Him from the will and society of the Father and the Son, it is written, Whatsoever He shall hear, that shall He speak.

To that which is eternal, without beginning, and without end, a verb of any tense may be applied. For though an unchangeable nature does not admit of was and shall be, but only is, yet it is allowable to say of It, was and is and shall be: was, because It never began; shall be, because It never shall end; is, because It always is.

But as many gifted saints have never had this power, the words, He will show you things to come, may be taken to mean, bring back to your minds the Joys of your heavenly country. He did however inform the Apostles of what was to come, viz. of the evils that they would have to suffer for Christ’s sake, and the good things they would receive in recompense.

By pouring love into the hearts of believers, and making them spiritual, and so able to see that the Son Whom they had known before only according to the flesh, and thought a man like themselves, was equal to the Father. Or certainly because that love filling them with boldness, and casting out fear, they proclaimed Christ to men, and so spread His fame throughout the whole world.

Sic igitur spiritum sanctum a filio accipere id quod suae naturae fuerat, cognoscendum est; et non aliam dantem et accipientem, sed unam significare substantiam. Siquidem et filius eadem a patre suscipere dicitur in quibus ipse subsistit: neque enim quid aliud est filius, exceptis his quae ei dantur a patre; neque alia est spiritus sancti substantia praeter id quod datur a filio.
          <td><b>DIDYMUS</b>. To receive must be taken here in a sense agreeable to the Divine Nature. As the Son in giving is not deprived of what He gives, nor imparts to others with any loss of His own, so too the Holy Ghost does not receive what before He had not; for if He received what before He had not, the gift being transferred to another, the giver would be thereby a loser. We must understand then that the Holy Ghost receives from the Son that which belonged to His nature, and that there are not two substances implied, one giving and the other receiving, but one substance only. In like manner the Son too is said to receive from the Father that wherein He Himself subsists. For neither is the Son any thing but what is given Him by the Father, nor the Holy Ghost any substance but that which is given Him by the Son.

But it is not true, as some heretics have thought, that because the Son receives from the Father, the Holy Ghost from the Son, as if by gradation, that therefore the Holy Ghost is inferior to the Son.

Procul hinc absint dialecticorum tendiculae; dicunt enim: ergo et pater est filius. Si autem dixisset: omnia quaecumque habet Deus, mea sunt, haberet occasionem impietas consurgendi; cum vero dixerit omnia quae habet mea sunt, patris nomine se filium declaravit, paternitatem qui filius erat non usurpavit; quamvis et ipse per adoptionis gratiam multorum sanctorum sit pater.
          <td><b>DIDYMUS</b>. As if He said, Although the Spirit of truth proceeds from the Father, yet all things that the Father has are Mine, and even the Spirit of the Father is Mine, and receives of Mine. But beware, when you hear this, that you think not it is a thing or possession which the Father and the Son have. That which the Father has according to His substance, i.e. His eternity, immutability, goodness, it is this which the Son has also. Away with the cavils of logicians who say, therefore the Father is the Son. Had He said indeed, All that God has are Mine, impiety might have taken occasion to raise its head; but when He said, All things that the Father has are Mine, by using the name of the Father, He declares Himself the Son, and being the Son, He usurps not the Paternity, though by the grace of adoption He is the Father of many saints.

Certainly, to receive from the Son must be thought one and the same thing with receiving from the Father; for when He says, All things that the Father has are Mine, therefore said I, that He shall receive of Mine, He shows herein that the things are received from Him, because all things which the Father has are His, but that they are received from the Father also. This unity has no diversity; nor does it matter from whom the thing is received; since that which is given by the Father is counted also as given by the Son.

Hoc autem facit, ut assuefaciat eos per tristium auditionem, bene ferre suam separationem: eam enim quae dolet animam, et a tristitia multa detinetur, nihil ita consuevit quietare, ut quae tristitiam pariunt verba revoluta continue.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord after having relieved the spirits of the disciples by the promise of the Holy Spirit, again depresses them: A little while, and you shall not see Me. He does this to accustom them to the mention of His departure, in order that they may bear it well, when it does come. For nothing so quiets the troubled mind, as the continued recurrence to the subject of its grief.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. He said, A little while, and you shall not see Me alluding to His going to be taken that night by the Jews, His crucifixion the next morning, and burial in the evening, which withdrew Him from all human sight.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Si vero quis diligenter scrutabitur, hoc consolationis est dicere quoniam ad patrem vado: hoc enim est ostendere quod non perierit, sed mors eius translatio sit; et aliam consolationem eis imposuit cum adiecit et iterum modicum, et videbitis me: ostendens quoniam et redibit, et in pauco erit separatio, et continua quae cum eis coexistentia.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But then, if one examines, these are words of consolation: Because I go to the Father. For they show that His death was only a translation; and more consolation follows: And again, a little while, and you shall see Me: an intimation this that He would return and, after a short separation, come and live with them for ever.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Haec autem verba domini obscura erant discipulis, antequam id quod dicit esset impletum; unde sequitur dixerunt ergo ex discipulis eius ad invicem: quid est hoc quod dicit nobis: modicum et non videbitis me, et iterum modicum et videbitis me quia vado ad patrem?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The meaning of these words however was obscure, before their fulfillment; Then said some of His disciples among themselves, What is this that He said to us, A little while, and you shall not see Me; and again, a little while, and you shall see Me; and, Because I go to the Father?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Hoc autem non intelligebant, aut propter tristitiam, quae amovebat a mente eorum ea quae dicebantur, aut propter immanifestationem eorum quae dicebantur: idcirco videbatur eis duo contraria ponere, non existentia contraria. Si enim videbimus te, aiunt, quomodo vadis? Si vero vadis, qualiter et videbimus? Propterea dicunt quid est hoc quod dicit nobis: modicum? Nescimus quid loquitur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Either sorrow had confused their minds, or the obscurity of the words themselves prevented their understanding them, and made them appear contradictory. If we shall see Thee, they say, how do You go? If you go, how shall we see you? What is this that He said to us, A little while? We cannot tell what He said.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Nam in praecedentibus, quia non dixerat modicum, sed dixerat ad patrem vado, aperte illis visus est loqui. Nunc ergo quod illis tunc obscurum fuit, et mox manifestatum est, iam nobis utique manifestum est. Post paululum enim passus est, et non viderunt eum; rursus post paululum resurrexit, et viderunt eum. Dicit autem et iam non videbitis me; quia scilicet mortalem Christum ulterius non viderunt.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For above, because He did not say, A little while, but simply, I go to the Father, He seemed to speak plainly. But what to them was obscure at the time, but by and by manifested, is manifest to us. For in a little while He suffered, and they did not see Him; and again, in a little while He rose again, and they saw Him. He says, And you shall see Me no more; for the mortal Christ they saw no more.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel aliter. Modicum tempus est futurum quo non videbitis me, idest illud triduum quo in sepulchro quievit; et iterum est modicum futurum tempus quo videbitis me, idest illi quadraginta dies, in quibus eis saepius post passionem suam usque ad tempus ascensionis suae apparuit; et ideo illo modico tempore videbitis me, quia vado ad patrem: quia non semper in terra corporaliter sum mansurus, sed per humanitatem quam assumpsi, ascensurus in caelum. Sequitur cognovit autem Iesus quia volebant eum interrogare, et dixit eis: de hoc quaeritis inter vos, quia dixi vobis: modicum et non videbitis me. Amen, amen, dico vobis, quia plorabitis et flebitis vos. Ignorantiam ipsorum pius magister intelligens, secundum illorum dubitationem respondit, quasi expositurus quid esset quod dixit.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or thus, It will be a little time during which you will not see Me, i.e. the three days that He rested in the grave; and again, it will be a little time during which you shall see Me, i.e. the forty days of His appearance amongst them, from His Passion to His ascension. And you shall see Me for that little time only, Because I go to the Father; for I am not going to stay always in the body here, but, by that humanity which I have assumed, to ascend to heaven. It follows: Now Jesus knew that they were desirous to ask Him, and said to them, Do you enquire among yourselves of that I said, A little while, and you shall not see Me; and again, a little while, and you shall see Me? Verily, verily, I say to you, That you shall weep and lament. Their merciful Master, understanding their ignorance and doubts, replied so as to explain what He had said.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod sic accipi potest, quia contristati sunt discipuli de morte domini, et confestim de resurrectione laetati. Mundus autem (quo nomine significati sunt inimici, a quibus Christus occisus est) tunc utique laetatus est occiso Christo, quando sunt discipuli contristati; unde sequitur mundus autem gaudebit, vos autem contristabimini; sed tristitia vestra vertetur in gaudium.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Which must be understood thus: viz. that the disciples sorrowed at their Lord’s death, and then immediately rejoiced at His resurrection. The world (i.e. the enemies of Christ, who put Him to death) rejoiced just when the disciples sorrowed, i.e. at His death: You shall weep and lament, but the world shall rejoice; and you shall be sorrowful, but your sorrow shall be turned into joy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Sed et cunctis fidelibus convenit hic sermo domini, qui per lacrymas pressurasque praesentes ad gaudia aeterna contendunt. Flentibus autem iustis, mundus gaudet, quia in praesenti delectantur, alterius vitae nulla gaudia sperantes.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. But this speech of our Lord’s is applicable to all believers who strive through present tears and afflictions to attain to the joys eternal. While the righteous weep, the world rejoices; for having no hope of the joys to come, all its delight is in the present.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Deinde ostendens quoniam tristitia parit gaudium, et quoniam tristitia brevis, laetitia vero infinita est, ad exemplum venit mundanum, dicens mulier cum parit, tristitiam habet, quia venit hora eius; cum autem pepererit puerum, iam non meminit pressurae propter gaudium, quia natus est homo in mundum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Then He shows that sorrow brings forth joy, short sorrow infinite joy, by an example from nature: A woman when she is in travail has sorrow, because her hour is come; but as soon as she is delivered of the child, she remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ista similitudo ad intelligendum non videtur esse difficilis; quoniam comparatio eius in promptu est, eodem ipso exponente cur dicta sit; nam sequitur et vos igitur nunc quidem tristitiam habetis. Iterum autem videbo vos, et gaudebit cor vestrum. Parturitio quippe tristitiae, partus autem gaudio comparatur; quod tunc magis esse consuevit quando non puella, sed puer nascitur. Quod vero subdit et gaudium vestrum nemo tollet a vobis, quia gaudium ipsorum ipse Iesus est, significat quod ait apostolus: Christus resurgens ex mortuis iam non moritur.
          <td><b>AUG</b> This comparison does not seem difficult to understand. It was one which lay near at hand, and He Himself immediately shows its application. And you now therefore have sorrow; but I will see you again, and your heart shall rejoice. The bringing forth is compared to sorrow, the birth to joy, which is especially true in the birth of a boy. And your joy no man takes from you: their joy is Christ. This agrees with what the Apostle said, Christ being risen from the dead dies no more (Romans 6:9).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Significat etiam praedicto exemplo quoniam solvit ipse mortis pressuras, et novum hominem regenerans esse fecit. Et non dixit quoniam non erit ei tribulatio, sed neque meminit eius: tantum est quod succedit gaudium; ita erit et sanctis. Et non dixit: quoniam natus est puer, sed: quoniam homo, occulte suam resurrectionem insinuans.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By this example He also intimates that He loosens the chains of death, and creates men anew. He does not say however that she should not have tribulation, but that she should not remember it; so great is the joy which follows. And so is it with the saints. He said not that a boy is born, but that a man, a tacit allusion to His own resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel de futuris visione et gaudio, quae superius dicta sunt, melius existimo intelligi modicum et iam non videbitis me: modicum enim est hoc totum spatium quo praesens pervolat saeculum; ideo namque addidit quia vado ad patrem: quod ad superiorem sententiam referendum est, ubi ait modicum et iam non videbitis me; non ad posteriorem ubi ait modicum et videbitis me. Eundo quippe ad patrem, facturus erat ut eum non viderent. Illis ergo ait modicum et iam non videbitis me, qui eum tunc corporaliter videbant: quia iturus erat ad patrem et eum deinceps mortales visuri non erant qualem cum ista loquebatur videbant. Quod vero addidit et iterum modicum et videbitis me, universae promisit Ecclesiae. Hoc autem modicum longum nobis videtur, quoniam adhuc agitur; cum finitum fuerit, tunc sentiemus quam modicum fuerit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. To this joy it is better to refer what was said above: A little while and you shall not see Me, and again, a little while and you shall see Me. For the whole space of time that this world continues is but a little while. Because I go to the Father, refers to the former clause, a little while and you shall not see Me, not to the latter, a little while and you shall see Me. His going to the Father was the reason why they would not see Him. So to them who then saw Him in the body He says, A little while and you shall not see Me; for He was about to go to the Father, and mortals would thenceforth never see Him again, as they saw Him now. The next words, A little while and you shall see Me, are a promise to the whole Church. For this little while appears long to us while it is passing, but when it is finished we shall then see how little a time it has been.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Mulier autem sancta Ecclesia est, propter fecunditatem bonorum operum, et quia spiritales Deo filios generat. Haec mulier dum parit, idest dum in mundo virtutum profectibus insistit, dum undique tentatur et affligitur, tristitiam habet de hoc, quia venit hora eius ut patiatur: quia nemo carnem suam odio habuit.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The woman is the holy Church, who is fruitful in good works, and brings forth spiritual children to God. This woman, while she brings forth, i.e. while she is making her progress in the world, amidst temptations and afflictions, has sorrow because her hour is come; for no one ever hated his own flesh.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Nec tamen in huius gaudii parturitione sine gaudio tristes sumus; sed, sicut apostolus ait: spe gaudentes; quia et ipsa mulier parturiens, cui comparati sumus, plus gaudet de mox futura prole quam tristis est de praesenti dolore.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nor yet in this bringing forth of joy, are we entirely without joy to lighten our sorrow, but, as the Apostle said, we rejoice in hope (Romans 12:12); for even the woman, to whom we are compared, rejoices more for her future offspring, than she sorrows for her present pain.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Sed cum peperit, idest cum devicto laborum certamine ad palmam pervenerit, iam non meminit pressurae praecedentis, propter gaudium perceptae retributionis, quia natus est homo in mundum. Sicut enim mulier nato in hoc mundo homine laetatur, ita Ecclesia, nato in vitam aeternam fidelium populo, exultatione repletur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. But as soon as she is delivered, i.e. when her laborious struggle is over, and she has got the palm, she remembers no more her former anguish, for joy at reaping such a reward, for joy that a man is born into the world. For as a woman rejoices when a man is born into the world, so the Church is filled with exultation when the faithful are born into life eternal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Nec novum debet videri si natus dicatur qui ex hac vita migraverit: sicut enim consuete nasci dicitur cum quis de utero matris procedens in hanc lucem ingreditur, ita potest natus appellari qui solutus a vinculis carnis, ad lucem aeternam sublimatur: unde sanctorum solemnia, non funebria, sed natalitia vocantur.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Nor should it appear strange, if one who departs from this life is said to be born. For as a man is said to be born when he comes out of his mother’s womb into the light of day, so may he be said to be born who from out of the prison of the body, is raised to the light eternal. Whence the festivals of the saints, which are the days on which they died, are called their birthdays.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Quod autem dicit iterum videbo vos, idest assumam vos ad meipsum. Vel iterum videbo vos; idest, iterum videndus apparebo; et gaudebit cor vestrum.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. I will see you again, i.e. I will take you to Myself. Or, I will see you again, i.e. I shall appear again and be seen by you; and your heart shall rejoice.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hunc enim totius laboris sui fructum Ecclesia nunc parturit desiderando, tunc est paritura cernendo. Et ideo masculum, quoniam ad istum fructum contemplationis, cuncta officia referuntur actionis; solus enim liber est qui propter se appetitur, et non refertur ad aliud: huic servit actio. Ad hoc enim refertur quidquid bene agitur: ibi est finis qui sufficit nobis: aeternus igitur erit. Neque enim finis nobis sufficit nisi cuius nullus est finis. De hoc igitur quod sufficit nobis rectissime audivimus gaudium vestrum nemo tollet a vobis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. This fruit indeed the Church now yearns for in travail, but then will enjoy in her delivery. And it is a male child, because all active duties are for the sake of devotion; for that only is free which is desired for its own sake, not for any thing else, and action is for this end. This is the end which satisfies and is eternal; for nothing can satisfy but what is itself the ultimate end. Wherefore of them it is well said, Your joy no man takes from you.

But that they might not start back from our Lord, as though they were no longer in need of Him, He adds, Because you have loved Me: as if to say, The Father loves you, because you have loved Me; when therefore you fall from My love, you will straightway fall from the Father’s love.

Amavit ipse quod fecit; sed non in nobis faceret quod amaret, nisi antequam id faceret, nos amaret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But does He love us because we love Him; or rather do not we love Him, because He loved us; This is what the Evangelist says, Let us love God, because God first loved us (1 Jn 4:19). The Father then loves us, because we love the Son, it being from the Father and the Son, that we receive the love from the Father and the Son. He loves what He has made; but He would not make in us what He loved, except He loved us in the first place.

Nativitas itaque eius, et adventus ostenditur, cum subdit exivi a patre et veni in mundum. Alterum in dispensatione, alterum in natura est. A patre enim venisse et a Deo exisse, non est significationis eiusdem; cum aliud sit a Deo in substantiam nativitatis exisse, aliud a patre in hunc mundum ad consummanda salutis nostrae sacramenta venisse. Cum autem exire a Deo sit ex nativitate subsistere, quid aliud quam Deus esse posset?
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Perfect faith in the Son, which believes and loves what has come forth from God, and deserves to be heard and loved for its own sake, this faith confessing the Son of God, born from Him, and sent by Him, needs not an intercessor with the Father; wherefore it follows, And have believed that I came forth from God. His nativity and advent are signified by, I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world. The one is dispensation, the other nature. To have come from the Father, and to have come forth from God, have not the same meaning; because it is one thing to have come forth from God in the relation of Sonship, another thing to have come from the Father into this world to accomplish the mystery of our salvation. Since to come forth from God is to subsist as His Son, what else can He be but God.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As it was consolatory to them to hear of His resurrection, and how He came from God, and went to God, He dwells again and again on these subjects: Again, I leave the world, and go to the Father.

Mundum reliquit corporali discessione, perrexit ad patrem hominis ascensione, nec mundum deseruit praesentiae gubernatione: quia sic in mundum venit exiens a patre ut non desereret patrem. Sed dominum Iesum Christum posteaquam resurrexit, et interrogatum legimus et rogatum: nam interrogatus est a discipulis ascensurus in caelum, quando regnum restitueret Israel; rogatus est a Stephano cum esset in caelo, ut spiritum eius susciperet. Et quis audeat dicere rogandum non esse immortalem, rogari debuisse mortalem? Puto ergo, quod dicit in illa die me non rogabitis quidquam, non ad illud tempus referendum esse quo resurrexit, sed ad illud quando videbimus eum sicuti est; quae visio non temporalis vitae est, sed aeternae, ubi iam nihil rogemus, nihil interrogemus, quia nihil desiderandum remanebit, nihil quaerendum latebit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He came forth from the Father, because He is of the Father; He came into the world, because He showed Himself in the body to the world. He left the world by His departure in the body, and went to the Father by the ascension of His humanity, nor yet in respect of the government of His presence, left the world; just as when He went forth from the Father and came into the world, He did so in such wise as not to leave the Father. But our Lord Jesus Christ, we read, was asked questions, and petitioned after His resurrection; for when about to ascend to Heaven He was asked by His disciples when He would restore the kingdom to Israel; when in Heaven He was asked by Stephen, to receive his spirit. And who would dare to say that as mortal He might be asked, as immortal He might not? I think then that when He says, In that day you shall ask Me nothing, He refers not to the time of His resurrection, but to that time when we shall see Him as He is: which vision is not of this present life, but of the life everlasting, when we shall ask for nothing, ask no questions, because there will remain nothing to be desired, nothing to be learnt.

Non autem petitur in nomine salvatoris quidquid petitur contra rationem salutis: non enim sonum litterarum aut syllabarum, sed quod sono recte ac veraciter intelligitur, hic accipiendum est, cum dicit in nomine meo. Unde qui hoc sentit de Christo quod non est de unico filio Dei sentiendum, non petit in eius nomine. Qui vero quod est de illo sentiendum sentit, ipse in eius nomine petit, et accipit quod petit, si non contra suam salutem sempiternam petit; accipit autem quando debet accipere: quaedam enim non negantur, sed ut congruo dentur tempore differuntur. Ita sane intelligendum est, quod ait dabit vobis, ut ea beneficia significata sciantur his verbis quae ad eos qui petunt proprie pertinent. Exaudiuntur quippe omnes sancti pro seipsis, non autem pro omnibus, quia non utcumque dictum est dabit; sed dabit vobis. Quod autem sequitur, usque modo non petistis quidquam in nomine meo, duobus modis intelligi potest: vel quia in nomine meo non petistis, quod nomen non sicut cognoscendum est cognovistis; vel non petistis quidquam, quoniam in comparatione rei quam petere debuistis, pro nihilo habendum est quod petistis. Ut igitur in nomine eius non nihil, sed gaudium plenum petant, subdit petite, et accipietis, ut gaudium vestrum sit plenum. Hoc quod dicit gaudium plenum, non carnale, sed spirituale gaudium est; et quando tantum erit ut aliquid ei iam non sit addendum, tunc erit plenum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The word whatsoever must not be understood to mean anything, but something which with reference to obtaining the life of blessedness is not nothing. That is not sought in the Savior’s name, which is sought to the hindering of our salvation; for by in My name must be understood not the mere sound of the letters or syllables, but that which is rightly and truly signified by that sound. He who holds any notion concerning Christ, which should not be held of the only Son of God, does not ask in His name. But he who thinks rightly of Him, asks in His name, and receives what he asks, if it be not against his eternal salvation; he receives when it is right he should receive; for some things are only denied at present in order to be granted at a more suitable time. Again, the words, He will give it you, only comprehend those benefits which properly appertain to the persons who ask. All saints are heard for themselves, but not for all; for it is not will give simply, but will give you; what follows, Hitherto have you asked nothing in My name, may be understood in two ways: either that they had not asked in His name, because they had not known it as it ought to be known; or, you have asked nothing, because with reference to obtaining the thing you ought to ask for, what you have asked for is to be counted nothing. That therefore they may ask in His name not for what is nothing, but for the fullness of joy, He adds, Ask and you shall receive, that your joy may be full. This full joy is not carnal, but spiritual joy; and it will be full, when it is so great that nothing can be added to it.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quidquid ergo petitur quod pertinet ad hoc gaudium consequendum, hoc est in nomine Christi petendum. Isto enim bono in petendo perseverantes sanctos suos nequaquam misericordia divina fraudabit.

Sequitur haec in proverbiis locutus sum vobis: venit hora cum iam non in proverbiis loquar vobis, sed palam de patre meo annuntiabo vobis. Possem dicere hanc de qua loquitur horam futurum saeculum intelligi, ubi videbimus palam quod apostolus dicit: facie ad faciem; ut quod ait haec in proverbiis locutus sum vobis, hoc sit quod ab apostolo dictum est: videmus nunc per speculum in aenigmate. Annuntiabo autem vobis quia per filium pater videbitur: neque enim patrem quis cognoscit nisi filius, et cui voluerit filius revelare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>, Whatsoever then is asked, which appertains to the getting this joy, this must be asked in the name of Christ. For His saints that persevere in asking for it, He will never in His divine mercy disappoint. But whatever is asked beside this is nothing, i.e. not absolutely nothing, but nothing in comparison with so great a thing as this. It follows: These things have I spoken to you in proverbs; but the time comes when I shall no more speak to you in proverbs, but I shall show you plainly of the Father. The hour of which He speaks may be understood of the future life, when we shall see Him, as the Apostle said, face to face, and, These things have I spoken to you in proverbs, of that which the Apostle said, Now we see as in a glass darkly (1 Cor 13:12). But I will show you that the Father shall be seen through the Son; For no man knows the Father save the Son, and he to whom the Son shall reveal Him (Matt 11:17).

          <td><b>GREG</b>. When He declares that He will show them plainly of the Father, He alludes to the manifestation about to take place of His own majesty which would troth show His own equality With the Father and the procession of the coeternal Spirit from both.

Petitio namque alicuius est indigentiae. Relinquitur itaque ut intelligatur Iesus discipulos suos de carnalibus vel animalibus spirituales esse facturus. Homo autem animalis sic audit quaecumque audit de Dei natura ut aliud quam corpus cogitare non possit. Ideo proverbia illi sunt quaecumque dicta sapientiae de incorporea immutabilique substantia; non quod tamquam proverbia deputet, sed quia sic cogitat quomodo qui proverbia solent audire, neque intelligere. Cum vero spiritalis coeperit omnia diiudicare, etiam si in hac vita velut per speculum et ex parte perspicit, tamen nullo corporis sensu, nulla imaginaria cogitatione, sed mentis certissima intelligentia, capit Deum non corpus esse, sed spiritum. Ita palam de patre annuntiante filio ut eiusdem substantiae conspiciatur et ipse qui annuntiat, nunc in eius nomine petunt qui petunt: quia in sono eius nominis non aliud quam res ipsa est quae hoc nomine vocatur, intelligunt. Hi possunt cogitare dominum nostrum Iesum Christum, inquantum homo est, pro nobis interpellare patrem; inquantum Deus est, nos exaudire cum patre: quod eum significasse arbitror, ubi ait et non dico vobis quia ego rogabo patrem pro vobis. Ad hoc quippe intuendum, quomodo non roget patrem filius, sed simul exaudiant rogantes pater et filius, non nisi spiritualis oculus mentis ascendit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But this sense seems to be interfered with by what follows: At that day you shall ask in My name. What shall we have to ask for in a future life, when all our desires shall be satisfied; Asking implies the want of something. It remains then that we understand the words of Jesus going to make His disciples spiritual, from being carnal and natural beings. The natural man so understands whatever he hears of God in a bodily sense, as being unable to conceive any other. Wherefore whatever Wisdom said of the incorporeal, immutable substance are proverbs to him, not that he accounts them proverbs but understands them as if they were proverbs. But when, become spiritual, he has begun to discern all things, though in this life he see but in a glass and in part, yet does he perceive, not by bodily sense, not by idea of the imagination, but by most sure intelligence of the mind, perceive and hold that God is not body, but spirit; the Son shows so plainly of the Father, that He who shows is seen to be of the same nature with Him who is shown. Then they who ask, ask in His name, because by the sound of that name they understand nothing but the thing itself which is expressed by that name. These are able to think that our Lord Jesus Christ, in so far as He is man, intercedes with the Father for us’ in so far as He is God, hears us together with the Father: which I think is His meaning when He says, And I say not to you that I will pray the Father for you. To understand this, viz. how that the Son does not ask the Father, but Father and Son together hear those who ask, is beyond the reach of any but the spiritual vision.

Quod utrumque legimus factum: et interrogasse scilicet dominum, et interrogatum fuisse. Sed hoc cito solvitur: quia hoc non ei, sed illis potius opus erat quos interrogabat, vel a quibus interrogabatur.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Why this remark? To one Who knew all things, instead of saying, you need not that any man should ask You; it would have been more appropriate to have said, you need not to ask any man; yet we know that both of these were done, viz. that our Lord both asked questions, and was asked. But this is soon explained; for both were for the benefit, not of Himself, but of those whom He asked questions of, or by whom He was asked. He asked questions of men not in order to learn Himself, but to teach them: and in the case of those who asked questions of Him, such questions were necessary to them in order to gain the knowledge they wanted; but they were not necessary to Him to tell Him what that was, because He knew the wish of the inquirer, before the question was put. Thus to know men’s thoughts beforehand was no great thing for the Lord, but to the minds of babes it was a great thing: By this we know that you came forth from God.

Inenarrabilem vero illam filii nativitatem per virtutem dicti istius intelligentes, tunc primum coeperunt advertere, cum illum sine proverbiis profiterentur esse locutum. Non enim per consuetudinem humani partus Deus ex Deo nascitur, cuius a Deo exitio potius quam partus est. Est enim unus ex uno: non est portio, non est defectio, non est diminutio, non derivatio; non est protensio, non passio, sed viventis naturae ex vivente nativitas est. Deus ex Deo exiens est, non creatura in Dei nomine electa, non ut esset coepit ex nihilo; sed exiit a manente, et exiisse significationem habet nativitatis, non inchoationis.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. They believe that He came forth from God, because He does the works of God. For whereas our Lord had said both, I came forth from the Father, and, I am come into the world from the Father, they testified no wonder at the latter words, I am come into the world, which they had often heard before. But their reply shows a belief in and appreciation of the former, I came forth from the Father. And they notice this in their reply: By this we believe that you came forth from God; not adding, and are come into the world, for they knew already that He was sent from God, but had not yet received the doctrine of His eternal generation. That unutterable doctrine they now began to see for the first time in consequence of these words, and therefore reply that He spoke no longer in parables. For God is not born from God after the manner of human birth; His is a coming forth from, rather than a birth from, God. He is one from one; not a portion, not a defection, not a diminution, not a derivation, not a pretension, not a passion, but the birth of living nature from living nature. He is God coming forth from God, not a creature appointed to the name of God; He did not begin to be from nothing, but He came forth from an abiding nature. To come forth has the signification of birth, not of beginning.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The tribulation of which He speaks was to commence thus, i.e. in every one being scattered to his home, but was not to continue so. For in saying, And leave Me alone, He does not mean this to apply to them in their sufferings after His ascension. They were not to desert Him then, but to abide and have peace in Him.

He declares this to be the object of His whole discourse, viz. that in Him they might have peace. And this peace shall have no end, but is itself the end of every pious action and intention.

Hoc autem quod ait pater, venit hora, ostendit omne tempus, et quid et quando faceret, vel fieri sineret, ab illo dispositum qui tempori subditus non est. Non autem credatur haec hora fato urgente venisse, sed Deo potius ordinante: absit enim ut sidera mori cogerent siderum conditorem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord, in the form of a servant, could have prayed in silence had He pleased; but He remembered that He had not only to pray, but to teach. For not only His discourse, but His prayer also, was for His disciples’ edification, yes and for ours who read the same. Father, the hour is come, shows that all time, and every thing that He did or suffered to be done, was at His disposing, Who is not subject to time. Not that we must suppose that this hour came by any fatal necessity, but rather by God’s ordering. Away with the notion, that the stars could doom to death the Creator of the stars.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Non diem autem, non tempus, sed horam venisse dicit. In hora diei portio est: et quae erat haec hora? Iam nunc conspuendus, flagellandus, crucifigendus erat: sed clarificat pater filium. Sol de cursu operis defecit, et interitum suum cum eo reliqua mundi elementa senserunt; ad onus domini in cruce pendentis terra tremuit, et eum qui moriturus erat se contestata est non capere. Proclamat centurio: vere filius Dei erat iste; praedictioni consentit effectus. Dominus dixerat clarifica filium tuum. Non solum nomine contestatus est esse se filium, sed et proprietate qua dicitur tuum: multi enim nos filii Dei, sed non talis hic filius: hic enim proprius et verus est filius origine, non adoptione; veritate, non nuncupatione; nativitate, non creatione. Ergo post clarificationem eius, veritatem confessio secuta est: nam verum Dei filium centurio confitetur, ne quis credentium ambigeret quod aliquis persequentium non negasset.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. He does not say that the day, or the time, but that the hour is come. An hour contains a portion of a day. What was this hour? He was now to be spit upon, scourged, crucified. But the Father glorifies the Son. The sun failed in his course, and with him all the other elements felt that death. The earth trembled under the weight of our Lord hanging on the Cross, and testified that it had not power to hold within it Him who was dying. The Centurion proclaimed, Truly this was the Son of God. The event answered the prediction. Our Lord had said, Glorify Your Son, testifying that He was not the Son in name only, but properly the Son. Your Son, He said. Many of us are sons of God; but not such is the Son. For He is the proper, true Son by nature, not by adoption, in truth, not in name, by birth, not by creation. Therefore after His glorifying, to the manifestation of the truth there succeeded confession. The Centurion confesses Him to be the true Son of God, that so none of His believers might doubt what one of His persecutors could not deny.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed si passione clarificatus dicitur, quanto magis resurrectione? Nam in passione magis eius humilitas quam claritas commendatur. Quod ergo ait: pater, venit hora, clarifica filium tuum, sic intelligendum est tamquam dixerit: venit hora seminandae humilitatis: fructum non differas claritatis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if He was glorified by His Passion, how much more by His Resurrection? For His Passion rather showed His humility than His glory. So we must understand, Father, the hour is come, glorify Your Son, to mean, the hour is come for sowing the seed, humility; defer not the fruit, glory.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Sed forte infirmus reperietur filius dum clarificationem potioris expectat. Et quis non patrem potiorem confitebitur, cum ipse dicat: pater maior me est? Sed cavendum est ne apud imperitos gloriam filii honor patris infirmet; nam sequitur ut filius tuus clarificet te. Non ergo infirmus est filius, vicem clarificationis ipse, cum clarificandus sit, redditurus. Ergo expostulatio clarificationis dandae vicissimque reddendae, eamdem in utroque ostendit divinitatis virtutem.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. But perhaps this proves weakness in the Son; His waiting to be glorified by one superior to Himself. And who does not confess that the Father is superior, seeing that He Himself said, The Father is greater than I? But beware lest the honor of the Father impair the glory of the Son. It follows: That Your Son also may glorify You. So then the Son is not weak, inasmuch as He gives back in His turn glory for the glory which He receives. This petition for glory to be given and repaid, shows the same divinity to be in both.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Merito autem quaeritur quomodo patrem clarificaverit filius, cum sempiterna claritas patris nec diminuta fuerit in forma humana, nec augeri potuerit in sua perfectione divina. Sed apud homines minor erat, quando in Iudaea tantummodo Deus notus erat; quia vero per Evangelium Christi factum est ut pater innotesceret gentibus, patrem clarificavit et filius. Dicit ergo clarifica filium tuum, ut filius tuus clarificet te; ac si dicat: resuscita me, ut innotescas toti orbi per me. Deinde magis pandens quomodo clarificet patrem filius, subiungit sicut dedisti ei potestatem omnis carnis, ut omne quod dedisti ei, det eis vitam aeternam. Omnem carnem dixit omnem hominem, a parte totum significans. Hoc autem quod potestas Christo a patre data est omnis carnis, secundum hominem intelligendum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But it is justly asked, how the Son can glorify the Father, when the eternal glory of the Father never experienced abasement in the form of man, and in respect of its own Divine perfection, does not admit of being added to. But among men this glory was less when God was only known in Judea; and therefore the Son glorified the Father, when the Gospel of Christ spread the knowledge of the Father among the Gentiles. Glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You; i.e. Raise Me from the dead, that by Me You may be known to the whole world. Then He unfolds further the manner in which the Son glorifies the Father; As You have given Him power over all flesh, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him. All flesh signifies all mankind, the part being put for the whole. And this power which is given to Christ by the Father over all flesh, must be understood with reference to His human nature.

          <td>
            <b>HILARY</b>. For being made flesh Himself, He was about to restore eternal life to frail, corporeal, and mortal man.
            <p><b>HILARY</b>. If Christ be God, not begotten, but unbegotten, then let this receiving be thought weakness. But not if His receiving of power signifies His begetting, in which He received what He is. This gift cannot be counted for weakness. For the Father is such in that He gives the Son remains God in that He has received the power of giving eternal life.

Sed quid est quod dicit omnis carnis? Non enim utique omnes crediderunt. Et quidem quantum ex eo est, omnes crediderunt; si vero non attendebant his quae dicebantur, non eius qui dicebat, est criminatio, sed eorum qui non susceperunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He said, You have given Him power over all flesh, to show that His preaching extended not to the Jews only, but to the whole world. But what is all flesh? For all did not believe? So far as lay with Him, all did. If they did not attend to His words, it was not His fault who spoke, but theirs who did not receive.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He said, As You have given Him power over all flesh, so the Son may glorify You, i.e. make You known to all flesh which You have given Him; for You have so given it to Him, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. And in what eternal life is, He then shows: And this is life eternal, that they might know You, the only true God. To know the only true God is life, but this alone does not constitute life. What else then is added? And Jesus Christ whom You have sent.

            <b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Dum autem Ariani intelligunt solum patrem verum Deum, solum iustum, solum sapientem, a communione horum, secundum hos, filius separatur. Soli enim, ut aiunt, propria non participantur ab altero; quae si in patre solo, et non in filio existimabuntur, necesse est ut filius Deus falsus et insipiens esse credatur.
            <p>Nulli autem dubium est veritatem ex natura et ex virtute naturae esse: verum enim triticum est quod spica structum, et aristis vallatum, et folliculis excussum, et in far comminutum, et in panem coctum, et in cibum sumptum reddit ex se et naturam panis et munus. Quaero ergo in quo filio veritas Dei desit, cui non desit Dei nec natura nec virtus. Naturae enim suae virtute usus est, ut essent quae non erant, et fierent quae placerent.
            <p>An forte quod ait te solum, communionem atque unitatem suam a Deo separat? Separat sane, si non ad id quod ait te solum verum Deum, continue subiecit et quem misisti Iesum Christum. Per id enim Ecclesiae fides Christum verum Deum confessa est, quod solum verum Deum confessa patrem sit: non enim unigenito Deo naturae demutationem naturalis nativitas intulit.
          <td>
            <b>HILARY</b>. The Arians hold, that as the Father is the only true, only just, only wise God, the Son has no communion of these attributes; for that which is proper to one, cannot be partaken of by another. And as these are as they think in the Father alone, and not in the Son, they necessarily consider the Son a false and vain God.
            <p><b>HILARY</b>. But it must be clear to every one that the reality of any thing is evidenced by its power. For that is true wheat, which when rising with grain and fenced with ears, and shaken out by the winnowing machine, and ground into corn, and baked into bread, and taken for food, fulfills the nature and function of bread. I ask then wherein the truth of Divinity is wanting to the Son, Who has the nature and virtue of Divinity. For He so made use of the virtue of His nature, as to cause to be things which were not, and to do every thing which seemed good to Him.
            <p><b>HILARY</b>. Because He says, You the only, does He separate Himself from communion and unity with God? He does separate Himself, but that He adds immediately, And Jesus Christ Whom You have sent. For the Catholic faith confesses Christ to be true God, in that it confesses the Father to be the only true God; for natural birth did not introduce any change of nature into the Only-Begotten God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Videndum est ergo an intelligere cogamur, cum dictum est patri ut cognoscant te solum verum Deum, tamquam hoc insinuare voluerit, quia et solus pater Deus verus est, ne non nisi ipsa tria simul, patrem et filium et spiritum sanctum, intelligeremus esse Deum. Nunc ergo ex domini testimonio et patrem solum verum Deum dicimus, et filium solum Deum verum, et spiritum sanctum solum verum Deum; et simul patrem et filium et spiritum, idest simul ipsam Trinitatem, non tres veros deos, sed unum verum Deum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Dismissing then the Arians, let us see if we are forced to confess, that by the words, That they may know You to be the only true God, He means us to understand that the Father only is the true God, in such sense as that only the Three together, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, are to be called God? Does our Lord’s testimony authorize us to say that the Father is the only true God, the Son the only true God, and the Holy Ghost the only true God, and at the same time, that the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost together, i.e. the Trinity, are not three Gods, but one true God?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel ordo verborum est: ut te, et quem misisti Iesum Christum, cognoscant solum verum Deum; consequenter enim et spiritus sanctus intelligitur, quia spiritus est patris et filii, tamquam caritas consubstantialis amborum. Sic igitur filius glorificat te, ut omnibus quos dedisti ei, te cognitum faciat. Porro si cognitio mei est vita aeterna, tanto magis in vita aeterna, quanto magis in hac cognitione proficimus. Non autem moriemur in vita aeterna. Tunc ergo Dei cognitio perfecta erit quando nulla mors erit: summa tunc Dei clarificatio, quia summa gloria. A veteribus autem gloria definita est frequens de aliquo fama cum laude. At si homo laudatur cum famae creditur, quomodo Deus laudabitur quando ipse videbitur? Propter quod scriptum est: beati qui habitant in domo tua, in saecula saeculorum laudabunt te. Ibi erit Dei sine fine laudatio, ubi erit Dei plena cognitio, et ideo clarificatio.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or is not the order of the words, That they may know You and Jesus Christ, Whom You have sent, to be the only true God? the Holy Spirit being necessarily understood, because the Spirit is only the love of the Father and the Son, consubstantial with both. If then the Son so glorifies You as You have given Him power over all flesh, and You have given Him the power, that He should give eternal life to as many as You have given Him, and, This is life eternal, to know You, it follows that He glorifies You by making You known to all whom You have given Him. Moreover, if the knowledge of God is life eternal, the more advance we make in this knowledge, the more we make in life eternal. But in life eternal we shall never die. Where then there is no death, there will then be perfect knowledge of God; there will God be most glorified, because His glory will be greatest. Glory was defined among the ancients to be fame accompanied with praise. But if man is praised in dependence on what is said of him, how will God be praised when He shall be seen? as in the Psalm, Blessed are they who dwell in Your house: they will be always praising You. There will be praise of God without end, where will be full knowledge of God. There then shall be heard the everlasting praise of God, for there will there be full knowledge of God, and therefore full glorifying of Him.

Ergo intelligendum est utroque verbo superius usum eo ordine quo futurum erat; modo vero usum fuisse verbo praeteriti temporis de re futura, velut si dixisset: ego te clarificabo super terram, opus consummando quod dedisti mihi ut faciam, et nunc clarifica me tu, pater: quae est omnino eadem sententia, nisi quod hic additur clarificationis modus, cum subdit claritate quam habui, priusquam mundus fieret, apud te. Ordo verborum est: quam habui apud te, priusquam mundus esset. Hoc quidam sic intelligendum putaverunt tamquam natura humana quae suscepta est a verbo, converteretur in verbum, et homo mutaretur in Deum; immo, si diligentius cogitemus, homo periret in Deo. Non enim quisquam ex ista mutatione hominis, vel duplicari Dei verbum dicturus est, vel augeri; sed quisquis Dei filium praedestinatum negat, hunc eumdem filium hominis negat. Cum ergo videret illius praedestinatae suae glorificationis venisse tempus, ut et nunc fieret in redditione quod fuerat in praedestinatione iam factum, oravit dicens et nunc clarifica me tu, pater, etc.: idest, illam claritatem quam habui apud te praedestinatione tua, tempus est ut apud te habeam etiam vivens in dextera tua.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He had said above, Father, the hour is come: glorify Your Son, that Your Son also may glorify You: the order of which words shows that the Son was first to be glorified by the Father, that the Father might be glorified by the Son. But now He says, I have glorified You; and now glorify Me, as if He had first glorified the Father, and then asked to be glorified by Him. We must understand that the first is the order in which one was to succeed the other, but that He afterwards uses a past tense, to express a thing future; the meaning being, I will glorify You on the earth, by finishing the work you have given Me to do: and now, Father, glorify Me, which is quite the same sentence with the first one, except that He adds here the mode in which He is to be glorified; with the glory which I had before the world was, with You. The order of the words is, The glory which I had with you before the world was. This has been taken by some to mean, that the human nature which was assumed by the Word, would be changed into the Word, that man would be changed into God, or, to speak more correctly, be lost in God. For no one would say that the Word of God would by that change be doubled, or even made at all greater. But we avoid this error, if we take the glory which He had with the Father before the world was, to be the glory which He predestined for Him on earth: (for if we believe Him to be the Son of man, we need not be afraid to say that He was predestined.) This predestined time of His being glorified, He now saw was arrived, that He might now receive what had been aforetime predestined, He prayed accordingly: And now, Father, glorify Me, &amp;c. i.e. that glory which I had with you by your predestination, it is now time that I should have at your right hand.

Si autem quod ait manifestavi nomen tuum hominibus quos dedisti mihi de mundo, omnes intelligi voluit qui in eum fuerant credituri, est plane ista clarificatio qua filius clarificat patrem: et tale est quod ait manifestavi nomen tuum, quale illud quod supra dixerat: ego te clarificavi, pro tempore futuro et illic et hic praeteritum ponens. Sed de his qui iam erant discipuli, non de omnibus qui in illum fuerant credituri, eum hoc dixisse, ea quae sequuntur credibilius demonstrant.

Iam nunc quid de illis a quibus tunc audiebatur discipulis suis dicat, audiamus: manifestavi nomen tuum hominibus quos dedisti mihi de mundo. Non ergo Dei nomen noverant, cum essent Iudaei; et ubi est quod legitur: notus in Iudaea Deus, et in Israel magnum nomen eius? Ergo intelligendum est: manifestavi nomen tuum hominibus istis, quos dedisti mihi de mundo, qui me audiunt haec dicentem, non illud nomen tuum quod vocaris Deus, sed illud quod vocaris pater meus; quod nomen manifestari sine ipsius filii manifestatione non possit: nam quod Deus dicitur universae creaturae, etiam omnibus gentibus antequam in Christum crederent non omnimode esse potuit hoc nomen incognitum. In hoc ergo quod fecit hunc mundum, et antequam imbuerentur in fide Christi, notus in omnibus gentibus Deus; in hoc autem quod non est cum diis falsis colendus, notus in Iudaea Deus; in hoc vero quod pater est huius Christi, per quem tollit peccatum mundi, hoc nomen eius prius occultum, nunc manifestavit eis quos dedit ei pater ipse de mundo.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. If He speaks of the disciples only with whom He supped, this has nothing to do with that glorifying of which He spoke above, wherewith the Son glorified the Father; for what glory is it to be known to twelve or eleven men? But if by the men which were given to Him out of the world, He means all those who should believe in Him afterwards, this is without doubt the glory wherewith the Son glorifies the Father; and, I have manifested your name, is the same as what He said before, I have glorified You; the past being put for the future both there and here. But what follows shows that He is speaking here of those who were already His disciples, not of all who should afterwards believe on Him. At the beginning of His prayer then our Lord is speaking of all believers, all to whom He should make known the Father, thereby glorifying Him: for after saying, that your Son also may glorify You, in strewing how that was to be done, He says, As You have given Him power over all flesh. Now let us hear what He says to the disciples: I have manifested your name to the men which You gave Me out of the world. Had they not known the name of God then, when they were Jews? We read in the Psalms, In Jewry is God known; His name is great in Israel. I have manifested your name, then must be understood not of the name of God, but of the Father’s name, which name could not be manifested without the manifestation of the Son. For God’s name, as the God of the whole creation, could not have been entirely unknown to any nation. As the Maker then of the world, He was known among all nations even before the spread of the Gospel. In Jewry He was known as a God, Who was not to be worshipped with the false gods: but as the Father of that Christ, by whom He took away the sins of the world, His name was unknown; which name Christ now manifests to those whom the Father had given Him out of the world. But how did He manifest it, when the hour had not come of which He said above, The hour comes, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs. We must understand the past to be put for the future.

But the Son of God had that sometimes, which He had not as Son of man; for He had the universe with His Father, while He was still in His mother’s womb. Wherefore by saying, They were Yours, the Son of God does not separate Himself from the Father; but only attributes all His power to Him, from whom he is, and has the same. And you gave them Me, then, means that He had received as man the power to have them; nay, that He Himself had given them to Himself, i.e. Christ as God with the Father, to Christ as man not with the Father.

What they believed surely, was what they knew surely; for I came out from You, is the same with, You did send Me. They believed surely, i. e not as He said above they believed, but surely, i.e. as they were about to believe firmly, steadily, unwaveringly: never any more to be scattered to their own, and leave Christ The disciples as yet et were not such as He describes them to be in the past tense, meaning such as they were to be when the, had received the Holy Ghost. The question how the Father gave those words to the Son, is easier to solve, if we suppose Him to have received them from the Father as Son of man. But if we understand it to be as the Begotten of the Father, let there be no time supposed previous to His having them, as if He once existed without them: for whatever God the Father gave God the Son, He gave in begetting.

Who He says above in speaking of the Holy Spirit, All things that the Father has are Mine, He means all things which pertain to the divinity of the [Father; for He adds, He (the Holy Ghost) shall receive of Mine; and the Holy Ghost would not receive from a creature which was subject to the Father and the Son.

            <p>Non ait: ut simus unum ipsi et nos, sicut et nos unum sumus: ipsi utique in natura sua unum sunt, sicut nos in nostra unum sumus: quia enim una eademque persona est Deus et homo, intelligimus hominem in eo quod rogat, et Deum in eo quod unum sunt et ille et ipse quem rogat. Poterat quidem dicere per id quod Ecclesiae caput est, et corpus eius Ecclesia: ego et ipsi, non unum sed unus sumus, quia caput et corpus unus est Christus; sed divinitatem suam consubstantialem patri ostendens, vult esse suos unum, sed in Christo; non tantum per eamdem naturam qua omnes ex hominibus mortalibus aequales Angelis fiunt, sed etiam per eamdem in eamdem habitudinem conspirantem concordissimam voluntatem, in unum spiritum quodammodo caritatis igne conflati. Ad hoc enim valet quod ait ut sint unum, sicut et nos unum sumus: ut quemadmodum pater et filius non tantum aequalitate substantiae, sed etiam voluntate unum sunt, ita et hi inter quos et Deum mediator est filius, non tantum per hoc quod eiusdem naturae sunt, sed etiam per eamdem dilectionis societatem unum sint.

            <b>AUG</b>. At the time at which He was speaking, both were still in the world. Yet we must not understand, I am no more in the world, metaphorically of the heart and life; for could there ever have been a time when hen He loved the things of the world? It remains then that He means that He was not in the world, as He had been before; i.e. that He was soon going away. Do we not say every day, when any one is going to leave us, or going to die, such an one is gone? This is shown to be the sense by what follows; for He adds, And now I come to You. And then He commends to His Father those whom He was about to leave: Holy Father, keep through Your own name those whom you have given Me. As man He prays God for His disciples, whom He received from God. But mark what follows: That they may be one, as We are: He does not say, That they may be one with us, We are one: but, that they may be one: that they may b one in their nature, as We are one in Ours. For, in that He was God and man in one person as man He prayed, as God He was one with Him to Whom He prayed.
            <p><b>AUG</b>. He does not say, That I and they maybe one, though He might have said so in the sense, that He was the head of the Church, and the Church His body; not one thing, but one person: the head and the body being one Christ. But strewing something else, viz. that His divinity is consubstantial With the Father, He prays that His people may in like manner be one; but one in Christ, not only by the same nature, in which mortal man is made equal to the Angels, but also by tile same will, agreeing most entirely in the same mind, and melted into one Spirit by the fire of love. This is the meaning of, That they may be one as We are: viz. that as the Father and the Son are one not only by equality of substance, but also in will, so they, between whom and God the Son is Mediator, may be one not only by the union of nature, but by the union of love.

Intelligamus ergo cum ita dominus loquitur, personas eum distinguere, non separare naturam. Quando ergo servabat discipulos suos filius praesentia corporali, non expectabat pater ad custodiendum succedere filio discedenti; sed eos ambo servabant potentia spiritali; et quando ab eis abstulit filius praesentiam corporalem, tenuit cum patre custodiam spiritalem; quia et custodiendos quando filius homo accepit, custodiae paternae non abstulit; et cum pater filio custodiendos dedit, non dedit sine ipso cui dedit; sed dedit homini filio, non sine Deo eodem ipso filio; sequitur enim quos dedisti mihi, ego custodivi, et nemo ex ipsis periit, nisi filius perditionis, idest traditor Christi, perditioni praedestinatus, ut Scriptura impleatur, qua scilicet de illo, maxime in Psalmo 108, prophetatur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Son as man kept His disciples in the Father’s name, being placed among them in human form: the Father again kept them in the Son’s name, in that He heard those who asked in the Son’s name. But we must not take this carnally, as if the Father and Son kept us in turns, for the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost guard us at the same time: but Scripture do does not raise us, except it stoop to us. Let us understand then that when our Lord says this, He is distinguishing the persons, not dividing, the nature, so that when the Son was keeping His disciples by His bodily presence, the Father was waiting to succeed Him on His departure; but both kept them by spiritual power, and when the Son withdrew His bodily presence, he still held with the Father the spiritual keeping. For when the Son as man received them into His keeping, He did not take them from n the Father’s keeping, and when the Father gave them into the Son’s keeping, it was to the Son as man, who at the, same time was God. Those that you gave Me I have kept, and none of them is lost but the Son of perdition: i.e. the betrayer of Christ, predestined to perdition; that the Scripture might be fulfilled, especially the prophecy, in Psalm 108.

And to make it more clear that this was His meaning, He adds, That they also might be sanctified through the truth, i.e. in Me; inasmuch as the Word is truth, in which the Son of man was sanctified from the time that the Word was as made flesh. For then He sanctified Himself in Himself, i.e. Himself as man, in Himself as the Word: the Word and man being one Christ. But of His members it is that He said, And for their sakes I sanctify Myself, i.e. them in Me, since in Me both they and I are.

I do not mention old Simon, or Anna the prophetess, Zacharias, Elisabeth, or John the Baptist; for it might be answered that it was not necessary to pray for dead persons, such as these who departed with such rich merits. With respect to the former then we must understand that they did not yet believe in Him, as He wished, but that after His resurrection, when the Apostles were taught and strengthened by the Holy Spirit, they attained to a right faith. The case of Paul however still remains, An Apostle not of men, or by men; and that of the robber, who believed when even the teachers themselves of the faith fell away. We must understand then, their word, to mean the word of faith itself which they preached to the world; it being called their word, because it was preached in the first instance and principally by them; for it was being preached by them, when Paul received it by revelation from Jesus Christ Himself. And in this sense the robber too believed their word. Wherefore in this prayer the Redeemer prays for all whom He redeemed, both present and to come. And then follows the thing itself which He prays for, That they all may be one. He asks that for all, which he asked above for the disciples; that all both we and they may be one.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. And this unity is recommended by the great example of unity: As you, Father, are in Me, and I in you, that they also may be one in Us, i.e. that as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father, so after the likeness of this unity, all may be one in the Father and in the Son.

Ita est enim pater in filio ut unum sint, quia unius substantiae sunt; nos vero esse quidem possumus in eis unum; unum tamen cum eis esse non possumus, quia unius substantiae nos et ipsi non sumus. Sic autem sunt in nobis, vel nos in illis, ut illi unum sint in natura sua, nos unum in nostra. Sunt quippe et ipsi in nobis sicut Deus in templo; sumus autem nos in illis, sicut creatura in creatore suo. Ideo ergo addidit in nobis, ut quod unum efficimur fidelissima caritate, gratiae Dei tribuendum esset, non nobis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We must particularly observe here, that our Lord did not say, that we may be all one, but that they may be all one, as you, Father, in Me, and I in You, are one, understood. For the Father is so in the Son, that They are one, because They are of one substance; but we can be one in Them, but not with Them; because we and They are not of one substance. They are in us, and we in Them, so as that They are one in Their nature, we one in ours. They are in us, as God is in the temple; we in Them, as the creature is in its Creator. Wherefore He adds, in Us, to show, that our being made one by charity, is to be attributed to the grace of God, not to ourselves.

Sed licet ipsum intelligentiae suae sensum impietas demutet, non tamen potest intelligentia non extare dictorum: si enim regenerati in unius vitae atque aeternitatis natura sunt, cessat in his solus unitatis assensus qui unum sunt in eiusdem regeneratione naturae; soli autem patri et filio ex natura proprium est ut unum sint, quia Deus ex Deo unigenitus, non potest nisi in originis suae esse natura.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Heretics endeavoring to get over the words, I and My Father are one, as a proving unity of nature, and to reduce them to mean a unity simply of natural love, and agreement of will, bring forwards these words of our Lord’s as an example of this kind of unity: That they may be all one, as You, Father, is in Me, and I in You. But though impiety can cheat its own understanding, it cannot alter the meaning of the words themselves. For they who are born again of a nature that gives unity in life eternal, they cease to be one in will merely, acquiring the same nature by their regeneration: but the Father and Son alone are properly one, because God, only-begotten of God, can only exist in that nature from which He is derived.

Nonne ista est pax illa perpetua, potius fidei merces quam fides? Sed etsi in hac vita propter ipsam communem fidem omnes qui unum credimus, unum sumus; etiam sic non ut credamus, sed quia credimus, unum sumus. Quid est ergo omnes unum sint ut mundus credat? Ipsi quippe omnis mundus est credens, cum de his dicat de quibus dixerat: non pro his rogo tantum, sed pro his qui credituri sunt per verba eorum in me. Quomodo ergo intellecturi sumus? Nisi quia non in eo causam posuit ut credat mundus, quia illi unum sunt: sed orando dixit ut mundus credat, sicut orando dixerat ut unum sint. Denique si verbum quod ait rogo, ubique ponamus, erit huius expositio sententiae manifestior. Rogo ut omnes unum sint; rogo ut et ipsi in nobis unum sint; rogo ut mundus credat quia tu me misisti.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But why does He say, That the world may believe that you have sent Me? Will the world believe when we shall all be one in the Father and the Son? Is not this unity that peace eternal, which is the reward of faith, rather than faith itself? For though in this life all of us who hold in the same common faith are one, yet even this unity is not a means to belief, but the consequence of it. What means then, That all may be one, that the world may believe? He prays for the world when He says, Neither pray I for these alone, but for all those who shall believe on Me through their word. Whereby it appears that He does not make this unity the cause of the world believing, but prays that the world may believe, as He prays that they all may be one. The meaning will be clearer if we always put in the word ask; I ask that they all may be one; I ask. that they may be one in Us; I ask that the world may believe that you have sent Me.

For there is no scandal so great as division, whereas unity amongst believers is a great argument for believing; as He said at the beginning of His discourse, By this shall all men know that you are My disciples, if you have love one to another.

Quam claritatem, nisi immortalitatem, quam natura humana in illo fuerat acceptura? Propter immutabilitatem enim praedestinationis praeteriti temporis verbis futura significat. Immortalitatis autem claritatem, quam sibi a patre datam dicit, etiam se sibi dedisse intelligendum est. Cum enim tacet filius in opere patris operationem suam, humilitatem commendat; cum vero in opere suo tacet operationem patris, parilitatem commendat. Isto igitur modo et hoc loco, nec se facit alienum a patris opere, quamvis dixerat claritatem quam dedisti mihi; nec patrem fecit alienum ab opere suo, quamvis dixerat dedi eis. Sicut autem ex eo quod patrem pro suis omnibus rogavit, hoc fieri voluit ut omnes unum sint; ita etiam suo beneficio id fieri voluit; unde adiunxit ut unum sint in nobis, sicut et nos unum sumus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Then our Savior, Who, by praying to the Father, showed Himself to be man, now shows that, being God with the Father, He does what He prays for: And the glory which you gave Me, I have given them. What glory, but immortality, which human nature was about to receive in Him? For that which was to be by unchangeable predestination, though future, He expresses by the past tense. That glory of immortality, which He says was given Him by the Father, we must understand He gave Himself also. For when the Son is silent of His own cooperation in the Father’s work, He shows His humility: when He is silent of the Father’s cooperation in His work, He shows His equality. In this way here He neither disconnects Himself with the Father’s work, when He says, The glory which you gave Me, nor the Father with His work, when He says, I have given them. But as He was pleased by prayer to the Father to obtain that all might be one, so now He is pleased to effect the same by His own gift; for He continues, That all may be one, even as We are one.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. By glory, He means miracles, and doctrines and unity; which latter is the greater glory. For all who believed through the Apostles see one. If any separated, it was owing to men’s own carelessness; not but that our Lord anticipates this happening.

          <td><b>HILARY</b>. By this giving and receiving of honor, then, all are one. But I do not yet apprehend in what way this makes all one. Our Lord, however, explains the gradation and order in the consummating of this unity, when He adds, I in them, and You in Me; so that inasmuch as He was in the Father by His divine nature, we in Him by His incarnation, and He again in us by the mystery of the sacrament, a perfect union by means of a Mediator was established.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Neque tamen hoc ita dictum est tamquam pater non in nobis aut nos in patre non simus, sed per mediatorem inter Deum et hominem se breviter intimavit. Quod vero addidit ut sint consummati in unum, ostendit eo perduci reconciliationem quae fit per mediatorem ut perfecta beatitudine perfruamur. Unde id quod sequitur, ut cognoscat mundus quia tu me misisti, non sic accipiendum puto tamquam iterum dixerit ut credat mundus. Quamdiu enim credimus quod non videmus, nondum sumus consummati, sicut erimus cum meruerimus videre quod credimus. Quando ergo de consummatione loquitur, talis est intelligenda cognitio qualis erit per speciem, non qualis nunc est per fidem. Ipsi quippe credentes sunt mundus, non permanens inimicus, sed ex inimico amicus effectus; propterea sequitur et dilexisti eos sicut me dilexisti. In filio quippe nos pater diligit, quia in eo nos elegit: nec ideo pares sumus unigenito filio: neque enim semper aequalitatem significat quod dicitur: sicut illud, ita et istud; sed aliquando tantum: quod illud est, est et illud. Ita in hoc loco nihil est aliud dilexisti eos sicut me dilexisti, quam dilexisti eos, quoniam et me dilexisti: non enim alia causa est diligendi membra eius, nisi quia diligit eum. Cum igitur eorum quae fecerit nihil oderit, quis digne possit eloqui quantum diligat membra unigeniti filii sui, et quanto amplius ipsum unigenitum?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nor is this said, however, as if to mean that the Father was not in us, or we in the Father. He only means to see, that He is Mediator between God and man. And what He adds, That they may be made perfect in one, shows that the reconciliation made by this Mediator, was carried on even to the enjoyment of everlasting blessedness. So what follows, That the world may know that you have sent Me, must not be taken to mean the same as the words just above. That the world may believe. For as long as we believe what we do not see, we are not yet made perfect, as we shall be when we hare merited to see what we believe. So that when He speaks of their being made perfect, we are to understand such a knowledge as shall be by sight not such as is by faith..These that believe are the world, not a permanent enemy, my, but changed from an enemy to a friend; as it follows: And has loved them, as you has loved Me. The Father loves us in the Son, because He elected us in Him. These words do not prove that we are equal to the Only-Begotten Son; for this mode of expression, as one thing so another, does not always signify equality. It sometimes only means, because cause one thing, therefore another. And this is its meaning here: You have loved them, as you have loved Me, i. e. You have loved them, because you have loved Me. There is no reason for God loving His members, but that He loves him, But since He hates nothing that He has made, who can adequately express how much He loves the members of His Only-Begotten Son, and still more the Only-Begotten Himself.

Quapropter omnibus membris suis promisit hoc praemium, ut ubi est ipse, et nos cum illo simus; nec poterat non fieri quod omnipotenti patri se velle dixerit omnipotens filius: una vero est patris et filii voluntas; et si intelligere nondum permittit infirmitas, credat pietas.

Wherein He shows that He had received power over all men, to deliver whom He would and to condemn whom He would. Wherefore it is to all His members that He promises this reward, that where He is they may be also. Nor can that but be done, which the Almighty Son says that He wishes to the Almighty Father: for the Father and the Son have one will, which, if weakness prevent us from comprehending, piety must believe. Where I am; so far as pertains to the creature, He was made of the seed of David according to the flesh: He might say, Where I am, meaning where He was shortly to be, i.e. heaven. In heaven then, He promises us, we shall be. For there was the form of a servant raised, which He had taken from the Virgin, and there placed on the right hand of God.

Wherefore it was not enough for Him to say, I will that they may be where I am, but He adds, with Me. For to be with Him is the great good: even the miserable can be where He is, but only the happy can be with Him. And as in the case of the visible though very different be whatever example we take, a blind man will serve for one, as a blind man though He is where the light is, yet is not himself with the light, but is absent from it in its presence, so not only the unbelieving, but the believing, though they cannot be where Christ is not, yet are not themselves with Christ by sight: by faith we cannot doubt but that a believer is with Christ. But here He is speaking of that sight wherein we shall see Him as He is; as He adds, That they may behold My glory, which you have given Me. That they may behold, He says, not, that they may believe.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Videtur autem mihi hoc et anxius dicere, quoniam eum qui ita bonus et iustus est cognoscere noluerunt. Non igitur hoc est quod Iudaei dicunt, quoniam ipsi quidem te cognoscunt, ego vero ignoro; sed e contrario est; unde subdit ego autem cognovi te, et hi cognoverunt quia tu me misisti: et notum feci eis nomen tuum, et notum faciam, per spiritum sanctum eis perfectam cognitionem dando. Si autem didicerint quis es tu, scient quia ego non sum separatus a te, sed valde amatus, et proprius filius et coniunctus. Hoc vero suasi eis, ut ego maneam in eis; et sic fidem quae est in me et amorem servabunt certissime; et hoc est quod subditur ut dilectio qua dilexisti me, in ipsis sit, et ego in ipsis; quasi dicat: ipsis me amantibus, ego manebo in eis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He says this as if He were troubled at the thought, that they should be unwilling to know One so just and good. And whereas the Jews had said, that they knew God, and He knew Him not: He on the contrary says, But I have known you, and these have known that you have sent Me, and I have declared to them your name, and will declare it, by giving them perfect knowledge through the Holy Ghost. When they have learned what you are, they will know that I am not separate from You, but You own Son greatly beloved, and joined to You. This I have e told them, that I might receive them, and that they who believe this aright, shall preserve their faith and love toward Me entire; and I will abide in them: That the love wherewith you have loved Me may be in them, and I in them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Vel aliter. Quid est eum cognoscere, nisi vita aeterna, quam mundo damnato non dedit, reconciliato dedit? Propterea itaque mundus non cognovit quia iustus es. Hoc meritis eius, ut non cognosceret, retribuisti; et propterea mundus reconciliatus cognovit quia misericors es; et ut cognosceret, non ei merito, sed gratia subvenisti. Denique sequitur ego autem cognovi te. Ipse fons gratiae est Deus natura, homo autem de spiritu sancto et virgine ineffabili gratia. Denique quia gratia Dei per Iesum Christum est, dicitur et hi cognoverunt: ipse est mundus reconciliatus; sed ideo quia tu me misisti: ergo gratia cognoverunt. Et notum feci eis nomen tuum per fidem, et notum faciam per speciem, ut dilectio qua dilexisti me, in ipsis sit. Qualis est ista locutio, tali et apostolus usus est: bonum certamen certavi; non ait: bono certamine, quod usitatius dicetur. Quomodo autem dilectio qua pater dilexit filium, esset in nobis, nisi quia membra eius sumus, et in illo diligimus, cum ipse diligitur totus, idest caput et corpus? Et ideo subiunxit et ego in ipsis: est enim in nobis tamquam in templo suo, nos autem in illo secundum quod caput nostrum est.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or thus; What is to know Him, but eternal life, which He gave not to a condemned but to a reconciled world? for this reason the world hath not known You; because you are just, and have punished the with this ignorance of You, in reward for their misdeeds. And for this reason the reconciled world knows You, because you are merciful, and have vouchsafed this knowledge, not in consequence of their merits, but of your grace. it follows: But I have known You. He is God the fountain of grace by nature, man of the Holy Ghost and Virgin by grace ineffable. Then because the grace of God is through Jesus Christ, He says, And they have known Me, i.e. the reconciled world have known Me, by grace, forasmuch as you have sent Me. And I have made known your name to them by faith, and will make it known by sight: that the love wherewith you have loved Me may be in them. The Apostle uses a like phrase, I have fought a good fight, by a good fight being the more common form. The love wherewith the Father loves the Son in us, can only be in us because we are His members, and we are loved in Him when He is loved wholly, i.e. both head and body. And therefore He adds, And I in them; He is in us, as in His temple, we in Him as our Head.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Terminato sermone quem post coenam dominus ad discipulos habuit, adiuncta oratione quam dixerat ad patrem, eius passionem Ioannes Evangelista sic exorsus est haec cum dixisset Iesus, egressus est cum discipulis suis trans torrentem Cedron, ubi erat hortus, in quem introivit ipse, et discipuli eius. Non autem continuo hoc factum est cum eius illa finita esset oratio; sed alia quaedam sunt interposita, quae ab isto praetermissa, apud alios Evangelistas leguntur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The discourse, which our Lord had with His disciples after supper, and the prayer which followed, being now ended, the Evangelist begins the account of His Passion. When Jesus had spoken these words, He came forth with His disciples over the brook Cedron, where was a garden, into which He entered, and His disciples. But this did not take place immediately after the prayer was ended; there was an interval containing some things, which John omits, but which are mentioned by the other Evangelists.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Facta est enim contentio inter eos, quis eorum videretur esse maior, sicut Lucas commemorat. Dixit etiam ipse Petro, sicut ipse Lucas subiungit: ecce Satanas expetivit vos, ut cribraret sicut triticum et cetera quae ibi sequuntur. Et hymno dicto, sicut Matthaeus et Marcus commemorant, exierunt in montem oliveti. Contexit ergo narrationem Matthaeus, et dixit: tunc venit Iesus cum illis in villam quae dicitur Gethsemani. Iste locus est quem commemorat hic Ioannes: ubi erat hortus, in quem introivit ipse, et discipuli eius.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. A contention took place between them, which of them was the greater, as Luke relates. He also said to Peter, as Luke adds in the same place, Behold, Satan has desired to have you, that he might sift you as wheat, &amp;c. And according to Matthew and Mark, they sang a hymn, and then went to Mount Olivet. Matthew lastly brings the two narratives together: Then went Jesus with His disciples to a place which is called Gethsemane. That is the place which John mentions here, Where there was a garden, into the which He entered, and His disciples.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ad hoc ergo valet quod dictum est, haec cum dixisset, ut non eum ante opinemur ingressum quam illa verba finiret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. When Jesus had spoken these words, shows that He did not enter before He had finished speaking.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sed propter quid non dixit: cessans ab oratione venit illuc? Quoniam oratio illa fuit loquela propter discipulos facta. De nocte autem vadit, et flumen pertransit, et properat ad locum proditori cognitum, auferens his qui insidiabantur, laborem, et ostendens discipulis quoniam volens ad mortem venit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why does not John say, When He had prayed, He entered? Because His prayer was a speaking for His disciples’ sake. It is now night time; He goes and crosses the brook, and hastens to the place which was known to the traitor; thus giving no trouble to those who were lying in wait for Him, and strewing His disciples that He went voluntarily to die.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Dicit autem trans torrentem Cedron, idest cedrorum: genitivus enim est Graecus. Transit torrentem, quia de torrente passionis bibit. Ubi erat hortus, ut peccatum quod in horto commissum fuerat, in horto deleret: Paradisus enim hortus deliciarum interpretatur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Over the brook Cedron, i.e. of cedars. It is the genitive in the Greek. He goes over the brook, i.e. drinks of the brook of His Passion. Where there was a garden, that the sin which was committed in a garden, He might blot out in a garden. Paradise signifies garden of delights.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ne autem audiens hortum, eum occultari aestimes, subiungit sciebat autem et Iudas, qui tradebat eum, locum: quia frequenter Iesus convenerat illuc cum discipulis suis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That it might not be thought that He went into a garden to hide Himself, it is added, But Judas who betrayed Him knew the place: for Jesus of often resorted there with; His disciples.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ibi ergo lupus ovina pelle contectus, et inter oves alto patrisfamilias consilio toleratus didicit, ubi ad tempus exiguum dispergeret gregem, insidiis appetendo pastorem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There the wolf in sheep’s clothing permitted by the deep counsel of the Master of the flock to go among the sheep, learned in what way to disperse the flock, and ensnare the Shepherd.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Multoties autem ibi cum discipulis Iesus singulariter convenerat, de necessariis loquens, et quae non erat fas alios audire. Facit autem hoc in montibus et in hortis, maxime purum a tumultibus inquirens semper locum, ne mens impediatur ab auditione. Ideo autem Iudas illuc venit, quoniam multoties Christus extra pernoctabat. Ivisset autem ad domum, si putasset eum ibi invenire dormientem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Jesus had often met and talked alone with His disciples there, on essential doctrines, such as it was lawful for others to hear. He does this on mountains, and in gardens, to be out of reach of noise and tumult. Judas, however went there, because Christ had often passed the night there in the open air. He would have gone to His house, if he had thought he should find Him sleeping there.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Noverat etiam Iudas dominum festo tempore consuevisse semper docere discipulos aliquod sublime: erat autem solitus docere huiusmodi mystica in talibus locis: ac quoniam tunc dies erat solemnis, arbitratus est illum esse illic, et discipulos docere quae ad celebritatem spectabant.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Judas knew that at the feast time our Lord was accustomed to teach His disciples high and mysterious doctrines, and that He taught in places like this. And as it was then a solemn season, he thought He would be found there, teaching His disciples things relating to the feast.

          <td><b>GLOSS</b>. The Evangelist had strewn how Judas had found, out the place where Christ was, now he relates how he went there. Judas then, having received a band of men and officers from the chief priests and Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torched and weapons.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Cohors non Iudaeorum, sed militum fuit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. It was a band not of Jews, but of soldiers, granted, we must understand, by the Governor, with legal authority to take the criminal, as He was considered, and crush any opposition that might be made.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They had often sent elsewhere to take Him, but had not been able. Whence it is evident that He gave Himself up voluntarily; as it follows, Jesus therefore, knowing all things that should come upon Him, went forth, and said to them, Whom do you seek?

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He asks not because He needed to know, for He knew all things that should come upon Him; but because He wished to show, that though present, they could not see or distinguish Him: Jesus says to them, I am He.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: In medio enim eorum existens, excaecavit eorum oculos: quoniam enim non tenebrae causa erant, indicavit Evangelista dicens, quoniam habuerunt lampades. Si vero lampades non essent, a voce saltem debebant eum agnoscere. Si vero et illi ignorabant, qualiter Iudas ignoravit, qui cum eo fuerat continue? Et ideo subdit stabat autem et Iudas, qui tradebat eum, cum ipsis.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He Himself had blinded their eyes. For that darkness was not the reason is clear, because the Evangelist says that they had lanterns. Though they had not lanterns, however, they should at least have recognized Him by His voice. And if they did not know Him, yet how was it that Judas, who had been with Him constantly also, did not know Him? And Judas also which betrayed Him stood with them. Jesus did all this to show that they could not have taken Him, or even seen Him when He was in the midst of them, had He not permitted it.

Et nunc utique per Evangelium, ego sum, dicit Christus, et a Iudaeis expectatur Antichristus, ut retro redeant, et in terram cadant: quoniam deserentes caelestia, terrena desiderant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As soon then as He said To them, I am He, they went backward. Where now is the band of soldiers, where the terror and defence of arms? Without a blow, one word struck, drove back, prostrated a crowd fierce with hatred, terrible with arms. For God was hid in the flesh, and the eternal day was so obscured by His human body, that He was sought for with lanterns and torches, to be slain in the darkness. What shall He do when He comes to judge, Who did thus when He was going to be judged? And now even at the present time Christ says by the Gospel, I am He, and an Antichrist is expected by the Jews: to the end that they may go backward, and fall to the ground; because that forsaking heavenly, they desire earthly things.

Iniqui ergo quia in invisibilibus cadunt, post se cadere dicuntur, quia ibi corruunt ubi quod tunc eos sequitur, modo videre non possunt: iusti vero, quia in istis visibilibus semetipsos sponte deiciunt ut in invisibilibus erigantur, quasi in faciem cadunt, quia timore compuncti videntes humiliantur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Why is this, that the Elect fall on their faces, the reprobate backward? Because every one who falls back, sees not where he falls, whereas he who falls forward, sees where he falls. The wicked when they suffer loss in invisible things, are said to fall backward, because they do not see what is behind them: but the righteous, who of their own accord cast themselves down in temporal things, in order that they may rise in spiritual, fall as it were upon their faces, when with fear and repentance they humble themselves with their eyes open.

Sed quia permanebant in malitia et nullam habebant excusationem, tunc seipsum in manibus eorum tradidit; unde sequitur iterum ergo interrogavit eos: quem quaeritis? Illi ergo dixerunt: Iesum Nazarenum. Respondit Iesus: dixi vobis quia ego sum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Lastly, lest any should say that He had encouraged the Jews to kill Him, in delivering Himself into their hands, He says every thing that is possible to reclaim them. But when they persisted in their malice, and showed themselves inexcusable then He gave Himself up into their hands: Then asked He them again, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth. Jesus answered, I have told you that I am He.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Audierant primo ego sum; sed non comprehenderant: quia hoc noluit qui potuit quidquid voluit.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. They had heard at the first, I am He, but had not understood it; because He who could do whatever He would, willed not that they should. But had He never permitted Himself to be taken by them, they would not have done indeed what they came to do; but neither would He what He came to do. So now having strewn His power to them when they wished to take Him and could not, He lets them seize Him, that they might be unconscious agent, of His will; If you seek Me, let these go their way.

The Evangelist, to show that it was not their design to do this, but that His power did it, adds, That the saying might be fulfilled which He spoke, Of them which you have given Me, have I lost none. He had said this with reference not to temporal, but to eternal death: the Evangelist however understands the word of temporal death also.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Petrus confidens in praedicta voce domini et in his quae iam facta erant, armatur adversus eos qui supervenerant; unde dicitur Simon ergo Petrus habens gladium, eduxit eum, et percussit pontificis servum. Sed qualiter iussus non peram habere neque duo vestimenta, gladium habet? Mihi videtur hunc formidans praeparasse dudum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Peter trusting to these last words of our Lord’s, and to what He had just done, assaults those who came to take Him: Then Simon Peter having a sword drew it, and smote the high priest’s servant. But how, commanded as he had been to have neither scrip, nor two garments, had he a sword? Perhaps he had foreseen this occasion, and provided one.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel ad opus agni illo indigens, ferebat hunc etiam post coenam.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, he had got one for sacrificing the lamb, and carried it away with him from the Supper.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed qualiter qui iussus erat non alapam dare, homicida fit? Quia maxime non se ulcisci iussus est; hic autem non se ulciscebatur, sed magistrum. Demum nondum perfecti adhuc erant, sed videbis postea Petrum verberatum, et humiliter ferentem. Non sine causa autem subdit et abscidit eius auriculam dexteram. Videtur mihi enim impetum apostoli significare quoniam ad ipsum caput impetum fecit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But how could he, who had been forbidden ever to strike on the cheek, be a murderer? Because what he had been forbidden to do was to avenge himself, but here he was not avenging himself, but his Master. They were not however yet perfect: afterwards you shall see Peter beaten with stripes, and bearing it humbly. And cut off his right ear: this seems to show the impetuosity of the Apostle; that he struck at the head itself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Solus autem hic Evangelista etiam nomen servi huius expressit, cum dixit erat autem nomen servo Malchus: sicut Lucas solus quod eius auriculam dominus tetigerit, et sanaverit eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The servant’s name was Malchus; John is the only Evangelist who mentions the servant’s name; as Luke is the only one who mentions that our Lord touched the ear and healed him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Tunc enim miraculum fecit, et erudiens nos, quoniam eis qui male faciunt benefacere oportet, et virtutem revelans suam. Nomen autem propterea posuit Evangelista, ut his qui tunc legerent, liceret quaerere si vere factum sit. Servum autem eum summi pontificis dicit: quia magnum est quod factum est, non solum quia curavit, sed quia curavit eum qui super eum venerat, et paulo post alapam daturus erat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He wrought this miracle both to teach us, that we ought to do good to those who suffer and to manifest His power. The Evangelist gives the name, that those who then read it might have the opportunity of inquiring into the truth of the account. And he mentions that he was the servant of the high priest, because in addition to the miracle of the cure itself, this shows that it was performed upon one of those who came to take Him, and who shortly after struck Him on the face.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Malchus autem interpretatur regnaturus. Quid ergo auris pro domino amputata et a domino sanata significat, nisi auditum amputata vetustate renovatum, ut sit in novitate spiritus, et non in vetustate litterae: quod cui praestitum fuerit a Christo, quis dubitet regnaturum esse cum Christo? Quod autem servus inventus est, et hoc ad illam pertinet vetustatem, quae in servitutem generat; sed cum accessit sanitas, figurata est et libertas.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The name Malchus signifies, about to reign. What then does the ear cut off for our Lord, and healed by our Lord denote, but the abolition of the old, and the creating of a new, hearing in the newness of the Spirit, and not in the oldness of the letter? To whomsoever this is given, who can doubt that he will reign with Christ? But he was a servant too, has reference to that oldness, which generated to bondage: the cure figures liberty.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel caesio auris dexterae servi principis sacerdotum signum erat surditatis eorum, quae praecipue in principibus sacerdotum inoleverat; quod autem denuo restituta sit auris, significat ultimam reparationem intellectus in Israeliticis veniente Elia.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or, the cutting off of the high priest’s servant’s right ear is a type of the people’s deafness, of which the chief priests partook most strongly: the restoration of the ear, of ultimate reenlightenment of the understanding of the Jews, at the coming of Elias.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Factum autem Petri dominus improbavit, et progredi ultra prohibuit; unde sequitur dixit ergo Iesus Petro: mitte gladium tuum in vaginam. Etenim ille ad patientiam commonendus fuit, et hoc ad intelligentiam conscribendum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Our Lord condemned Peter’s act, and forbade him proceeding further: Then said Jesus to Peter, Put up your sword into the sheath. He was to be admonished to have patience: and this was written for our learning.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Non solum autem minis eum cohibuit, ut Matthaeus refert; sed et aliter consolatur eum, dicens calicem quem dedit mihi pater, non vis ut bibam illum? Ostendens quoniam non illorum virtutis quae fiebant erant, sed suae concessionis; et quod non est Deo contrarius, sed obediens usque ad mortem.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He not only restrained Him however by threats, but consoled him also at the same time: The cup that My Father gives Me, shall I not drink it? Whereby He shows that it was not by their power, but by His permission, that this had been done, and that He did not oppose God, but was obedient even to death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: In eo autem quod ipsam calicem dicit, quam sibi grata et acceptabilis pro salute mortalium mors videatur, edisserit.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. In that He calls it a cup, He shows how pleasing and acceptable death for the salvation of men was to Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod autem a patre traditum sibi dicit calicem passionis, illud est quod ait apostolus: filio proprio non pepercit, sed pro nobis omnibus tradidit eum. Verum auctor calicis huius est etiam ipse qui bibit: unde idem apostolus dicit: Christus dilexit nos, et tradidit seipsum pro nobis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The cup being given Him by the Father, is the same with what the Apostle says, Who spared not His own Son, but delivered Him up for us all. But the Giver of this cup and the Drinker of it are the same, as the same Apostle says, Christ loved us, and gave Himself for us.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Every thing having been done that could be to dissuade the Jews, and they refusing to take warning, He suffered Himself to be delivered into their hands: Then the band and the captain and officers of the Jews took Jesus.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Comprehenderunt ad quem non accesserunt: nec audierunt illud: accedite ad eum, et illuminamini. Si enim sic accederent, non eum manibus occidendum, sed recipiendum corde comprehenderent. Nunc autem quando eum illo modo comprehenderunt, ab eo longius recesserunt. Sequitur et ligaverunt eum; a quo solvi potius velle debuerunt: et erant forte in eis qui postea liberati ab eo, dixerunt: dirupisti vincula mea. Postea vero quam persecutores tradente Iuda dominum ligaverunt, ut intelligatur Iudas non laudabilis utilitate traditionis huius, sed sceleris voluntate damnabilis, subditur et adduxerunt eum ad Annam primum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. They took Him Whom they did not draw nigh to; nor understood that which is written in the Psalms, Draw nigh to Him, and be you lightened. For had they thus drawn nigh to Him, they would have taken Him, not to kill Him, but to be in their hearts. But now that they take Him the way they do, they go backward. It follows, and bound Him, Him by Whom they ought to have wished to be loosed. And perhaps there were among them some who, afterwards delivered by Him, exclaimed, you have broken My chains asunder. But after that they had bound Jesus, it then appears most clearly that Judas had betrayed Him not for a good, but a most wicked purpose: And led Him away to Annas first.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Prae delectatione enim gloriabantur in his quae fiebant, quasi trophaeum statuentes.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. In exultation, to show what they had done, as if they were raising a trophy.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Nec tacet causam cur ita factum sit, subdens erat enim socer Caiphae, qui erat pontifex anni illius. Merito et Matthaeus, cum id brevius narrare voluisset, eum ad Caipham ductum fuisse commemorat: quia et ad Annam prius ideo ductus est, quod socer eius fuerit; ut intelligendum sit hoc eumdem Caipham fieri voluisse.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Why they did so, he tells us immediately after: For he was father in law to Caiaphas, which was the high priest that same year. Matthew, in order to shorten the narrative, says that He was led to Caiaphas; because He was led to Annas first, as being the father in law of Caiaphas. So that we must understand that Annas wished to act Caiaphas’s part.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quatenus dum a consimili pontifice damnaretur, ipse quoque minoris criminis reus haberetur. Vel fortassis sic domus eius sita erat ut praeterire eam non possent. Sive divinitus actum est, ut qui erant affines sanguine, sociarentur in scelere. Sed quod dicitur, quod esset pontifex anni illius, sonat contrarium legi, in qua praeceptum erat ut unus esset pontifex summus, quo mortuo succederet ei filius suus; sed iam pontificatus ambitione erat infectus.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. In order that, while our Lord was condemned by his colleague, he might not be guiltless, though his crime was less. Or perhaps his house lay in the way, and they were obliged to pass by it. Or it was the design of Providence, that they who were allied in blood, should be associated in guilt. That Caiaphas however was high priest for that year sounds contrary to the law, which ordained that there be only one high priest, and made the office hereditary. But the pontificate had now been abandoned to ambitious men.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Refert enim Iosephus, istum Caipham, unius anni sacerdotium redemisse. Non ergo mirum si iniquus pontifex inique iudicaverit: saepe qui per avaritiam ad sacerdotium accedit, per iniustitiam in eo servatur.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Josephus relates that this Caiaphas bought the high priesthood for this year. No wonder then if a wicked high priest judged wickedly. A man who was advanced to the priesthood by avarice would keep himself there by injustice.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Ne autem audiens vincula auditor tumultuetur, recoluit prophetiae, quoniam mors eius salus fuit orbis terrarum; unde sequitur erat autem Caiphas qui consilium dederat Iudaeis, quia expedit unum hominem mori pro populo: tanta enim est veritatis superabundantia, ut et inimici eam personent.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That no one however might be disturbed at the sound of the chains, the Evangelist reminds them of the prophecy that His death would be the salvation of the world: Now Caiaphas was he which gave counsel to the Jews, that it was expedient that one man should die for the people. Such is the overpowering force of truth, that even its enemies echo it.

Ioannes autem incipit Petri tentationem dicere, cum dicit sequebatur autem Iesum Simon Petrus, et alius discipulus.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The temptation of Peter, which took place in the midst of the contumelies offered to our Lord, is not placed by all in the same order. Matthew and Mark put the contumelies first, the temptation of Peter afterwards; Luke the temptation first, the contumelies after. John begins with the temptation: And Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Who that other disciple was we cannot hastily decide, as his name is not told us. John however is accustomed to signify himself by this expression, with the addition of, whom Jesus loved. Perhaps therefore he is the one.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Se autem occultat humilitatis gratia; etenim magnam rectitudinem enarrat, quomodo omnibus fugientibus ipse sequitur. Sed praeponit sibi Petrum, et sui ipsius coactus est meminisse, ut discas quoniam certius aliis enarrat ea quae facta sunt in atrio, quasi intus existens. Succidit autem propriam laudem, subdens discipulus autem ille erat notus pontifici, et introivit cum Iesu in atrium pontificis; non enim hoc ut magnum quid de seipso ponit; sed quia dixit quod intravit cum Iesu solus, ut non aestimes hoc excelsae mentis esse, addit causam. Igitur Petrum venisse illuc, amoris fuit; non intrasse autem intro, timoris; unde sequitur Petrus autem stabat ad ostium foris.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He omits his own name out of humility: though he is relating an act of great virtue, how that he followed when the rest fled. He puts Peter before himself, and then mentions himself, in order to show that he was inside the hall, and therefore related what took place there with more certainty than the other Evangelists could. That disciple was known to the high priest, and went in with Jesus into the palace of the high priest. This he mentions not as a boast, but in order to diminish his own merit, in having been the only one who entered with Jesus. It is accounting for the act in another way, than merely by greatness of mind. Peter’s love took him as far as the palace, but his fear prevented him entering in: But Peter stood at the door without.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Foris stabat qui negaturus erat dominum, nec erat in Christo qui Christum confiteri non erat ausus.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed quoniam et Petrus intrasset utique domum, si ei concessum esset, indicavit subdens exivit ergo discipulus alius, qui erat notus pontifici, et dixit ostiariae, et introduxit Petrum. Ideo autem ipse eum non introduxit, quia Christo adhaerebat, et sequebatur eum. Sequitur dixit ergo ancilla ostiaria: numquid et tu ex discipulis es hominis istius? Dicit ille: non sum. Quid dicis, o Petre? Nonne prius dixisti: et si oportuerit, animam meam pro te ponam? Quid ergo factum est, quoniam nec ostiariae fers interrogationem? Non erat miles qui interrogabat, sed ostiaria vilis; neque dixit: seductoris discipulus es, sed hominis illius; quod miserentis erat. Dicit autem numquid et tu? Quia Ioannes intus erat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But that Peter would have entered the palace, if he had been permitted, appears by what immediately follows: Then went out that other disciple who was known to the high priest, and spoke to her who kept the doors, and brought in Peter. He did not bring him in himself, because he kept near Christ. It follows: Then says the damsel that kept the door to Peter, Are not you also one of this Man’s s disciples? He says, I am not. What say you, O Peter? Did you not say before, I will lay down my life for your sake? What then had happened, that you give way even when the damsel asks you? It was not a soldier who asked you, but a mean porteress. Nor said she, Are you this Deceiver’s disciple, but, this Man’s: an expression of pity. Are not you also, she says, because John was inside.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed quid mirum si Deus vera praedixit, homo autem falsa praesumpsit? Sane in ista quae iam coepta est negatione Petri debemus advertere, non solum ab eo negari Christum qui dicit eum non esse Christum, sed ab illo etiam qui negat se esse Christianum. Dominus enim non ait Petro: discipulum meum te negabis; sed: me negabis. Negavit ergo ipsum cum se negavit esse discipulum. Quid autem aliud isto modo quam se negavit esse Christianum? Quam multi postea, etiam pueri et puellae, potuerunt mortem pro Christi confessione contemnere, et regnum caelorum fortiter introire, quod tunc iste non potuit, qui claves regni eius accepit. Ecce unde dictum est sinite hos abire: quia quos dedisti mihi, non perdidi ex eis quemquam. Utique enim Petrus, si negato Christo hinc iret, quid aliud quam periret?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But what wonder, if God foretold truly, man presumed falsely. Respecting this denial of Peter we should remark, that Christ is not only denied by him, who denies that He is Christ, but by him also who denies himself to be a Christian. For the Lord did not say to Peter, you shall deny that you art My disciple, but, you shall deny Me. He denied Him then, when he denied that he was His disciple. And what was this but to deny that he was a Christian? How many afterwards, even boys and girls, were able to despise death, confess Christ, and enter courageously into the kingdom of heaven; which he who received the keys of the kingdom, was now unable to do? Wherein we see the reason for His saying above, Let these go their way, for of those which you hast given Me, have I lost none. If Peter had gone out of this world immediately after denying Christ, He must have been lost.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Idcirco autem divinae providentiae secretum permisit ut primus ipse laberetur Petrus, quo erga peccantes duriorem sententiam proprii casus intuitu temperaret. Petrus enim orbis terrarum doctor et magister peccavit, et veniam impetravit, ut haec indulgentiae norma et regula iudicantibus praeberetur. Idcirco enim non Angelis arbitror commissam sacerdotii potestatem, ne cum ipsi minime peccarent, in peccatoribus sine misericordia vindicarent. Homo passibilis supra homines ordinatur, ut dum ipse in aliis suas recolit passiones, mitem apud eos se praebeat et benignum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Therefore did Divine Providence permit Peter first to fall, in order that he might be less severe to sinners from the remembrance of his own fall. Peter, the teacher and master of the whole world, sinned, and obtained pardon. that judges might thereafter have that rule to go by in dispensing pardon. For this reason I suppose the priesthood was not given to Angels; because, being without sin themselves, they would punish sinners without pity. Passible man is placed over man, in order that remembering his own weakness, he may be merciful to others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam tamen inanem quamdam gratiam appropriantes Petro, dicunt, quod ideo negavit Petrus, quoniam volebat semper esse cum Christo, et sequi continue. Novit enim quod si fateretur se esse de Christi discipulis, divideretur ab eo, et non haberet ultra spatium sequendi videndique dilectum: unde simulabat se officium gerere ministrorum, ne vultus moestitia cognitus excluderetur; unde sequitur stabant autem servi et ministri ad prunas, quia frigus erat, et calefaciebant se. Erat autem et Petrus stans cum eis, et calefaciens se.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Some however foolishly favor Peter, so far as to say that he denied Christ, because he did not wish to be away from Christ, and he knew, they say, that if he confessed that he was one of Christ’s disciples, he would be separated from Him, and would no longer have the liberty of following and seeing his beloved Lord; and therefore pretended to be one of the servants, that his sad countenance might not be perceived, and so exclude him: And the servants and officers stood there, who had made a fire of coals, and warmed themselves; and Peter stood with them, and warmed himself.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quia Christo nullum crimen inferre poterant, de discipulis interrogabant; unde dicitur pontifex ergo interrogavit Iesum de discipulis suis: fortassis ubi erant, vel cuius gratia eos collegit. Hoc autem dicebat quasi seditiosum et novarum rerum factorem eum redarguere volens, quasi nullo alio attendente ei quam eius discipulis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As they could bring no charge against Christ, they asked Him of His disciples: The high priest then asked Jesus of His disciples; perhaps where they were, and on what account He had collected them, he wished to prove that he was a seditious and factious person whom no one attended to, except His own disciples.

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Explorat insuper de doctrina; unde sequitur et de doctrina eius, cuiusmodi scilicet foret, utrum a lege discrepans et adversa Moysi, ut exinde occasione concepta ut Dei aemulum perdat.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He asks Him moreover of His doctrine, what it was, whether opposed to Moses and the law, that he might take occasion thereby to put Him to death as an enemy of God.

          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Non enim cognoscendae veritatis amore interrogat, sed ut causam inveniret qua eum accusare potuisset, et tradere Romano praesidi ad damnandum. Sed dominus ita temperavit responsionem ut nec veritatem taceret, nec se defendere videretur; sequitur enim respondit ei Iesus: ego palam locutus sum mundo; ego semper docui in synagoga et in templo quo omnes Iudaei conveniunt, et in occulto locutus sum nihil.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. He does not ask in order to know the truth, but to find out some charge against Him, on which to deliver Him to the Roman Governor to be condemned. But our Lord so tempers His answer, as neither to conceal the truth, nor yet to appear to defend Himself: Jesus answered him, I spoke openly to the world; I ever taught in the synagogue, and in the temple, where the Jews always resort; and in secret have I said nothing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Non praetereunda nascitur hic quaestio: si enim ipsis discipulis non loquebatur palam, sed horam promittebat quando palam fuerat locuturus, quomodo palam locutus est mundo? Deinde ipsis discipulis suis multo manifestius loquebatur quando cum eis erat remotus a turbis; tunc enim et parabolas aperiebat, quas clausas proferebat ad alios. Sed intelligendum est ita eum dixisse palam locutus sum mundo, ac si dixisset: multi me audierunt. Et rursus non erat palam, quia non intelligebant; et quod seorsum discipulis loquebatur, non in occulto utique loquebatur; quis namque in occulto loquitur qui coram tot hominibus loquitur? Praesertim si hoc loquitur paucis, quod per eos velit innotescere multis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. There is a difficulty here not to be passed over: if He did not speak openly even to His disciples, but only promised that He would do so at some time, how was it that He spoke openly to the world? He spoke more openly to His disciples afterwards, when they had withdrawn from the crowd; for He then explained His parables, the meaning of which He concealed from the others. When He says then, I spoke openly to the world, He must be understood to mean, w within the hearing of many. So in one sense He spoke openly, i.e. in that many heard Him; in another sense not openly, i.e. in that they did not understand Him. His speaking apart with His disciples was not speaking in secret; for how could He speak in secret before the multitude, especially when that small number of His disciples were to make known what He said to a much larger?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Reminiscitur autem hic prophetiae quae dicit: non in occulto locutus sum, nec in loco terrae tenebroso.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He refers here to the prophecy of Esaias; I have not spoken in, secret, in a dark place of the earth.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel locutus est quidem in occulto, sed non, ut hi aestimabant, trepidans et seditionem faciens; sed ubi multorum auditione superiora erant quae dicebantur. Volens autem ex superabundantia fide dignum constituere suum testimonium, subdit quid me interrogas? Interroga eos qui audierunt quid locutus sim ipsis: ecce hi sciunt quae dixerim ego; quasi dicat: tu me de meis interrogas; interroga inimicos meos, qui insidiantur mihi. Sunt autem haec verba confidentis in eorum quae dicta erant veritate: haec est enim veritatis inaltercabilis demonstratio, cum inimicos quis invocat teste.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, He spoke in secret, but not, as these thought, from fear, or to excite sedition; but only when what He said was above the understanding of the many. To establish the matter, however, upon superabundant evidence, He adds, Why ask you Me? ask them which heard Me what I said to them; behold, they know what I said to them: as if He said, you ask Me of My disciples; ask My enemies, who lie in wait for Me. These are the words of one who was confident of the truth of what He said: for it is incontrovertible evidence, when enemies are called in as witnesses.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ipsa enim quae audierant et non intellexerant, talia erant ut non possent iuste ac veraciter criminari: et quotiescumque interrogando tentarunt ut invenirent unde accusarent eum, sic eis respondit ut omnes eorum retunderentur doli, et calumniae eorum frustrarentur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For what they had beard and not understood was not of such a kind, as that they could justly turn it against Him. And as often as they tried by questioning to find out some charge against Him, He so replied as to blunt all their stratagems, and refute their calumnies.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. This shows that Annas was the high priest, for this was before He was sent to Caiaphas. And Luke in the beginning of his Gospel says, that Annas and Caiaphas were both high priests.

          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Here is fulfilled the prophecy, I gave my cheek to the smiters. Jesus, though struck unjustly, replied gently: Jesus answered him, If I have spoken evil, bear witness of the evil: but if well, why smite you Me?

          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicat: si habes ex his quae nunc a me prolata sunt reprehendere, ostende quod male dixerim; quod si nequis, quid furis? Vel etiam sic: si perperam docui cum in synagogis docebam, certifica principem sacerdotum; quod si recte docui, ita ut etiam vos ministri miraremini, quid me nunc caedis, quem prius admirabaris?
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if to say, If you have any fault to find with what I have said, show it; if you have not, why do you rage? Or thus: If I taught any thing unadvisedly, when I taught in the synagogues, give proof of it to the high priest I but if taught aright, so that even you officers admired, why smite you Me, Whom before you admired?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Quid ista responsione verius, mansuetius, iustius? Qui enim accepit alapam, numquid vellet eum qui percussit aut caelesti igne consumi, aut terra dehiscente sorberi, aut correptum Daemonio volutari, aut etiam alia huiusmodi qualibet poena, vel etiam graviori puniri? Quid horum per potentiam iubere non potuisset per quem factus est mundus, nisi patientiam nos docere maluisset, qua vincitur mundus? Hic dicet aliquis: cur non fecit quod ipse praecepit? Percutienti scilicet non sic respondere, sed maxillam debuit alteram praebere. Quid quod et mansuete respondit, et non solum maxillam alteram iterum percussuro, sed totum corpus figendum praeparavit in ligno? Et hinc potius demonstravit sua illa praecepta patientiae non ostentatione corporis, sed cordis praeparatione fienda: fieri enim potest ut alteram maxillam visibiliter homo praebeat iratus. Quanto ergo melius et respondet vera placatus, et ad perferenda graviora tranquillo animo fit paratus?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. What can be truer, gentler, kinder, than this answer? He Who received the blow on the face neither wished for him who struck it that fire from heaven should consume him, or the earth open its month and swallow him; or a devil seize him; or any other yet more horrible kind of punishment. Yet had not He, by Whom the world was made, power to cause any one of these things to take place, but that He preferred teaching us that patience why which the world is overcome? Some one will ask here, why He did not do what He Himself commanded, i.e. not make this answer, but give the other cheek to the smiter? But what if He did both, both answered gently, and gave, not His check only to the smiter, but His whole body to be nailed to the Cross? And herein He shows, that those precepts of patience are to be performed not by posture of the body, but by preparation of the heart: for it is possible that a man might give his cheek outwardly, and yet be angry at the same time. How much better is it to answer truly, yet gently, and be ready to bear even harder usage patiently.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Quid igitur consequens erat, nisi aut redarguere, aut acceptare quod dictum est?

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. What should they do then but either disprove, or admit, what He said? Yet this they do not do: it is not a trial they are carrying on, but a faction, a tyranny. Not knowing what to do further, they send Him to Caiaphas: Now Annas sent Him bound to Caiaphas the high priest.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. He was the one to whom they were taking Him from the first, as Matthew says; he being the high priest of this year. We must understand that the pontificate was taken between them year by year alternately, and that it was by Caiaphas’s consent that they led Him first to Annas; or that their houses were so situated, that they could not but pass straight by that of Annas.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Sent Him bound, not that He was bound now for the first time, for they bound Him when they took Him. They sent Him bound as they had brought Him. Or perhaps He may have been loosed from His bonds for that hour, in order to be examined, after which He was bound again, and sent to Caiaphas.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hoc loco invenimus non ante ianuam, sed ad focum stantem, secundo negasse Petrum; quod fieri non posset nisi iam rediisset postea quam foras exierat, ut Matthaeus dicit. Neque enim iam exierat, et foris vidit eum altera ancilla; sed cum exiret, eum vidit; idest, cum surgeret et exiret, animadvertit eum et dixit his qui erant ibi, idest qui simul erant ad ignem intus in atrio: et hic cum Iesu Nazareno erat. Ille autem qui foras exierat, hoc audito, rediens, iuravit illis contra nitentibus: quia non novi hominem. Deinde in eo quod Ioannes hic ait dixerunt: numquid et tu ex discipulis eius es? Quod redeunti et stanti dictum intelligimus, hoc quoque confirmatur, non illam tantum alteram ancillam, quam commemorant in hac secunda negatione Matthaeus et Marcus, sed alium quemdam, quem commemorat Lucas, cum Petro illud egisse; unde Ioannes dicit dixerunt ergo ei. Ioannes autem secutus de tertia Petri negatione, ita explicat dicit ei unus ex servis pontificis, cognatus eius cuius abscidit Petrus auriculam: nonne ego vidi te in horto cum illo? Quod Matthaeus et Marcus non singulari, sed plurali numero enuntiant eos qui cum Petro agebant, cum Lucas unum dicat; Ioannes quoque unum eumdemque cognatum eius cuius abscidit Petrus auriculam: facile est intelligere aut pluralem numerum pro singulari usitata locutione usurpasse Matthaeum et Marcum; aut quod unus maxime tamquam sciens, et qui eum viderat, affirmabat; ceteri autem secuti eius fidem Petrum simul urgebant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Here we find Peter not at the gate, but at the fire, when he denies the second time: so that he must have returned after he had gone out of doors, where Matthew says he was. He did not go out, and another damsel see him on the outside, but another damsel saw him as he was rising to go out, and remarked him, and told those who were by, i.e. those who were standing with her at the fire inside the hall, This fellow also was with Jesus of Nazareth. He heard this outside, and returned, and swore, I do not know the man. Then John continues: They said therefore to him, Are not you also one of His disciples? which words we suppose to have been said to him when he had come back, and was standing at the fire. And this explanation is confirmed by the fact, that besides the other damsel mentioned by Matthew and Mark in the second denial, there was another person, mentioned by Luke, who also questioned him. So John uses the plural. They said therefore to him. And then follows the third denial: One of the servants of the high priest, being his kinsman whose ear Peter cut off, says, Did not I see you in the garden with Him? That Matthew and Mark speak of the party who here question Peter in the plural number, whereas Luke mentions only one, and John also, adding that that one was the kinsman of him whose ear Peter cut off, is easily explained by supposing that Matthew and Mark used the plural number by a common form of speech for the singular; or that one who had observed him most strictly put the question first, and others followed it up, and pressed Peter with more.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Lo, the prophecy of the Physician is fulfilled, the presumption of the sick man demonstrated. That which Peter had said he would do, he had not done. I will lay down my life for your sake, but what our Lord had foretold had come to pass, you shall deny Me thrice.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Evangelists have all given the same account of the denials of Peter, not with any intention of throwing blame upon him, but to teach us how hurtful it is to trust in self, and not ascribe all to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem per primam Petri negationem illi designantur qui ante passionem ipsius negaverunt eum esse Deum; per secundam vero illi qui post resurrectionem eius in divinitate pariter et humanitate offenderunt. Item per primum galli cantum ipsius designatur capitis resurrectio, per secundum illa quae in fine celebrabitur totius corporis. Per primam autem ancillam, quae Petrum negare coegit, designatur cupiditas; per secundam carnalis delectatio; per unum seu plures servos, Daemones, qui suadent Christum negare.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Mystically, by the first denial of Peter are denoted those who before our Lord’s Passion denied that He was God, by the second, those who did so after His resurrection. So by the first crowing of the cock His resurrection is signified; by the second, the general resurrection at the end of the world. By the first damsel, who obliged Peter to deny, is denoted lust, by the second, carnal delight: by one or more servants, the devils who persuade men to deny Christ.

Sed si ad Caipham, cur ad praetorium, quod nihil aliud vult intelligi quam ubi praeses Pilatus habitavit?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The Evangelist returns to the part where he had left off, in order to relate Peter’s denial: Then led they Jesus to Caiaphas to the hall of judgment: to Caiaphas from his colleague and father in law Annas, as has been said. But If to Caiaphas, how to the praetorium, which was the place where the governor Pilate resided;
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Praetorium enim dicitur sedes praetoris; praetores vero dicuntur praefecti, sive praeceptores, eo quod civibus praecepta donent.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. The praetorium is the place where the praetor sat. Praetors were called prefects and preceptors, because they issue decrees.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Aut igitur aliqua urgente causa de domo Annae, quo ad audiendum ambo convenerant, Caiphas perrexerat ad praetorium praesidis, et socero suo Iesum reliquerat audiendum; aut in domo Caiphae praetorium Pilatus acceperat, et tanta domus erat ut seorsum habitantem dominum suum, seorsum iudicem ferret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Where then for some urgent reason Caiaphas proceeded from the house of Annas, where both had been sitting, to the praetorium of the governor, and left Jesus to the hearing of his father in law: or Pilate had established the praetorium in the house of Caiaphas, which was large enough to afford a separate lodging to its owner, and the governor at the same time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons.

Sequitur erat autem mane.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. According to Matthew, When the morning came, they led Him away, and delivered Him to Pontius Pilate. But He was to have been led to Caiaphas at first. How is it then that He was brought to him so late? The truth is, now He was going as it were a committed criminal, Caiaphas having already determined on His death. And He was to be given up to Pilate immediately. And it was early.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Antequam gallus cantaret, ad Caipham ducitur; mane vero ad Pilatum: per quae demonstrat Evangelista quoniam per totum intermedium noctis a Caipha interrogatus in nullo redarguitur; et idcirco misit eum Pilato. Sed illa aliis dimittens enarranda, ipse quaesivit quod deinceps est; sequitur enim et ipsi non introierunt in praetorium.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He was led to Caiaphas before the cock crowed, but early in the morning to Pilate. Whereby the Evangelist shows, that all that night of examination, ended in proving nothing against Him; and that He was sent to Pilate in consequence. But leaving what passed then to the other Evangelists, he goes to what followed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc est in eam partem domus quam Pilatus tenebat, si ipsa erat domus Caiphae. Cur autem non introierunt, exponit subdens ut non contaminarentur, sed manducarent Pascha.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. And they themselves entered not into the judgment hall: i.e. into that part of the house which Pilate occupied, supposing it to be the house of Caiaphas. Why they did not enter is next explained: Lest they should be defiled, but that they might eat the Passover.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quoniam tunc Iudaei faciebant Pascha; ipse vero ante unam diem tradidit Pascha, reservans suam occisionem sextae feriae quando vetus Pascha fiebat: vel Pascha dicit totum festum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> For the Jews were then celebrating the passover; He Himself celebrated it one day before, reserving His own death for the sixth day; on which day the old passover was kept. Or, perhaps, the passover means the whole season.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dies enim agere coeperant azymorum, quibus diebus contaminatio illis erat in alienigenae habitaculum intrare.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The days of unleavened breed were beginning; during which time it was defilement to enter the house of a stranger.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Pascha enim proprie dicebatur dies illa qua agnus ad vesperam quartadecima luna occidebatur; septem vero dies sequentes dies azymorum dicebantur, in quibus nihil fermentatum in domibus eorum debuit inveniri. Sed tamen dies paschalis invenitur inter dies azymorum, ut apud Matthaeum: prima autem die azymorum accesserunt discipuli ad Iesum, dicentes: ubi vis paremus tibi comedere Pascha? Pascha etiam dies azymorum inveniuntur nominati, sicut hic: ut manducarent Pascha: Pascha enim non immolationem agni hic notat, quae fiebat quartadecima luna ad vesperam; sed magnam solemnitatem, quae quintadecima luna celebrabatur post agni immolationem; quartadecima enim luna dominus, sicut et alii Iudaei, Pascha celebravit; quintadecima luna, quando magna solemnitas celebrabatur, est crucifixus; quartadecima vero luna coepit esse immolatio ex quo captus est in horto.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. The passover was strictly the fourteenth day of the month, the day on which the lamb was killed in the evening: the seven days following were called the days of unleavened bread, in which nothing leavened ought to be found in their houses. Yet we find the day of the passover reckoned among the days of unleavened bread: Now the first day of the feast of unleavened bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying to Him, Where will you that we prepare for you to eat the passover? And here also in like manner: That they might eat the passover; the passover here signifying not the sacrifice of the lamb, which took place the fourteenth day at evening, but the great festival which was celebrated on the fifteenth day, after the sacrifice of the lamb. Our Lord, like the rest of the Jews, kept the passover on the fourteenth day: on the fifteenth day, when the great festival was held, He was crucified. His immolation however began on the fourteenth day, from the time that He was taken in the garden.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: O impia caecitas. Alienigenae iudicis praetorio contaminari timebant, et fratris innocentis sanguinem fundere non timebant. Nam quod etiam dominus erat et vitae dator qui occidebatur, non eorum conscientiae, sed nescientiae deputetur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. O impious blindness! They feared to be defiled by the judgment hall of a foreign prefect, to shed the blood of an innocent brother they feared not. For that He Whom they killed was the Lord and Giver of life, their blindness saved them from knowing

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Haec autem erat consuetudo Iudaeorum, ut quem mortis reum iudicarent, vinctum praesidi traderent, ut dum praeses vinctum cerneret, intelligeret morti addictum.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. It was the custom of the Jews when they condemned any one to death, to notify it to the governor, by delivering the man bound.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed videns eum ligatum et a tot ductum, non aestimavit hoc argumentum esse inaltercabile accusationis, sed interrogat; unde sequitur et dixit eis: quam accusationem affertis adversus hominem hunc? Inconveniens enim dicit esse, iudicium eos rapuisse, supplicium autem illi concedere. Sed illi renuentes ex directo accusationem, coniecturis quibusdam utuntur; unde sequitur responderunt, et dixerunt: si non esset hic malefactor, non tibi tradidissemus eum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Pilate however seeing Him bound, and such numbers conducting Him, supposed that they had not unquestionable evidence against Him, so proceeds to ask the question: And said, What accusation bring you against this Man? For it was absurd, he said, to take the trial out of his hands, and yet give him the punishment. They in reply bring forward no positive charge but only their own conjectures: They answered and said to him, If He were not a malefactor, we would not have delivered Him up to you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Interrogentur atque respondeant ab immundis spiritibus liberati, caeci videntes, mortui resurgentes, et, quod omnia superat, stulti sapientes, utrum sit malefactor Iesus. Sed ista dicebant, de quibus per prophetam iam ipse praedixerat: retribuebant mihi mala pro bonis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Ask the freed from unclean spirits, the blind who saw, the dead who came to life again, and, what is greater than all, the fools who were made wise, and let them answer, whether Jesus was a malefactor. But they spoke, of whom He had Himself prophesied in the Psalms, They rewarded Me evil for good.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Sed videndum est ne contra sit quod Lucas dicit, certa in eum dicta esse crimina: coeperunt autem illum, inquit, accusare, dicentes: hunc invenimus subvertentem gentem nostram, et prohibentem tributa dari Caesari, et dicentem se Christum regem esse. Sed secundum Ioannem videntur Iudaei noluisse dicere crimina ut eorum auctoritatem secutus Pilatus, quid ei obicerent desineret quaerere; sed ob hoc tantum nocentem crederet, quod sibi ab eis tradi meruisset. Ergo intelligere debemus et hoc dictum esse, et illud quod Lucas commemoravit: multa enim dicta et multa responsa sunt. Unde in narratione sua quisque posuit quod satis esse iudicavit: nam et ipse Ioannes dicit quaedam quae obiecta sunt, quae suis locis videbimus. Itaque sequitur dicit ergo eis Pilatus: accipite eum vos, et secundum legem vestram iudicate eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But is not this account contradictory to Luke’s, who mentions certain positive charges: And they began to accuse Him, saying, We found this fellow perverting the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Caesar, saying that He Himself is Christ a King. According to John, the Jews seem to have been unwilling to bring actual charges, in order that Pilate might condemn Him simply on their authority, asking no questions, but taking it for granted that if He was delivered up to him, He was certainly guilty. Both accounts are however compatible Each Evangelist only inserts what he thinks sufficient. And John’s account implies that some charges had been made, when it comes to Pilate’s answer: Then said Pilate to them, Take you Him, and judge Him according to your law.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quasi dicat: quoniam ad votum iudicium poscitis, et superbitis, ac si nihil unquam profanum egeritis, accipite vos et damnate; ego nequaquam talis iudex efficiar.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. As if to say, Since you will only have such a trial as will suit you, and are proud, as if you never did any thing profane, take you Him, and condemn Him; I will not be made a judge for such a purpose.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Alcuinus</b>: Vel hoc dicit, quasi dicat: vos qui legem habetis, scitis quid lex de talibus iudicet; secundum quod iustum esse scitis, ita facite. Sequitur dixerunt ergo Iudaei: nobis non licet interficere quemquam.
          <td><b>ALCUIN</b>. Or as if he said, you who have the law, know what the law judges concerning such: do what you know to be just. The Jews therefore said to him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed nonne lex praecepit, ne malefactoribus, praesertim seductoribus adeo qualem istum putabant, parcant? Sed intelligendum est eos dixisse non sibi licere interficere quemquam propter festi diei sanctitatem quam celebrare iam coeperant. Ita ne omnem sensum nimia malitia perdidistis, ut ideo vos a sanguine innocentis impollutos esse credatis, quia eum fundendum alteri traditis?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But did not the law command not to spare malefactors, especially deceivers such as they thought Him? We must understand them however to mean, that the holiness of the day which the’ were beginning to celebrate, made it unlawful to put any man to death. Have you then so lost your understanding by your wickedness, that you think yourselves free from the pollution of innocent blood, because you e deliver it to be shed by another?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Vel ideo ipsi eum non interfecerunt, quia multum de potestate eorum abscissum erat eis Romanis regibus subiacentibus. Vel aliter. Quia dixerat eis secundum legem vestram interficite eum, volentes ostendere quod peccatum eius non est Iudaicum, dicunt non licet nobis: non enim secundum legem nostram peccavit; sed crimen eius est publicum, quia se regem dixit. Vel quia eum crucifigi cupiebant, ut etiam modo mortis eum diffament. Non autem licebat eis crucifigere. Sed quod alio modo interficiebant, monstrat Stephanus ab eis lapidatus; et ideo subditur ut sermo Iesu impleretur quem dixit significans qua morte esset moriturus: quoniam scilicet Iudaeis crucifigere non licebat. Aut dicit hoc Evangelista, quoniam non ab eis solum, sed et a gentibus debebat interfici.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or, they were not allowed by the Roman law to put Him to death themselves. Or, Pilate having said, Judge Him according to your law, they reply, It is not lawful for us: His sin is not a Jewish one, He has not sinned according to our law: His offense is political, He calls Himself a King. Or they wished to have Him crucified, to add infamy to death: they not being allowed to put to death in this way themselves. They put to death in another way, as we see in the stoning of Stephen: That the saying of Jesus might be fulfilled, which He spoke, signifying what death He should die. Which was fulfilled in that He was crucified, or in that He was put to death by Gentiles as well as Jews.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sic enim legimus apud Marcum, ubi ait: ecce ascendimus Ierosolymam, et filius hominis tradetur principibus sacerdotum et Scribis, et tradent eum gentibus. Pilatus autem Romanus erat, eumque in Iudaeam Romani praesidem miserant. Ut ergo iste sermo Iesu impleretur, idest ut eum sibi traditum gentes interficerent, noluerunt eum accipere, dicentes nobis non licet interficere quemquam.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. As we read in Mark, Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be delivered to the chief priests, and to the scribes; and they shall condemn Him to death, and shall deliver Him to the Gentiles. Pilate again was a Roman, and was sent to the government of Judea, from Rome. That this saying of Jesus then might be fulfilled, i.e. that He might be delivered to and killed by the Gentiles, they would not accept Pilate’s offer, but said, If is not lawful for us to put any man to death.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. This is what the good Master wished to teach us. But first it was necessary to show the falsity of the notions of both Jews and Gentiles as to His kingdom, which Pilate had heard of; as if it meant that He aimed at unlawful power; a crime punishable with death, and this kingdom were a subject of jealousy to the ruling power, and to be guarded against as likely to be hostile either to the Romans or Jews. Now if our Lord had answered immediately Pilate’s question, He would have seemed to have been answering not the Jews, but the Gentiles only. But after Pilate’s answer, what He says is an answer to both Gentiles and Jews: as if He said, Men, i.e. Jews and Gentiles, I hinder not your dominion in this world. What more would you have? Come by faith to the kingdom which is not of this world. For what is His kingdom, but they that believe in Him, of whom He says, you are not of the world: although He wished that they should be in the world. In the same way, here He does not say, My kingdom is not in this world; but, is not of this world. Of the world are all men, who created by God are born of the corrupt race of Adam. All that are born again in Christ, are made a kingdom not of this world. Thus hath God taken us out of the power of darkness, and translated us to the kingdom of His dear Son.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel hoc dicit, quoniam non tenet regnum ut hic reges terreni tenent; sed quoniam desuper habet principatum, qui non est humanus, sed multo maior et clarior; unde subdit si ex hoc mundo esset regnum meum, ministri mei utique decertarent ut non traderer Iudaeis. Ostendit hic regni eius quod apud nos est imbecillitatem, quoniam a ministris habet fortitudinem; superius vero regnum sufficiens est sibi ipsi, nullo indigens.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Or He means that He does not derive His kingdom from the same source that earthly kings do; but that He has his sovereignty from above; inasmuch as He is not mere man, but far greater and more glorious than man: If My kingdom were of this world, then would My servants fight, that I should not be delivered to the Jews. Here He shows the weakness of an earthly kingdom, has its strength from its servants, whereas that higher kingdom is sufficient to itself, and wanting in nothing. And if His kingdom was thus the greater of the two, it follows that He was taken of His own will, and delivered up Himself.

          <td><b>AUG</b>, After showing that His kingdom was not of this world, He adds, But now My kingdom is not from here. He does not say, Not here, for His kingdom is here to the end of the world, having within it the tares mixed with the wheat until the harvest. But yet it is not from here, since it is a stranger in the world.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>, Or He says, from here, not, here; because He reigns in the world, and carries on the government of it, and disposes all things according to His will; but His kingdom is not from below, but from above, and before all ages.

Sequitur dicit itaque ei Pilatus: ergo rex es tu? Respondit Iesus: tu dicis quia rex sum ego.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Heretics infer from these words that our Lord is a different person from the Creator of the world. But when He says, My kingdom is not from here, He does not deprive the world of His government and superintendence, but only shows that His government is not human and corruptible. Pilate therefore said to Him, Are you a King then? Jesus answered, you say that I am a King.

Non est producenda huius pronominis syllaba quod ait in hoc natus sum, tamquam dixerit: in hac re natus sum; sed corripienda, tamquam dixerit: ad hoc natus sum; sicut et ait ad hoc veni in mundum.

He did not fear to confess Himself a King, but so replied as neither to deny that He was, nor yet to confess Himself a King in such sense as that His kingdom should be supposed to be of this w world. He says, you say, meaning, you being carnal say it carnally. He continues, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, that 1 should bear witness to the truth. The pronoun here, in hoc, must not be dwelt long on as if it meant, in hâc re, but shortened, as if it stood, ad hoc, natus sum, as the next words are, ad hoc veni in mundum. Wherein it is evident He alludes to His birth in the flesh not to that divine birth which never had beginning.

For this I came, that I should bear witness to the truth, i.e. that I should make all men believe it. We must observe how He shows His humility here: when they accused Him as a malefactor, He bore it in silence; but when He is asked of His kingdom, then He talks with Pilate, instructs him, and raises his mind to higher things. That I should bear witness to the truth shows that He had no crafty purpose in what He did.

Quod vero ait omnis qui est ex veritate, gratiam commendavit, qua secundum propositum vocat. Nam si naturam cogitemus in qua creati sumus, cum omnes veritas creaverit, quis non est ex veritate? Sed non omnes sunt, quibus ut obediant veritati, ex ipsa veritate praestatur.

          <td><b>AUG</b> But when Christ bears witness to the truth, He bears witness to Himself; as He said above, I am the truth. But inasmuch as all men have not faith, He adds, Everyone that is of the truth hears My voice: hears, that is, with the inward ear; obeys My voice, believes Me. Every one that is of the truth, has reference to the grace by which He calls according to His purpose. For as regards the nature in which we are created, since the truth created all, all are of the truth. But it is not all to whom it is given the truth to obey the truth. For had He even said, Everyone one that hears My voice is of the truth, it still would be thought that such were of the truth, because they obeyed the truth But He does not say this, but Everyone that is of the truth hears My voice. A man then is not of the truth, because he hears His voice, but hears His voice because he is of the truth. This grace is conferred upon him by the truth.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. When the Jews had cried out that they did not wish Jesus to be released on account of the passover, but Barabbas, Then Pilate therefore took Jesus, and scourged Him. Pilate seems to have done this for no reason but to satisfy the malice of the Jews with some punishment short of death. On which account he allowed his band to do what follows, or perhaps even commanded them. The Evangelist only says however that the soldiers did so, not that Pilate commanded them: And the soldiers platted a crown of thorns, and put it on His head, and they put on Him a purple robe, and said, Hail, King of the Jews! and they smote Him with their hands.

Et quamvis hoc milites illudendo facerent, nobis tamen operabantur mysteria. Nam per spineam coronam nostrorum designatur peccatorum susceptio, quae sicut spinas terra nostri corporis germinat.

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. For instead of a diadem, they put upon Him a crown of thorns, and a purple robe to represent the purple robe which kings wear. Matthew says, a scarlet robe, but scarlet and purple are different names for the same color. And though the soldiers did this in mockery, yet to us their acts have a meaning. For by the crown of thorns is signified the taking of our sins upon Him, the thorns which the earth of our body brings forth. And the purple robe signifies the flesh crucified. For our Lord is robed in purple, wherever He is glorified by the triumphs of holy martyrs.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Hence it is apparent that these things were not done without Pilate’s knowledge, whether he commanded, or only permitted them, for the reason we have mentioned, viz. that His enemies seeing the insults heaped upon Him, might not thirst any longer for His blood: Then came Jesus forth, wearing the crown of thorns, and the purple robe: not the insignia of empire, but the marks of ridicule.

Non autem ultra interrogat: quid fecisti? Sequitur Iesus autem responsum non dedit ei. Qui enim audivit, quoniam in hoc natus sum et ad hoc veni, et quoniam regnum meum non est hinc, cum debuisset resistere et eripere eum, hoc quidem non fecit, sed secutus est Iudaicum impetum. Propterea ergo nihil ei respondit, quoniam inaniter omnia interrogabat. Sed et aliter operibus testantibus ei, nolebat per sermones vincere, et excusationes componere, ostendens quoniam ad hoc venit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Pilate, agitated with fear, begins again examining Him: And went again into the judgment hall, and says to Jesus, Where are you? He no longer asks, What hast you done? But Jesus gave him no answer. For he who had heard, To this end was I born, and for this cause came I into the world, and, My kingdom is not from here ought to have resisted, and rescued Him, instead of which he had yielded to the fury of the Jews. Wherefore seeing that he asked questions without object, He answers him no more indeed at other times He was unwilling to give reasons and defend Himself by argument, when His works testified so strongly for Him; thus showing that He came voluntarily to His work.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Hoc autem silentium domini nostri Iesu Christi non semel factum, collatis omnium Evangelistarum narrationibus, reperitur: et apud principem sacerdotum, et apud Herodem, et apud ipsum Pilatum, ut non frustra de illo prophetia processerit: sicut agnus coram tondente fuit sine voce, sic non aperuit os suum, tunc utique quando interrogantibus non respondit; quamvis enim quibusdam interrogantibus saepe responderit, tamen propter illa in quibus noluit respondere, ad hoc data est de agno similitudo, ut in suo silentio non reus, sed innocens haberetur; idest, non sicut male sibi conscius, qui de peccatis convincebatur suis, sed sicut mansuetus qui pro peccatis immolabatur alienis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In comparing the accounts of the different Evangelists together, we find that this silence was maintained more than once; viz. before the High Priest, before Herod, and before Pilate. So that the prophecy of Him, As a sheep before her shearers is dumb, so opened He not His mouth was amply fulfilled. To many indeed of the questions put to, He did reply, but where He did not reply, this comparison of the sheep shows us that His was not a silence of guilt, but of innocence; not of self-condemnation, but of compassion, and willingness to suffer for the sins of others.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia igitur siluit, sequitur dicit ergo ei Pilatus: mihi non loqueris? Nescis quia potestatem habeo crucifigere te, et potestatem habeo dimittere te? Vide qualiter seipsum condemnavit. Si enim in te totum positum est, cuius gratia nullam causam inveniens, non absolvis? Quia igitur adversus seipsum protulit, respondit Iesus: non haberes potestatem adversum me ullam, nisi datum esset tibi desuper, ostendens quoniam non simpliciter et secundum aliorum consequentiam hoc fit, sed mystice consummatur. Ne igitur hoc audiens aestimes eum ab omni erutum crimine, subdit propterea qui tradidit me tibi, peccatum maius habet. Et nimirum si datum erat, neque hic neque illi obnoxii sunt criminibus; inaniter dicis. Hoc enim datum est, idest concessum; ac si diceret: permisit hoc fieri; neque tamen propterea extra nequitiam sunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He remaining thus silent, Then says Pilate to Him, Speak you not to me? know you not that I have power to crucify you, and have power to release you? See how he condemns himself. If all depends upon thee, why, when you find no fault of offence, do you not acquit Him? Jesus answered, you could have no power at all against Me, except it were given you from above: strewing that this judgment was accomplished not in the common and natural order of events, but mysteriously. But lest we should think that Pilate was altogether free from blame, He adds, Therefore he that has delivered Me to you has the greater sin. But if it was given, you wilt say, neither he nor they were liable to blame you speak foolishly. Given means permitted; as if He said, He has permitted this to be done; but you are not on that account free from guilt.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Ecce respondit. Proinde ubi non respondebat, non sicut reus, sive dolosus, sed sicut ovis silebat; ubi respondebat, sicut pastor docebat. Discamus ergo quod dixit, quod et per apostolum docuit quia non est potestas nisi a Deo; et quia plus peccat qui potestati innocentem occidendum livore tradit, quam potestas ipsa si eum timore alicuius maioris potestatis occidit. Talem quippe Deus dederat illi potestatem ut esset etiam sub Caesaris potestate: quapropter inquit non haberes adversum me potestatem ullam, idest quantulamcumque habes, nisi hoc ipsum, quidquid est, tibi esset datum desuper. Sed quia scio quantum sit, non enim tantum est ut tibi omni modo liberum sit, propterea qui tradidit me tibi, maius peccatum habet. Ille quippe me tuae potestati tradidit invidendo; tu vero eamdem potestatem in me exerciturus es metuendo. Nec timendo quidem, praesertim innocentem hominem, homo debet occidere; sed id zelando facere multo maius malum est quam timendo; et ideo non ait qui me tibi tradidit, ipse habet peccatum, tamquam ille non haberet; sed ait maius peccatum habet, ut etiam se habere intelligeret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. So He answers. When He was silent, He was silent not as guilty or crafty, but as a sheep: when He answered, He taught as a shepherd. Let us hear what He says; which is that, as He teaches by His Apostle, There is no power but of God; and that he that through envy delivers an innocent person to the higher power, who puts to death from fear of a greater power, still sins more than that higher power itself. God had given such power to Pilate, as that he was still under Caesar’s power: wherefore our Lord says, you could have no power at all against Me, i.e. no power however small, unless it, whatever it was, was given you from above. And as that is not so great as to give you complete liberty of action, therefore he that delivered Me to you has the greater sin. He delivered Me into your power from envy, but you will exercise that power from fear. And though a man ought not to kill another even from fear, especially an innocent man, yet to do so from envy is much worse. Wherefore our Lord does not say, He that delivered Me to you has the sin, as if the other had none, but, has the greater sin, implying that the other also had some.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He that delivered Me to you, i.e. Judas, or the multitude. When Jesus had boldly replied, that unless He gave Himself up, and the Father consented, Pilate could have had no power over Him, Pilate was the more anxious to release Him; And from thenceforth Pilate sought to release Him.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Pilate had sought from the first to release: so we must understand, from thence, to mean from this cause, i.e. lest he should incur guilt by putting to death an innocent person.

Ut intelligamus horam quintam iam fuisse transactam, et aliquid de sexta coeptum, quando sedit pro tribunali Pilatus, quae dicta est a Ioanne hora quasi sexta; et cum duceretur et crucifigeretur, et iuxta eius crucem gererentur quae gesta narrantur, hora sexta integra compleretur: ex qua hora usque ad nonam sole obscurato, tenebras factas, trium Evangelistarum, Matthaei, Marci et Lucae contestatur auctoritas. Sed quoniam Iudaei facinus interfecti Christi a se in Romanos, idest Pilatum et eius milites, transferre conati sunt, propterea Marcus ea hora qua Christus a militibus crucifixus est praetermissa, tertiam potius horam recordatus expressit, ut non tantum milites reperiantur crucifixisse Iesum, verum etiam Iudaei, qui ut crucifigeretur, hora tertia clamaverunt. Est et alia huius solutio quaestionis, ut non hic accipiatur hora sexta diei; quia neque Ioannes ait: erat hora diei quasi sexta; sed ait erat parasceve hora quasi sexta. Parasceve autem Latine praeparatio est Pascha enim nostrum, ut dicit apostolus, immolatus est Christus: cuius Paschae praeparationem si ab hora noctis nona computemus, quando videntur principes sacerdotum pronuntiasse domini immolationem, dicentes: reus est mortis, usque ad horam diei tertiam, qua crucifixum esse Christum Marcus Evangelista testatur, sex horae sunt: tres nocturnae et tres diurnae.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Why then does Mark say, And it was the third hour, and they crucified Him? Because on the third hour our Lord was crucified by the tongues of the Jews, on the sixth by the hands of the soldiers. So that we must understand that the fifth hour was passed, and the sixth began, when Pilate sat down on the judgment seat, (about the sixth hour, John says,) and that the crucifixion, and all that took place in connection with it, filled up the rest of the hour, from which time up to the ninth hour there was darkness, according to Matthew, Mark, and Luke. But since the Jews tried to transfer the guilt of putting Christ to death from themselves to the Romans, i.e. to Pilate and his soldiers, Mark, omitting to mention the hour at which He was crucified by the soldiers, has expressly recorded the third hour; in order that it might be evident that not only the soldiers who crucified Jesus on the sixth hour, but the Jews who cried out for His death at the third, were His crucifiers. There is another way of solving this difficulty, viz. that the sixth hour here does not mean the sixth hour of the day; as John does not say, It was about the sixth hour of the day, but, It was the preparation of the passover, and about the sixth hour. Parasceve means in Latin, praeparatio. For Christ our passover, as says the Apostle, is sacrificed for as. The preparation for which passover, counting from the ninth hour of the night, which seems to have been the hour at which the chief priests pronounced upon our Lord’s sacrifice, saying, He is guilty of death, between it and the third hour of the day, when He was crucified, according to Mark, is an interval of six hours, three of the night and three of the day.

For the love of rule is a heavy crime, and sufficient to condemn a man. They cried out, Away with Him, away with Him.

He tries to shame them into doing what he had not been able to soften them into by putting Christ to shame. The chief priests answered, We have no king but Caesar.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They voluntarily brought themselves under punishment, and God gave them up to it. With one accord they denied the kingdom of God, and God suffered them to fall into their own condemnation; for they rejected the kingdom of Christ, and called down upon their own heads that of Caesar.

Non autem dictum est tradidit eis illum ut crucifigerent illum, sed ut crucifigeretur, scilicet iudicio ac potestate praesidis. Sed ideo illis traditum dixit Evangelista, ut eos crimine implicatos, a quo alieni esse conabantur, ostenderet; non enim faceret hoc Pilatus, nisi ut id quod eos cupere cernebat, impleret.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But Pilate is at last overcome by fear: Then delivered he Him therefore to them to be crucified. For it would be taking part openly against Caesar, if when the Jews declared that they had no king but Caesar, he wished to put another king over them, as he would appear to do if he let go unpunished a Man whom they had delivered to him for punishment on this very ground. It is not however, delivered Him to them to crucify Him, but, to be crucified, i.e. by the sentence and authority of the governor. The Evangelist says, delivered to them, to show that they were implicated in the guilt from which they tried to escape. For Pilate would not have done this except to please them.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Great spectacle, to the profane a laughing-stock, to the pious a mystery. Profaneness sees a King bearing a cross instead of a scepter; piety sees a King bearing a cross, thereon to nail Himself, and afterwards to nail it on the foreheads of kings. That to profane eyes was contemptible, which the hearts of Saints would afterwards glory in; Christ displaying His own cross on His shoulders, and bearing that which was not to be put under a bushel, the candlestick of that candle which was now about to burn.

Ita inanes Diaboli artes factae sunt. Nec solum non obfuit gloriae eius; sed contulit non parum: nam latronem in cruce convertere, et in Paradisum inducere, non minus fuit quam concutere petras.

What they did in wickedness, was a gain to the truth. The devil wished to obscure what was done, but could not. Though three were nailed on the cross, it was evident that Jesus alone did the miracles; and the arts of the devil were frustrated. Nay, they even added to His glory; for to convert a thief on the cross, and bring him into paradise, was no less a miracle than the rending of the rocks.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Yea, even the cross, if you consider it, was a judgment seat: for the Judge being the middle, one thief, who believed, was pardoned, the other, who mocked, was damned: a sign of what He would once do to the quick and dead, place the one on His right hand, the other on His left.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As letters are inscribed on a trophy declaring the victory, so Pilate wrote a title on Christ’s cross. And Pilate wrote a title, and put it on the cross: thus at once distinguishing Christ from the thieves with Him, and exposing the malice of the Jews in rising up against their King: And the writing was, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews.

Immo et gentium; cum enim dixisset: ego autem sum constitutus rex ab eo super Sion montem sanctum eius, subiecit: postula a me, et dabo tibi gentes hereditatem tuam. Magnum ergo volumus intelligi in hoc titulo sacramentum: quia scilicet oleaster factus est particeps pinguedinis oleae, non olea particeps facta est amaritudinis oleastri. Rex ergo Iudaeorum Christus, secundum Iudaeorum circumcisionem, non carnis, sed cordis; non littera, sed spiritu. Sequitur hunc ergo titulum multi legebant Iudaeorum: quia prope civitatem erat locus ubi crucifixus est Iesus.

Of the Gentiles too, as we read in the Psalms, Yet have I set My King upon My holy hill of Sion; after which it follows, Demand of Me, and I will give you the heathen for your inheritance. So this title expresses a great mystery, viz. that the wild olive-tree was made partaker of the fatness of the olive-tree, not the olive-tree made partaker of the bitterness of the wild olive-tree. Christ then is King of the Jews according to the circumcision not of the flesh, but of the heart; not in the letter, but in the spirit. This title then read many of the Jews: for the place where Jesus was crucified was nigh to the city.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is probable that many Gentiles as well as Jews had come up to the feast. So the title was written in three languages, that all might read it: And it was written in Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin.

The Latin denotes the practical, because the Roman empire; was the most powerful, and best managed one; the Greek the physical, the Greeks being the best physical philosophers; and, lastly, the Hebrew the theological, because the Jews had been made the depositories of religious knowledge.

Sed quid loquimini, insani pontifices? Numquid enim propterea non erit verum, quia Iesus ait: rex sum Iudaeorum? Si corrumpi non potest quod Pilatus scripsit, corrumpi potest quod veritas dixit?

But Pilate was firm: Pilate answered, What I have written I have written.

Did not some hidden voice sound from within, and, if we may say so, with clamorous silence, saying to Pilate in the prophetic words of the Psalm, Alter not the inscription of the title? But what say you, you mad priests: will the title be the less true, because Jesus said I am the King of the Jews? If that which Pilate wrote cannot be altered, can that be altered which the Truth spoke? Pilate wrote what he wrote, because our Lord said what He said.

And yet if we fool to their intentions, their clamors, the Jews were rather the people which crucified Him.

It seems then that the other garments were made up of equal parts, as it was not necessary to rend them; the tunic only having to be rent in order to give each an equal share of it; to avoid which they preferred casting lots for it, and one having it all. This answered to the prophecy: That the Scripture might be fulfilled which says, They parted My raiment among them, and for My vesture they did cast lots.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Intuere prophetiae certitudinem: non enim quae partiti sunt solum, sed et quae non partiti sunt, dixit propheta: nam vestimenta quidem diviserunt, sed vestem sorti concesserunt.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Behold the sureness of prophecy. The Prophet foretold not only what they would part, but what they would not. They parted the raiment, but cast lots for the vesture.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Matthaeus dicendo: diviserunt vestimenta eius, sortem mittentes, totam divisionem vestimentorum voluit intelligi, et ad illam tunicam pertinere, de qua sortem miserunt. Tale est quod etiam ait Lucas: dividentes vestimenta eius, miserunt sortes. Dividentes enim venerunt ad tunicam, de qua est sortitio. Dicendo autem sortes, pluralem numerum pro singulari posuit. Marcus autem solus videtur intulisse aliquam quaestionem: dicendo enim: mittentes sortem super eis, quis quid tolleret, tamquam super omnibus vestimentis, non super sola tunica sors missa sit, locutus videatur. Sed haec brevitas obscuritatem facit. Sic enim dictum est: mittentes sortem super eis, ac si diceretur: mittentes sortem cum dividerentur. Cum autem dicit: quis quid tolleret, idest quis tunicam tolleret, tamquam si totum ita diceretur: mittentes sortem super eis, quis tunicam, quae partibus aequalibus superfuerat, tolleret. Quadripartita autem vestis domini nostri Iesu Christi, quadripartitam figuravit eius Ecclesiam, quatuor scilicet partibus in orbe diffusam, et in eisdem aequaliter, idest concorditer, distributam. Tunica vero illa sortita, omnium partium significat unitatem, quae caritatis vinculo continetur. Si autem caritas et supereminentiorem habet viam, et supereminet scientiae, et super omnia praecepta est, secundum illud: super omnia autem haec caritatem habete; merito vestis, qua significatur, desuper contexta perhibetur. Et addidit per totum: quia nemo eius est expers qui pertinere invenitur ad totum, a quo toto Catholica vocatur Ecclesia. Inconsutilis autem, ne aliquando dissuatur; et ad unum provenit, quia in unum omnes colligit. In sorte autem, Dei gratia commendata est: cum enim sors mittitur, non personae cuiusque, vel meritis, sed occulto iudicio Dei ceditur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Matthew in saying, They parted His garments, casting lots, means us to understand the whole division of the garments, including the tunic also for which they cast lots. Luke says the same: They parted His raiment, and cast lots. In parting His garments they came to the tunic, for which they cast lots. Mark is the only one that raises any question: They parted His garments, casting upon them what every man should take: as if they cast lots for all the garments, and not the tunic only. But it is his brevity that creates the difficulty. Casting lots upon them: as if it was, casting lots when they were parting the garments. What every man should take: i.e. who should take the tunic; as if the whole stood thus: Casting lots upon them, who should take the tunic which remained over and above the equal shares, into which the rest of the garments were divided. The fourfold division of our Lord’s garment represents His Church, spread over the four quarters of the globe, and distributed equally, i.e. in concord, to all. The tunic for which they cast lots signifies the unity of all the parts, which is contained in the bond of love. And if love is the more excellent way, above knowledge, and above all other commandments, according to Colossians, Above all things have charity, the garment by which this is denoted, is well said to be woven from above. Through the whole, is added, because no one is void of it, who belongs to that whole, from which the Church Catholic is named. It is without seam again, so that it can never come unsown, and is in one piece, i.e. brings all together into one. By the lot is signified the grace of God: for God elects not with respect to person or merits, but according to His own secrets counsel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel, sicut quidam dicunt, tunica inconsutilis desuper contexta per totum, secundum allegoriam ostendit quoniam non simpliciter homo erat qui crucifixus est, sed et desuper deitatem habebat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. According to some, The tunic without seam, woven from above throughout, is an allegory strewing that He who was crucified was not simply man, but also had Divinity from above.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Vel aliter. Vestis inconsutilis denotat corpus Christi, quod a superiori parte contextum est: spiritus enim sanctus supervenit, et virtus altissimi virgini obumbravit. Hoc ergo sacrosanctum Christi corpus indivisibile constat: nam et si dividatur per singulos, sanctificans uniuscuiusque animam simul et corpus, integre tamen et indivisibiliter consistit in omnibus. At quoniam ex quatuor elementis mundus consistit, intelligenda est per Christi vestimenta visibilis creatura, quam inter se dividunt Daemones, quoties morti tradunt verbum Dei quod habitat in nobis, ac satagunt nos suae partis efficere per mundanas illecebras.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. The garment without seam denotes the body of Christ, which was woven from above; for the Holy Ghost came upon the Virgin, and the power of the Highest overshadowed her. This holy body of Christ then is indivisible: for though it be distributed for every one to partake of, and to sanctify the soul and body of each one individually, yet it subsists in all wholly and indivisibly. The world consisting of four elements, the garments of Christ must be understood to represent the visible creation, which the devils divide amongst themselves, as often as they deliver to death the word of God which dwells in us, and by worldly allurements bring us over to their Side.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Nec ideo ista non aliquid boni significasse quis dixerit, quia per malos facta sunt: quid enim de ipsa cruce dicturi sumus, quae similiter ab impiis facta est? Et tamen ea significari recte intelligitur quod ait apostolus: quae sit latitudo, longitudo, altitudo et profundum. Lata est quippe in transverso ligno, quo extenduntur pendentes manus, et significat opera bona in latitudine caritatis: longa est a transverso ligno usque ad terram, et significat perseverantiam in longitudine temporis: alta est in cacumine, quo transversum lignum sursum versus excedit, et significat supernum finem, quo cuncta opera referuntur: profunda est in ea parte quae in terra figitur; ibi quippe occulta est, sed cuncta eius apparentia inde consurgunt, sicut bona nostra de profunditate gratiae Dei, quae comprehendi non potest, universa procedunt. Sed etsi crux Christi hoc solum significet quod ait apostolus: qui Christi sunt, carnem suam crucifixerunt cum passionibus et concupiscentiis, quam magnum bonum est. Postremo quid est signum Christi nisi crux Christi? Quod signum nisi adhibeatur sive frontibus credentium, sive ipsi aquae, ex qua regenerantur, sive oleo, quo chrismate unguntur, sive sacrificio quo aluntur, nihil eorum vitae proficitur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nor let any one say that these things had no good signification, because they were done by wicked men; for if so, what shall we say of the cross itself; For that was made by ungodly men, and yet certainly by it were signified, What is the length, and depth, and breadth, and height, as the Apostle says. Its breadth consists of a cross beam, on which are stretched the hands of Him who hangs upon it. This signifies the breadth of charity, and the good works done therein. Its length consists of a cross beam going to the ground, and signifies perseverance in length of time. The height is the top which rises above the cross beam, and signifies the high end to which all things refer. The depth is that part which is fixed in the ground; there it is hidden, but the whole cross that we see rises from it. Even so all our good works proceed from the depth of God’s incomprehensible grace. But though the cross of Christ only signify what the Apostle said, They that are Christ’s have crucified the flesh, with the affections and lusts, how great a good is it? Lastly, what is the sign of Christ, but the cross of Christ? Which sign must be applied to the foreheads of believers, to the water of regeneration, to the oil of chrism, to the sacrifice whereby we are nourished, or none of these is profitable for life.

          <td><b>Ambrosius</b>: Maria mater domini ante crucem stabat filii. Nullus me hoc docuit nisi sanctus Ioannes Evangelista. Mundum alii concussum in passione domini conscripserunt, caelum tenebris obductum, refugisse solem, in Paradisum latronem, sed post piam confessionem, receptum. Ioannes docuit quod alii non docuerunt, quemadmodum in cruce positus matrem appellaverit. Pluris putavit quod victor suppliciorum, pietatis officia matri exhibebat, quam quod regnum caeleste donabatur vitae aeternae. Nam si religiosum est quod latroni donatur vita, multo uberioris pietatis est quod a filio mater tanto affectu honoratur: ecce, inquit, filius tuus. Ecce mater tua. Testabatur de cruce Christus, et inter matrem atque discipulum dividebat pietatis officia. Condebat dominus non solum publicum, sed etiam domesticum testamentum. Et hoc eius testamentum signabat Ioannes, dignus tanto testatore testis. Bonum testamentum non pecuniae, sed vitae aeternae, quod non atramento scriptum est, sed spiritu Dei vivi: lingua mea calamus Scribae velociter scribentis. Sed nec Maria minor quam matrem Christi decebat, fugientibus apostolis, ante crucem stabat, et piis spectabat oculis filii vulnera, quia spectabat non in pignoris mortem, sed in mundi salutem; aut fortasse quia cognoverat per filii mortem mundi redemptionem, aula regalis etiam sua morte putabat se aliquid publico addituram muneri; sed Iesus non egebat adiutore ad redemptionem omnium, qui omnes sine adiutore servavit; unde et dicit: factus sum homo sine adiutorio inter mortuos liber. Suscepit quidem affectum parentis, sed non quaesivit alterius auxilium. Hanc imitamini, matres sanctae, quae in unico filio dilectissimo tantum maternae virtutis exemplum dedit: neque enim vos dulciores liberos habetis, neque illud virgo quaerebat solatium, ut alium posset generare filium.
          <td><b>AMBROSE</b>. Mary the mother of our Lord stood before the cross of her Son. None of the Evangelists hath told me this except John. The others have related how that at our Lord’s Passion the earth quaked, the heaven was overspread with darkness, the sun fled, the thief was taken into paradise after confession. John hath told us, what the others have not, how that from the cross whereon He hung, He called to His mother. He thought it a greater thing to show Him victorious over punishment, fulfilling the offices of piety to His mother, than giving the kingdom of heaven and eternal life to the thief. For if it was religious to give life to the thief, a much richer work of piety it is for a son to honor his mother with such affection. Behold, He says, your son; behold your mother. Christ made His Testament from the cross, and divided the offices of piety between the Mother and the disciples. Our Lord made not only a public, but also a domestic Testament. And this His Testament John sealed a witness worthy of such a Testator. A good testament it was, not of money, but of eternal life, which was not written with ink, but with tile spirit of the living God: My tongue is the pen of a ready writer. Mary, as became the mother of our Lord, stood before the cross, when the Apostles fled and With pitiful eyes beheld the wounds of her Son. For she looked not on the death of the Hostage, but on the salvation of the world; end perhaps knowing that her Son’s death would bring this salvation, she who had been the habitation of the King, thought that by her death she might add to that universal gift. But Jesus did not need any help for saving the world, as you read in the Psalm, I have been even as a man with no help, free among the dead. He received indeed the affection of a parent, but He did not seek another’s help. Imitate her, you holy matrons, who, as towards here only most beloved Son, has set you an example of such virtue: for you have not sweeter sons, nor did the Virgin seek consolation in again becoming a mother.

Si autem inde tibi alia atque alia videtur, quod alibi dicatur Maria Iacobi minoris mater, et hic Maria Cleophae, disce Scripturae consuetudinem, eumdem hominem diversis nominibus appellari.
          <td><b>JEROME</b>. The Mary which in Mark and Matthew is called the mother of James and Joses was the wife of Alpheus, and sister of Mary the mother of our Lord: which Mary John here designates of Cleophas, either from her father, or family, or for some other reason. She need not be thought a different person, because she is called in one place Mary the mother of James the less, and here Mary of Cleophas, for it is customary in Scripture to give different names to the same person.

Possumus etiam intelligere quod illae quae simul aderant cum matre domini, postquam eam discipulo commendavit, abire iam coeperant, ut a densitate turbae se eruerent, et cetera quae facta sunt, longius intuerentur; ut ceteri Evangelistae, qui post mortem domini eas commemoraverunt, iam longe stantes commemorarent. Quid autem interest ad veritatem quod quasdam mulieres pariter omnes, quasdam singuli nominaverunt?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If Matthew and Mark had not mentioned by name Mary Magdalene, we should have thought that there were two parties, one of which stood far off, and the other near. But how must we account for the same Mary Magdalene and the other women standing afar off, as Matthew and Mark say, and being near the cross, as John says? By supposing that they were within such a distance as to be within sight of our Lord, and yet sufficiently far off to be out of the way of the crowd and Centurion, and soldiers who were immediately about Him. Or, we e may suppose that after our Lord had commended His mother to the disciple, they retired to be out of the way of the crowd, and saw what took place afterwards at a distance: so that those Evangelists who do not mention them till after our Lord’s death, describe them as standing afar off. That some women are mentioned by all alike, others not, makes no matter.

Our parents indeed, if they actually oppose the truth, are not even to be known: but otherwise we should pay them all attention, and honor them above all the world beside: When Jesus therefore saw His mother, and the disciple standing by, whom he loved, He says to His mother, Woman, behold your son!

For had he wished to boast, he would have added the reason why he was loved, for there must have been something great and wonderful to have caused that love. This is all He says to John; He does not console his grief, for this was a time for giving consolation. Yet was it no small one to be honored with such a charge, to have the mother of our Lord, in her affliction, committed to his care by Himself on His departure: Then says He to the disciple, Behold your mother!

Then, about to act divinely, He repelled the mother of His humanity, of His infirmity, as if He knew her not: now, suffering humanly, He commends with human affection her of whom He was made man. Here is a moral lesson. The good Teacher shows us by His example how that pious sons should take care of their parents. The cross of the sufferer, is the chair of the Master.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Neque enim ex his quae videbant facti sunt mansueti, sed saeviebant magis, et eum potabant, condemnatorum pocula offerentes: propterea enim hyssopus appositus erat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. They were not softened at all by what they saw, but were the more enraged, and gave Him the cup to drink, as they did to criminals, i.e. with a hyssop.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Hyssopum autem, cui circumposuerunt spongiam aceto plenam, quoniam herba est humilis et pectus purgat, Christi humilitatem congruenter accipimus; quam circumdederunt, et se circumvenisse putaverunt: Christi namque humilitate mundamur. Ne moveat quomodo spongiam ori eius potuerunt admovere qui in cruce fuerat exaltatus a terra: sicut enim apud alios Evangelistas legitur, quod hic praetermisit, in arundine factum est, ut in spongia talis potus ad crucis sublimia levaretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The hyssop around which they put the sponge full of vinegar, being a mean herb, taken to purge the breast, represents the humility of Christ, which they hemmed in and thought they had circumvented. For we are made clean by Christ s humility. Nor let it perplex you that they were able to reach His mouth when He was such a height above the ground: for we read in the other Evangelists, what John omits to mention, that the sponge was put upon a reed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Quidam vero hyssopum dicunt vocari arundinem: nam frondes habet arundini consimiles. Sequitur cum ergo accepisset Iesus acetum, dixit: consummatum est.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Some say that the hyssop is put here for reed, its leaves being like a reed. When Jesus therefore had received the vinegar, He said, It is finished.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid nisi quod prophetia tanto ante praedixerat?

          <td><b>BEDE</b>. It may be asked here, why it is said, When Jesus had received the vinegar, when another Evangelists says, He would not drink. But this is easily settled. He did not receive the vinegar, to drink it, but fulfill the prophecy.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Then as there was nothing left Him to do before He died, it follows, And He bowed His head, and gave up the ghost, only dying when He had nothing more to do, like Him who had to lay down His life, and to take it up again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He did not bow His head because He gave up the ghost, but He gave up the ghost because at that moment He bowed His head. Whereby the Evangelist intimates that He was Lord of all.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quis enim ita dormit quando voluerit, sicut Iesus mortuus est quando voluit? Quanta speranda vel timenda potestas est iudicantis, si apparuit tanta morientis?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. For whoever had such power to sleep when he wished, as our Lord had to die when He wished? What power must He have, for our good or evil, Who had such power dying?

Propter hoc prima mulier facta est de viri latere dormientis; et hic secundus Adam inclinato capite in cruce dormivit, ut inde formaretur ei coniux per id quod de latere dormientis effluxit.

That blood was shed for the remission of sins, that water tempers the cup of salvation. This it was which was prefigured when Noah was commanded to make a door in the side of the ark, by which the animals that were not to perish by the deluge entered; which animals prefigured the Church. To shadow forth this, the woman was made out of the side of the sleeping man; for this second Adam bowed His head, and slept on the cross, that out of that which came therefrom, there might be formed a wife for Him.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Nor does John here contradict the other Evangelists, who, though they are silent about Nicodemus, yet do not affirm that our Lord was buried by Joseph alone. Nor because they say that our Lord was wrapped in a linen cloth by Joseph, do they say that other linen cloths may not have been brought by Nicodemus in addition; so that John may be right in saying, not, in a single cloth, but, in linen cloths. Nay more, the napkin which was about His head and the bands which were tied round His body being all of linen, thought there were but one linen cloth, He may yet be said to have been wrapped up in linen cloths: linen cloths being taken in a general sense, as comprehending all that was made of linen.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But as they were pressed for time, for Christ died at the ninth hour, and after that they had gone to Pilate, and taken away the body, so that the evening was now near, they lay Him in the nearest tomb: Now in the place where He was crucified there was a garden; and in the garden a new sepulcher, wherein was never man yet laid.

Mark too the exceeding poverty that He took up for our sakes. He had no house in His lifetime, and now He is laid in another’s sepulcher at His death, and His nakedness covered by Joseph.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The sepulcher was near, that the disciples might approach it more easily, and be better witnesses of what took place there, and that even enemies might be made the witnesses of the burial, being placed there as guards, and the story of His being stolen away showed to be false.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. What Mark says, Very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun, does not contradict John’s words, when it was yet dark. At the dawn of day, there are yet remains of darkness, which disappear as the light breaks in. We must not understand Mark’s words, Very early in the morning, at the rising of the sun, to mean that the sun was above the horizon, but rather what we ourselves ordinarily mean by the phrase, when we want any thing to be done very early, we say at the rising of the sun, i.e. some time before the sun is risen.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord rose while the stone and seal were still on the sepulcher. But as it was necessary that others should be certified of this, the sepulcher is opened after the resurrection, and so the fact confirmed. This it was which roused Mary. For when she saw the stone taken away, she entered not nor looked in, but ran to the disciples with all the speed of love. But as yet she knew nothing for certain about the resurrection, but thought that His body had been carried off.

Neque enim, si quidem eum transtulissent, corpus eius denudassent; neque si furati essent, huius rei fuissent solliciti, ut levarent sudarium et involverent et ponerent in unum locum seorsum a linteaminibus, sed simpliciter ut se habebat suscepissent corpus. Ideo enim Ioannes praemiserat quoniam sepultus est cum myrrha, quae conglutinat corpori linteamina, ut non decipiaris ab his qui dicunt eum furto sublatum esse. Non enim ita insensatus esset qui furaretur, ut circa rem superfluam tantum studium consumeret.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. On coming he sees the linen clothes set aside: And he stooping down, and looking in, saw the linen clothes lying. But he makes no further search: yet went he not in. Peter on the other hand, being of a more fervid temper, pursued the search, and examined every thing: Then comes Simon Peter following him, and went into the sepulcher, and sees the linen clothes lie, and the napkin, that was about His head, not lying with the linen clothes, but wrapped together in a place by itself. Which circumstances were proof of His resurrection. For had they carried Him away, they would not have stripped Him; nor, if any had stolen Him, would they have taken the trouble to wrap up the napkin, and put it in a place by itself, apart from the linen clothes; but would have taken away the body as it was. John mentioned the myrrh first of all, for this reason, i.e. to show you that He could not have been stolen away. For myrrh would make the linen adhere to the body, and so caused trouble to the thieves, and they would never have been so senseless as to have taken this unnecessary pains about the matter. After Peter however, John entered: Then went in also that other disciple, which came first to the sepulcher, and he saw, and believed.

Non ergo eum credidit resurrexisse quem nesciebat oportere resurgere.

He saw the sepulcher empty, and believed what the woman had said: For as yet they knew not the Scripture, that He must rise again from the dead. If he did not yet know that He must rise again from the dead, he could not believe that He had risen. They had heard as much indeed from our Lord, and very openly, but they were so accustomed to hear parables from Him, that they tool; this for a parable, and thought He meant something else.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Haec autem tam subtilis Evangelistae descriptio a mysteriis vacare credenda non est. Per Ioannem iuniorem synagoga, per seniorem vero Petrum Ecclesia gentium designatur: quia etsi ad Dei cultum est prior synagoga quam Ecclesia gentium, ad usum tamen saeculi prior est multitudo gentium quam synagoga. Cucurrerunt autem simul, quia ab ortus sui tempore usque ad occasum pari et communi via, etsi non pari et communi sensu, gentilitas cum synagoga decucurrit. Venit synagoga prior ad monumentum, sed minime intravit: quia legis quidem mandata percepit, prophetias de incarnatione ac passione dominica audivit; sed credere in mortuum noluit; venit autem Simon Petrus, et introivit in monumentum: quia secuta posterior Ecclesia gentium, Christum Iesum et cognovit carne mortuum, et viventem credidit Deum. Sudarium autem capitis domini cum linteaminibus non invenitur: quia caput Christi Deus, et divinitatis incomprehensibilia sacramenta ab infirmitatis nostrae cognitione disiuncta sunt, eiusque potentia creaturae transcendit naturam. Non solum autem separatim, sed involutum inveniri dicitur: quia lintei quo involvitur, nec initium nec finis aspicitur. Celsitudo autem divinitatis nec coepit esse nec desinit. Bene autem additur in unum locum: quia in scissura mentium Deus non est: et illi eius gratiam habere merentur qui se ab invicem per sectarum scandala non dividunt. Sed quia solet per sudarium laborantium sudor detergi, potest et sudarii nomine intelligi labor Dei. Sudarium ergo quod super caput eius fuerat, seorsum invenitur, quia ipsa redemptoris nostri passio longe a nostra passione disiuncta est: quoniam ipse sine culpa pertulit quod nos cum culpa toleramus; ipse sponte morti succumbere voluit, ad quam nos venimus inviti. Postquam autem intravit Petrus, ingressus est et Ioannes: quia in fine mundi ad redemptoris fidem etiam Iudaea colligetur.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But this account of the Evangelist must not be thought to be without some mystical meaning. By John, the y younger of the two, the synagogue; by Peter, the elder, the Gentile Church is represented: for s though the synagogue was before the Gentile Church as regards the w worship of God, as regards time the Gentile world was before the synagogue. They ran together, because the Gentile world ran side by side with the synagogue from first to last, in respect of purity and community of life, though a purity and community of understanding they had not. The synagogue came first to the sepulcher, but entered not: it knew the commandments of the law, and had heard the prophecies of our Lord’s incarnation and death, but would not believe in Him who died. Then comes Simon Peter, and entered into the sepulcher: the Gentile Church both knew Jesus Christ as dead man, and believed in Him as living God. The napkin about our Lord’s head is not found with the linen clothes, i.e. God, the Head of Christ, and the incomprehensible mysteries of the Godhead are removed from our poor knowledge; His power transcends the nature of the creature. And it is found not only apart, but also wrapped together; because of the linen wrapped together, neither beginning nor end is seen; and the height of the Divine nature had neither beginning nor end. And it is into one place: for where there is division, God is not; and they merit His grace, who do not occasion scandal by dividing themselves into sects. But as a napkin is what is used in laboring to wipe the sweat of the brow, by the napkin here we may understand the labor of God: which napkin is found apart, because the suffering of our Redeemer is far removed from ours; inasmuch as He suffered innocently, that which we suffer justly; He submitted Himself to death voluntarily, we by necessity. But after Peter entered, John entered too; for at the end of the world even Judea shall be gathered in to the true faith.

          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. Or thus: Peter is practical and prompt, John contemplative and intelligent, and learned in divine things. Now the contemplative man is generally beforehand in knowledge and intelligence, but the practical by his fervor and activity gets the advance of the other’s perception, and sees first into the divine mystery.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Be not astonished that Mary wept for love at the sepulcher, and Peter did not; for the female sex is naturally tender, and inclined to weep.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The eyes then which had sought our Lord, and found Him not, now wept without interruption; more for grief that our Lord had been removed, than for His death upon the cross. For now even all memorial of Him was taken away.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The sight of the sepulcher itself was some consolation. Nay, behold her, to console herself still more, stooping down, to see the very place where the body lay: And as she wept, she stooped down, and looked into the sepulcher.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Amanti enim semel aspexisse non sufficit, quia vis amoris intentionem multiplicat inquisitionis.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Nimium enim dolebat, nec suis nec discipulorum oculis facile putabat esse credendum: an potius divino instinctu in animo eius effectum est ut prospiceret?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In her too great grief she could believe neither her own eyes, nor the disciples. Or was it a divine impulse which caused her to look in?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Quaesivit enim corpus, et minime invenit; perseveravit ut quaereret: unde et contingit ut inveniret, actumque est ut desideria dilata crescerent, et crescentia caperent quod invenissent. Sancta enim desideria dilatione crescunt; si autem dilatione deficiunt, desideria non fuerunt. Ista itaque, quae sic amat, quae se ad monumentum quod prospexerat, iterum inclinat: videamus quo fructu vis amoris in ea ingeminat opus inquisitionis; sequitur enim et vidit duos Angelos in albis sedentes, unum ad caput, et unum ad pedes, ubi positum fuerat corpus Iesu.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. She sought the body, and found it not; she persevered in seeking; and so it came to pass that she found. Her longings growing the stronger, the more they were disappointed, at last found and laid hold on their object. For holy longings ever gain strength by delay, did they not, they would not be longings. Mary so loved, that not content with seeing the sepulcher, she stooped down and looked in: let us see the fruit which came of this persevering love: And sees two Angels in white sitting, the one at the head, and the other at the feet, where the body of Jesus had lain,
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quia enim non erat excelsa mulieris mens ut ex sudariis perciperet resurrectionem, Angelos videt in laeto habitu, ut et ipsa a passione mitigetur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As her understanding was not so raised as to be able to gather from the napkins the fact of the resurrection, she is given the sight of Angels in bright apparel, who soothe her sorrow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quid est autem quod unus ad caput, et alter ad pedes sedebat? An, quoniam qui Graece Angeli dicuntur, Latine sunt nuntii, isto modo Christi Evangelium, velut a capite usque ad pedes, ab initio usque in finem signabant esse nuntiandum?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But why did one sit at the head, the other at the feet? To signify that the glad tidings of Christ’s Gospel was to be delivered from the head to the feet, from the beginning to the end. The Greek word Angel means one who delivers news.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Vel ad caput sedet Angelus cum per apostolos praedicatur, quia in principio erat verbum; et quasi ad pedes sedet, cum dicitur: verbum caro factum est. Possumus etiam per duos Angelos duo testamenta agnoscere, quae dum pari sensu incarnatum et mortuum ac resurrexisse dominum nuntiant quasi testamentum prius ad caput et testamentum posterius ad pedes sedet.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. The Angel sits at the head when the Apostles preach that in the beginning was the Word: he sits, as it were, at the feet, when it is said, The Word was made flesh. By the two Angels too we may understand the two testaments; both of which proclaim alike the incarnation, death, and resurrection of our Lord. The Old seems to sit at the head, the New at the feet.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Angeli autem apparentes nihil de resurrectione dicunt; sed paulatim in eum qui de resurrectione est intrant sermonem. Quia enim mulier ultra consuetudinem praeclarum habitum viderat, ne turbetur, audivit compassionis vocem; unde sequitur dicunt ei illi: mulier, quid ploras? Angeli lacrymas prohibebant, et futurum quodammodo gaudium nuntiabant: ita enim dixerunt quid ploras? Ac si dicerent: plorare noli.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. The Angels who appear say nothing about the resurrection; but by degrees the subject is entered on. First of all they address her compassionately, to prevent her from being overpowered by a spectacle of such extraordinary brightness: And they say to her, Woman, why weep you? The Angels forbade tears, and announced, as it were, the joy that was at hand: Why weep you? As if to say, Weep not.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Ipsa enim sacra eloquia, quae nos in lacrymas amoris excitant, easdem lacrymas consolantur, dum nobis redemptoris nostri speciem repromittunt.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. The very declarations of Scripture which excite our tears of love, wipe away those very tears, by promising us the sight of our Redeemer again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: At illa eos putans interrogasse nescientes, causas prodit lacrymarum; unde sequitur dicit eis: quia tulerunt dominum meum. Dominum suum vocat domini sui corpus exanime, a toto partem significans; sicut omnes confitemur Iesum Christum filium Dei sepultum, cum sola eius sepulta sit caro. Sequitur et nescio ubi posuerunt. Haec erat causa maioris doloris, quia nesciebat quo iret ad consolandum dolorem.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But she, thinking that they wanted to know why she wept, tells them the reason: She says to them, Because they have taken away my Lord. The lifeless body of her Lord, she calls her Lord, putting the part for the whole; just as we confess that Jesus Christ the Son of God was buried, when only His flesh was buried. And I know not where here they hare placed Him: it was a still greater grief, that she did not know where to go to console her grief.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Nondum autem de resurrectione aliquid noverat, sed adhuc translationem imaginabatur.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As yet she knew nothing of the resurrection, but thought the body had been taken away.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Hic intelligendi sunt surrexisse Angeli, ut etiam stantes viderentur, sicut Lucas eos visos esse commemorat.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Here the Angels must be understood to rise up, for Luke describes them as seen standing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Sed hora iam venerat qua id quod nuntiatum quodammodo fuerat ab Angelis flere prohibentibus, gaudium succederet flentibus; unde sequitur haec cum dixisset, conversa est retrorsum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The hour was now come, which the Angels announced, when sorrow should be succeeded by joy: And when she had thus said, she turned herself back.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Sed quare ad Angelos loquens, et nondum ab eis aliquid audiens, convertitur retrorsum? Mihi videtur quod haec ea dicente, Christus post eam apparuit, et Angeli considerantes dominatorem, et figura et inspectione et motu confestim ostenderunt quoniam dominum viderunt; et hoc est quod mulierem converti retrorsum fecit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But why, when she is talking to the Angels, and before she has heard any thing from them, does she turn back? It seems to me that while she was speaking, Christ appeared behind her, and that the Angels by their posture, look, and motion, showed that they saw our Lord, and that thus it was that she turned back.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Notandum etiam quod Maria, quae adhuc de domini resurrectione dubitabat, conversa retrorsum est ut videret Iesum, quia videlicet per eamdem dubitationem suam quasi tergum in domini faciem miserat, quem resurrexisse minime credebat. Sed quia amabat et dubitabat, videbat et non agnoscebat eum; unde sequitur et vidit Iesum stantem, et non sciebat quia Iesus esset.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. We must observe that Mary, who as yet doubted our Lord’s resurrection, turned back to see Jesus. By her doubting she turned her back, as it were, upon our Lord. Yet inasmuch as she loved, she saw Him. She loved and doubted: she saw, and did not recognize Him: And saw Jesus standing, and knew not that it was Jesus.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Angelis enim ut dominator apparuit, mulieri vero non ita, ne eam ex prima visione stupefaceret: non enim oportebat eam repente ad excelsa reducere, sed paulatim. Sequitur dicit ei Iesus: mulier, quid ploras? Quem quaeris?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. To the Angels He appeared as their Lord but not so to c the woman, for the sight coming upon her all at once, would have stupefied her. She was not to be lifted suddenly, but gradually to high things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Interrogatur doloris causa, ut augeatur desiderium; quatenus cum nominaret quem quaereret, in amorem eius ardentius aestuaret.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Jesus says to her, Woman, why do you weep? He asks the cause of her grief, to set her longing still more. For the mere mentioning His name whom she sought would inflame her love for Him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Et quia in communi figura apparuit, aestimavit eum hortulanum esse; unde sequitur illa aestimans quia hortulanus esset, dicit ei: domine, si tu sustulisti eum, dicito mihi ubi posuisti eum, et ego eum tollam; hoc est: si propter timorem Iudaeorum levasti eum, dicito mihi, et ego eum accipiam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Because He appeared as a common person, she c thought Him the gardener: She, supposing Him to be the gardener, says to Him, Sir, if you have borne Him from here, tell me where you have laid Him, and 1 will take Him away. i.e. If you have taken Him away from fear of the Jews, tell me, and I will take Him again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Theophylactus</b>: Timebat enim ne Iudaei etiam in corpus saevirent exanime; et ideo volebat in alio loco incognito illud transponere.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. She was afraid that the Jews might vent their rage even on the lifeless body, and therefore wished to remove it to some secret place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Forsitan autem nec errando haec mulier erravit, quae Iesum hortulanum credidit. An non ei spiritualiter hortulanus erat, qui in eius pectore per amoris sui vim semina virtutum virentia plantabat? Sed quid est quod viso eo quem hortulanum credidit, cui necdum dixerat quem quaerebat, ait: domine, si tu sustulisti eum? Sed vis amoris hoc agere solet in animo, ut quem ipse semper cogitat, nullum alium credat ignorare. Postquam autem eam dominus communi vocabulo appellavit ex sexu, et agnitus non est, vocat ex nomine; unde sequitur dicit ei Iesus: Maria; ac si dicat: recognosce eum a quo recognosceris. Maria ergo, quia vocatur ex nomine, recognoscit auctorem: quia et ipse erat qui quaerebatur exterius, et ipse qui eam interius, ut quaereret, docebat; unde sequitur conversa illa dicit ei: Rabboni (quod dicitur magister).
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Perhaps, however, the woman was right, in believing Jesus to be the gardener. Was not He the spiritual Gardener, who by the power of His love had sown strong seeds of virtue in her breast? But how is it that, as soon as she sees the gardener, as she supposes Him to be, she says without having told Him who it was she was seeking, Sir, if you have borne Him from here? It arises from her love; when one loves a person, one never thinks that any one else can be ignorant of him. Our Lord, after calling her by the common name of her sex, and not being recognized, calls her by her own name: Jesus says to her, Mary; as if to say, Recognize Him, who recognizes you. Mary, being called by name, recognizes Him; that it was He whom she sought externally, and He who taught her internally to seek. She turned herself, and says to Him, Rabooni; which its to say, Master.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sicut enim Iudaeis quandoque immanifestus erat et praesens; ita et loquens cum volebat, seipsum notum faciebat. Qualiter autem conversam dicit, cum Christus ad eam loqueretur? Mihi videtur quod dicente ea ubi posuisti eum, conversa est ad Angelos, ut interrogaret cur stupefacti essent. Deinde Christus vocans eam, convertit eam ad seipsum, et per vocem manifestum seipsum fecit.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Just as He was sometimes in the midst of the Jews, and they did not know Him till He pleased to make Himself known. But why does she turn herself; when she had turned herself before? It seems to me that when she said, Where you have laid Him, she turned to the Angels, to ask why they were astonished. Then Christ, calling her, discovered Himself by His voice, and made her turn to Him again.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel quia prius conversa corpore, quod non erat putavit, nunc corde conversa quod erat agnovit. Nemo autem calumnietur mulierem, quod hortulanum dixerit dominum, et Iesum magistrum: ibi enim honorabat hominem a quo beneficium postulabat; hic recolebat doctorem, a quo discernere humana et divina discebat. Aliter ergo dominum dixit: sustulerunt dominum meum; aliter autem: domine, si tu sustulisti eum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or she first turned her body, but thought Him what He was not; now she was turned in heart, and knew who He was. Let no one however blame her, because she called the gardener, Lord, and Jesus, Master. The one was a title of courtesy to a person from whom she was asking a favor; the other of respect to a Teacher from whom she was used to learn to distinguish the divine from the human. The word Lord is used in different senses, when she says, They have taken away my Lord, and when she says, Lord, if you have borne Him away.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Iam vero ab Evangelista non subditur quid mulier fecit, sed ex eo innuitur quod audivit; sequitur enim dicit ei Iesus: noli me tangere: in his namque verbis ostenditur, quod Maria amplecti voluit eius vestigia quem recognovit. Sed cur tangi non debeat, ratio quoque additur cum subiungitur nondum enim ascendi ad patrem meum.
          <td><b>GREG</b> The Evangelist does not add what she did upon recognizing Him, but we know from what our Lord said to her: Jesus says to her, Touch Me not. Mary then had tried to embrace His feet, but was not allowed. Why not? The reason follows: For I am not yet ascended to My Father.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Sed si stans in terra non tangitur, sedens in caelo quomodo ab homine tangetur? Qui certe antequam ascenderet, discipulis suis se obtulit tangendum, dicens: palpate, et videte, quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet, ut Lucas testatur. Quis autem tam sit absurdus ut dicat, eum a discipulis quidem, antequam ascendisset ad patrem, se voluisse tangi, a mulieribus autem noluisse, nisi cum ascendisset ad patrem? Sed leguntur etiam feminae post resurrectionem, antequam ad patrem ascenderet, tetigisse Iesum, in quibus erat etiam ipsa Maria Magdalena, narrante Matthaeo. Aut ergo hoc sic dictum est ut in illa femina figuraretur Ecclesia de gentibus, quae in Christum non credidit nisi cum ascendisset ad patrem; aut sic in se credi voluit Iesus, hoc est sic se spiritualiter tangi, quod ipse et pater unum sunt. Eius quippe intimis sensibus quodammodo ascendit ad patrem qui sic in eo profecerit ut patri agnoscat aequalem. Quomodo autem haec non carnaliter adhuc in eum credebat quem sicut hominem fiebat?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. But if standing upon the earth, He is not touched, how shall He be touched sitting in heaven? And did He not before His ascension offer Himself to the touch of the disciples: Handle Me and see, for a spirit has not flesh and bones? Who can be so absurd as to suppose that He was willing that disciples should touch Him before He ascended to His Father, and unwilling that women should till after Nay, we read of women after the resurrection, and before He ascended to His Father, touching Him, one of whom was Mary Magdalene herself, according to Matthew. Either then Mary here is a type of the Gentile Church, which did not believe in Christ till after His ascension: or the meaning is that Jesus is to be believed in, i.e. spiritually touched, in no other way, but as being one with the Father. He ascends to the Father mystically, as it were, in the mind of him who has so far advanced as to acknowledge that He is equal to the Father. But how could Mary believe in Him otherwise than carnally, when she wept for Him as a man?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Tactus autem tamquam finem facit notionis; ideoque nolebat in eo esse finem intenti cordis in se, ut hoc quod videbatur tantummodo putaretur.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Touch is as it were the end of knowledge and He was unwilling that a soul intent upon Him should have its end, in thinking Him only what He seemed to be.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Vel aliter. Volebat haec mulier adhuc cum Christo esse, sicut et ante passionem; et prae gaudio nihil magnum excogitabat; quamvis caro Christi multo melior facta fuerit resurgendo. Ab hac ergo intelligentia eam abducens, dixit noli me tangere, ut cum multa reverentia ei loquatur: unde nec discipulis apparet de reliquo cum eis conversans, ut reverentius ei attendant. Dicens autem nondum enim ascendi, ostendit quoniam illuc properat et festinat. Eum autem qui illuc debet abire, et non ultra cum hominibus conversari, non oportebat cum eadem videre mente qua et ante; et hoc manifestat consequenter dicens vade autem ad fratres meos; et dic eis: ascendo ad patrem meum et patrem vestrum, Deum meum et Deum vestrum.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Mary wished to be as familiar with Christ now, as she was before His Passion; forgetting, in her joy, that His body was made much more holy by its resurrection. So, Touch Me not, He says, to remind her of this, and make her feel awe in talking with Him. For which reason too He no longer keeps company with His disciples, viz. that they might look upon Him with the greater awe. Again, by saying I have not yet ascended, He shows that He is hastening there. And He who was going to depart and live no more with men, ought not to be regarded with the same feeling that He was before: But go to My brethren, and say to them, I ascend to My Father, and you Father; and to My God, and your God.

          <td><b>Hilarius de Trin</b>: Inter ceteras impietates suas etiam hoc dicto domini uti solent haeretici, ut per id quod pater eius pater eorum est, et Deus eius, Deus eorum est, in natura Dei non sit. Sed in forma Dei manens formam servi assumpsit: et cum hoc ad homines in servi forma Christus Iesus loquatur, non ambigitur quin pater sibi ut ceteris sit ex ea parte qua homo est, et Deus sibi ut cunctis sit ex ea natura qua servus est. Denique hunc eumdem sermonem coepit dicens vade ad fratres meos. Fratres autem ex carne sunt Deo; ceterum unigenitus Deus in unigeniti exceptione sine fratribus est.
          <td><b>HILARY</b>. Heretics, among their other impieties, misinterpret these words of our Lord’s, and say, that if His Father is their Father, His God their God, He cannot be God Himself. But though He remained in the form of God, He took upon Him the form of a servant; and Christ says this in the form of a servant to men. And we cannot doubt that in so far as He is man, the Father is His Father in the same sense in which He is of other men, and God His God in like manner. Indeed He begins with saying, Go to My brethren, But God can only have brethren according to the flesh; the Only-Begotten God, being Only-Begotten, is without brethren.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Vel aliter. Non ait: patrem nostrum, sed patrem meum et patrem vestrum. Aliter ergo meum, aliter vestrum; natura meum, gratia vestrum. Neque dixit: Deum nostrum, sed Deum meum, sub quo ego homo, et Deum vestrum, inter quos et ipsum mediator sum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He does not say, Our Father, but, My Father and your Father: Mine therefore and yours in a different sense; Mine by nature, yours by grace. Nor does He say, Our God, but My God - under Him I am man - and your God; between you and Him I am Mediator.

          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Tunc ergo egressa est a monumento, hoc est ab illo loco ubi erat horti spatium ante lapidem effossum, et cum illa aliae quas secundum Marcum invaserat tremor et pavor, et nemini, scilicet aliorum, quidquam dicebant; unde et hic dicitur venit Maria Magdalene annuntians discipulis: quia vidi dominum, et haec dixit mihi.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. She then went away from. the sepulcher, i.e. from that part of the garden before the rock which had been hollowed out, and with her the other women. But these, according to Mark, were seized with trembling and amazement, and said nothing to any man: Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she had seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things to her.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Ecce humani generis culpa ibi absconditur unde processit: quia enim in Paradiso mulier viro propinavit mortem, a sepulchro mulier viris annuntiavit vitam; et dicta sui vivificatoris narrat quae mortiferi serpentis verba narraverat.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. So the sin of mankind is buried in the very place whence it came forth. For whereas in Paradise the woman gave the man the deadly fruit, a woman from the sepulcher announced life to men; a woman delivers the message of Him who raises us from the dead, as a woman had delivered the words of the serpent who slew us.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Dum autem cum aliis veniret, tunc secundum Matthaeum occurrit illis Iesus dicens: avete.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. While she was going with the other women, according to Matthew, Jesus met them, saying, All hail. So we gather that there were two visions of Angels; and that our Lord too was seen twice once when Mary took Him for the gardener, and again, when He met them by the way, and by this repeating His presence confirmed their faith. And so Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples, not alone, but with the other women whom Luke mentions.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Beda</b>: Mystice autem Maria, quae interpretatur domina, illuminata, illuminatrix, seu stella maris, significat Ecclesiam, quae Magdalena, idest turrensis dicitur: nam Magdalon Graece, Latine turris dicitur, propter illud quod dicitur in Psalmo 60, 4: factus est mihi turris fortitudinis. In eo autem quod haec mulier discipulis Christum resurrexisse nuntiavit, omnes monentur, maxime quibus est commissum praedicandi officium, ut si quid ei caelitus revelatum fuit, studiose proximis propinent.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. Mystically, Mary, which name signifies, mistress, enlightened, enlightener, star of the sea, stands for the Church, which is also Magdalene, i.e. towered, (Magdalene being Greek for tower) as we read in the Psalms, you have been a strong tower for me. In that she announced Christ’s resurrection to the disciples, all, especially those to whom the office of preaching is committed are admonished to be zealous in setting forth to others whatever is revealed from above.

The disciples, when they heard what Mary told them, were obliged either to disbelieve, or, if they believed, to grieve that He did not count them worthy to have the sight of Him. He did not let them however pass a whole day in such reflections, but in the midst of their longing trembling desires to see Him, presented Himself to them: Then the same day at evening, being the first day of the week, when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. It is wonderful that they did not think him a phantom. But Mary had provided against this, by the faith she had wrought in them. And He Himself too showed Himself so openly, and strengthened their wavering minds by His voice: And says to them, Peace be to you, i.e. Be not disturbed. Wherein too He reminds them; of what He had said before His crucifixion; My peace 1 give to you; and again, In Me you shall have peace.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. The glory, wherewith the righteous shall shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father, i.e. in Christ’s body, we must believe to have been rather veiled than not to have been there at all.

To the women above there was announced joy; for that sex was in sorrow, and had received the curse, In sorrow shall you bring forth. All hindrances then being removed, and every thing made straight, he adds, As My Father has sent Me, even so send I you

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Having then given them confidence by His own miracles, and appealing to Him who sent Him, He uses a prayer to the Father, but of His own authority gives them power: And when He had said this, He breathed on them, and says to them, Receive you the Holy Ghost.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Trin</b>: Flatus ergo ille corporeus substantia spiritus sancti non fuit, sed demonstratio per congruam significationem non tantum a patre, sed etiam a filio procedere spiritum sanctum.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. That corporeal breath was not the substance of the Holy Ghost, but to show, by meet symbol, that the Holy Ghost proceeded not only from the Father, but the Son.

Sicut ergo una est caritas et duo praecepta; ita unus est spiritus et duo data; prius a consistente domino in terra, postmodum datur ex caelo, quia proximi amore discitur qualiter perveniri debeat ad amorem Dei.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But why is He first given too the disciples on earth, and afterwards sent from heaven? Because there are two commandments of love, to love God, and to love our neighbor. The spirit to love our neighbor is given on earth, the spirit to love God is given from heaven. As then love is one, and there are two commandments; so the Spirit is one, and there are two gifts of the Spirit. And the first is given by our Lord while yet upon earth, the second from heaven, because by the love of our neighbor we learn how to arrive at the love of God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Quidam autem dicunt quoniam non spiritum dedit, sed aptos eos ad susceptionem spiritus per insufflationem construxit.

Nequaquam autem quis peccabit, dicens, tunc suscepisse eos quamdam potestatem spiritualis gratiae non ut mortuos suscitent et miracula faciant, sed ut dimittant peccata; unde sequitur quorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur eis; et quorum retinueritis, retenta sunt eis.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Some say that by breathing He did not give them the Spirit, but made them meet to receive the Spirit. For if Daniel’s senses were so overpowered by the sight of the Angel, how would they have been overwhelmed in receiving that unutterable gift, if He had not first prepared them for it! It would not be wrong however to say that they received then the gift of a certain spiritual power, not to raise the dead and do miracles, but to remit sins: Whosoever sins you remit, they are remitted to them, and whosoever sins you retain, they are retained.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Ecclesiae caritas, quae per spiritum sanctum diffunditur in cordibus nostris, participum suorum peccata dimittit; eorum autem qui non sunt eius participes, tenet; ideo postquam dixit accipite spiritum sanctum, continuo de peccatorum remissione et retentione subiecit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The love of the Church, which is shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Spirit, remits the sins of those who partake of it; but retains the sins of those who do not. Where then He has said, Receive you the Holy Ghost, He instantly makes mention of the remission and retaining of sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Sciendum vero est, quod hi qui prius spiritum sanctum habuerunt, ut et ipsi innocenter viverent, et in praedicatione quibusdam prodessent, idcirco hunc post resurrectionem domini patenter acceperunt, ut prodesse non paucis, sed pluribus possent. Libet ergo intueri, illi discipuli ad tanta onera humilitatis vocati, ad quantum culmen gloriae sint perducti. Ecce non solum de seipsis securi fiunt, sed etiam principatum superni iudicii sortiuntur, ut vice Dei quibusdam peccata retineant, quibusdam vero relaxent. Horum nunc in Ecclesia episcopi locum tenent, et solvendi ac ligandi auctoritatem suscipiunt qui gradum regiminis sortiuntur. Grandis honor, sed grave pondus istius est honoris. Durum quippe est ut qui nescit tenere moderamina vitae suae, iudex fiat vitae alienae.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. We must understand that those who first received the Holy Ghost, for innocence of life in themselves, and preaching to a few others, received it openly after the resurrection, that they might profit not a few only, but many. The disciples who were called to such works of humility, to what a height of glory are they led! Lo, not only have they salvation for themselves, but are admitted to the powers of the supreme Judgment-seat; so that, in the place of God, they retain some men’s sins, and remit others. Their place in the Church, the Bishops now hold; who receive the authority to bind, when they are admitted to the ram; of government. Great the honor, but heavy the burden of the place. It is ill if one who knows not how to govern his own life, shall be judge of another’s.

Et si vita eorum fuerit valde detrectabilis, in nullo laederis in his quae sunt eis commissa a Deo: non enim sacerdos, sed neque Angelus aut Archangelus operari aliquid potest in his quae sunt data a Deo, sed pater et filius et spiritus sanctus omnia dispensant; sacerdos autem suam linguam et manum tribuit: non enim iustum esset, propter alterius malitiam circa symbola nostrae salutis laedi eos qui ad fidem veniunt. Omnibus autem discipulis congregatis, solus Thomas deficiebat a dispersione quae iam facta erat; unde dicitur Thomas autem unus ex duodecim, qui dicitur Didymus, non erat cum eis, quando venit Iesus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. A priest though he may have ordered well his own life, yet, if he have not exercised proper vigilance over others, is sent to hell with the evil doers. Wherefore, knowing the greatness of their danger, pay them all respect, even though they be not men of notable goodness. For they who are in rule, should not be judged by those who are under them. And their incorrectness of life will not at all invalidate what they do by commission from God. For not only cannot a priest, but not even angel or archangel, do any thing of themselves; the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost do all. The priest only furnishes the tongue, and the hand. For it were not just that the salvation of those who come to the Sacraments in faith, should be endangered by another’s wickedness. At the assembly of the disciples all were present but Thomas, who probably had not returned from the dispersion: But Thomas, one of the twelve, called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. It was not an accident that that particular disciple was not present. The Divine mercy ordained that a doubting disciple should, by feeling in his Master the wounds of the flesh heal in us the wounds of unbelief. The unbelief of Thomas is more profitable to our faith, than the belief of the other disciples; for, the touch by which he is brought to believe, confirming our minds in belief, beyond all question.

          <td><b>Beda</b>: Quaeri autem potest quare hic Evangelista tunc Thomam defuisse dicat, cum Lucas scribat quod duo discipuli euntes in Emmaus, reversi in Ierusalem invenerunt undecim congregatos. Sed datur intelligi quoddam fuisse intervallum, quo ad horam Thomas egressus sit, et Iesus veniens in medio eorum stetit.
          <td><b>BEDE</b>. But why does this Evangelist say that Thomas was absent, when Luke writes that two disciples on their return from Emmaus found the eleven assembled? We must understand that Thomas had gone out, and that in the interval of his absence, Jesus came and stood in the midst.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Sicut autem simpliciter et qualitercumque credere, facilitatis est, ita multum investigare est crassissimae mentis: et propter hoc Thomas accusatur: apostolis enim dicentibus, quoniam vidimus dominum, non credidit, non tantum illis discredens, quantum rem putans impossibilem esse; unde sequitur dixerunt ergo ei alii discipuli: vidimus dominum. Ille autem dixit eis: nisi videro in manibus eius fixuram clavorum, et mittam digitum meum in locum clavorum, et mittam manum meam in latus eius, non credam. Aliis enim crassior existens, eam quae est per sensum crassissimum, scilicet tactum, quaerebat fidem, et neque oculis credebat: unde non suffecit ei dicere nisi videro, sed addidit et mittam digitum meum in locum clavorum, et mittam manum meam in latus eius, non credam.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. As to believe directly, and any how, is the mark of too easy a mind, so is too much inquiring of a gross one: and this is Thomas’s fault. For when the Apostle said, We have seen the Lord, he did not believe, not because he discredited them, but from an idea of the impossibility of the thing itself: The other disciples therefore said to him, We have seen the Lord. But he said to them, Except I shall see in His hands the print of the nails, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side, I will not believe. Being the grossest of all, he required the evidence of the grossest sense, viz. the touch, and would not even believe his eyes: for he does not say only, Except I shall see, but adds, and put my finger into the print of the nails, and thrust my hand into His side.

Notwithstanding, because one person, Thomas, would examine Him, Christ allowed him. But He did not appear to him immediately, but waited till the eighth day, in order that the admonition being given in the presence of the disciples, might kindle in him greater desire, and strengthen his faith for the future.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. You ask; If He entered by the shut door, where is the nature of His body? And I reply; If He walked on the sea, where is the weight of His body? The Lord did that as the Lord; and did He, after His resurrection, cease to be the Lord?

          <td><b>Chrysostomus</b>: Stat itaque Iesus et non expectat a Thoma interrogari; sed ut ostendat quoniam cum loquebatur ad condiscipulos, aderat, eisdem verbis usus est. Et primo quidem increpat, vel improperat; unde sequitur deinde dicit Thomae: infer digitum tuum huc, et vide manus meas, et affer manum tuam, et mitte in latus meum. Secundo autem erudit dicens et noli esse incredulus, sed fidelis. Vide quoniam infidelitatis erat ambiguitas, antequam spiritum sanctum acciperent; postea autem non, sed firmi erant de reliquo. Dignum autem est quaerere qualiter corpus incorruptibile typos habebat clavorum. Sed ne tumultueris: condescensionis enim erat ut discerent quoniam ipse erat qui crucifixus fuerat.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b> Jesus then comes Himself, and does not wait till Thomas interrogates Him. But to show that He heard what Thomas said to the disciples, He uses the same words. And first He rebukes him; Then says He to Thomas, Reach hither your finger, and behold My hands; and reach hither your hand, and thrust it into My side: secondly, He admonishes him; And be not faithless, but believing. Note how that before they receive the Holy Ghost faith wavers, but afterward is firm. We may wonder how an incorruptible body could retain the marks of the nails. But it was done in condescension; in order that they might be sure that it was the very person Who was crucified.

Sicut enim demonstravit Thomae non credenti, nisi tangeret et videret, ita etiam inimicis suis vulnera demonstraturus est sua: non quod eis dicat sicut Thomae: quia vidisti, credidisti, sed ut convincens eos veritas dicat: ecce hominem quem crucifixistis; videtis vulnera quae infixistis, agnoscitis latus quod pupugistis, quoniam per vos et propter vos apertum est, nec tamen intrare voluistis.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He might, had He pleased, have wiped all spot and trace of wound from His glorified body; but He had reasons for retaining them. He showed them to Thomas, who would not believe except he saw and touched, and He will show them to His enemies, not to say, as He did to Thomas, Because you have seen, you have believed, but to convict them: Behold the Man whom you crucified, see the wounds which you inflicted, recognize the side which you pierced, that it was by you, and for you, that it was opened, and yet you cannot enter there.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Nec ideo tamen si aliqua martyribus amputata et ablata sunt membra; sine ipsis membris in resurrectione erunt mortuorum, quibus dictum est: capillus capitis vestri non peribit. Sed si hoc decebit in illo novo saeculo, ut indicia gloriosorum vulnerum in illa immortali carne cernantur, ubi membra, ut praeciderentur, percussa vel secta sunt, ibi cicatrices, sed tamen eisdem membris redditis, non perditis, apparebunt. Quamvis igitur omnia quae acciderant corpori vitia, tunc non erunt, non sunt tamen appellanda vitia, sed virtutis indicia.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. We are, as I know not how, afflicted with such love for the blessed martyrs, that we would wish in that kingdom to see on their bodies the marks of those wounds which they have borne for Christ’s sake. And perhaps we shall see them; for they will not have deformity, but dignity, and, though on the body, shine forth not with bodily, but with spiritual beauty. Nor yet, if any of the limbs of martyrs have been cut off, shall they therefore appear without them in the resurrection of the dead; for it is said, There shall not an hair of your head perish. But if it be fit that in that new world, the traces of glorious wounds should still be preserved on the immortal flesh, in the places where the limbs were cut off there, though those same limbs withal be not lost but restored, shall the wounds appear. For though all the blemishes of the body shall then be no more, yet the evidences of virtue are not to be called blemishes.

Nam et corrumpi necesse est quod palpatur, et palpari non potest quod non corrumpitur. Et incorruptibilem se ergo et palpabilem demonstravit, ut profecto post resurrectionem esse ostenderetur corpus suum et eiusdem naturae et alterius gloriae.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Our Lord gave that flesh to be touched which He had introduced through shut doors: wherein two wonderful, and, according to human reason, contradictory things appear, viz. that after the resurrection He had a body incorruptible, and yet palpable. For that which is palpable must be corruptible, and that which is incorruptible must be impalpable. But He showed Himself incorruptible and yet palpable, to prove that His body after His resurrection was the same in nature as before, but different in glory.

          <td><b>GREG</b>. Our body also in that resurrection to glory will be subtle by means of the action of the Spirit, but palpable by its true nature, not, as Eutychius says, impalpable, and subtler than the winds and the air.

Sequitur dicit ei Iesus: quia vidisti me, credidisti.
          <td><b>THEOPHYL</b>. He who had been before unbelieving, after touching the body showed himself the best divine; for he asserted the twofold nature and one Person of Christ; by saying, My Lord, the human nature by saying, My God, the divine, and by joining them both, confessed that one and the same Person was Lord and God. Jesus says to him, Because you have seen Me, you have believed.

Unde et hic dominus dicit infer digitum tuum huc, et vide manus meas. Quid aliud ait quam tange et vide? Nec tamen ille oculos habebat in digito. Ergo sive intuendo, sive etiam tangendo, hoc ait: quia vidisti me, credidisti. Quamvis dici possit non ausum fuisse discipulum tangere, cum se offerret ille tangendum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. He says not, has touched me, but, has seen me; the sight being a kind of general sense, and put in the place often of the other four senses; as when we say, Hear, and see how well it sounds; smell, and see how sweet it smells; taste, and see how well it tastes, touch, and see how warm it is. Wherefore also our Lord says, Reach hither your finger, and behold My hands. What is this but, Touch and see? And yet he had not eyes in his finger. He refers them both to seeing and to touching, when He says, Because you have seen, you have believed. Although it might be said, that the disciple did not dare to touch, what was offered to be touched.

          <td><b>Gregorius in Evang</b>: Sed cum apostolus dicat: fides est substantia sperandarum rerum, argumentum non apparentium, profecto liquet quia quae apparent, iam fidem non habent, sed agnitionem. Dum ergo vidit Thomas, dum palpavit, cur ei dicitur quia vidisti me, credidisti? Sed aliud vidit, aliud credidit: hominem vidit et Deum confessus est. Laetificat autem valde quod sequitur: beati qui non viderunt et crediderunt: in qua sententia nos specialiter significati sumus, qui eum quem carne non vidimus, mente retinemus; si tamen fidem nostram operibus sequimur, ille enim vere credit qui exercet operando quod credit.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. But when the Apostle says, Faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen, it is plain that things which are seen, are objects not of faith, but of knowledge. Why then is it said to Thomas who saw and touched, Because you have seen Me, you have believed? Because he saw one thing, believed another; saw the man, confessed the God. But what follows is very gladdening; Blessed are they that have not seen, and yet have believed. In which sentence we are specially included, who have not seen Him with the eye, but retain Him in the mind, provided we only develop our faith in good works. For he only really believes, who practices what he believes.

Sed nec alii omnia dixerunt, sed quae erant sufficientia attrahere ad fidem audientes. Mihi autem videtur hic dicere ea quae post resurrectionem sunt signa; et ideo dicit in conspectu discipulorum suorum, cum quibus solis post resurrectionem conversatus est. Deinde ut discas quoniam non solum discipulorum gratia signa fiebant, induxit haec autem scripta sunt, ut credatis quia Iesus est Christus filius Dei: communiter ad humanam naturam loquens. Et ut ostendat quoniam non illi cui creditur, sed nobisipsis utile est credere, subdit et ut credentes vitam habeatis in nomine eius, idest per Iesum; ipse autem est vita.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. John having related less than the other Evangelists, adds, And many other signs truly did Jesus in the presence of His disciples, which are not written in this book. Yet neither did the others relate all, but only what was sufficient for the purpose of convincing men. He probably here refers to the miracles which our Lord did after His resurrection, and therefore says, In the presence of His disciples, and they being the only persons with whom He conversed after His resurrection Then to let you understand, that the miracles were not done for the sake of the disciples only, He adds, But these are written, that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; addressing Himself to mankind generally. And, this belief, he then profits ourselves, not Him in Whom we believe. And that believing you might have life through His name, i.e. through Jesus, which is life.

Nunc vero post eum sibi de sepulchro redditum vivum, post inspecta vulnerum loca, post acceptum eius insufflatione spiritum sanctum, subito fiunt sicut fuerant, non hominum, sed piscium piscatores. Respondendum est ergo, non eos fuisse prohibitos ex arte sua licita victum necessarium quaerere, sui apostolatus integritate servata, si quando unde viverent aliud non haberent. Si enim beatus Paulus ea potestate, quam profecto cum ceteris Evangelii praedicatoribus habebat, non cum ceteris uteretur, sed stipendio suo militaret, ne gentes a nomine Christi penitus alienas, doctrina eius quasi venalis offenderet, aliter educatus, artem quam non noverat didicit, ut dum suis manibus transigitur doctor, nullus gravaretur auditor, quanto magis beatus Petrus, qui iam piscator fuerat, quod noverat fecit, si ad praesens illud tempus, aliud unde viveret non invenit. Sed respondebit quispiam: et cur non invenit, cum dominus promiserit dicens: quaerite primum regnum Dei et iustitiam eius, et haec omnia apponentur vobis? Prorsus etiam dominus quod promisit implevit: nam quis alius pisces qui caperentur apposuit, qui non ob aliud credendus est eis ingessisse penuriam, qua cogerentur ire piscatum, nisi dispositum volens exhibere miraculum?
          <td><b>AUG</b>. If the disciples had done this after the death of Jesus, and before His resurrection, we should have imagined that they did it in despair. But now after that He has risen from the grave, after seeing the marks of His wounds, after receiving, by means of His breathing, the Holy Ghost, all at once they become what they were before, fishers, not of men, but of fishes. We must remember then that they were not forbidden by their Apostleship from earning their livelihood by a lawful craft, provided they had no other means of living. For if the blessed Paul used not that power which he had with the rest of the preachers of the Gospel, as they did, but went a warfare upon his own resources, lest the Gentiles, who were aliens from the name of Christ, might be offended at a doctrine apparently venal; if, educated in another way, he learnt a craft he never knew before, that, while the teacher worked with his own hands, the hearer might not be burdened much more might Peter, who had been a fisherman, work at what he knew, if he had nothing else to live upon at the time. But how had he not, some one will ask, when our Lord promises, Seek you first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you? Our Lord, we answer, fulfilled this promise, by bringing them the fishes to catch: for who else brought them? He did not bring upon them that poverty which obliged them to go fishing, except in order to exhibit a miracle.

They answered, No. He then gives them a sign to know Him by: And He said to them, Cast the net on the right side of the ship, and you shall find. They cast therefore, and now they were not able to draw it for the multitude of fishes. The recognition of Him brings out Peter and John in their different tempers of mind; the one fervid, the other sublime; the one ready, the other penetrating. John is the first to recognize our Lord: Therefore that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, It is the Lord; Peter is the first to come to Him: Now when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he girt his fisher’s coat to Him, for he was naked.

In alia piscatione non mittuntur retia in dexteram, ne solos significent bonos; nec in sinistram, ne solos malos; sed indifferenter: laxate, inquit, retia vestra in capturam, ut permixtos intelligamus bonos et malos; hic autem mittite, inquit, in dexteram navigii rete, ut significaret eos qui stabant ad dexteram solos bonos. Illud fecit initio praedicationis suae, hoc post resurrectionem suam: hinc ostendens illam capturam piscium bonos et malos significare, quos nunc habet Ecclesia; istam vero tantummodo bonos, quos habebit in aeternum, completa in fine huius saeculi resurrectione mortuorum. Illi autem qui pertinent ad resurrectionem vitae, idest ad dexteram, et inter Christiani nominis retia defiguntur, nonnisi in littore, idest in fine saeculi, cum resurrexerint apparebunt; ideo non valuerunt sic trahere retia ut in navem refunderent quos ceperant pisces, sicut de aliis factum est. Habet autem istos dexteros Ecclesia post finem vitae huius in somno pacis velut in profundo latentes, donec ad littus rete perveniat. Quod autem in prima piscatione duabus naviculis, hoc isto loco ducentis cubitis, tamquam centum et centum, existimo figuratum, propter utriusque generis electos, et circumcisionis et praeputii.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The shore is the end of the sea, and therefore signifies the end of the world. The Church is here typified as she will be at the end of the world, just as other draughts of fishes typified her as she is now. Jesus before did not stand on the shore, but went into a ship which was Simon’s, and asked him to put out a little from the land. In a former draught the nets are not thrown to the light, or to the left, so that the good or the bad should be typified alone, but indifferently: Let down your nets for a draught, meaning that the good and bad were mixed together. But here it is, Cast the net on the right side of the ship; to signify those who should stand on the right hand, the good. The one our Lord did at the beginning of His ministry, the other after His resurrection, strewing therein that the former draught of fishes signified the mixture of bad and good, which composes the Church at present; the latter the good alone, which it will contain in eternity, when the world is ended, and the resurrection of the dead completed. But they who belong to the resurrection of life, i.e. to the right hand, and are caught within the net of the Christian name, shall only appear on the shore, i.e. at the end of the world, after the resurrection: wherefore they were not able to draw the net into the ship, and unload the fishes, as they were before. The Church keeps these of the right hand, after death, in the sleep of peace, as it were in the deep, till the net come to shore. That the first draught was taken in two little ships, the last two hundred cubits from land, a hundred and a hundred, typifies, I think, the two classes of elect, circumcised and uncircumcised.

This he did by word of mouth, by epistles; this he does daily by signs and miracles. After saying that the net was full of great fishes, the number follows: Full of great fishes, one hundred and fifty and three.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: In alia piscatione numerus piscium non exprimitur, tamquam illud ibi fiat quod praedictum est per prophetam: annuntiavi, et locutus sum; multiplicati sunt super numerum; hic vero certus est numerus, cuius reddenda est ratio. Numerus enim qui legem significat decem est propter Decalogum. Cum autem accedit ad legem gratiae, idest ad litteram spiritus, quodammodo denario numero additur septenarius, septenario quippe numero significatur spiritus sanctus, ad quem sanctificatio proprie pertinet. Primum enim in lege sonuit sanctificatio in die septima. Isaias etiam propheta eum commendat opere, vel munere septenario. Cum itaque legis denario spiritus sanctus per septenarium numerum accedit, fiunt decem et septem, qui numerus ab uno usque ad seipsum, computatis omnibus crescens ad centum quinquaginta tres pervenit.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. In the draught before, the number of the fishes is not mentioned, as if in fulfillment of the prophecy in the Psalm, If I should declare them, and speak of them, they should be more than l am able to express, but here there is a certain number mentioned, which we must explain. The number which signifies the law is ten, from the ten Commandments. But when to the law is joined grace, to the letter spirit, the number seven is brought in, that being the number which represents the Holy Spirit, to Whom sanctification properly belongs. For sanctification was first heard of in the law, with respect to the seventh day; and Isaiah praises the Holy Spirit for His sevenfold work and office. The seven of the Spirit added to the ten of the law make seventeen, and the numbers from one up to seventeen when added together, make a hundred and fifty-three.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Gregorius</b>: Ducamus etiam per trigonum decem et septem, veniunt quinquaginta unum. In quinquagesimo autem anno cunctus populus ab omni operatione quiescebat. Sed vera requies in unitate est: ubi enim scissura divisionis est, vera requies non est.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. Seven and ten multiplied by three make fifty-one. The fiftieth year was a year of rest to the whole people from all their work. In unity is true rest; for where division is, true rest cannot be.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Non ergo tantummodo centum quinquaginta tres sancti ad vitam resurrecturi significantur aeternam, sed omnes ad gratiam spiritus pertinentes hoc numero figurantur: qui etiam numerus ter habet quinquagenarium numerum, et insuper ipsa tria propter mysterium Trinitatis. Quinquagenarius autem multiplicatis septem per septem, et unius adiectione completur. Unus autem additur, ut eos significet esse unum. Non autem frustra dictum est quod erant magni. Cum enim dixisset dominus: non veni solvere legem, sed implere, daturus spiritum, utique per quem lex posset impleri, paucis verbis interpositis ait: qui fecerit et docuerit, magnus vocabitur in regno caelorum. In prima autem piscatione rete propter significanda schismata rumpebatur; hic vero, quoniam in illa summa pace sanctorum nulla erunt schismata, pertinuit ad Evangelistam consequenter dicere et cum tanti essent, idest tam magni, non est scissum rete, tamquam illud respiceret ubi scissum est, et in illius mali comparatione commendaret hoc bonum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. It is not then signified that only a hundred and fifty-three saints are to rise again to eternal life, but this number represents all who partake of the grace of the Holy Spirit. which number too contains three fifties, and three over, with reference to the mystery of the Trinity. And the number fifty is made up of seven sevens, and one in addition, signifying that those sevens are one. That they were great fishes too, is not without meaning. For when our Lord says, I came not to destroy the law, but to fulfill, by giving, that is, the Holy Spirit through Whom the law can be fulfilled, He says almost immediately after, Whosoever shall do and teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of hearer. In the first draught the net was broken, to signify schisms; but here to show that in that perfect peace of the blessed there would be no schisms, the Evangelist continues: And for all they were so great, yet was not the net broken; as if alluding to the case before, in which it was broken, and making a favorable comparison.

Sequitur et nemo audebat discumbentium interrogare eum: tu quis es? Scientes quia dominus est; ac si diceretur:
          <td><b>AUG</b>. The bodies of the just, when they rise again, shall need neither the word of life that they die not of disease, or old age, nor any bodily nourishment to prevent hunger and thirst. For they shall be endowed with a sure and inviolable gift of immortality, that they shall not eat of necessity, but only be able to eat if they will. Not the power, but the need of eating and drinking shall be taken away from them; in like manner as our Savior after His resurrection took meat and drink with His disciples, with spiritual but still real flesh, not for the sake of nourishment, but in exercise of a power. And none of His disciples dare ask Him, who are you? knowing that it was the Lord.

          <td><b>Augustinus in Ioannem</b>: Nemo audebat dubitare quod ipse esset: tanta enim erat evidentia veritatis ut eorum non solum negare, sed nec dubitare quidem ullus auderet: quoniam si quisquam dubitaret, utique interrogaret.

Sed formido in hoc quod sciebant quod dominus est, detinebat interrogationem; et solum comedebant quae eis dabat cum priori potestate. Hic autem non respicit in caelum, neque humana illa facit, ostendens quoniam condescensionis gratia fiebant; unde subditur et venit Iesus, et accepit panem, et dabat eis: et pisces similiter.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He means that they had not confidence to talk to Him, as before, but sat looking at Him in silence and awe, absorbed in regarding His altered and now supernatural form, and unwilling to ask any question. Knowing that it was the Lord, they were in fear, and only ate what, in exercise of His great power, He had created. He again does not look up to heaven, or do anything after a human sort, thus strewing that His former acts of that kind were done only in condescension: Jesus then comes, and takes bread, and gives them, and fish likewise.

          <td><b>AUG</b>. Mystically, the fried fish is Christ Who suffered. And He is the bread that came down from heaven. To Him the Church is united to His body for participation of eternal bliss. Wherefore He says, Bring of the fishes which you have now caught; to signify that all of us who have this hope, and are in that septenary number of disciples, which represents the universal Church here, partake of this great sacrament, and are admitted to this bliss.

Illi ergo ultimo convivio de praesentia veritatis epulantur qui nunc perfectionis studio terreno transcendunt.
          <td><b>GREG</b>. By holding this last feast with seven disciples, he declares that they only who are full of the sevenfold grace of the Holy Spirit, shall be with Him in the eternal feast. Time also is reckoned by periods of seven days, and perfection is often designated by the number seven. They therefore feast upon the presence of the Truth in that last banquet, who now strive for perfection.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Inasmuch, however, as He did not converse with them regularly, or in the same way as before, the Evangelist adds, This is now the third time that Jesus showed Himself to His disciples, after that He was risen from the dead.

          <td><b>Augustinus</b>: Quod non ad ipsas demonstrationes, sed ad dies referre debemus; idest, primo die cum resurrexisset, et post octo, quando Thomas vidit et credidit, et hoc die quando hoc de piscibus fecit, et deinde quoties voluit, usque ad diem quadragesimum quo ascendit in caelum.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Which has reference not to manifestations, but to days; i.e. the first day after He had risen, eight days after that, when Thomas saw and believed, and this day at the draught of fishes; and thenceforward as often as He sew them, up to the time of His ascension.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><b>Augustinus de Cons. Evang</b>: Invenimus autem apud quatuor Evangelistas decies commemoratum dominum visum esse post resurrectionem.

Peter denied, because he feared to die: but when our Lord was risen from the dead, and by His death destroyed death, what should he fear? He says to Him, Yea, Lord; you know that 1 love You. On this confession of his love, our Lord commends His sheep to him: He says to him, Feed My lambs. as if there were no way of Peter’s showing his love for Him, but by being a faithful shepherd, under the chief Shepherd.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. That which most of all attracts the Divine love is care and love for our neighbor. Our Lord passing by the rest, addresses this command to Peter: he being the chief of the Apostles, the mouth of the disciples, and head of the college. Our Lord remembers no more his sin in denying Him, or brings that as a charge against him, but commits to him at once the superintendence over his brethren. If you love Me, have rule over your brethren, show forth that love which you have evidenced throughout, and that life which you said you would lay down for Me, lay down for the sheep. He says to him again the second time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you Me? He says to Him, Yea, Lord; you know that I love You.

He says to him the third time, Simon, son of Jonas, love you Me? A third time our Lord asks Peter whether he loves Him.

They who feed Christ’s sheep, as if they were their own, not Christ’s, show plainly that they love themselves, not Christ; that they are moved by lust of glory, power, gain, not by the love of obeying, ministering, pleasing God. Let us love therefore, not ourselves, but Him, and in feeding His sheep, seek not our own, but the things which are His. For whoso loves himself, not God, loves not himself: man that cannot live of himself, must die by loving himself; and he cannot love himself, who loves himself to his own destruction. Whereas when He by Whom we live is loved, we love ourselves the more, because we do not love ourselves; because we do not love ourselves in order that we may love Him by Whom we live.

Meminit prioris vitae, quia in saecularibus iuvenis quidem utilis est, qui vero senuerit, inutilis. In divinis autem non ita est; sed cum supervenerit senectus, tunc virtus clarior, tunc virilitas industrior, in nullo ab aetate prohibita. Quia ergo Petrus semper volebat in periculis esse cum Christo, dicit ei: confide: ita implebo tuum desiderium, ut quae passus non es iuvenis existens, oporteat te pati senem; unde sequitur cum autem senueris: per quod ostenditur quod neque tunc iuvenis erat neque senex, sed vir perfectus.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. Our Lord having made Peter declare his love, informs him of his future martyrdom; an intimation to us how we should love: Verily, verily, I say to you, When you were young, you girded yourself, and walked where you would. He reminds him of his former life, because, whereas in worldly matters a young man has powers, an old man none; in spiritual things, on the contrary, virtue is brighter, manliness stronger, in old age; age is no hindrance to grace. Peter had all along desired to share Christ’s dangers; so Christ tells him, Be of good cheer; I will fulfill your desire in such a way, that what you has not suffered when young, you shall suffer when old: But when you are old. Whence it appears, that he was then neither a young nor an old man, but in the prime of life.

Solutus quippe a corpore esse volebat cum Christo: sed si fieri posset, praeter mortis molestiam vitam concupiscebat aeternam; ad quam molestiam nolens venit sed volens eam vicit, et reliquit hunc infirmitatis affectum, quo nemo vult mori, usque adeo naturalem ut eum beato Petro nec senectus auferre potuerit. Sed molestia quantacumque sit mortis, debet eam vincere vis amoris quo amatur ille qui, cum sit vita nostra, etiam mortem voluit ferre pro nobis. Nam si nulla esset mortis, vel parva molestia, non esset tam magna martyrii gloria.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. That is, shall be crucified. And to come to this end, Another shall gird you, and carry you where you would not. First He said what would come to pass, secondly, how it would come to pass. For it was not when crucified, but when about to be crucified, that he was led where he would not. He wished to be released from the body, and be with Christ; but, if it were possible, he wished to attain to eternal life without the pains of death; to which he went against his will, but conquered by the force of his will, and triumphing over the human feeling, so natural a one, that even old age could not deprive Peter of it. But whatever be the pain of death, it ought to be conquered by the strength of love for Him, Who being our life, voluntarily also underwent death for us. For if there is no pain in death, or very little, the glory of martyrdom would not be great.

Non dixit: moriturus esset, ut discas quoniam pati pro Christo, gloria est patientis et honor. Nisi autem certificaretur animus quia verus Deus est, minime eius intuitu mortem toleraret: quo fit ut sanctorum mors divinae sit gloriae certitudo.
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. He says, Where you would not, with reference to the natural reluctance of the soul to be separated from the body; an instinct implanted by God to prevent men putting an end to themselves. Then raising the subject, the Evangelist says, This spoke He, signifying by what death he should glorify God: not, should die: he expresses himself so, to intimate that to suffer for Christ was the glory of the sufferer. But unless the mind is persuaded that He is very God, the sight of Him can in no way enable us to endure death. Wherefore the death of the saints is certainty of divine glory.

Sed cur eius discipulo quem prae ceteris diligebat, pro magno munere longum in corpore donaverit somnum, cum beatum Petrum per ingentem martyrii gloriam ab onere corporis absolverit, eique concesserit quod Paulus se concupiscere dixit: cupio dissolvi, et esse cum Christo? Si autem vere ibi fit quod semper sparsit fama, aut ideo fit ut eo modo commendetur pretiosa eius mors, quoniam non eam commendat martyrium, aut propter aliquid aliud quod nos latet. Manet tamen quaestio cur dixerit dominus de homine morituro sic eum volo manere donec veniam. Illud etiam movet ad quaerendum, cur Ioannem plus dilexerit dominus, cum ipsum dominum plus dilexerit Petrus. Quantum ipse sapio, meliorem qui plus diligit Christum, feliciorem vero quem plus diligit Christus, facile responderem, si iustitiam liberatoris nostri, quemadmodum defenderem providerem. Aggrediar igitur de solvenda quaestione tam ingenti. Duas vitas sibi divinitus praedicatas novit Ecclesia: quarum una est in fide, altera in specie. Ista significata est per apostolum Petrum propter apostolatus sui primatum, illa per Ioannem; ideo huic dicitur sequere me, per imitationem scilicet perferendi temporalia mala; de illo vero dicitur sic eum volo manere donec veniam; quasi dicat: tu me sequere per imitationem perferendi temporalia mala; ille maneat donec sempiterna venio redditurus bona; quod apertius dici potest: perfecta me sequatur actio informata meae passionis exemplo; inchoata vero contemplatio maneat donec venio, perficienda cum venero: quod non sic intelligendum est, quasi dixerit remanere vel permanere, sed expectare: quoniam quod per eum significatur, cum venerit Christus implebitur. In hac autem activa vita quanto magis Christum diligimus, tanto facilius liberamur a malo; at ipse nos minus diligit quales nos sumus, et hinc ideo liberat, ne semper tales simus; ibi vero amplius nos diligit, quoniam quod ei displiceat et quod a nobis auferat non habebimus. Amet ergo eum Petrus, ut ab ista mortalitate liberemur; ametur ab eo Ioannes, ut in illa immortalitate servemur. Cur ergo Ioannes minus eum diligebat quam Petrus, si eam vitam significabat in qua est multo amplius diligendus, nisi quia propterea dictum est volo eum manere, idest expectare, donec veniam; quando et ipsum amorem qui tunc multo amplior erit, nondum habemus, sed expectamus futurum, ut dum ipse venerit, habeamus. Hoc ergo per Petrum significatum est plus amantem, sed minus amatum, quia minus nos amat Christus miseros quam beatos: veritatis autem contemplationem qualis tunc futura est, minus amamus, quia nunc nondum novimus nec habemus. Nemo tamen istos insignes apostolos separet: et in eo quod significabat Petrus ambo erant, et in eo quod significabat Ioannes ambo futuri erant.
          <td><b>AUG</b>. Or perhaps he will allow that John still lies in his sepulcher at Ephesus, but asleep, not dead; and will give us a proof, that the soil over his grave is moist and watery, owing to his respiration. But why should our Lord grant it as a great privilege to the disciple whom He loved, that he should sleep this long time in the body, when he released Peter from the burden of the flesh by a glorious martyrdom, and gave him what Paul had longed for, when he said, I have a desire to depart and be with Christ? If there really takes place at John’s grave that which report says, it is either done to commend his precious death, since that had not martyrdom to commend it, or for some other cause not known to us. Yet the question remains, Why did our Lord say of one who was about to die, I will that he tarry till I come? It may be asked too why our Lord loved John the most, when Peter loved our Lord the most? I might easily reply, that the one who loved Christ the more, was the better man, and the one whom Christ loved the more, the more blessed; only this would not be a defense of our Lord’s justice. This important question then I will endeavor to answer. The Church acknowledges two modes of life, as divinely revealed, that by faith, and that by sight. The one is represented by the Apostle Peter, in respect of the primacy of his Apostleship; the other by John: wherefore to the one it is said, Follow Me, i.e. imitate Me in enduring temporal sufferings; of the other it is said, I will that he tarry till I come: as if to say, Do you follow Me, by the endurance of temporal sufferings, let him remain till I come to give everlasting bliss; or to open out the meaning more, Let action be perfected by following the example of My Passion, but let contemplation wait inchoate till at My coming it be completed: wait, not simply remain, continue, but wait for its completion at Christ’s coming. Now in this life of action it is true, the more we love Christ, the more we are freed from sin; but He does not love us as we are, He frees us from sin, that we may not always remain as we are, but He loves us heretofore rather, because hereafter we shall not have that which displeases Him, and which He frees us from. So then let Peter love Him, that we may be freed from this mortality; let John be loved by Him, that we may be preserved in that immortality. John loved less than Peter, because, as he represented that life in which we are much more loved, our Lord said, I will that he remain (i.e. wait) till I come; seeing that that greater love we have not yet, but wait till we have it at His coming. And this intermediate state is represented by Peter who loves, but is loved less, for Christ loves us in our misery less than in our blessedness: and we again love the contemplation of truth such as it will be then, less in our present state, because as yet we neither know nor have it. But let none separate those illustrious Apostles; that which Peter represented, and that which John represented, both were sometime to be.

          <td><b>Chrysostomus in Ioannem</b>: Si vero dixerit quis: qualiter igitur Iacobus thronum assumpsit Hierosolymorum? Illud utique dicam, quoniam Petrus orbis terrarum inthronizavit magistrum. Sequitur conversus Petrus vidit illum discipulum quem diligebat Iesus, sequentem, qui et recubuit in coena super pectus eius. Non sine causa recolit illam accubationem, sed ut ostendat quantam Petrus habebat fiduciam post negationem. Qui enim in coena non audebat interrogare, sed Ioanni interrogationem commisit, huic et praepositura fratrum credita est, et non solum non committit alteri interrogare quae ad ipsum pertinent, sed de reliquo ipse pro aliis magistrum interrogat. Quia igitur magna ei praedixerat dominus, et orbem terrarum commiserat, et martyrium praenuntiaverat, et amorem protestatus est ampliorem; volens et Ioannem communicatorem accipere dixit hic autem quid? Quasi diceret: nonne eadem nobiscum veniet via? Valde enim Ioannem amabat Petrus; et per Evangelium ostenditur eorum colligatio, et in actibus apostolorum. Sic igitur nunc vicem reddit Petrus Ioanni. Aestimans autem eum velle interrogare de seipso, nec audere, ipse pro eo suscipit interrogationem. Quia vero debebant orbis terrarum procurationem accipere, nec oportebat eos de reliquo sibi invicem esse coniunctos, quod esset damnum orbi terrarum, propterea dominus dicit secundum litteram Graecam: si eum volo manere donec veniam, quid ad te? Tu me sequere; quasi dicat: opus tibi commissum attende et perfice, hunc vero si voluero manere hic, quid ad te?
          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. But if it be asked, How then did James assume the see of Jerusalem? I answer, that our Lord enthroned Peter, not as Bishop of this see, but as Doctor of the whole world: Then Peter, turning about, sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following, which also leaned on his breast at supper. It is not without meaning that that circumstance of leaning on His breast is mentioned, but to show what confidence Peter had after his denial. For he who at the supper dared not ask himself, but gave his question to John to put, has the superintendence over his brethren committed to him, and whereas before he gave a question which concerned himself to another to put, he now asks questions himself of his Master concerning others. Our Lord then having foretold such great things of him, and committed the world to him, and prophesied his martyrdom, and made known his greater love, Peter wishing to have John admitted to a share of this calling, says, And what shall this man do? as if to say, Will he not go the same way with us? For Peter had great love for John, as appears from the Gospels and Acts of the Apostles, which give many proofs of their close friendship. So Peter does John the same turn, that John had done him; thinking that he wanted to ask about himself, but was afraid, he puts the question for him. However, inasmuch as they were now going to have the care of the world committed to them, and could not remain together without injury to their charge, our Lord says, If I will that he tarry till I come, what is that to you? as if to say, Attend to the work committed to thee, and do it: if I will that he abide here, what is that to you?

Consuetudo enim est, cum valde vera dicamus, nostrum testimonium non denegare, et multo magis ille qui spiritu sancto scribebat: unde et alii apostoli dicebant: nos sumus testes horum. Sequitur et scripsit haec; quod ipse solus dicit, quia posterior ad scribendum venit Christo monente; unde et frequenter ostendit Christi ad se amorem, occulte insinuans causam ex qua ad scribendum processit, et fide dignum faciens hunc sermonem ex sua dignitate. Sequitur et scimus quia verum est testimonium eius. Omnibus enim aderat, et neque cum crucifigeretur defuit et mater ei commissa est; quae sunt signa amoris, et quod cum certitudine sciat omnia. Et si aliqui non credant, inducantur ad credendum ex hoc quod subditur: sunt autem et alia multa quae fecit Iesus. Unde manifestum est quod nequaquam scripsi ut Christo gratiam praestarem, cum tot existentibus non tot scripserim quot ceteri; sed horum plura reliqui, contumelias et convicia in medium proponens.

          <td><b>CHRYS</b>. John appeals to his own knowledge of these events, having been witness of them: This is the disciple which testifies of these things. When we assert any undoubted fact in common life, we do not withhold our testimony: much less would he, who wrote by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost. And thus the other Apostles, And we are witnesses of these things, and wrote these things. John is only one who appeals to his own testimony; and he does so, because he was the last who wrote. And for this reason he often mentions Christ’s love for him, i.e. to show the motive which led him to write, and to give weight to his history. And we know that his testimony is true. He was present at every event, even at the crucifixion, when our Lord committed His mother to him; circumstances which both show Christ’s love, and his own importance as a witness. But if any believe not, let him consider what follows: And there are also many other things which Jesus did. If, when there were so many things to relate, I have not said so much as the other, and have selected often reproaches and contumelies in preference to other things, it is evident that I have not written partially. One who wants to show another off to advantage does the very contrary, omits the dishonorable parts.
