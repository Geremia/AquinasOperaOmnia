              When the objects of an inquiry, in any department, have
              principles, conditions, or elements, it is through acquaintance
              with these that knowledge, that is to say scientific knowledge, is
              attained. For we do not think that we know a thing until we are
              acquainted with its primary conditions or first principles, and
              have carried our analysis as far as its simplest elements. Plainly
              therefore in the science of Nature, as in other branches of study,
              our first task will be to try to determine what relates to its
              principles.

              The natural way of doing this is to start from the things which
              are more knowable and obvious to us and proceed towards those
              which are clearer and more knowable by nature; for the same things
              are not 'knowable relatively to us' and 'knowable' without
              qualification. So in the present inquiry we must follow this
              method and advance from what is more obscure by nature, but
              clearer to us, towards what is more clear and more knowable by
              nature. Now what is to us plain and obvious at first is rather
              confused masses, the elements and principles of which become known
              to us later by analysis. Thus we must advance from generalities to
              particulars;

            2. It must be understood, therefore, that there are some things
            whose existence depends upon matter, and which cannot be defined
            without matter. Further there are other things which, even though
            they cannot exist except in sensible matter, have no sensible matter
            in their definitions. And these differ from each other as the curved
            differs from the snub. For the snub exists in sensible matter, and
            it is necessary that sensible matter fall in its definition, for the
            snub is a curved nose. And the same is true of all natural things,
            such as man and stone. But sensible matter does not fall in the
            definition of the curved, even though the curved cannot exist except
            in sensible matter. And this is true of all the mathematicals, such
            as numbers, magnitudes and figures. Then, there are still other
            things which do not depend upon matter either according to their
            existence or according to their definitions. And this is either
            because they never exist in matter, such as God and the other
            separated substances, or because they do not universally exist in
            matter, such as substance, potency and act, and being itself.

            3. Now metaphysics deals with things of this latter sort. Whereas
            mathematics deals with those things which depend upon sensible
            matter for their existence but not for their definitions. And
            natural science, which is called physics, deals with those things
            which depend upon matter not only for their existence, but also for
            their definition.

            And because everything which has matter is mobile, it follows that
            mobile being is the subject of natural philosophy. For natural
            philosophy is about natural things, and natural things are those
            whose principle is nature. But nature is a principle of motion and
            rest in that in which it is. Therefore natural science deals with
            those things which have in them a principle of motion.

            instance of that which is common. Therefore it was necessary that
            one book in natural science be set forth in which those things which
            are consequent upon mobile being in common are treated; just as
            first philosophy, in which those things which are common to being
            insofar as it is being, is set forth for all the sciences.

            When, however, he speaks of principles or causes or elements, he
            does not intend to signify the same thing by each. For cause is
            wider in meaning than element. An element is a first component of a
            thing and is in it [i.e., in the composed], as is said in
            <i>Metaphysics</i>, V:3. Thus the letters, but not the syllables,
            are the elements of speech. But those things are called causes upon
            which things depend for their existence or their coming to be.
            Whence even that which is outside the thing, or that which is in it,
            though the thing is not first composed of it, can be called a cause.
            But it cannot be called an element. And thirdly principle implies a
            certain order in any progression. Whence something can be a
            principle which is not a cause, as that from which motion begins is
            a principle of motion, but is not a cause, and a point is a
            principle of a line but not a cause.

            He then proves from common opinion the first proposition of his
            argument. This is also proven in the
            <i>Posterior Analytics</i>
            I:2. For a man thinks that he knows something when he knows all its
            causes from the first to the last. The meaning here of causes,
            principles, and elements is exactly the same as we have explained
            above, even though the Commentator disagrees. Furthermore Aristotle
            says, ‘...as far as its simplest elements’ (184 a 14), because that
            which is last in knowledge is matter. For matter is for the sake of
            form, and form is from the agent for the sake of the end, unless it
            itself is the end. For example, we say that a saw has teeth in order
            to cut, and these teeth ought to be made of iron so they will be apt
            for cutting.

            complete science in act when it arrives, through resolution, at a

            distinct when each of the things which are contained in potency in

            9. Next, where he says, ‘... for it is a whole...’ (184 a 25), he
            clarifies his position with three examples. The first of these is
            taken from the integral sensible whole. He says that since the
            sensible whole is better known to the sense, then, the intelligible
            whole is also better known to the intellect. But the universal is a
            sort of intelligible whole, because it comprehends many as parts,
            namely, its inferiors. Therefore the universal is better known to us
            intellectually.

            apprehends a genus does not apprehend the species distinctly, but in
            potency only, so also he who apprehends a house does not yet
            distinguish its parts. Whence it is that a whole is first known to
            us as confused. This applies to both of these wholes. However, to be
            composed is not common to each whole. Whence it is clear that

            quae est prioris et posterioris; aliam secundum positionem, scilicet

            Those who held that there was an infinite plurality of principles
            had a diversity of opinions. For Democritus held that indivisible
            bodies which are called atoms are the principles of all things. And
            he held that bodies of this sort were all of one genus according to
            nature, but that they differed according to figure and form, and
            that they not only differed but even had contrariety among
            themselves. For he held three contrarieties: one according to
            figure, which is between the curved and the straight, another
            according to order, which is the prior and the posterior, and
            another according to position, namely, before and behind, above and
            below, to the right and to the left. And so he held that from these
            bodies existing of one nature different things come to be according
            to the diversity of the figure, position and order of the atoms. In
            this opinion, then, he gives us some basis for understanding the
            opposing opinion, namely that of Anaxagoras who held that the
            principles were infinite, but not of one genus according to nature.
            For he held that the principles of nature were the infinite,
            smallest parts of flesh and bone and other such things, as will be
            made clear below.

            nature of a principle is taken away. For every principle is either a
            principle of some thing or of some things. Therefore, if we posit a
            principle, a multiplicity follows, because one is the principle and
            the other is that of which it is the principle. Whoever, therefore,
            denies multiplicity removes principles. Therefore natural science
            ought not to argue against this position.

            He says, therefore, that to undertake a thorough consideration of
            the question whether being is one, and hence immobile, is like
            arguing against any other improbable position. For example, it is
            like arguing against the position of Heraclitus, who said that all
            things are always moved and that nothing is true; or against the
            position of one who would say that the whole of being is one man,
            which position, indeed, would be altogether improbable. And indeed
            whoever holds being to be only one immobile thing is forced to hold
            that the whole of being is some one thing. It is clear, therefore,
            that it does not belong to natural science to argue against this
            position.

            First he proves his position by pointing out that it is not
            incumbent upon any science to resolve sophistic arguments which have
            an obvious defect of form or matter. He says that to deal with
            improbable arguments is like solving a contentious or sophistic
            argument. But each argument of both Melissus and Parmenides is
            sophistic, for they err in matter, whence he says that they have
            accepted what is false, i.e., they assume false propositions, and
            they err in form, whence he says that they are not syllogizing. But
            the position of Melissus is much worse, i.e., more vain and foolish
            and does not cause any difficulty. This will be shown below [L 5].
            Moreover, it is not inconsistent that given one inconsistency
            another should follow. Therefore it can be concluded that it is not
            required of the philosopher of nature that he resolve the arguments
            of this man.

            18. He sets forth the second argument for this where he says, ‘We

            science it is supposed that natural things are moved, either all or
            some of them. He says this because there is doubt whether some
            things are moved and how they are moved, for example, about the soul
            and the centre of the earth, and the pole of heaven, and about
            natural forms and other such things. But the fact that natural
            things are moved can be made clear from induction, for it is
            apparent to the sense that natural things are moved.

            Having established this point, that motion is supposed in natural
            science, he proceeds further to prove his position as follows. Not
            all arguments must be resolved in any science, but only those which
            conclude to something false from the principles of that science. Any
            arguments which do not reach their conclusions from the principles
            of the science, but from the contraries of these principles, are not
            resolved in that science. He proves this by an example taken from
            geometry saying that it pertains to geometry to resolve the problem
            of squaring, i.e., the squaring of a circle by dissecting the
            circumference, because this method supposes nothing contrary to the
            principles of the science of geometry. For somebody wished to find a
            square equal to a circle by dividing the circumference of the circle
            into many parts and placing straight lines in each part. And so by
            finding some figure, which was rectilinear, equal to some of the
            figures which were contained by the dissections of the circumference
            and the cords (either many or all), he thought he had found a
            rectilinear figure equal to the whole circle, to which it was easy
            to find an equal square through the principles of geometry. And thus
            he thought that he was able to find a square equal to a circle. But
            he did not argue well enough, for although these dissections used up
            the whole circumference of the circle, the figures contained by the
            dissections of the circumference and the straight lines did not
            encompass the whole circular surface.

            But to resolve the square of Antiphon does not pertain to geometry,
            because he used principles contrary to those of geometry. For he
            described in a circle a certain rectilinear figure, for example, a
            square. And he divided in half the arcs by which the sides of the
            square were subtended. And from the points of dissection he led
            straight lines to all the angles of the square. And then there
            resulted in the circle a figure of eight angles, which more closely
            approached equality with the circle than the square. Then he again
            divided in half the arcs by which the sides of the octagon were
            subtended, and thus by leading straight lines from the points of
            dissection to the angles of this figure there resulted a figure of
            sixteen angles, which still further approached equality with the
            circle. Therefore, by always dividing the arcs and leading straight
            lines to the angles of the figure already existing there will arise
            a figure very near to equality with the circle. He said, then, that
            it was impossible to proceed to infinity in the dissection of arcs.
            Therefore, it was necessary to arrive at some rectilinear figure
            equal to the circle to which some square could be equal.

              The most pertinent question with which to begin will be this: In
              what sense is it asserted that all things are one? For 'is' is
              used in many senses. Do they mean that all things 'are' substance
              or quantities or qualities? And, further, are all things one
              substance—one man, one horse, or one soul—or quality and that one
              and the same—white or hot or something of the kind? These are all
              very different doctrines and all impossible to maintain. or if
              both substance and quantity and quality are, then, whether these
              exist independently of each other or not, Being will be many. If
              on the other hand it is asserted that all things are quality or
              quantity, then, whether substance exists or not, an absurdity
              results, if the impossible can properly be called absurd. For none
              of the others can exist independently: substance alone is
              independent: for everything is predicated of substance as subject.
              Now Melissus says that Being is infinite. It is then a quantity.
              For the infinite is in the category of quantity, whereas substance
              or quality or affection cannot be infinite except through a
              concomitant attribute, that is, if at the same time they are also
              quantities. For to define the infinite you must use quantity in
              your formula, but not substance or quality. If then Being is both
              substance and quantity, it is two, not one: if only substance, it
              is not infinite and has no magnitude; for to have that it will
              have to be a quantity.

              Again, 'one' itself, no less than 'being', is used in many senses,
              so we must consider in what sense the word is used when it is said
              that the All is one. Now we say that (a) the continuous is one or
              that (b) the indivisible is one, or (c) things are said to be
              'one', when their essence is one and the same, as 'liquor' and
              'drink'. If (a) their One is one in the sense of continuous, it is
              many, for the continuous is divisible ad infinitum. There is,
              indeed, a difficulty about part and whole, perhaps not relevant to
              the present argument, yet deserving consideration on its own
              account—namely, whether the part and the whole are one or more
              than one, and how they can be one or many, and, if they are more
              than one, in what sense they are more than one. (Similarly with
              the parts of wholes which are not continuous.) Further, if each of
              the two parts is indivisibly one with the whole, the difficulty
              arises that they will be indivisibly one with each other also.

            principle in arguing against the aforesaid position is the fact that
            that which is, i.e., being, is said in many ways. For we must ask of

            they take it for substance, or for quality, or for one of the other
            genera. And because substance is divided into the universal and the
            particular, i.e., into first and second substance, and further into
            many species, we must ask the following questions. Do they say that
            being is one as one man or as one horse, or as one soul, or as one
            quality, such as white or hot or some other such thing? For it makes

            quantity is an accident. And this is contrary to the position of
            Melissus. For he held that being was infinite, whence it follows
            that it is quantity, because the infinite, properly speaking, does
            not exist except in quantity. And substance and quality and the like
            are not said to be infinite except accidentally insofar as they are,
            for instance, together with quantity. Since, then, Melissus held
            being to be infinite, he cannot hold that it is substance without
            quantity. If, therefore, being is substance and quantity together,
            it follows that being is not one only, but two. If, however, it is

            each other. And thus it would follow that both parts, if they are
            held simply to be the same as the whole, would be identical with
            each other. Hence it would follow that the whole would be
            indivisible having no diversity of parts.

            that it is impossible for all to be one as the indivisible is one.
            For that which is indivisible cannot be a quantity, since every
            quantity is divisible. As a result of this it cannot be a quality,
            if it is understood that we are speaking of a quality which is
            founded upon quantity. And if it is not a quantity, it cannot be
            finite as Parmenides has said, nor can it be infinite as Melissus
            has said. For an indivisible terminus, such as a point, is an end
            and is not finite. For the finite and the infinite are found in

            The second absurdity is that the definitions [

            all beings would not only be one being, as they hold, but also they
            would be non-being or nothing. For things which are one in
            definition are so related that they may be used interchangeably as
            predicates. Whence if being and nothing are one according to

            Parmenides and Melissus erred because they did not know how to
            distinguish the uses of the term ‘one’. Thus, what is one in a
            certain respect, they said was one simply. But the later
            philosophers, also not knowing how to distinguish the uses of the
            term ‘one’, thought it absurd that one and the same thing should be
            in some way one and many. Yet, being convinced by the arguments,
            they were forced to believe it. And so Aristotle says that the later
            philosophers were ‘disturbed’ (that is, fell into a difficulty
            similar to that of the ancients, i.e., Parmenides and Melissus) lest
            they be forced to say that one and the same thing is one and many.
            Now this seemed absurd to both groups of philosophers. So the
            earlier philosophers, holding that all is one, rejected all
            multiplicity. The later philosophers, on the other hand, tried to
            remove multiplicity from anything they held to be one.

            He shows in two ways that this does not follow. First it does not
            follow in regard to local motion. For a part of water could be moved
            with in water so that it is not moved to any extrinsic place. In
            this case it would be moved by a joining and separation of the
            parts. And likewise, if the whole infinite body were water, it would
            be possible for the parts of it to be moved within the whole and not
            proceed outside the place of the whole. Again he disproves this with
            reference to the motion of alteration. For nothing prevents the
            infinite from being altered either as a whole or in its parts, for
            it would not be necessary to posit something outside the infinite to
            account for this.

            35. Fourthly, where he says, ‘But further...’ (186 a 19), he
            disproves the given argument with reference to its fourth inference
            by which it is concluded that, if being is infinite, it is one. For
            it does not follow that it is one according to species, but rather
            that it is one according to matter, just as some of the philosophers
            of nature have held that all things are one according to matter, but
            not according to species. For it is obvious that man and horse
            differ in species, and in like manner contraries differ from each
            other in species.

              His conclusion does not follow, because if we take only white
              things, and if 'white' has a single meaning, none the less what is
              white will be many and not one. For what is white will not be one
              either in the sense that it is continuous or in the sense that it
              must be defined in only one way. 'Whiteness' will be different
              from 'what has whiteness'. Nor does this mean that there is
              anything that can exist separately, over and above what is white.
              For 'whiteness' and 'that which is white' differ in definition,
              not in the sense that they are things which can exist apart from
              each other. But Parmenides had not come in sight of this
              distinction.

              It is necessary for him, then, to assume not only that 'being' has
              the same meaning, of whatever it is predicated, but further that
              it means (1) what just is and (2) what is just one. It must be so,
              for (1) an attribute is predicated of some subject, so that the
              subject to which 'being' is attributed will not be, as it is
              something different from 'being'. Something, therefore, which is
              not will be. Hence 'substance' will not be a predicate of anything
              else. For the subject cannot be a being, unless 'being' means
              several things, in such a way that each is something. But ex

              If, then, 'substance' is not attributed to anything, but other
              things are attributed to it, how does 'substance' mean what is
              rather than what is not? For suppose that 'substance' is also
              'white'. Since the definition of the latter is different (for
              being cannot even be attributed to white, as nothing is which is
              not 'substance'), it follows that 'white' is not-being—and that
              not in the sense of a particular not-being, but in the sense that
              it is not at all. Hence 'substance' is not; for it is true to say
              that it is white, which we found to mean not-being. If to avoid
              this we say that even 'white' means substance, it follows that

              (2) Substance is plainly divisible into other substances, if we
              consider the mere nature of a definition. For instance, if 'man'
              is a substance, 'animal' and 'biped' must also be substances. For
              if not substances, they must be attributes—and if attributes,
              attributes either of (a) man or of (b) some other subject. But
              neither is possible. (a) An attribute is either that which may or
              may not belong to the subject or that in whose definition the
              subject of which it is an attribute is involved. Thus 'sitting' is
              an example of a separable attribute, while 'snubness' contains the
              definition of 'nose', to which we attribute snubness. Further, the
              definition of the whole is not contained in the definitions of the
              contents or elements of the definitory formula; that of 'man' for
              instance in 'biped', or that of 'white man' in 'white'. If then
              this is so, and if 'biped' is supposed to be an attribute of
              'man', it must be either separable, so that 'man' might possibly
              not be 'biped', or the definition of 'man' must come into the
              definition of 'biped'—which is impossible, as the converse is the
              case. (b) If, on the other hand, we suppose that 'biped' and
              'animal' are attributes not of man but of something else, and are
              not each of them a substance, then 'man' too will be an attribute
              of something else. But we must assume that substance is not the
              attribute of anything, that the subject of which both 'biped' and
              'animal' and each separately are predicated is the subject also of
              the complex 'biped animal'. Are we then to say that the All is
              composed of indivisible substances?

            But what is non-being is nothing. Therefore whatever is other than
            being is nothing. But being is one, therefore whatever is other than
            one is nothing. Therefore there is only one being. And from this he
            concluded that it would be immobile, because it would not have
            anything by which it would be moved, nor would there be anything
            outside of it by which it would be moved.

            argument of Melissus. For as the argument of Melissus was answered
            on the basis that he assumed false propositions and did not draw his
            conclusions according to the correct form of the syllogism, so also
            the argument of Parmenides is answered partly because he assumed
            false propositions and partly because he did not draw his
            conclusions correctly.

            was false and improbable, for example, that being is not generated.
            Because of this, Aristotle did not argue against Melissus from the

            that the form of argumentation used is not efficacious in every
            matter. And this could not be true if a proper form of argumentation
            were used. For if we take ‘white’ in the place of ‘being’, and if we
            say that ‘white’ signifies one thing only and is not used
            equivocally, and if we say that whatever is other than white is
            non-white, and whatever is non-white is nothing, then it will not
            follow that white would be one only. For it will not be necessary
            that all white things are one continuum. Or, to put it differently,
            white will not necessarily be one by continuity, i.e., from the fact
            that white is a continuum, it will not be one simply. For a
            continuum is in a certain respect many, as was said above [L3 #22].

            42. He says, therefore, first that when it is said that ‘whatever is
            other than being is non-being’, if ‘being’ is said to signify one
            thing, then it will be necessary that it signify not some one being
            or what is predicated of some one thing. Rather it will signify what
            truly is, i.e., substance, and it will signify what is truly one,
            i.e., the indivisible. For if being were to signify accident, then,
            since accident would be predicated of a subject, the subject could
            not be that to which the accident, which is called being, occurs.
            For if whatever is other than being is non-being (i.e., other than
            accident), and if the subject is other than the accident, which is
            here said to be being, then it follows that the subject is nonbeing.
            And so when accident, which is being, is predicated of the subject
            which is non-being, it follows that being is predicated of
            non-being. Hence, Aristotle concludes, ‘Something, therefore, which
            is not win be’ (186 b 1), that is, it will follow that non-being is
            being. This, however, is impossible.. For what is first of all
            assumed in the sciences is that contradictories are not to be
            predicated of each other, as is said in
            <i>Metaphysics</i>, IV:7. Whence he concludes that if anything is
            truly being, as is supposed in the proposition ‘whatever is other
            than being is nonbeing’, it follows that it is not an accident
            inhering in something else. For in this case its subject would not
            be a being. That is, this subject would not have the nature [
            <i>ratio</i>
            ] of being, unless being should signify many, so that each of the
            many would be a being. But it was assumed by Parmenides that being
            signifies one only.

            happen to it, then in the proposition ‘whatever is other than being

            But this cannot stand. For let it be held that that which truly is,
            i.e., substance, is white. But white is not that which truly is. For
            it has already been said that that which truly is cannot happen to
            something. And this is so because what is not truly, i.e., what is
            not substance, is not that which is, i.e., is not being. But what is
            other than being, i.e., other than substance, is non-being. Hence it
            follows that white is non-being, not only in the sense that it is
            not this being, as a man is not this being which is an ass, but also
            in the sense that it is not in any way. For he says that whatever is
            other than being is non-being, and what is nonbeing is nothing. From
            this, therefore, it follows that non-being would be predicated of
            that which truly is, because white is predicated of substance, which
            truly is. And white does not signify being, as was said.

            a two-footed animal, it is necessary that animal be and that
            two-footed be. And each of these will be what truly is, i.e.,
            substance. And if they are not substances, they are accidents,

            First he assumes that ‘accident’ is used in two ways. One type of
            accident is separable, and as such can be in something or not in it,
            for example, to sit. Another type of accident is inseparable and
            <i>per se</i>. And this latter is the accident in whose definition
            is placed the subject in which it is. For example, the snub is a
            <i>per se</i>
            accident of nose, because nose is placed in the definition of the
            snub. For the snub is a curved nose.

            The second thing which he assumes is that if certain things are
            placed in the definition of that which is defined, or in the
            definition of the things on which the definition depends, then it is
            impossible that the whole definition of that which is defined be
            placed in the definition of these certain things. Thus two-footed is
            placed in the definition of man, and certain other things are placed
            in the definition of two-footed or animal, from which [i.e., from
            two-footed and animal] man is defined. Hence it is impossible that
            man be placed in the definition of two-footed or in the definition
            of any of the things which fall in the definition of two-footed or
            of animal. Otherwise we would have a circular definition, and one
            and the same thing would be both prior and posterior, better known
            and less known. For every definition is from the prior and the
            better known, as is said in
            <i>Topics</i>, VI:4. And for the same reason, when white is placed
            in the definition of white man, it is impossible for white man to be
            placed in the definition of white.

            His igitur suppositis, sic argumentatur. Si bipes est accidens

            quod est etiam impossibile quia bipes ponitur in ratione eius.
            Impossibile est igitur quod bipes sit accidens homini, et eadem

            alicui alii, sequeretur quod etiam homo accidat alicui alteri. Sed
            hoc est impossibile: iam enim supra dictum est quod illud quod vere

          <td>
            These things having been assumed, the argument is as follows. If
            two-footed is an accident of man, it must be either a separable
            accident (and thus it could happen that man is not two-footed, which
            is impossible) or an inseparable accident (and thus it will be
            necessary that man be placed in the definition of two-footed). But
            this also is impossible, because two-footed is placed in the
            definition of man. It is impossible, therefore, that two-footed be
            an accident of man. For the same reason animal cannot be an
            accident. If, however, it is said that both are accidents of
            something else, it would follow that man also would be an accident
            of something else. But this is impossible, for it has already been
            said above that that which truly is is an accident of nothing. But
            man was assumed to be that which truly is, as is clear from what was
            said above.

            is as follows. A being which is one is substance and not accident
            (and by substance he means body). If, however, that body is divided
            into two halves, it will follow that being is predicated of each
            half and of the union of the two. And this either proceeds to
            infinity, which is impossible in itself, or else the being is
            divided into points. But this also is impossible. Hence it follows

            argument led to the absurdity that non-being is being, as is clear

            the conclusion that an is one does not follow because, if it were a
            magnitude, it would follow that this magnitude is indivisible. For

            said in
            <i>Metaphysics</i>, VI:2 that Plato held that sophistry dealt with
            nonbeing, because it treated most of all those things which are
            predicated per accidens. Therefore Plato, understanding being to be
            substance, conceded the first proposition of Parmenides who said
            that whatever is other than being is non-being. For Plato held that
            accident, which is other than substance, was non-being.

            51. He says, therefore, first that the argument by which Plato
            concluded that being signifies one clearly does not follow. For he
            held that being is a genus and is predicated univocally of all
            things by a participation in the first being. And further he held
            that contradictories cannot be true at the same time. From these two
            points he thought that it followed that non-being is not nothing,
            but something. For if being signifies the one, which is substance,
            it will be necessary that whatever is not substance is non-being.
            For if it were being, then since being does not signify anything but
            substance, it would follow that it would be substance. And so it
            would at once be substance and non-substance, in which case
            contradictories would be true at the same time. If, therefore, it is
            impossible for contradictories to be true at the same time, and if
            being signifies the one, which is substance, it would follow that
            whatever is not substance is non-being. But there is something which
            is not substance, namely, accident. Therefore something is
            non-being. And so it is not true that non-being is nothing.

            that that which is not something, i.e., not substance, is absolute

            52. Next where he says, ‘To say that all things...’ (187 a 7), he
            shows further that, if the non-being which is accident is not
            something, it does not follow that all is one. For if being can mean
            only substance, which truly is, then he says that it is absurd to
            hold that it would follow that all things are one unless there is
            something outside of being. For if there is substance, there is
            nothing to prevent there being a multiplicity of substances, as has
            already been said [L6 #45], even if magnitude and accident are
            removed. For the definition of substance is divided into the many
            things which are in the genus of substance, as man is divided into
            animal and two-footed. And further it follows that according to the
            diverse differentiae of a genus there are many substances in act.
            And finally he draws the conclusion which he had uppermost in mind,
            namely, that all things are not one, as Parmenides and Melissus
            said.

              The physicists on the other hand have two modes of explanation.
              The first set make the underlying body one either one of the three
              or something else which is denser than fire and rarer than air
              then generate everything else from this, and obtain multiplicity
              by condensation and rarefaction. Now these are contraries, which
              may be generalized into 'excess and defect'. (Compare Plato's
              'Great and Small'—except that he make these his matter, the one
              his form, while the others treat the one which underlies as matter
              and the contraries as differentiae, i.e. forms). The second set
              assert that the contrarieties are contained in the one and emerge
              from it by segregation, for example Anaximander and also all those
              who assert that 'what is' is one and many, like Empedocles and
              Anaxagoras; for they too produce other things from their mixture
              by segregation. These differ, however, from each other in that the
              former imagines a cycle of such changes, the latter a single
              series. Anaxagoras again made both his 'homceomerous' substances
              and his contraries infinite in multitude, whereas Empedocles
              posits only the so-called elements.

            philosophers there are two ways in which things are generated from
            principles. One of the opinions was advanced by the natural
            philosophers who held that there is only one material principle.
            This principle would be either one of three elements, i.e., fire,
            air, and water (for no one made earth alone the principle, as was
            said above [L2 #13]) or else some intermediate between them, for
            example, that which would be more dense than fire and more subtle
            than air. They then said that all other things were generated from
            this one principle by rarity and density. For example, those who
            made air to be the principle said that fire was generated from air
            by rarefaction, and water by condensation. However, the dense and
            the rare are contraries and are reduced to excess and defect as to
            something more universal. For the dense is what has much matter,

            ancient natural philosophers, on the other hand, maintained a
            contrariety on the part of form, because they held that the first
            principle is one matter from which many things were constituted in

            one confused state in which there are not many things mixed
            together. Thus he held one principle only. But Empedocles and
            Anaxagoras held rather that the principles are the very things which
            are mixed together in that one confused state. And so they held many
            principles, although they also held that this one confused state is
            in some way a principle.

            Sed Anaxagoras et Empedocles differebant in duobus. Primo quidem
            quia Empedocles ponebat circulationem quandam commixtionis et
            segregationis. Ponebat enim mundum multoties esse factum et
            multoties corruptum; ita scilicet quod cum mundus corruptus fuit,
            amicitia omnia confundente in unum, iterum mundus generaretur, lite
            separante et distinguente: et sic confusioni succedit distinctio et
            e converso. Sed Anaxagoras ponebat semel tantum mundum factum esse,
            ita quod a principio omnia essent commixta in unum: sed intellectus,
            qui incoepit extrahere et distinguere, nunquam cessabit hoc facere,
            ita quod nunquam erunt omnia commixta in unum.

            57. But Anaxagoras and Empedocles differed on two points. First,
            Empedocles held that there is a certain cycle of mixing and
            separating. For he held that the world has been made and corrupted
            many times; that is to say, when the world has been corrupted by
            friendship gathering all into one, the world is then generated again
            by strife separating and distinguishing. And thus the distinction of
            things follows upon their being confused, and vice versa. But
            Anaxagoras held that the world was made only once, such that from
            the beginning all things were mixed into one. But mind, which began
            to draw out and to distinguish, will never cease to do this, so that
            all things never will be mixed into one.

            Alio modo differebant in hoc quod Anaxagoras posuit principia esse
            infinitas partes similes et contrarias: sicut infinitas partes
            carnis, quae sunt similes invicem, et infinitas partes ossis et
            aliorum quae habent partes similes, cum tamen quarundam sit ad alias
            contrarietas; sicut partium ossis ad partes sanguinis est
            contrarietas secundum humidum et siccum. Sed Empedocles posuit
            principia solum illa quatuor quae communiter dicuntur elementa,
            scilicet ignem, aerem, aquam et terram.
          </td>
          <td>
            They also differed in another way. Anaxagoras held that the
            principles are infinite parts which are alike and contrary. Thus
            there are infinite parts of flesh which are like each other and
            infinite parts of bone and other things which have similar parts,
            yet each has a contrariety to the others. Thus the contrariety of
            the parts of bone to the parts of blood is that of the dry to the
            moist. But Empedocles held as principles only those four things
            which are commonly called elements, i.e., fire, air, water, and
            earth.

              of the physicists that nothing comes into being from not-being.

              thought that the truth of the alternative necessarily followed,

              out of things already present, but imperceptible to our senses
              because of the smallness of their bulk. So they assert that
              everything has been mixed in every. thing, because they saw

              water. Hence, since every finite body is exhausted by the repeated

            Aristotle says that, because of this, Anaxagoras seemed to have held

            true the common opinion of all philosophers of nature, namely, that
            what simply is not in no way comes to be. For they assumed this as a
            principle and then developed their different opinions.

            Anaxagoras proceeded as follows. If something comes to be, it is
            necessary that it should come to be either from being or from
            nonbeing. But he excluded one of these alternatives-namely, that
            something should come to be from non-being. He does this because of
            the common opinion of the philosophers mentioned above [#59]. Whence
            he concluded that the remaining member was correct, namely, that a
            thing comes to be from being. For example, if air comes to be from
            water, then air pre-existed. For it cannot be said that air comes to
            be from water unless air pre-existed in water. Hence he wished to
            say that everything which comes to be from something pre-existed in
            that from which it comes to be.

            holding that that which comes to be from something pre-exists in it
            as certain most minute parts which are not sensible to us because of
            their smallness. For example, if air comes to be from water, certain
            minute parts of air are in the water, but not in that quantity in
            which it is generated. And so he said that by the gathering together
            of these parts of air by themselves, and by their separation from
            the parts of water, air comes to be.

            respect to multitude or magnitude, it will be unknown in respect to
            quantity. If, however, it is infinite in respect to species (for
            example, if it is composed of an infinite variety of species), then
            it will be unknown according to quality. And the reason for this is
            that what is known by the intellect is grasped by the intellect with
            respect to all that belongs to that thing. But this cannot happen
            with regard to something infinite. If, therefore, the principles of
            a thing are infinite, they must be unknown either in respect to
            quantity or in respect to species.

            If from water flesh is separated, and again other flesh, the process

            in everything. If it does not stop, then some part of flesh will
            always remain in the water. Thus in the second separation the
            remaining flesh is smaller than in the first, and in the third it is

            third of a whole, and then a third of the third, and so on. In this

            Every body becomes a smaller one when something is taken from it,
            because every whole is greater than its parts. Since then the
            quantity of flesh is determinately great or small, as is clear from
            what was said above, there must be some smallest bit of flesh.
            Therefore from this nothing can be separated, because the remaining
            flesh would be smaller than this smallest piece of flesh. Therefore
            it is impossible that everything comes to be from everything by
            separation.

            71. At the point where he says, ‘Lastly in each...’ (188 a 3), he
            gives his fifth argument, which is as follows. If infinite parts of
            each thing are in each thing, and everything is in everything, it
            follows that infinite parts of flesh and infinite parts of blood and
            brain are in an infinite number of bodies. And regardless of how
            much is separated, the same amount would always remain. Therefore it
            would follow that the infinite is in the infinite infinitely. But
            this is unthinkable.

            He says, therefore, first that although Anaxagoras has in a certain
            respect spoken the truth, he himself did not understand what he said
            when he held that the process of separation would never end. For
            accidents can never be separated from substance; yet he held that
            there was a mixture not only of bodies but also of accidents. When
            something becomes white, he said that this happened by an
            abstraction of white from the previously existing mixture. If then
            colours and other accidents of this sort are mixed together, as he
            said, and if someone on this supposition says all things that are
            mixed can be separated, it would follow that there would be white
            and healthy, and yet there would be no subject of which these are
            predicated and in which they are. But this is impossible. Therefore
            the truth is that if accidents are in the mixture it is impossible
            that all mixed things can be separated.

            Sed ex hoc sequitur inconveniens. Ponebat enim Anaxagoras quod omnia
            a principio erant commixta, sed intellectus incoepit segregare:
            quicumque autem intellectus quaerit facere quod impossibile est
            fieri, est indecens intellectus. Quare inconveniens erit intellectus

            Another absurdity results from the following. Anaxagoras held that
            all things were mixed from the very beginning, but intellect began
            to separate them. Now any intellect which attempts to do what cannot
            be done is not worthy of the name intellect. Hence that intellect
            will be inconsistent, intending the impossible, if it truly wishes
            this, i.e., wishes to separate things completely. For this is
            impossible both from the point of view of quantity, because there is
            no smallest magnitude, as Anaxagoras said, for from any small
            quantity something can be subtracted, and from the point of view of
            quality, because accidents are not separable from their subjects.

            speciem. Quaedam enim ex similibus generantur et in similia

            Since Anaxagoras saw that a thing is made large by the coming
            together of many small parts which are similar, as a stream is made
            from many brooks, he believed this to be the case for all things.
            And thus Aristotle says that Anaxagoras did not correctly understand
            the generation of things of the same species, i.e., he did not
            understand that a thing is not always generated by things which are
            similar in respect to species. For some things are both generated
            from and are resolved into things like unto themselves, as clay is
            divided into bricks; in other instances, however, this is not so.
            For some things are generated from that which is dissimilar. And in
            these instances there is not merely one mode of production. For some
            things are made by alteration from that which is unlike, as the
            sides of a house are made from clay and not from sides; whereas
            other things are made by composition, as the house is not made of
            houses, but of sides. It is in this way that air and water come to
            be from each other, i.e., as from the unlike.

              And with good reason. For first principles must not be derived
              from one another nor from anything else, while everything has to
              be derived from them. But these conditions are fulfilled by the
              primary contraries, which are not derived from anything else
              because they are primary, nor from each other because they are
              contraries. But we must see how this can be arrived at as a
              reasoned result, as well as in the way just indicated. Our first
              presupposition must be that in nature nothing acts on, or is acted
              on by, any other thing at random, nor may anything come from
              anything else, unless we mean that it does so in virtue of a
              concomitant attribute. For how could 'white' come from 'musical',
              unless 'musical' happened to be an attribute of the not-white or
              of the black? No, 'white' comes from 'not-white'—and not from any
              'not-white', but from black or some intermediate colour.
              Similarly, 'musical' comes to be from 'not-musical', but not from
              any thing other than musical, but from 'unmusical' or any
              intermediate state there may be. Nor again do things pass into the
              first chance thing; 'white' does not pass into 'musical' (except,
              it may be, in virtue of a concomitant attribute), but into
              'not-white'—and not into any chance thing which is not white, but
              into black or an intermediate colour; 'musical' passes into
              'not-musical'—and not into any chance thing other than musical,
              but into 'unmusical' or any intermediate state there may be. The
              same holds of other things also: even things which are not simple
              but complex follow the same principle, but the opposite state has
              not received a name, so we fail to notice the fact. What is in
              tune must come from what is not in tune, and vice versa; the tuned
              passes into untunedness—and not into any untunedness, but into the
              corresponding opposite. It does not matter whether we take
              attunement, order, or composition for our illustration; the
              principle is obviously the same in all, and in fact applies
              equally to the production of a house, a statue, or any other
              complex. A house comes from certain things in a certain state of
              separation instead of conjunction, a statue (or any other thing
              that has been shaped) from shapelessness—each of these objects
              being partly order and partly composition. If then this is true,
              everything that comes to be or passes away from, or passes into,
              its contrary or an intermediate state. But the intermediates are
              derived from the contraries—colours, for instance, from black and
              white. Everything, therefore, that comes to be by a natural
              process is either a contrary or a product of contraries.

              Hence their principles are in one sense the same, in another
              different; different certainly, as indeed most people think, but
              the same inasmuch as they are analogous; for all are taken from
              the same table of columns, some of the pairs being wider, others
              narrower in extent. In this way then their theories are both the
              same and different, some better, some worse; some, as I have said,
              take as their contraries what is more knowable in the order of
              explanation, others what is more familiar to sense. (The universal
              is more knowable in the order of explanation, the particular in
              the order of sense: for explanation has to do with the universal,
              sense with the particular.) 'The great and the small', for

            Tertia vero opinio est eorum qui posuerunt plura principia. Inter

            relinquebant; et huiusmodi vacuitates vocabat poros, ut patet in I
            de generatione. Sic igitur omnia corpora ponebat composita ex firmo
            et inani, idest ex pleno et vacuo: unde plenum et vacuum dicebat
            esse principia naturae; sed plenum attribuebat enti, vacuum vero non
            enti. Item, licet corpora indivisibilia omnia essent unius naturae,
            tamen ex eis dicebat constitui diversa secundum diversitatem
            figurae, positionis et ordinis. Unde ponebat principia esse
            contraria quae sunt in genere positionis, scilicet sursum et
            deorsum, ante et retro; et contraria quae sunt in genere figurae,

            sunt in genere ordinis, scilicet prius et posterius, de quibus non
            fit mentio in littera quia manifesta sunt. Et sic concludit quasi

            secundum aliquem modum. De opinione autem Anaxagorae et Empedoclis
            mentionem non fecit, quia eas superius magis explicavit. Et tamen hi
            ponebant etiam quodammodo contrarietatem in principiis, dicentes
            omnia fieri congregatione et segregatione, quae conveniunt in genere
            cum raro et denso.
          </td>
          <td>
            A third opinion was advanced by those who posited many principles.
            Among them, Democritus held that all things come to be from
            indivisible bodies which are joined together. And in this contact
            with each other they left a sort of void. Such voids he called
            pores, as is clear in <i>De Generatione</i>, I:8. Therefore he held
            that all bodies are composed of the fixed and the empty, that is,
            composed of the plenum and the void. Hence he said that the plenum
            and the void are principles of nature. But he associated the plenum
            with being and the void with non-being. And although all of these
            indivisible bodies are one in nature, he said that different things
            are composed of them according to a diversity of figure, position,
            and order. Thus he held that the principles are contraries in the
            genus of position, i.e., above and below, before and behind, and
            also contraries in the genus of figure, i.e., the straight, the
            angular, and the circular. The principles also are contraries in the
            genus of order, i.e., prior and posterior. (These last contraries
            are not mentioned in the text because they are obvious.) And thus
            Aristotle concludes, by a sort of induction, that all of the
            philosophers held that the principles are contraries in some way. He
            makes no mention of the opinion of Anaxagoras and Empedocles because
            he has already explained their position at length above [L8 #56-57].
            However, they also placed a certain contrariety in the principles
            when they said that all things come to be through joining and
            separating, which agree in genus with the rare and the dense.

            the dry and the hot and the cold. Since, however, it is impossible
            to proceed to infinity, but one must come to certain contraries,
            which are not caused by other contraries, he calls these last
            contraries the primary contraries.

            manifestly not from each other. For even though the cold comes to be
            from the hot, insofar as that which was previously hot is later
            cold, nevertheless coldness itself never comes to be from heat, as
            will be pointed out later [L11 #90]. The third point—precisely how
            all things come to be from the contraries -we must investigate more

            This is first of all seen clearly in simple things. For white does
            not come to be from musical except accidentally insofar as white or
            black happen to be in the musical. But white comes to be
            <i>per se</i>
            from the non-white, and not from just any non-white, but from that
            non-white which is black or some mean colour. And in like manner,
            the musical comes to be from the non-musical, and again not from
            just any nonmusical, but from its opposite, which is called the
            unmusical, i.e., from that which is disposed to be musical but is
            not, or from some mean between these two. And for the same reason, a
            thing is not corrupted primarily and
            <i>per se</i>
            into just any contingent thing (e.g., the white into the musical)
            except accidentally. Rather white is corrupted
            <i>per se</i>
            into the non-white, and not into just any non-white, but into black
            or some mean colour. And he says the same of the corruption of the
            musical and of other similar things. The reason for this is as
            follows. Whatever comes to be or is corrupted does not exist before
            it comes to be and does not exist after it is corrupted. Whence it
            is necessary that that which a thing comes to be
            <i>per se</i>
            and that into which a thing is corrupted
            <i>per se</i> be such that it includes in its nature [
            <i>ratio</i> ] the non-being of that which comes to be or is
            corrupted.

            And he shows that the same is true of composite things. He says that
            the situation is the same with composite things as with simple
            things, but is more hidden in composite things because the opposites
            of composite things have no names, as do the opposites of simple
            things. For the opposite of house has no name, although we give a
            name to the opposite of white. Hence if the composite is reduced to
            something with a name, it will be clear. For every composite
            consists of a certain harmony. Now the harmonious comes to be from
            the inharmonious, and the inharmonious from the harmonious. And in
            like manner, the harmonious is corrupted into the inharmonious (not
            any inharmonious, but the opposite). However, we can speak of the
            harmonious according to order alone, or according to composition.
            For some wholes consist of a harmony of order, e.g., an army; and
            other wholes consist of a harmony of composition, e.g., a house. And
            the nature [
            <i>ratio</i>
            ] of each of these is the same. It is also clear that all composites
            come to be from the non-composed, for example, a house comes to be
            from non-composed things, and the figured from the non-figured. And
            in all such things nothing is involved except order and composition.

            Or it could be said that this second difference explains the first.
            For those things which are better known to reason are prior simply,
            whereas those things which are better known to sense are posterior
            simply, and are prior relative to us. However, it is clear that the
            principles must be prior. Thus, those who judged ‘prior’ according
            to what is better known to reason held that the principles are those
            contraries which are prior simply. On the other hand, those who
            judged ‘prior’ according to what is better known to sense held that
            the principles are those contraries which are posterior simply.
            Hence some held that the hot and the cold are first principles;
            others, the wet and the dry. And both of these are better known to
            sense. However the hot and the cold, which are active qualities, are
            prior to the wet and the dry, which are passive qualities, because
            the active is naturally prior to the passive.

            And this is true in three respects. First, all the principles which
            they assumed are related as contraries. And thus Aristotle says that
            they all took their principles from the same columns, i.e., columns
            of contraries. For they all took contraries as their principles,
            even though the contraries differed. Nor is it remarkable that they
            took different principles from the columns of contraries. For among
            the contraries, some are containers, as the prior and more common;
            and others axe contained, as the posterior and less common. Hence
            one way in which they spoke alike is that all of them took their
            principles from the order of contraries.

            Another way, in which they agree according to analogy is as follows.
            No matter what principles they accepted, one of these principles is
            better, and the other is worse. For example, friendship, or the
            plenum, or the hot, are better; but strife, or the void, or the
            cold, are worse. And the same thing is true of the other pairs of
            contraries. This is so because one of the contraries always has
            privation joined to it. For the source of contrariety is the
            opposition of privation and habit, as is said in
            <i>Metaphysics</i>, X:4.

            Tertio modo conveniunt secundum analogiam in hoc quod omnes
            accipiunt principia notiora: sed quidam notiora secundum rationem,
            quidam vero secundum sensum. Cum enim ratio sit universalis, sensus
            vero particularis, universalia sunt notiora secundum rationem, ut
            magnum et parvum; singularia vero secundum sensum, ut rarum et

            Thirdly they agree according to analogy by reason of the fact that
            they all took principles which are better known. But some took
            principles which are better known to reason, others those which are
            better known to sense. Since reason treats the universal and sense
            treats the particular, universals (such as the great and the small)
            are better known to reason, whereas singulars (such as the rare and
            the dense, which are less common) are better known to sense.

              If then we accept both the former argument and this one, we must,

              one nature—water or fire or what is intermediate between them.
              What is intermediate seems preferable; for fire, earth, air, and
              water are already involved with pairs of contraries. There is,

              All, however, agree in this, that they differentiate their One by

              of old standing, though in different forms; for the early thinkers

              some of the more recent maintain the reverse. To suppose then that

            must be primary contraries, as was shown above [L10 #77]. But the
            primary contraries belong to the primary genus, which is substance.
            But substance, since it is one genus, has one primary contrariety.
            For the first contrariety of any genus is that of the primary
            differentiae by which the genus is divided. Therefore, the
            principles are not infinite.

            finite principles rather than from infinite principles. But all
            things which come to be according to nature are explained by
            Empedocles through finite principles, just as they are explained by
            Anaxagoras through infinite principles. Hence an infinite number of
            principles should not be posited.

            are contraries. If, therefore, the principles are infinite, it is
            necessary that all the contraries be principles. But all of the
            contraries are not principles. This is clear for two reasons. First,
            the principles must be primary contraries, but not all contraries
            are primary, since some are prior to others. Secondly, the
            principles ought not to be from each other, as was said above [L10
            #77]. But some contraries are from each other, as the sweet and the
            bitter, and the white and the black. Therefore, the principles are
            not infinite.

            88. However, we must note that the Philosopher proceeds here by way
            of disputation from probable arguments. Hence he assumes certain
            things which are seen in many instances, and which cannot be false
            taken as a whole, but are true in particular instances. Therefore,
            it is true that in a certain respect contraries do come to be from
            each other, as was said above [L10 #78], if the subject is taken
            along with the contraries. For that which is white later becomes
            black. However, whiteness itself is never changed into blackness.
            But some of the ancients, without including the subject, held that
            the primary contraries come to be from each other. Hence, Empedocles
            denied that the elements come to be from each other. And thus
            Aristotle significantly does not say in this place that the hot
            comes to be from the cold, but the sweet from the bitter and the
            white from the black.

            since the principles are not infinite, then it remains for us to
            consider whether there are only two principles or more than two.
            Since it was shown above that the principles are contraries, it
            seems that there are only two principles, because contrariety exists
            between two extremes.

            But one might question this. For it is necessary that other things
            come to be from the principles, as was said above [L10 #77]. If,
            however, there are only two contrary principles, it is not apparent
            how all things can come to be from these two. For it cannot be said
            that one of them makes something from the other one. For density is
            not by nature such that it can convert rarity into something, nor
            can rarity convert density into something. And the same is true of
            any other contrariety. For friendship does not move strife and make
            something out of it, nor does the converse happen. Rather each of
            the contraries changes some third thing which is the subject of both
            of the contraries. For heat does not make coldness itself to be hot,
            but makes the subject of coldness to be hot. And conversely,
            coldness does not make heat itself to be cold, but makes the subject
            of heat to be cold. Therefore, in order that other things can come
            to be from the contraries, it seems that it is necessary to posit
            some third thing which will be the subject of the contraries.

            objections...’(189 a 28). He says that, unless there is something
            other than the contraries which are given as principles, then there
            arises an even greater difficulty. For a first principle cannot be
            an accident which is predicated of a subject. For since a subject is
            a principle of the accident which is predicated of it and is
            naturally prior to the accident, then if the first principle were an
            accident predicated of a subject, it would follow that what is ‘of’
            a principle would be a principle, and there would be something prior
            to the first. But if we hold that only the contraries are
            principles, it is necessary that the principles be an accident
            predicated of a subject. For no substance is the contrary of
            something else. Rather contrariety is found only between accidents.
            It follows, therefore, that the contraries cannot be the only
            principles.

            is from certain things is posterior to them. But this is impossible.
            For substance which is being

            just given (which proves that contrary principles are not

            understanding nature to mean matter, such as water, or fire or air,
            or some intermediate state between these, such as vapour, or some

            This seems especially true in regard to an intermediate. For this
            third thing is taken as the subject of the contraries, and as
            distinct from them in some way. Hence, that which has less of the
            nature of a contrary about it is more conveniently posited as the
            third principle beyond the contraries. For fire and earth and air
            and water have contrariety attached to them, e.g., the hot and the
            cold, the wet and the dry. Hence, it is not unreasonable that they
            make the subject something other than these and something in which
            the contraries are less prominent. After these philosophers,
            however, those who held that air was the principle spoke more
            wisely, for the contrary qualities found in air are less sensible.
            After these philosophers are those who held that water was the
            principle. But those who held that fire was the principle spoke most
            poorly, because fire has a contrary quality which is most sensible
            and which is very active. For in fire there is an excellence of
            heat. If, however, the elements are compared with reference to their
            subtlety, those who made fire the principle seem to have spoken
            better, as is said elsewhere,’ for what is more subtle seems to be
            more simple and prior. Hence no one held that earth was the
            principle because of its density.

            and the small are the principles of things was also the opinion of
            the ancient natural philosophers, but in a different way. For the
            ancient philosophers, thinking that one matter was differentiated by
            diverse forms, held two principles on the part of form, which is the
            principle of action, and one on the part of matter, which is the
            principle of passion. But the Platonists, thinking that many
            individuals in one species are distinguished by a division of
            matter, posited one principle on the part of the form, which is the
            active principle, and two on the part of the matter, which is the
            passive principle.

            it is necessary that there be many primary contrarieties. But this
            is impossible because the first contrariety seems to belong to the
            first genus, which is one, namely, substance. Hence all contraries
            which are in the genus of substance do not differ in genus, but are
            related as prior and posterior. For in one genus there is only one
            contrariety, namely, the first, because all other contrarieties seem
            to be reduced to the first one. For there are certain first contrary
            differentiae by which a genus is divided. Therefore it seems that

              But there are different senses of 'coming to be'. In some cases we
              do not use the expression 'come to be', but 'come to be
              so-and-so'. Only substances are said to 'come to be' in the
              unqualified sense. Now in all cases other than substance it is
              plain that there must be some subject, namely, that which becomes.
              For we know that when a thing comes to be of such a quantity or
              quality or in such a relation, time, or place, a subject is always
              presupposed, since substance alone is not predicated of another
              subject, but everything else of substance. But that substances
              too, and anything else that can be said 'to be' without
              qualification, come to be from some substratum, will appear on
              examination. For we find in every case something that underlies
              from which proceeds that which comes to be; for instance, animals
              and plants from seed.

            there are only two principles of nature or three involves much
            difficulty, he concludes that he must first speak of generation and
            production as common to all the species of mutation. For in any
            mutation there is found a certain coming-to-be. For example, when
            something is altered from white to black, the non-white comes to be
            from the white, and the black comes to be from the non-black. And
            the same is true of other mutations. He also points out the reason
            for this order of procedure. It is necessary to speak first of those
            things which are common, and afterwards to think of those things
            which are proper to each thing, as was said in the beginning of the
            Book [L1 #6].

            He explains this as follows. Sometimes we say man becomes musical,
            and then the two termini of the production are simple. It is the
            same when we say that the non-musical becomes musical. But when we
            say that the non-musical man becomes a musical man, each of the
            termini is a composite. Yet when coming to be is attributed to man
            or to the nonmusical, each is simple. And thus, that which becomes,
            i.e., that to which coming to be is attributed, is said to come to
            be simply. Moreover, that in which the very coming to be is
            terminated, which is also said to come to be simply, is musical.
            Thus we say man becomes musical, or the non-musical becomes musical.
            But when each is signified as coming to be as composed (i.e., both
            what becomes, i.e., that to which the coming to be is attributed,
            and what is made, i.e., that in which the coming to be is
            terminated), then we say that the non-musical man becomes musical.
            For then there is composition on the part of the subject only and
            simplicity on the part of the predicate. But when I say that the
            nonmusical man becomes a musical man, then there is composition on
            the part of each.

            He points out the second difference where he says, ‘When a

            to two simple things, i.e., the subject and the opposite, one of
            these is permanent, but the other is not. For when someone has
            already been made musical, ‘man’ remains. But the opposite does not
            remain, whether it be the negative opposite, as the non-musical, or
            the privation or contrary, as the unmusical. Nor is the composite of
            subject and the opposite permanent, for the non-musical man does not
            remain after man has been made musical. And so coming to be is
            attributed to these three things: for it was said that man becomes
            musical, and the non-musical becomes musical, and the non-musical
            man becomes musical. Of these three, only the first remains complete
            in a production, the other two do not remain.

            what was said above, wishes to consider [coming-to-be] in all the
            things which come to be naturally, he will agree that there must
            always be some subject to which the coming to be is attributed, and
            that that subject, although one in number and subject, is not the
            same in species or nature [
            <i>ratio</i> ]. For when it is said of a man that he becomes
            musical, the man is indeed one in subject, but two in nature [
            <i>ratio</i> ]. For man and the non-musical are not the same
            according to nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. Aristotle does not, however,
            mention here the third point, namely, that in every generation there
            must be something generated, for this is obvious.

            something which is permanent and something which is not permanent.
            For that which is not an opposite of the terminus of the production
            is permanent, for man remains when he becomes musical, but the
            non-musical does not remain. And from this it is clear that man and
            the non-musical are not the same in nature [

            106. Secondly, where he says, ‘We speak of...’(190 a 2 1), he shows
            the same thing in another way. With reference to the non-permanent
            things, it is much better to say ‘this comes to be from this’ than
            to say ‘this becomes this’ (although this latter also may be said,
            but not as properly). For we say that the musical comes to be from
            the nonmusical. We also say that the non-musical becomes musical,
            but this is accidental, insofar as that which happens to be
            non-musical becomes musical. But in permanent things this is not
            said. For we do not say that the musical comes to be from man,
            rather we say that the man becomes musical.

            But this happens because by the name ‘bronze’ we understand the
            ‘unshaped’, and so this is said by reason of the privation which is
            understood.

            He says, therefore, first that since ‘to come to be’ is used in many
            ways, ‘to come to be simply’ is said only of the coming to be of
            substances, whereas other things are said to come to be
            accidentally. This is so because ‘to come to be’ implies the
            beginning of existing. Therefore, in order for something to come to
            be simply, it is required that it previously will not have been
            simply, which happens in those things which comer to be
            substantially. For when a man comes to be, he not only previously
            was not a man, but it is true to say that he simply was not. When,
            however, a man becomes white, it is not true to say that he
            previously was not, but that he previously was not such.

            that that to which coming to be is attributed is always composed.
            And since in any production there is that at which the coming to be
            is terminated and that to which the coming to be is attributed, the
            latter of which is twofold, i.e., the subject and the opposite, it
            is then clear that there are three things in any coming to be,
            namely, the subject, the terminus of the production, and the
            opposite of this terminus. Thus when a man becomes musical, the
            opposite is the non-musical, the subject is the man, and musical is
            the terminus of the production. And in like manner, shapelessness
            and lack of figure and lack of order are opposites, while bronze and
            gold and stone are subjects in artificial productions.

              Plainly then, if there are conditions and principles which
              constitute natural objects and from which they primarily are or
              have come to be—have come to be, I mean, what each is said to be
              in its essential nature, not what each is in respect of a
              concomitant attribute—plainly, I say, everything comes to be from
              both subject and form. For 'musical man' is composed (in a way) of
              'man' and 'musical': you can analyse it into the definitions of
              its elements. It is clear then that what comes to be will come to
              be from these elements.

              There is a sense, therefore, in which we must declare the
              principles to be two, and a sense in which they are three; a sense
              in which the contraries are the principles—say for example the
              musical and the unmusical, the hot and the cold, the tuned and the
              untuned—and a sense in which they are not, since it is impossible

              difficulty also is solved by the fact that the substratum is
              different from the contraries, for it is itself not a contrary.

            which happens to the subject, i.e., contrariety and privation, such
            as to be unmusical and unshaped. The third principle, then, is a

            form of a musical man, or as any of the other things which are

            Hence it must be said that matter is never without privation. For
            when matter has one form, it is in privation of some other form. And
            so while it is coming to be that which it becomes (e.g., musical
            man), there is in the subject, which does not yet have the form, the
            privation of the musical itself. And so the
            <i>per accidens</i>
            principle of a musical man, while he is coming to be musical, is the
            non-musical. For he is a non-musical man while he is coming to be
            musical. But when this latter form has already come to him, then
            there is joined to him the privation of the other form. And thus the
            privation of the opposite form is a
            <i>per accidens</i>
            principle of being.

            V [L2 #649ff], there are three species of mutation, namely,
            generation and corruption and motion. The difference among these is
            as follows. Motion is from one positive state to another positive
            state, as from white to black. Generation, however, is from the
            negative to the positive, as from the non-white to the white, or
            from non-man to man. Corruption, on the other hand, is from the
            positive to the negative, as from the white to the non-white, or
            from man to non-man. Therefore, it is clear that in motion two
            contraries and one subject are required. But in generation and
            corruption there is required the presence of one contrary and its
            absence, which is privation.

            Generation and corruption, however, are found in motion. For when
            something is moved from white to black, white is corrupted and black
            comes to be. Therefore in every natural mutation subject and form
            and privation are required. However, the nature [
            <i>ratio</i>
            ] of motion is not found in every generation and corruption, as is
            clear in the generation and corruption of substances. Hence subject
            and form and privation are found in every mutation, but not a

            known is known through its form. Primary matter is, moreover,
            considered to be the subject of every form. But it is known by
            analogy, that is, according to proportion. For we know that wood is
            other than the form of a bench and a bed, for sometimes it underlies
            the one form, at other times the other. When, therefore, we see that
            air at times becomes water, it is necessary to say that there is
            something which sometimes exists under the form of air, and at other
            times under the form of water. And thus this something is other than
            the form of water and other than the form of air, as wood is
            something other than the form of a bench and other than the form of
            bed. This ‘something’, then, is related to these natural substances
            as bronze is related to the statue, and wood to the bed, and

              We will now proceed to show that the difficulty of the early
              thinkers, as well as our own, is solved in this way alone. The
              first of those who studied science were misled in their search for
              truth and the nature of things by their inexperience, which as it
              were thrust them into another path. So they say that none of the
              things that are either comes to be or passes out of existence,
              because what comes to be must do so either from what is or from
              what is not, both of which are impossible. For what is cannot come
              to be (because it is already), and from what is not nothing could
              have come to be (because something must be present as a
              substratum). So too they exaggerated the consequence of this, and
              went so far as to deny even the existence of a plurality of
              things, maintaining that only Being itself is. Such then was their
              opinion, and such the reason for its adoption.

              Our explanation on the other hand is that the phrases 'something
              comes to be from what is or from what is not', 'what is not or
              what is does something or has something done to it or becomes some
              particular thing', are to be taken (in the first way of putting
              our explanation) in the same sense as 'a doctor does something or
              has something done to him', 'is or becomes something from being a
              doctor.' These expressions may be taken in two senses, and so too,
              clearly, may 'from being', and 'being acts or is acted on'. A
              doctor builds a house, not qua doctor, but qua housebuilder, and
              turns gray, not qua doctor, but qua dark-haired. On the other hand
              he doctors or fails to doctor qua doctor. But we are using words
              most appropriately when we say that a doctor does something or
              undergoes something, or becomes something from being a doctor, if
              he does, undergoes, or becomes qua doctor. Clearly then also 'to
              come to be so-and-so from not-being' means 'qua not-being'. It was
              through failure to make this distinction that those thinkers gave
              the matter up, and through this error that they went so much
              farther astray as to suppose that nothing else comes to be or
              exists apart from Being itself, thus doing away with all becoming.
              We ourselves are in agreement with them in holding that nothing
              can be said without qualification to come from what is not. But
              nevertheless we maintain that a thing may 'come to be from what is
              not'—that is, in a qualified sense. For a thing comes to be from
              the privation, which in its own nature is not-being,—this not
              surviving as a constituent of the result. Yet this causes
              surprise, and it is thought impossible that something should come
              to be in the way described from what is not. In the same way we
              maintain that nothing comes to be from being, and that being does
              not come to be except in a qualified sense. In that way, however,
              it does, just as animal might come to be from animal, and an
              animal of a certain kind from an animal of a certain kind. Thus,
              suppose a dog to come to be from a horse. The dog would then, it
              is true, come to be from animal (as well as from an animal of a
              certain kind) but not as animal, for that is already there. But if
              anything is to become an animal, not in a qualified sense, it will
              not be from animal: and if being, not from being—nor from
              not-being either, for it has been explained that by 'from not
              being' we mean from not-being qua not-being. Note further that we
              do not subvert the principle that everything either is or is not.
              This then is one way of solving the difficulty.

            The weakness of their understanding forced them to hold this
            position because they did not know how to resolve the following

            not generated. If being comes to be, it comes to be either from
            being or from non-being. And each of these seems to be impossible,
            i.e., that being comes to be from being or that it comes to be from
            non-being. It is clearly impossible for something to come to be from
            being, because that which is does not come to be, for nothing is
            before it comes to be. And being already is, hence it does not come
            to be. It is also clearly impossible for something to come to be
            from non-being. For it is always necessary that there be a subject
            for that which comes to be, as was shown above [L12 #107]. From
            nothing, nothing comes to be. And from this it was concluded that
            there is neither generation nor corruption of being.

            is concerned, it makes no difference whether we say that something
            comes to be from being or from non-being, or that being or non-being
            does something or is acted upon, or anything else, or whether we say
            this same sort of thing about a doctor; namely, that the doctor does
            something or is acted upon, or that something is or comes to be from
            the doctor.

            i.e., being, is not from privation <i>per se</i>. And this is so

            Rather a thing comes to be

            distinguish between matter and privation. Hence, they attributed to
            matter what belongs to privation. And because privation, considered
            in itself, is non-being, they said that matter, considered in
            itself, is non-being. And so just as a thing comes to be simply and
            <i>per se</i> from matter, so they believed that a thing comes to be
            simply and <i>per se</i> from non-being.

            And they were led to hold this position for two reasons. First they
            were influenced by the argument of Parmenides, who said that
            whatever is other than being is non-being. Since, then, matter is
            other than being, because it is not being in act, they said that it
            is non-being simply. Secondly, it seemed to them that that which is
            one in number or subject is also one in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ]. And
            Aristotle calls this a state of being one in potency, because things
            which are one in nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] are such that each has the
            same power. But things which are one in subject but not one in
            nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] do not have the same potency or power, as is
            clear in the white and the musical. But subject and privation are
            one in number, as for example, the bronze and the unshaped. Hence it
            seemed to them that they would be the same in nature [
            <i>ratio</i> ] or in power. Hence this position accepts the unity of
            potency.

            non est aliquid extra genus substantiae. Non igitur potentia
            materiae est aliqua proprietas addita super essentiam eius; sed
            materia secundum suam substantiam est potentia ad esse substantiale.

            131. But lest anyone, because of these words, be in doubt about what
            the potency of matter is and whether it is one or many, it must be
            pointed out that act and potency divide every genus of beings, as is
            clear in <i>Metaphysics</i>, IX:1, and in Book III [L3] of this
            work. Hence, just as the potency for quality is not something
            outside the genus of quality, so the potency for substantial being
            is not outside the genus of substance. Therefore, the potency of
            matter is not some property added to its essence. Rather, matter in
            its very substance is potency for substantial being. Moreover, the
            potency of matter is one in subject with respect to many forms. But
            in its nature [ <i>ratio</i> ] there are many potencies according to
            its relation to different forms. Hence in Book Ills it will be said
            that to be able to be healed and to be able to be ill differ

            or nature [

            that matter and privation although one in subject, are other in

            matter is non-being accidentally, whereas privation is non-being
            <i>per se</i>. For ‘unshaped’ signifies non-being, but ‘bronze’ does
            not signify non-being except insofar as ‘unshaped’ happens to be in
            it. Secondly, matter is ‘near to the thing’ and exists in some
            respect, because it is in potency to the thing and is in some
            respect the substance of the thing, since it enters into the
            constitution of the substance. But this cannot be said of privation.

            If matter seeks form, it does not seek a form insofar as it is under

            need, for an appetite is a desire for what is not possessed.) In

            ordination and direction of someone who knows, as the arrow tends
            toward a determinate mark by the direction and ordination of the
            archer. Therefore, natural appetite is nothing but the ordination of
            things to their end in accordance with their proper natures. However
            a being in act is not only ordered to its end by an active power,
            but also by its matter insofar as it is potency. For form is the end
            of matter. Therefore for matter to seek form is nothing other than
            matter being ordered to form as potency to act.

            is not because of a dislike for the form which it has, nor because
            it seeks to be the contrary at the same time, but because it is in
            potency to other forms while it has some form in act.

            Nor does he use a figure of speech here; rather, he uses an example.
            For it was said above [L13 #118] that primary matter is knowable by
            way of proportion, insofar as it is related to substantial forms as
            sensible matters are related to accidental forms. And thus in order
            to explain primary matter, it is necessary to use an example taken
            from sensible substances. Therefore, just as he used the example of
            unshaped bronze and the example of the non-musical man to explain
            matter, so now to explain matter he uses the example of the appetite
            of the woman for the man and the example of appetite of the base for
            the good. For this happens to these things insofar as they have
            something which is of the nature [
            <i>ratio</i>
            ] of matter. However, it must be noted that Aristotle is here
            arguing against Plato, who used such metaphorical expressions,
            likening matter to a mother and the feminine, and form to the
            masculine. And so Aristotle uses Plato’s own metaphors against him.

            139. Next where he says, ‘The matter comes to be... (192 a 25), he
            shows how matter is corrupted. He says that in a certain respect
            matter is corrupted and in a certain respect it is not. For insofar
            as privation is in it, it is corrupted when the privation ceases to
            be in it, as if we should say that unshaped bronze is corrupted when
            it ceases to be unshaped. But in itself, insofar as it is a certain
            being in potency, it is neither generated nor corruptible. This is
            clear from the following. If matter should come to be, there would
            have to be something which is the subject from which it comes to be,
            as is clear from what was said above [L12 #7,10ff]. But that which
            is the first subject in generation is matter. For we say that matter
            is the first subject from which a thing comes to be
            <i>per se</i>, and not <i>per accidens</i>, and is in the thing
            after it has come to be. (And privation differs from matter on both
            of these points. For privation is that from which a thing comes to
            be <i>per accidens</i>, and is that which is not in the thing after
            it has come to be.) It follows, therefore, that matter would be
            before it would come to be, which is impossible. And in like manner,
            everything which is corrupted is resolved into primary matter..
            Therefore, at the very time when primary matter already is, it would
            be corrupted; and thus if primary matter is corrupted, it will have
            been corrupted before it is corrupted, which is impossible.
            Therefore, it is impossible for primary matter to be generated and
            corrupted. But by this we do not deny that it comes into existence
            through creation.

            been eliminated, then the errors and problems about form should also
            be eliminated. For some have posited separated forms, i.e., ideas,
            which they reduced to one first idea.

            whether the formal principle is one or many, and how many there are,
            and what kind there are. Hence these questions will be reserved for
            first philosophy. For form is a principle of existing, and being as
            such is the subject of first philosophy. But matter and privation
            are. principles of mutable being, which is considered by the natural
            philosopher. Nevertheless we shall treat of natural and corruptible
            forms in the following books on this discipline.
