            tripliciter se habent ad veterem legem. Quaedam enim essentialiter
            fuerunt in veteri lege, quamvis non ut sunt sacramenta novae legis,
            sed magis secundum quod sunt in officium vel actum virtutis; sicut
            poenitentia, ordo, et matrimonium. Quaedam fuerunt secundum aliquid
            eis respondens non essentialiter, sicut Baptismus et Eucharistia.
            Quaedam autem nihil respondens habuerunt in veteri lege, sicut
            confirmatio et extrema unctio. Cujus ratio est, quia prima tria
            sacramenta non solum sunt sacramenta; sed poenitentia est actus
            virtutis; ordo autem pertinet ad officium dispensationis
            sacramentorum; matrimonium autem ad officium naturae; et ideo in
            qualibet lege requiruntur. Baptismus autem et Eucharistia sunt
            sacramenta tantum gratiam continentia; et ideo ante tempus gratiae
            esse non debuerunt. Sed quia sunt sacramenta necessitatis, Baptismus
            quidem quantum ad effectum, Eucharistia autem quantum ad fidem ejus
            quod repraesentatur per ipsam; ideo oportuit quod in lege Moysi
            haberent aliquid respondens: sed confirmatio et extrema unctio sunt
            sacramenta gratiam conferentia; et ideo in veteri lege esse non
            debuerunt. Et quia non sunt sacramenta necessitatis, sed cujusdam
            superabundantis perfectionis; ideo non oportebat quod haberent
            aliquid respondens, cum non esset tempus plenitudinis gratiae; et
            ideo haec duo non fuerunt praefiguranda aliquibus expressis figuris,
            similiter neque prima tria, sed tantum duo media, scilicet
            Eucharistia et Baptismus.</font

            >It should be said that the sacraments of the new law stand in a
            threefold relationship to the old law. For some were essentially in
            the old law, although not as they are sacraments of the new law, but
            rather as they were for an office or were the act of virtue, such as
            penance, order, and marriage. There were some that corresponded, not
            essentially but according to some aspect, such as baptism and the
            Eucharist. Finally there were some that had nothing corresponding to
            them in the old law, such as confirmation and extreme unction. The
            reason for this is that the first three sacraments are not only
            sacraments, but penance is an act of virtue, while order pertains to
            the office of the dispensing of sacraments and marriage to the
            office of nature; and hence they are required in any law whatsoever.
            But baptism and the Eucharist are sacraments alone,
            <i>containing</i> grace;

                before the time of grace they ought not to have existed. But
                since they are sacraments of necessity - baptism in regard to
                its effect, and the Eucharist in regard to the faith of that
                which is represented by it - it was thus necessary that in the
                law of Moses they should have something corresponding to them.
                Finally, confirmation and extreme unction are sacraments
                [alone],
                <i>conferring</i>
                grace,

                    ought not to have existed in the old law. And since they are
                    not sacraments of necessity, but of a superabundant
                    perfection, it was therefore unnecessary that they have
                    something corresponding to them, since it was not yet the
                    time of the fullness of grace; and therefore these two were
                    not prefigured by any express figures; nor, similarly, were
                    the first three; but only the middle two, namely the

            relations can exist in the same things with respect to different
            things, because relative being is to stand toward something, but
            absolute characteristics cannot; and so in relations it happens that
            something is disposed through something of its own genus
            <i>per accidens,</i>
            as there is a son of a son, not insofar as he is a son, but insofar
            as he is a father; and similarly, there can be a sign of a sign. But
            in absolute [characteristics] this cannot happen; hence there can be
            a quality of a quality neither
            <i>per se</i>
            nor

            statum habentis, quia non cuilibet datur, sed tantummodo illis qui
            sunt in statu perfectionis. Et similiter dico, quod perfectio
            Eucharistiae est simpliciter major quam perfectio confirmationis et
            extremae unctionis, sed illae sunt majores secundum statum: quia
            perfectio Eucharistiae, quae est per conjunctionem ad principium
            sanctitatis est omnibus de necessitate salutis; sed perfectio
            spiritus sancti ad robur quae est in confirmatione, vel perfectio

            lesser than another in two ways: either simply speaking, or
            according to state; as the essential reward, which is called "gold
            crown," is simply speaking greater than the accidental reward, which

                haver, because it is not given to just anyone, but only to those
                who are in the state of perfection. And similarly I say that the
                perfection of Eucharist is simply speaking greater than the
                perfection of confirmation and of extreme unction, but that of
                those is greater according to status. For the perfection of the
                Eucharist, which is by way of union with the very source of
                holiness, is a matter of necessity for everyone's salvation,
                while the perfection of the Holy Spirit for strengthening, which
                is given in confirmation, or the perfection of cleansing from
                the remnants of sin, which is given in extreme unction, are not
                necessary for everyone; and so in the old law something ought to
                correspond to the perfection of the Eucharist, but not to the
                perfection of confirmation or of extreme unction; these are
                reserved for the law in which the state of perfection is found,
                namely, the law of grace.</font

            reficiendo, quia hoc solum sacramentum per modum refectionis
            operatur. Vel dicendum, secundum Dionysium, quod omnium
            sacramentorum effectus huic sacramento possunt ascribi, inquantum
            perfectio est omnis sacramenti, habens quasi in capitulo et summa
            omnia quae alia sacramenta continent singillatim.</font

            sweetness, insofar as it contains the source of all grace, although
            its use is not ordered to every effect of sacramental grace. Or it
            should be said that even with regard to effect it has every
            sweetness of effect in terms of refreshing, because this sacrament
            alone operates in the manner of refreshment. Or it should be said,
            following Dionysius, that the effect of all sacraments may be
            ascribed to this sacrament, inasmuch as it is the perfection of
            every sacrament, having in principle and in totality, as it were,
            all that the other sacraments contain one by one.</font

            necessity as regards its effect, because it wipes away original sin,
            the remaining of which bars salvation; and therefore it was
            necessary that in the Old Law there should correspond to it some
            figure that was provided as a remedy against original sin, namely
            circumcision. But the Eucharist is a sacrament of necessity as
            regards faith in that which it represents, namely the work of our
            redemption; and therefore it was not necessary that there should
            have been figures providing a remedy, but rather [that there be
            figures] serving exclusively as signs [of the redemption to
            come].</font

            providebatur: aqua etiam sanguini admixta in passione Christi
            populum significat Christi sanguine communicantem. Non autem ita est
            in aliis sacrificiis; et ideo quamvis sint figurae Christi passi,

            >6. To the sixth, it should be said that although in the Old Law
            there were many figures materially [considered], nevertheless all of
            them are led back to these [that the Master mentions]: since in all
            sacrifices and oblations of old, there was signified that which is
            the reality and sacrament in the Eucharist, which indeed was
            signified by the paschal lamb, namely the very Christ who offered
            himself an oblation and victim to God the Father on our behalf. Or
            it should be said that those figures represent the body of Christ
            according as it is for the use of the faithful by way of eating,
            which is evident in the offering of Melchisadech, who offered
            Abraham bread and wine for the purpose of eating it; and in like
            manner the paschal lamb was slain in order to be eaten by the
            people; and the manna, too, was provided by God with a view to the
            feeding of the people. The water, too, mixed with blood in the
            Passion of Christ signifies the people sharing in the blood of
            Christ. But it is not so in other sacrifices; and therefore although
            they are figures of the Christ who suffered, they are not
            appropriate figures of this
            <i>sacrament.</i>
            In the Canon of the Mass mention is made of the oblation of Abraham
            and Abel, however, more on account of the devotion of the ones
            offering than on account of the figurative nature of the thing
            offered.</font
