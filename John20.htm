          <td>2470 Having related the mysteries of the passion of Christ, the Evangelist now speaks of the resurrection. First, he says the resurrection was made known to certain women; secondly, to the disciples (v 19). The revelation of Christ's resurrection to the women went in stages: first, there is the open tomb; secondly, the appearance of the angel (v 11); thirdly, the sight of Christ (v 14). In regard to the first, he first mentions the sight of the open tomb; secondly, this news is reported to the disciples (v 2); and thirdly, they see for themselves (v 3).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum quatuor consideranda occurrunt. Primo scilicet visionis tempus, quia <i>una sabbati</i>, scilicet prima feria. Nam apud Iudaeos dies sabbati solemnior habebatur, et ideo ab eo omnis alius dies denominabatur: unde dicebant prima sabbati, secunda sabbati et cetera. Unde et Matth. XXVIII, v. 1, dicit <i>prima sabbati</i>. Sed Ioannes dicit: <i>una sabbati</i>, propter mysterium, quia in hac die, in qua resurrectio facta est, inchoavit quasi quaedam nova creatura; Ps. CIII, 30: <i>emitte spiritum tuum, et creabuntur, et renovabis faciem terrae</i>; Gal. VI, 15: <i>in Christo Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet neque praeputium, sed nova creatura</i>. Moyses autem in principio Gen. de prima die non dicit factus est dies primus, sed unus. Ideo Evangelista ad ipsam renovationem insinuandam utitur verbo Moysi. Item quia in hac die inchoabatur dies aeternitatis, quae est una non habens interpolationem noctis; quia sol qui eam facit, non occidit. Apoc. XXI, 23: <i>civitas illa non eget sole neque luna ut luceant in ea: nam claritas Dei illuminabit illam, et lucerna eius est agnus</i>; Zach. ult., 7: <i>erit dies una, quae nota est domino, non dies neque nox: et in tempore vesperi erit lux</i>.
          <td>2471 Four things can be noted about the first. First, the time: it was <b>one day of the sabbath,</b> that is, the first day of the week. The Jews considered the sabbath as a very sacred day, and all the other days were described in reference to the sabbath. Thus they spoke of the first day of the sabbath, the second day of the sabbath, and so on. Matthew [28:1] speaks of the "first day of the sabbath". But John speaks of "one day of the sabbath" because he is referring to a mystery, for this day of the resurrection was the beginning of a new creation: "When you send forth your Spirit, they are created; and you renew the face of the ground" (Ps 104:30); "For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation" (Gal 6:15). In Genesis (1:5), when Moses is speaking of the first day of creation he says "one day." "God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day." And so the Evangelist uses these words of Moses because he wants to express a newness. And also because this day begins the day of eternity, which is one day, no night interrupting it, because the sun which makes this day will never set. "And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is the Lamb" (Rev 21:23); "There will be one day, which is known to the Lord, not day and night, for at evening time there will be light" [Zech 14:7].

          <td>Secundo ponitur persona videns, quia <i>Maria Magdalene venit mane, cum adhuc tenebrae essent, ad monumentum</i>. Sed hic est dubium: quia in Mc. XVI, 1, dicitur: <i>Maria Magdalene et Iacobi et Salome</i>; et Matth. ult. connumeratur etiam alia Maria. Responsio. Dicendum secundum Augustinum, quod Maria Magdalena ferventior et devotior erat ad Christum aliis mulieribus: unde Lc. VII, 47, dicitur: <i>dimissa sunt ei peccata multa, quoniam dilexit multum</i>. Et ideo eam Evangelista specialius nominat. Et inde est quod prius ei apparuit dominus, Mc. ult. Sap. VI, 14: <i>praeoccupat eos qui se concupiscunt, ut illis se prior ostendat</i>.
          <td>
            2472 Secondly, the person who saw the tomb is given, <b>Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still dark.</b> A question arises here because Mark (16:1) makes mention of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome; and Matthew (28:1) also mentions "the other Mary." According to Augustine the resolution is that Mary Magdalene was more ardent and more devoted to Christ than the other women. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title="" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Thus we read that "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much" (Lk 7:47). And for this reason the Evangelist mentions her by name. This is also the reason why the Lord appeared to her first, "He appeared first to Mary Magdalene" (Mk 16:9); "She [Wisdom] hastens to make herself known to those who desire her" (Wis 6:14).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio ponitur hora, seu qualitas temporis, quia <i>mane, cum adhuc tenebrae essent</i>; Lc. XXIII, 55 s. dicitur, quod mulieres quae cum Iesu venerunt de Galilaea viderunt monumentum, et quemadmodum positum erat corpus Iesu, et revertentes paraverunt aromata et unguenta, et sabbato quidem siluerunt secundum mandatum. Et ideo statim transacto sabbato ante lucem primae sabbati venit ad monumentum: nam nimius ardor amoris eam sollicitabat; Cant. VIII, 6: <i>lampades eius lampades ignis atque flammarum</i>, scilicet caritatis.
          <td>2473 Thirdly, the time is given, <b>early, while it was still dark.</b> Luke (23:55) tells us that the women who had come with Christ from Galilee saw his tomb and how his body was laid, and they prepared spices and ointments for it. They rested on the sabbath according to the commandment. As soon as the sabbath was over, on the first day of the week, before daylight, she [Mary Magdalene] came to the tomb, incited by her exceedingly great love: "Its flashes," the flashes of love, "are flashes of fire" (Song 8:6).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed hic est quaestio litteralis: quia, ut dicitur Mc. ult., 2, <i>valde mane orto iam sole</i>, quid igitur dicit Evangelista <i>cum adhuc tenebrae essent?</i> Responsio. Dicendum quod hoc quod dicit Marcus intelligitur de aurora: unde orto iam sole, non quod supra terram appareret, sed appropinquaret ad nostras regiones.
          <td>2474 The question arises why Mark says "very early, after the sun had risen" [Mk 16:2], while the Evangelist says, <b>while it was still dark.</b> The answer is that what Mark says should be understood as referring to the breaking of the day, so that the sun had risen, but had not yet appeared in the sky.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quarto quid videt: quia <i>vidit revolutum lapidem</i>, quod erat signum vel quod aliquis Christum abstulerit, vel quod resurrexerit. Et, sicut dicitur Matth. ult., v. 2, <i>Angelus domini descendit de caelo</i>: quod non est intelligendum quod ante lapis esset revolutus quam Christus resurgeret, sed post. Nam Christus exivit de clauso utero virginis nondum gloriosum corpus habens, non est ergo mirum si cum corpore glorioso exivit de sepulcro. Nam lapis est revolutus, ut, videntes ibi Christum non esse, facilius crederent eius resurrectionem.
          <td>2475 Fourthly, we are told what Mary saw, she <b>saw that the stone had been taken away from the tomb.</b> This was a sign that either someone had taken Christ away, or that he had arisen. When Matthew (28:2) says that "an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone," we should not think the stone was rolled away before Christ arose, but only after. For since Christ came forth from the closed womb of the Virgin even though his body was not glorified, it is not surprising if he passed through the tomb with his glorified body. The stone was taken away so that people could see that Christ was not there, and more easily believe in his resurrection.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>cucurrit ergo ad Simonem Petrum</i>, ponitur rei visae denuntiatio. Ex nimio enim amore non distulit nuntiare discipulis quod vidit; sed <i>cucurrit, et venit ad Simonem Petrum, et alium discipulum quem diligebat Iesus</i>. IV Reg. VII, 9: <i>haec dies boni nuntii est: si tacuerimus, et noluerimus nuntiare usque ad mane, sceleris arguemur</i>. Sic qui audit verba Dei, debet festinus aliis dicere. Apoc. ult., 17: <i>qui audit dicat, veni</i>. Sed ad illos venit qui praecipui erant, et Christum ferventius diligebant, ut aut secum quaererent, aut secum dolerent.
          <td>2476 Next the Evangelist mentions that this was reported. Because of Mary's exceeding love she could not delay telling what she had seen to the disciples, <b>so she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved</b>: "This day is a day of good news; if we are silent and wait until the morning light, punishment will overtake us" (2 Kgs 7:9). And so one who hears the words of God should tell it to others without delay: "Let him who hears say, 'Come'" (Rev 22:17). Mary came to those who were the more important, and who loved Christ more ardently, so that they might either look for Jesus with her or share her sorrow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et dicit eis <i>tulerunt dominum de monumento</i>. Viso enim sepulcro vacuo, nondum habens in corde quod Christus resurrexerit, dicit <i>et nescimus ubi posuerunt eum</i>. Ubi dat intelligere quod non sola fuerit ad monumentum, et quod adhuc de resurrectione dubitaret. Et ideo Evangelista non sine causa dixit <i>cum adhuc tenebrae essent</i>, per qualitatem temporis, qualitatem mentis, in qua dubitationis tenebrae erant, designans. Ps. LXXXI, 5: <i>nescierunt neque intellexerunt: in tenebris ambulant</i>. Sed attende, quod in Graecis codicibus habetur <i>dominum meum</i>, ad designandum propensiorem caritatem, et famulatus affectum; Ps. LXXII, 25: <i>quid mihi est in caelo, et a te quid volui super terram? Defecit caro mea et cor meum: Deus cordis mei, et pars mea Deus in aeternum</i>.
          <td>She said to them, <b>They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.</b> Mary saw the empty tomb, and not yet having it in her heart that Christ had risen, she said, <b>and we do not know where they have laid him.</b> We can see from this that Mary had not been alone at the tomb, and that she still had doubts about the resurrection. So it was not without reason that the Evangelist wrote that <b>it was still dark</b>, for this indicated the condition of their minds, in which there was the darkness of doubt: "They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness" (Ps 82:5). Note that in the Greek manuscripts it reads, <b>my Lord</b>, which shows the impetus of her love and her affectionate devotion: "Whom have I in heaven but you? And there is nothing upon earth that I desire besides you.... God is the strength of my heart and my portion for ever" (Ps 73:25).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>exiit ergo Petrus et ille alius discipulus</i>, ponitur denuntiatae rei inquisitio: et primo ponitur quaerentium studium ad inquirendum; et hoc per exitum, dum dicit <i>exiit ergo Petrus et alius discipulus</i>. Qui enim scrutari vult mysteria Christi, debet exire quodammodo a se, et a carnali consuetudine. Cant. III, 11: <i>egredimini et videte, filiae Sion, regem Salomonem</i>.
          <td>2477 The Evangelist next shows how this was investigated. First, he indicates the eagerness with which Peter and John acted, for they left the place where they were, <b>Peter then came out with the other disciple.</b> Those who want to look into the mysteries of Christ have in a sense to come out from themselves and from their carnal way of living: "Come out, O daughters of Zion, and behold King Solomon" [Song 3:11].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ponitur inquisitionis ordo seu modus. Et primo quantum ad cursum, quia <i>currebant duo simul</i>, qui prae ceteris Christum diligebant. Ps. CXVIII, 32: <i>viam mandatorum tuorum cucurri</i>; 1 Cor. IX, 25: <i>sic currite ut comprehendatis</i>.
          <td>2478 Secondly, we see the details of their search. First, it is said that they ran, <b>they both ran</b>, they who loved Christ more than the others: "I will run in the way of your commandments" (Ps 119:32); "So run that you may obtain it," the prize (1 Cor 9:25).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo quantum ad adventum, quia et <i>ille alius discipulus praecucurrit citius Petro</i>, ubi primo ponitur quomodo Ioannes praevenit; secundo quomodo Petrus eum sequitur, ibi <i>venit ergo Simon Petrus sequens eum</i>.
          <td>2479 Secondly, we see how the disciples arrived, <b>the other disciple outran Peter.</b> John arrived first, and Peter followed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed nota, quod non sine causa Evangelista etiam particularia diligenter narrat. Nam istis duobus discipulis, populus duplex, Iudaeorum scilicet et gentilium designatur. Quia licet Iudaei prius habuerint cognitionem unius veri Dei, tamen quantum ad statum mundi, populus gentium est antiquior: quia ex gentilibus processerunt etiam Iudaei. Gen. XII, 1: <i>egredere de terra tua et de cognatione tua</i>. Isti simul currebant, vel decursum huius mundi: Iudaei per litteram legis, gentiles per legem naturae; vel simul currunt naturali desiderio ad beatitudinem et veritatis cognitionem, quam omnes homines natura scire desiderant. <i>Sed ille alius discipulus</i>, scilicet minor, <i>praecucurrit citius Petro</i>: quia gentiles ad cognitionem veritatis tardius venerunt quam Iudaei, quia quondam Deus erat tantum in Iudaea notus, unde dicunt Ps. CXLVII, 20: <i>non fecit taliter omni nationi.</i>
          <td>2480 It is not without reason that the Evangelist is careful to tell us the smallest details. For these two disciples signify two peoples, the Jews [by John] and the Gentiles [by Peter]. Although the Jews were the first to have knowledge of the one true God, the Gentiles were an older people, because even the Jews originated from the Gentiles: "Go from your country and your kindred" (Gen 12:1). These two people were both running over the course of this world: the Jews using the written law, the Gentiles using the law of nature. Or, they were both running by their natural desire for happiness and for a knowledge of the truth, which all men desire to know by their very nature. <b>But the other disciple</b>, that is, the younger one, <b>outran Peter</b>, because the Gentiles came to a knowledge of the truth more slowly than the Jews, since formerly God was known only in Judea. So the Psalm says, "He has not dealt thus with any other nation" (Ps 147:20).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et venit prior ad monumentum: quia prius consideravit mysteria Christi, et prius Iudaeis de Christo facta est promissio. Rom.

          <td>The other disciple <b>reached the tomb first</b>, because he [John, the younger, representing the Jews] was the first to look upon the mysteries of Christ, and the promise was first made to the Jews: "They are the Israelites, and to them belong the... promises; to them belong the patriarchs, and of their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ" (Rom 9:4).

Non tamen introivit</i>: quia non pervenit ad veritatis cognitionem dum in mortuum credere noluit. Et hoc dicitur Lc. c. XV, 25 ss. de fratre maiore, qui audiens symphoniam et tripudia fratri revertenti facta, noluit intrare: cum tamen introitum promittat David, dicens Ps. XLII, 4: <i>introibo ad altare Dei</i>.
          <td><b>And stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there, but he did not go in. And stooping</b>, under the yoke of the law, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do" (Ex 24:7), <b>he saw the linen cloths lying there</b>, that is, the figures or foreshadowings of all the mysteries, "But their minds were hardened; for to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains uplifted" (2 Cor 3:14). <b>But he did not go in</b>, for as long as he was unwilling to believe in the one who was dead he had not yet come to the knowledge of the truth. Another who did not go in was the brother of the prodigal son, for when he heard the celebrations, the music and the dancing, he "refused to go in" (Lk 15:28). Nevertheless, David promised that they would enter: "I will go to the altar of God" (Ps 43:4).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic agitur de perventione Petri. Et secundum litteram, quod simul currebant, signum erat ferventis devotionis; sed Ioannes citius pervenit, quia iunior erat sene Petro. Sed secundum mysterium, Petrus Ioannem sequitur: quia gentiles ad Christum conversi, non erant congregandi in aliam Ecclesiam ab Ecclesia Iudaeorum, sed inserendi in praecedentem olivam et Ecclesiam: Rom. XI. Et ideo apostolus, I Thess. II, 14, commendans eos, dicit: <i>vos autem, fratres, facti estis imitatores Ecclesiarum quae sunt in Iudaea in Christo Iesu</i>.
          <td>2481 Now the Evangelist recounts the arrival of Peter. As for the literal meaning, the fact that they ran together was a sign of their passionate devotion. John arrived first because he was a younger man than Peter. But considering the mystical sense, Peter follows John because the Gentiles who were converted to Christ were not joined to another church different from the church of the Jews, but were grafted on to the already existing olive tree and church. The Apostle praises them saying, "For you brethren, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus which are in Judea" (1 Thess 2:14).

          <td>Tertio ponitur ordo inquisitionis quantum ad eorum ingressum, quia <i>introivit in monumentum</i>, et primo ponitur quomodo Petrus intravit primo; secundo quomodo Ioannes, ibi <i>tunc ergo introivit in monumentum</i>.
          <td>2482 Thirdly, we see the order in which they entered, Peter first, and then John.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo, quod Petrus introivit in monumentum: et quidem, secundum litteram, Ioannes, qui primo pervenit, non intravit propter reverentiam Petri, cui priorem ingressum servabat. Sed secundum mysterium, signatur quod populus Iudaeorum, qui primo mysteria incarnationis audivit, posterius ad fidem convertitur quam populus gentium. Rom. IX, 30: <i>gentes quae non sectabantur iustitiam, apprehenderunt iustitiam (...). Israel vero sectando legem iustitiae, in legem iustitiae non pervenit. Et vidit</i>, scilicet Petrus, <i>posita linteamina</i>. Ioannes vidit sola linteamina quae Petrus similiter vidit: quia non reprobamus vetus testamentum, nam <i>aperuit eis sensum, ut intelligerent Scripturas</i>. Sed adhuc ulterius vidit <i>sudarium quod fuerat super caput eius</i>. I Cor. XI, 3: <i>caput Christi Deus</i>. Videre ergo sudarium quod fuerat super caput Iesu, est habere fidem divinitatis Christi, quam Iudaei acceptare noluerunt. Quod quidem sudarium describitur et separatum ab aliis, et <i>involutum</i>, et <i>in unum locum</i>: quia divinitas Christi occulta est, et separata ab omni creatura: <i>est super omnia Deus benedictus in saecula, amen</i>; Is. XLV, 15: <i>vere tu es Deus absconditus. Involutum</i> vidit quasi in modum circuli: quia lintei quando involvuntur nec initium nec finis in eis aspicitur: celsitudo divinitatis est, quae nec coepit esse nec desinit. Hebr. ult., 8: <i>Iesus Christus heri et hodie, ipse et in saecula</i>; Ps. ci, 28: <i>tu autem idem ipse es, et anni tui non deficient</i>. Sed <i>in unum locum</i> viderunt, quia Deus non habitat ubi est scissura mentium; sed illi eius merentur gratiam qui sunt unum per caritatem. Ps. LXXV, 3: <i>in pace factus est locus eius</i>; I Cor. XIV, 33: <i>non est Deus dissensionis, sed pacis</i>.
          <td>2483 The Evangelist says that Peter entered the tomb. According to the literal meaning, although John arrived first, he did not enter because of his respect for Peter. But considering the mystical interpretation, this signifies that the Jewish people, who were the first to hear of the mysteries of the incarnation, would be converted to the faith after the Gentiles: "That Gentiles, who did not pursue righteousness have attained it... but that Israel who pursued the righteousness which is based in law did not succeed in fulfilling that law" (Rom 9:30). John saw only the linen cloths. He, Peter, also <b>saw the linen cloths</b> because we [Gentiles] do not reject the Old Testament, for as Luke says, "Then he opened their minds to understand the scriptures" (Lk 24:45). But in addition Peter saw <b>the napkin which had been on his head</b>: "The head of Christ is God" (1 Cor 11:3). Thus to see the napkin which had been on the head of Jesus is to have faith in the divinity of Christ, which the Jews refused to accept. This napkin is described as <b>not lying with the linen cloths, and rolled up, having a place by itself</b>, because the divinity of Christ is covered over, and it is apart from every creature because of its excellence: "God who is over all be blessed for ever" (Rom 9:5); "Truly, you art a God who hides yourself" (Is 45:15). He saw the napkin <b>rolled up</b>, to form a circle. And when linen is rolled this way one can not see its beginning or end, for the eminence of the divinity neither begins nor ends: "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever" (Heb 13:8); "You are the same, and your years have no end" (Ps 102:27). The napkin was in one place, <b>a place by itself</b>, because God does not dwell where minds are divided; those who merit his grace are those who are one in charity: "His place is in peace" [Ps 76:2]; "For God is not a God of confusion but of peace" (1 Cor 14:33).

I, 14: <i>facta sunt mihi molesta, laboravi sustinens</i>. Et praecipue hunc laborem pertulit Christus in humanitate assumpta. Thren. III, 30: <i>dabit percutienti se maxillam, saturabitur opprobriis</i>. Hoc igitur sudarium longe seorsum invenitur, quia ipsa redemptoris nostri passio longe est a nostra passione disiuncta. Nam per linteamina, quae ita se habent ad membra sicut sudarium ad caput, intelliguntur passiones sanctorum, a quibus sudarium seorsum, scilicet passio Christi: quoniam ipse sine culpa pertulit, quod nos cum culpa toleramus. I Petr. III, 18: <i>Christus, mortuus est, iustus pro iniustis</i>. Ipse sponte morti succumbere voluit. Supra X, 18: <i>nemo tollit a me animam meam: sed ego pono eam a meipso</i>; Eph. V, v. 2: <i>dilexit nos, et tradidit semetipsum pro nobis</i>. Sed sancti ad mortem vadunt inviti. Infra ult., 18: <i>alius te cinget, et ducet quo tu non vis</i>.
          <td>2484 Or, in another interpretation, the napkin, which workers use to wipe the sweat off their faces can be understood to indicate the labor of God. For while God always remains tranquil, he presents himself as laboring and burdened when he endures the stubborn depravity of mankind: "They have become a burden to me, I am weary of bearing them" (Is 1:14). Christ took on this burden in a special way when he took on a human nature: "Let him give his cheek to the smiter, and be filled with insults" (Lam 3:30). This napkin is found separate and apart from the other cloths because the sufferings of our Redeemer are far apart and separate from our sufferings. The other linen cloths, which are related to the members of the body as the napkin is to the head, indicate the sufferings of the saints, which are separate from the napkin, that is, the sufferings of Christ, for Christ suffered without fault what we suffer because of our faults: "For Christ also died... the righteous for the unrighteous" (1 Pet 3:18). He went to his death willingly ‑"No one takes it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (10:18); "Christ loved us and gave himself up for us" (Eph 5:2) ‑ while the saints go to their death reluctantly, "Another will gird you and carry you where you do not wish to go" (21:18).

Nam si hoc modo aliqui transtulissent illud: non utique eum denudassent, praecipue cum oportuisset eos festinanter hoc facere propter praesentiam custodum: neque etiam fuissent ita solliciti ut levarent sudarium, et involverent, et seorsum in unum locum ponerent, sed ea simpliciter ut contigisset, suscepto corpore, dimisissent.

            2485 Why was the Evangelist so careful to mention all these details?

Nor would they be so careful to lift off the napkin and roll it up and place it in a separate place. They would simply have taken the body as they found it. This was why he allowed himself to be buried with myrrh and aloes: they glue the cloths to the body so that they cannot be quickly removed.

          <td>2486 When the Evangelist says, <b>Then the other disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in</b>, he tells of John's entrance. John did not remain outside but entered after Peter, because when the world is ending, the Jews will also be gathered into the faith: "A hardening has come upon part of Israel, until the full number of the Gentiles come in, and so all Israel will be saved" (Rom 11:25); "A remnant will be saved" [Is 10:21].

Contingit autem plerumque quod prius perveniat ad cognitionem mysteriorum Christi contemplativus, sua docilitate, sed non intrat: quia quandoque praecedit intellectus, et sequitur tardus aut nullus affectus.

These two disciples stand for two kinds of people: John represents those who are devoted to the contemplation of truth, and Peter stands for those whose main interest is to carry out the commandments. In fact, "Simon" means "obedient." Now it very often happens that contemplatives, because they are docile, are the first to become acquainted with a knowledge of the mysteries of Christ ‑ but they do not enter, for sometimes there is knowledge, but little or no love follows. While those in the active life, because of their continuing fervor and earnestness, even though they are slower to understand, enter into them more quickly, so that those who are later to arrive, are the first to penetrate the divine mysteries: "So the last will be first, and the first last" (Mt 20:16).

Their fear was so great that they did not stay together: I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter" [Zech 13:7]; "The holy stones lie scattered at the head of every street" (Lam 4:1). Further, she stood there, lingering near the tomb, <b>Mary stood weeping outside the tomb.</b> The disciples had left, but a stronger and more burning affection fixed the weaker sex to the spot.

Dicendum, quod monumentum Christi erat excisum in lapide, et circa ipsum erat clausura horti, sicut supra habitum est. Quandoque ergo monumentum vocant Evangelistae solum locum ubi corpus reconditum fuit, quandoque totum illud quod clausum erat. Cum ergo dicitur quod ingressae sunt monumentum, intelligendum de tota clausura horti; sed hoc quod dicitur <i>stabat foris</i>, intelligendum est de illo saxei sepulcri loco, sed tamen intra illud spatium quod iam ingressae fuerant, ubi stabat propter amoris constantiam, quae mentem eius accenderat. I Cor. XV, 58: <i>stabiles estote et immobiles, abundantes in opere domini semper</i>; Ps. CXXI, v. 2: <i>stantes erant pedes nostri</i>.
          <td>2492 A question arises here, because Mark (16:5‑8) says that the women "went out and fled from the tomb." Therefore, they must have been within it. Why then does John say that <b>Mary stood outside</b> ? We should say to answer this that the tomb of Christ was hewn out of rock and surrounded by a garden, as was stated before. Sometimes, therefore, the Evangelists calls only the place where the body of Christ had been laid the tomb, and at other times the entire enclosure is called the tomb. Thus when the women are said to enter into the tomb [as in Mark 16:5], this should be understood to mean the entire enclosure. But when it says here that <b>Mary stood outside</b>, the Evangelist is referring to the tomb hewn out of rock. But this rock‑hewn tomb was within the enclosure they had already entered. Mary was standing here because of the unwavering love which had inflamed her heart "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord" (1 Cor 15:58); "Our feet have been standing within your gates" (Ps 122:2).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

Est autem duplex lacrymarum gemitus: scilicet compunctionis ad peccata abluenda, Ps. VI, 7: <i>lacrymis meis stratum meum rigavi</i>; et devotionis ad caelestia desideranda, Ps. CXXV, 6: <i>euntes ibant, et flebant mittentes semina sua</i>, idest properantes ad caelestia. Sed Maria Magdalena lacrymis quidem compunctionis abundavit tempore suae conversionis, quando quae fuerat in civitate peccatrix, amando veritatem lavit lacrymis maculas criminis. Lc. VII, 47: <i>dimissa sunt ei peccata multa, quoniam dilexit multum</i>. Abundavit etiam lacrymis devotionis in Christi passione et resurrectione, ut habetur hic.
          <td>2493 Secondly, Mary's devotion is admired because it issued in tears, for she stood there <b>weeping</b>: "She weeps bitterly in the night" (Lam 1:2). There are two kinds of tears: tears of compunction, to wash away sins ‑ "Every night I flood my bed with tears" (Ps 6:7) ‑ and tears of devotion, from a desire for heavenly things ‑ "He goes forth," hastening towards heavenly things, "weeping, bearing the seed for sowing" (Ps 126:6). Mary Magdalene had copious tears of compunction at the time of her conversion, when she had been the village sinner. Then, in her love for the truth, she washed the stains of her sins with her tears: "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much" (Lk 7:47). She also shed abundant tears of devotion over the passion and resurrection of Christ, as we see here.

          <td>Tertio commendatur eius devotio ex inquisitionis diligentia. Unde dicit <i>dum ergo fleret, inclinavit se et prospexit in monumentum</i>. Fletus enim iste ex desiderio amoris proveniebat. Natura enim amoris est quod velit dilectum praesentem habere, et si hoc non potest in re, saltem eius praesentiam habet in cognitione. Matth. VI, 21: <i>ubi est thesaurus tuus, ibi est et cor tuum</i>. Amare ergo flebat Maria, quia oculi qui dominum quaesierant et non invenerant, lacrymis vacabant, amplius dolens quod ablatus fuit de monumento: quoniam magistri tanti, cuius vita subtracta fuerat, memoria remanebat. Et ideo quia eum habere non poterat, volens saltem videre locum ubi positus fuerat, <i>inclinavit se, et prospexit in monumentum</i>. In quo datur intelligi quod in mortem Christi debemus prospicere cum humilitate cordis. Matth. XI, 25: <i>abscondisti haec a sapientibus et prudentibus, et revelasti ea parvulis. Et prospexit</i>, ut daret exemplum continue oculis mentis mortem Christi prospicere: quia amanti semel aspexisse non sufficit, cuius vis amoris intentionem multiplicat inquisitionis. Hebr. XII, 2: <i>aspicientes in auctorem fidei et consummatorem Iesum, qui proposito sibi gaudio, sustinuit crucem confusione contempta. Inclinavit</i> autem <i>se, et prospexit</i>, quia caritas Christi eam urgebat. II Cor. V, 14: <i>caritas Christi urget nos</i>. Vel potius, secundum Augustinum, divino instinctu in animo eius factum est ut perspiceret, et altius aliquid videret, scilicet Angelos; Rom. VIII, 14: <i>qui spiritu Dei aguntur, hi sunt filii Dei</i>.
          <td>
            2494 Thirdly, her devotion is admired because of her earnest search for Christ, <b>and as she wept she stooped to look into the tomb.</b> This weeping of Mary came from the desire of love. For it is the nature of love to want its beloved present; and if the beloved cannot be really present, it at least wants to think of the beloved: "Where your treasure is, there will your heart be also" (Mt 6:21). Mary shed these bitter tears because the eyes which had sought her Lord and did not find him were now freed for tears, and she grieved the more because he had been taken from the tomb. The life of such a Teacher had been destroyed, but his memory remained. Since Mary could not have him present, she wanted at least to look at the place where he had been buried, so <b>she stooped</b> to look into the tomb. We learn from this that we should look at the death of Christ with a humble heart: "You have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to babes" (Mt 11:25). She stooped <b>to look,</b> giving us the example to look continually on the death of Christ with the eyes of our mind, for one look is not enough for one who loves, for the force of love increases the desire to explore: "Looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame" (Heb 12:2). <b>She stooped to look,</b> pressed down by the love of Christ: "The love of Christ presses us" [2 Cor 5:14]. Or again, according to Augustine, by a divine impulse in her soul she was made to look about, and saw something greater, the angels: "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom 8:14). <a href="John20.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title="" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

          <td>A question arises here because Matthew (28:2) and Mark (16:5) say that Mary and the other women saw one angel on the right side of the tomb, while here we have two angels and they are inside. Each one is correct, for Matthew and Mark tell what occurred first, when the women first came, and believing that Christ was taken, returned to the disciples. But John recounts what happened after Mary returned with the disciples and remained after they had left.

          <td>2497 Secondly, he mentions their raiment, <b>in white</b>. This shows the splendor of the resurrection and the glory of the risen Christ: "They shall walk with me in white" (Rev 3:4).

          <td>2498 Thirdly, we see that they were <b>sitting</b>. This indicates the calmness and power of Christ, who being now at rest from all afflictions, reigns in immortal flesh and sitting at the right hand of the Father: "Sit at my right hand" (Ps 110:1); he will sit "upon the throne of David, and over his kingdom" (Is 9:7).

          <td>2499 Fourthly, we see how they were positioned, <b>one at the head and one at the feet</b>. We can refer this to three things. First, to the two Testaments. The word "angel" in Greek means "messenger," and both Testaments brought messages about Christ: "And the crowds that went before him and that followed him shouted, 'Hosanna to the Son of David!'" (Mt 21:9). So the angel sitting at the head signifies the Old Testament, and the angel at the feet the New Testament.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ad praedicatores. In Christo enim est duplex natura, divina scilicet, et humana. Caput autem Christi est Deus, ut dicitur I Cor. XI, 3, pedes vero humanitas; Ps.

Qui ergo annuntiat divinitatem Christi, sicut est illud: <i>in principio erat verbum</i>, sedet ad caput; qui vero humanitatem annuntiat, sicut illud: <i>verbum caro factum est</i>, sedet ad pedes.
          <td>Secondly, we can relate this to those who preach Christ. There are two natures in Christ, the divine and the human: the head of Christ is God (1 Cor 11:3), and the feet of Christ are his human nature: "We will adore in the place where his feet stood" [Ps 132:7]. So, those who preach the divinity of Christ ‑ as in "In the beginning was the Word" (1:1) ‑ are sitting at the head; those who preach his humanity ‑ as in "And the Word became flesh" (1:14) ‑ are sitting at the feet.

          <td>Thirdly, we can refer this to the time when the mysteries of Christ are announced. Then one angel sits at the head and the other at the feet because they signified that the mysteries of Christ would be announced from the head or beginning of the world to its end: "You proclaim the Lord's death until he comes" (1 Cor 11:26).

XXXI, 16: <i>quiescat vox tua a ploratu, et oculi tui a lacrymis, quia est merces operi tuo</i>. Ubi notandum, secundum Gregorium, quod ipsa sacra eloquia quae in nobis lacrymas amoris excitant, easdem lacrymas consolantur, dum nobis redemptoris nostri spem repromittunt. Ps.

            2501 Concerning the first, the angels knew that Mary was uncertain about the resurrection and so as if beginning anew they asked her the reason for her tears: they, the angels, said to her, <b>Woman, why are you weeping?</b> This was like saying: Do not cry for there is no need for it, because "Weeping may tarry for the night," of the passion, "but joy comes with the morning," of the resurrection (Ps 30:5); "Keep your voice from weeping, and your eyes from tears; for your work shall be rewarded" (Jer 31:16). In this regard we can recall to mind that Gregory said that the very same sacred words which excite our tears of love console those same tears when they promise us hope in our Redeemer: "When the cares of my heart are many, your consolations cheer my soul" (Ps 94:19). <a href="John20.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a>

Here she was referring to a part by mentioning the whole, just like we profess that the Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God was buried, although only his flesh was buried, because his divinity was never separated from his flesh. <b>And I do not know where they have laid him.</b> This was the reason for her desolation: she did not know where to go to find him to soothe her sorrow.

          <td>Sed numquid ad consolationem amantis est habere aliquid quod fuit amici? Et quidem, secundum Augustinum, IV confessionum, magis pertinet ad dolorem. Unde ipse dicit, quod fugiebat omnia loca in quibus conversatus fuerat cum amico suo. Et tamen Chrysostomus dicit, quod est ad consolationem. Sed utrumque est verum. In omnibus enim quae habent admixtionem gaudii et tristitiae, spes rei desideratae est delectabilis, Rom. c. XII, 12: <i>spe gaudentes, in tribulatione patientes</i>, est etiam et tristabilis, quia <i>spes quae differtur affligit animam</i>: sed non secundum eamdem rationem. Nam inquantum per spem repraesentatur res amata ut possibilis consequi, causat gaudium; inquantum autem separat actu, absens contristatur. Et sic est in isto loco: quia res amici inquantum repraesentat amicum, amanti delectabilis est; inquantum vero subtractionem amici ad memoriam reducit, tristitiam infert.
          <td>
            2503 Is it a consolation for one who loves to have something that belonged to the beloved? According to Augustine, in his <i>Confessions,</i> this would be more a cause of sorrow. For this reason he said that he fled from all the places where he had formerly spent time with his friend. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Still, Chrysostom says that this would be a cause of consolation. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Each of these is true. In all cases where there is a mixture of joy and sadness, the hope for the thing desired brings pleasure ‑ "Rejoice in your hope, be patient in tribulation" (Rom 12:12) ‑ and also brings sorrow ‑ "Hope deferred makes the heart sick" (Prv 13:12). But hope does not cause these from the same point of view. Hope causes joy because it regards the thing loved as able to be obtained; but insofar as this thing is actually absent it produces sorrow. It is like that here: something belonging to a friend, because it stands for the friend, is pleasant to the lover; while inasmuch as it recalls the absence of the one loved it produces sadness.

            2505 Firstly, then, <b>Saying this,</b> that is, when Mary said this to the angels, <b>she turned round.</b> Chrysostom wonders why Mary, who was speaking to the angels, whom she considered to be at least men deserving of respect, turned around before they had a chance to answer her. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> The answer is that while Mary was responding to the angels' question Christ arrived and the angels stood out of reverence. When Mary saw this, she was puzzled and turned around to see what had made them stand up. Thus in Luke (24:4) mention is made that the two angels were seen standing.

We see from this that if anyone desires to see Christ, they must turn round to him: "Return to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to you" (Zech 1:3). Those come to the point of seeing him who entirely turn themselves to him by love: "She [Wisdom] hastens to make herself known to those who desire her" (Wis 6:14).

Christ asked her whom she was looking for in order to increase this desire, for when she spoke of the one she was seeking, her love burned more intensely, and so she would continue to seek him: "Seek his presence continually" (Ps 105:4); "But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day" (Prv 4:18).

As Gregory says: "This woman, in erring did not err, when she thought that Christ was a gardener, for he planted the seeds of virtue in her heart by the strength of his love." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> "I will water my orchard and drench my garden plot" (Sir 24:31).

But since this "gardener" had just arrived, and Mary had not told him whom she was looking for, why does she say, <b>if you have carried him away?</b> Who was <b>him</b> ? We should say that the force of love usually causes the lover to think that no one would be ignorant of the one who is always in his thoughts. For example, we read in Luke that our Lord asked [on the road to Emmaus] "What is this conversation which your are holding with each other as your walk?" And one of the disciples answered, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who does not know the things that have happened there in these days" (Lk 24:17).

            2514 Wasn't Mary always looking at Christ when he was speaking to her?

Et si dicas eum a discipulis se tangi voluisse, non autem a mulieribus; hoc non potest stare, quia Matth. ult., 9, dicitur de Magdalena et aliis mulieribus quia accesserunt et tenuerunt pedes eius. Intelligendum est ergo, secundum litteram, quod mulier haec bis vidit Angelos in hoc itinere. Primo quidem simul cum aliis mulieribus vidit unum Angelum sedentem super lapidem, ut dicitur Matth. XXVIII, 2 et Mc. c. XVI, 5. Secundo vero in reditu vidit duos Angelos intus in monumento, sicut dicit Ioannes. Similiter etiam in hoc eodem itinere bis vidit Christum. Primo quidem in horto, quando aestimavit eum hortulanum, ut supra habitum est; secundo in via, quando currebat cum aliis annuntiare discipulis quae viderat, ut magis firmarentur in fide resurrectionis: et tunc accesserunt et tenuerunt pedes eius, ut dicunt Matthaeus et Marcus.
          <td>
            2516 He does two things about the first: he states the prohibition, and then gives the reason for it. Christ warns Mary not to touch him, saying, <b>Do not hold me.</b> Even though we do not read here that Mary wanted to touch Christ, Gregory says we can see from this that Mary fell at the feet of Christ and wanted to grasp the one she had recognized. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a> He adds the reason, <b>for I have not yet ascended to my Father.</b> It seems from this that after his resurrection, Christ did not want to be touched before he ascended. But the opposite is found in Luke (24:39): "Handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones." It is no answer to say that Christ wanted to be touched by his disciples, but not by the women, for we see in Matthew (28:9), that Mary Magdalene and other women came to him and did grasp him by his feet. Therefore, we should understand, according to the letter of the text, that Mary saw angels at two times: the first time was with the other women, when she saw one angel sitting on the stone, as Matthew (28:2) says, and Mark (16:5); the second time was when she returned and saw two angels inside the tomb, as John (20:12) says. Similarly, she also saw Christ two times: first in the garden, when she thought he was the gardener, as we just saw; secondly, she saw him when she was running with the other women to tell the disciples what they had seen (in order to strengthen them in their faith in the resurrection). It was this second time that they approached and held Christ's feet, as Matthew (28:9) and Mark (16:9) say.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Est autem duplex ratio mystica quare tangi noluit. Una, quia haec mulier significabat Ecclesiam gentium, quae Christum non erat tactura per fidem, nisi cum ascendisset ad patrem. Ps. VII, 8: <i>synagoga populorum circumdabit te: propter hanc in altum regredere</i>. Alia ratio est, quia secundum Augustinum I de Trinitate cap. IX, tactus facit quasi finem cognitionis. Quando enim videmus rem, utcumque eam cognoscimus; sed per tactum consummatam cognitionem de ea habemus. Mulier autem haec aliquam fidem habebat de Christo sicut de sancto viro, unde et magistrum eum vocabat: necdum ad hoc pervenerat ut cognosceret eum aequalem patri et unum cum Deo. Et ideo dicit <i>noli me tangere</i> idest, non constituas finem tuae notionis in eo quod credis de me, <i>nondum enim ascendi ad patrem meum</i>, scilicet in corde tuo, quia non credis me esse unum cum eo; quod tamen postea credidit. Nam in eius intimis sensibus quodammodo Christus ascendit ad patrem, qui sic in ea profecerat ut patri cognoscat aequalem.
          <td>
            2517 There are two mystical reasons why Christ did not want to be touched. First, because this particular woman signified the Church of the Gentiles, which was not to touch Christ by faith until he had ascended to the Father: "A congregation of people will surround you; for their sakes return on high" [Ps 7:8]. The other reason is given by Augustine in his work on <i>The Trinity.</i> <a href="John20.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> It is that touch is the last stage of knowledge: when we see something, we know it to a certain extent, but when we touch it our knowledge is complete. Now this particular woman had some faith in Christ, which was that he was a holy man; and this was why she called him Teacher. But she had not yet reached the point of believing that he was equal to the Father and one with God. Thus Christ says, <b>Do not hold me</b>, that is, do not allow what you now believe of me to be the limit of your faith, <b>for I have not yet ascended to my Father</b>, that is, in your heart, because you do not believe that I am one with him - yet she did believe this later.

Et ideo ab hac intelligentia eam revocare volens, dicit <i>noli me tangere</i>; quasi dicat: non putes me de cetero habere vitam mortalem et vobiscum eo modo conversari quo primo. II Cor. V, v. 16: <i>et si novimus secundum carnem Christum, sed iam nunc non novimus</i>. Et hoc est quod subdit <i>nondum enim ascendi ad patrem meum</i>. Et tunc non est monitionis ratio, sed tacitae quaestionis responsio, quasi dicat: etsi videas me hic manentem, non est propter hoc quod non habeam gloriosam carnem; sed quia <i>nondum ascendi ad patrem meum</i>.

            2518 Or, we could say, with Chrysostom, that after this woman saw that Christ had arisen, she thought he was in the same state as he was before, having a life subject to death. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" title="" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> She wanted to be with him as she was before his passion, and in her joy thought there was nothing extraordinary about him, although Christ's flesh had become much better by arising. To correct this impression Christ said, <b>Do not hold me.</b> It was like saying: Do not think that I have a mortal life, and can associate with you as before: "Even though we once regarded Christ from a human point of view, we regard him thus no longer" (2 Cor 5:16). This is what he adds when he says, <b>for I have not yet ascended to my Father.</b> Accordingly, this statement does not give the reason for his prohibition, but an answer to an implicit question. It was like saying: Although you see me remaining here, it is not because my flesh is not glorified but because <b>I have not yet ascended to my Father.</b> For before he ascended he wanted to strengthen in the hearts of the apostles their faith in his resurrection and in his divinity.

Thirdly, she had the office of an apostle; indeed, she was an apostle to the apostles insofar as it was her task to announce our Lord's resurrection to the disciples.

The answer to this is that the meaning of these words must be gathered from the circumstances in which they were spoken. Christ said before, <b>go to my brethren</b>.

Thus, the meaning is my Father by nature, and your Father by grace. It is saying in effect: the fact that you are adopted children by grace is due to me: "God sent forth his Son... so that we might receive adoption as sons" (Gal 4:4); "For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the first‑born among many brethren" (Rom 8:29).

Secondly, our Lord appeared to strengthen and comfort them.

The third time was to the two disciples on the road to Emmaus (Lk 24:13).

Sed hoc non potest stare: quia quod corpus humanum non glorificatum, non possit simul cum alio corpore esse, inest sibi ex natura. Oportet ergo quod si corpus glorificatum dicatur habere in se proprietatem aliquam inhaerentem, quod possit simul cum alio corpore esse in eodem loco, quod excludatur ab eo illa proprietas qua nunc impeditur ne simul cum alio possit esse. Haec autem proprietas nullo modo est separabilis vel destructibilis a corpore, cum non sit mathematica corpulentia ut ipsi dicunt, sed ipsae dimensiones corporis quanti, quibus proprie accidit situs. Unde philosophus arguit contra ponentes ideas et materias. Et quod dato etiam quod vacuum esset totum spatium super terram, adhuc corpus sensibile non posset esse simul cum illis, propter dimensiones quantitatis. Per nullam autem proprietatem corporis gloriosi possent removeri dimensiones a corpore, natura corporis remanente. Et ideo dicendum est, quod hoc miraculose Christus fecit virtute suae divinitatis; et quandocumque in sanctis simile contingeret, miraculosum esset, et per novum miraculum fit. Et hoc expresse dicunt Augustinus et Gregorius. Dicit enim Augustinus: <i>quaeris quomodo per ostia clausa intrare potuit? Si comprehendis modum, non est miraculum. Ubi deficit ratio, ibi est fidei aedificatio</i>: et subdit: <i>ille quippe non eis apertis intrare potuit, quo nascente virginitas matris inviolata permansit</i>.

          <td>
            2527 Regarding this point, some say that to enter through closed doors is a property of the glorified body. They say that due to some inherent property in a glorified body, it can be simultaneously present in the same place as another body. Thus, this is accomplished without a miracle. But this position cannot stand, for the fact that a non‑glorified human body cannot be simultaneously in the same place as another body is due to its very nature. Consequently, if the glorified body has an inherent ability to be in a place occupied at the same time by another body, it must be because it lacks the property which now prevents this in the case of a non‑glorified body. But this latter property cannot be separated or destroyed from a body, since it is not a mathematical bulk, as they say, but the very dimensions of the quantified body through which it has a local position. Thus the Philosopher, when he argues against those who posit ideas and matter, asserts that even on the assumption that the entire region above the earth is a vacuum, no sense‑perceptible body could exist there in the same place as another body because of their quantitative dimensions. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a> Now no property of a glorified body can remove the dimensions from a body and have it still remain a body. Thus we should say that Christ did this miraculously, by the power of his divinity, and that whenever something similar happens with the saints, it is miraculous and requires a new miracle. Augustine and Gregory teach this explicitly. Augustine says: "Do you want to know how Christ could enter through closed doors? If you understood how, it would not be a miracle. Where reason falls, faith instructs." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a> And he adds: "He was able to enter with the doors shut, who was born without his mother's virginity being taken away." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn21" name="_ftnref21" id="_ftnref21">[21]</a> So, just as Christ's leaving the womb of his virgin mother was a miracle of his divine power, so was his entering through closed doors.

Also, he wanted to show that we ought to stand among the virtues: "This is the way, walk in it; do not turn asde to the right or to the left" [Is 30:21].

To cure this Jesus offers them the peace of reconciliation with God: "We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son" (Rom 5:10), which he accomplished by his suffering. Their peace with themselves was disturbed because they were depressed and hesitant in their faith. And he offers his peace to cure this: "Great peace have those who love your law" (Ps 119:165). Their peace with others was disturbed because they were being persecuted by the Jews. And to this he says, <b>Peace be with you</b>, to counter the persecution of the Jews: "Peace I leave with you; my peace I give to you" (14:27).

This was a source of strength for the disciples: for they recognized the authority of Christ, and knew that he was sending them by divine authority.

            2538 Jesus makes them adequate for their task by giving them the Holy Spirit, "God, who has qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, not in a written code but in the Spirit" (2 Cor 3:6). In this giving of the Spirit, he first grants them a sign of this gift, which is, that <b>he breathed on them.</b> We see something like this in Genesis (2:7), when God "breathed into his nostrils the breath of life," of natural life, which the first man corrupted, but Christ repaired this by giving the Holy Spirit. We should not suppose that this breath of Christ was the Holy Spirit; it was a sign of the Spirit. So Augustine says, in <i>The Trinity</i>: "This bodily breath was not the substance of the Holy Spirit, but a fitting sign that the Holy Spirit proceeds not just from the Father but also from the Son." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a>

          <td>2539 Notice that the Holy Spirit was sent over Christ, first, in the appearance of a dove, at his baptism (1:32), and then in the appearance of a cloud, at his transfiguration (Mt 17:5). The reason for this is that the grace of Christ, which is given by the Holy Spirit, was to be distributed to us by being proliferated through the sacraments. Consequently, at Christ's baptism the Holy Spirit descended in the form of a dove, which is an animal known for its proliferation. And since the grace of Christ comes through teaching, the Spirit descended in a luminous cloud, and Christ is seen to be a Teacher, "Listen to him" (Mt 17:5). The Spirit descended over the apostles the first time through a breath to indicate the proliferation of grace through the sacraments, whose ministers they were. Thus Christ said, <b>"If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven</b>: "Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" (Mt 28:19). The second time the Spirit descended on them in tongues of fire to indicate the proliferation of grace through teaching; and so we read in Acts (2:4) that right after they were filled with the Holy Spirit they began to speak.

Et quidem, secundum Chrysostomum, quidam dicunt, quod Christus non dedit eis hic spiritum sanctum; sed praeparavit eos ad dationem futuram in Pentecoste. Et moventur ad hoc, quia Daniel. X, 8 dicitur, quod non potuit sustinere visionem Angeli: unde isti nisi praeparati non potuissent sustinere spiritus sancti adventum. Sed tamen ipse Chrysostomus dicit: <i>spiritus sanctus datus fuit discipulis non communiter ad omnia: sed ad aliquem effectum</i>, scilicet ad dimittendum peccata, sicut Matth. X, 8, ad faciendum miracula. Augustinus autem et Gregorius dicunt, quod spiritus sanctus habet duo praecepta dilectionis, scilicet Dei et proximi: et ideo primo datus fuit in terra ad designandum praeceptum dilectionis proximi; secundo de caelo ad designandum praeceptum dilectionis Dei.
          <td>
            2540 We see the words used when the Spirit was given, <b>Receive the Holy Spirit.</b> But did they receive the Holy Spirit then? It seems not, for since Christ had not yet ascended, it was not fitting that he give gifts to us. Indeed, according to Chrysostom, there were some who said that Christ did not give them the Holy Spirit at that time, but prepared them for the future giving of the Spirit at Pentecost. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn23" name="_ftnref23" id="_ftnref23">[23]</a> They were brought to this opinion because Daniel (10:8) could not endure his sight of an angel, and so these disciples could not have endured the coming of the Holy Spirit unless they had been prepared. But Chrysostom himself says that the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples, not for all tasks in general, but for a specific task, that is, to forgive sin. Augustine and Gregory say that the Holy Spirit has two precepts of love: love of God and of neighbor. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn24" name="_ftnref24" id="_ftnref24">[24]</a> Therefore, the Holy Spirit was given the first time on earth to indicate the precept of the love of neighbor; and the Spirit was given the second time from heaven to indicate the precept of the love of God.

Quia: <i>universa delicta operit caritas</i>; I Petr. IV, 8: <i>caritas operit multitudinem peccatorum</i>.
          <td>2541 Thirdly, we see the fruit of the gift, If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven. This forgiving of sins is a fitting effect of the Holy Spirit. This is so because the Holy Spirit is charity, love, and through the Holy Spirit love is given to us: "God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us" (Rom 5:5). Now it is only through love that sins are forgiven, for "Love covers all offenses" (Prv 10:12); "Love covers a multitude of sins" (1 Pet 4:8).

          <td>Hic ergo primo quaeritur de hoc quod dicit <i>quorum remiseritis peccata</i>, cum solus Deus peccata remittat. Ad hoc aliqui dicunt, quod solus Deus remittit culpam; sed sacerdos absolvit tantum a reatu poenae, et denuntiat eum absolutum a macula culpae. Sed hoc non est verum: nam sacramentum poenitentiae cum sit sacramentum novae legis, confert gratiam, sicut et in Baptismo confertur. Sed in Baptismo sacerdos baptizat instrumentaliter, et tamen confert gratiam: ergo similiter in sacramento poenitentiae sacramentaliter et ministerialiter absolvit a poena et culpa, inquantum dat sacramentum in quo peccata dimittuntur. Quod autem dicitur, quod solus Deus peccata dimittit, verum est auctoritate. Sic etiam solus Deus baptizat; sed sacerdos ministerio, ut dictum est.
          <td>2542 We can ask here why we read, <b>If you forgive the sins of any</b>, for only God forgives sins? Some say that only God forgives the sin, while the priest absolves only from the debt of punishment, and pronounces the person free from the stain of sin. This is not true: for the sacrament of Penance, since it is a sacrament of the New Law, gives grace, as does Baptism. Now in the sacrament of Baptism, the priest baptizes as an instrument, and yet he confers grace. It is similar in the sacrament of Penance, the priest absolves from the sin and the punishment as a minister and sacramentally, insofar as he administers the sacrament in which sins are forgiven. The statement that God alone forgives sins authoritatively is true. So also, only God baptizes, but the priest is the minister, as was said.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Item quaeritur de hoc quod dicit <i>accipite spiritum sanctum: quorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur eis</i>. Videtur ergo quod qui non habet spiritum sanctum, non possit peccata dimittere. Ad quod dicendum, quod si remissio peccatorum esset proprium opus sacerdotis, idest quod ex sua virtute hoc faceret, non utique posset sanctificare nisi sanctus. Remissio autem peccatorum est proprium opus Dei, qui propria virtute et auctoritate peccata dimittit, sacerdotis autem non nisi est sicut instrumenti. Sicut ergo dominus per servum et ministrum suum, sive sit bonus sive malus, potest facere voluntatem suam ad exequendum aliqua: ita et dominus per ministros, etiam si mali sint, potest sacramenta conferre, in quibus datur gratia.
          <td>2543 Another question arises from the statements, <b>Receive the Holy Spirit. If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven.</b> It seems from this that one who does not have the Holy Spirit cannot forgive sins. We should say about this that if the forgiveness of sins was the personal work of the priest, that is, that he did this by his own power, he could not sanctify anyone unless he himself were holy. But the forgiveness of sins is the personal work of God, who forgives sins by his own power and authority. The priest is only the instrument. Therefore, just as a master, through his servant and minister, whether good or bad, can accomplish what he wills, so our Lord, through his ministers, even if they are evil, can confer the sacraments, in which grace is given.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Item quaeritur de hoc quod dicitur <i>quorum remiseritis peccata, remittuntur eis</i>. Ad quod dicendum est quod, sicut dictum est, sacerdos in sacramentis agit sicut minister Dei. I Cor. IV, 1: <i>sic nos existimet homo ut ministros Christi et dispensatores mysteriorum Dei</i>. Eodem ergo modo quo Deus remittit et retinet peccata, simul et sacerdos. Remittit autem Deus peccata largiendo gratiam; sed dicitur retinere non largiendo eam propter impedimentum ex parte recipientis: sic et minister remittit peccata, inquantum impendit sacramentum Ecclesiae; et retinet inquantum aliquos indignos ostendit sacramentorum receptione.
          <td>2544 Again, there is a question about, <b>If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven.</b> We should say, as we already did, that in the sacraments the priest acts as a minister: "This is how one should regard us, as servants [ministers] of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God" (1 Cor 4:1). Thus, in the same way that God forgives and retains sins, so also does the priest. Now God forgives sins by giving grace, and he is said to retain by not giving grace because of some obstacle in the one who is to receive it. So also the minister forgives sins, insofar as he dispenses a sacrament of the Church, and he retains insofar as he accounts someone unworthy to receive the sacrament.

We read: "Abyss calls to abyss" [Ps 42:7]. That is, the depths of Christ's compassion calls to the depths of darkness [of disbelief] in Thomas, and Thomas' abyss of unwillingness [to believe] calls out, when he professes the faith, to the depths of Christ.

The English word "twin" is "Didymus" in Greek. Because John wrote his Gospel in Greek, he used the word Didymus. Perhaps he was called the Twin because he was from the tribe of Benjamin, in which some or all were twins. Or, this name could be taken from his doubting, for one who is certain holds firmly to one side, but one who doubts accepts one opinion but fears another might be true.

This was the reason he allowed the apostles, the prophets and the holy martyrs to be afflicted: "Therefore I have hewn them by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth" (Hos 6:5); "If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted it is for your comfort which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer" (2 Cor 1:6). Even more remarkable is that God allows some saint to fall into sin in order to teach us. Why did God allow some saints and holy men to sin gravely (as David did by adultery and murder) if not to teach us to be more careful and humble? It is so that one who thinks he is standing firm will take care not to fall, and so that one who has fallen will make the effort to rise. Thus, Ambrose said to the Emperor Theodosius: "The one you followed by sinning, try now to follow by repenting." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn27" name="_ftnref27" id="_ftnref27">[27]</a> And Gregory says that the disbelief of Thomas was of more benefit to our faith than the faith of the disciples who did believe. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>

          <td>2548 Thomas is told about our Lord's appearance. Because he had not been with the others, <b>the other disciples told him, We have seen the Lord.</b> This was by the divine plan, which is that what one receives from God should be shared with others: "As each has received a gift, employ it for one another" (1 Pet 4:10); "I have seen the Lord, and I have been saved" [Gen 32:30].

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>ille autem dixit eis</i> etc., ponitur obstinata Thomae dubitatio. Et quidem satis fuisset excusabilis, quod non statim credidit: quia, ut dicitur Eccli. XIX, 4: <i>qui cito credit, levis est corde</i>. Sed multum investigare, praesertim ubi de secretis Dei agitur, grossities mentis est. Prov. XXV, 27: <i>sicut qui mel multum comedit, non est ei bonum; sic qui perscrutator est maiestatis, opprimetur a gloria</i>: Eccli. III, v. 22: <i>altiora te ne quaesieris, et fortiora te ne scrutatus fueris. Sed quae praecepit Deus tibi, illa cogita semper, et in pluribus operibus eius ne fueris curiosus</i>.
          <td>2549 When Thomas said, <b>Unless I see the print of the nails....</b> we see how stubborn he was in doubting. It would have been justifiable if he had not immediately believed, for we read, "One who trusts others too quickly is light‑minded" (Sir 19:4). But to overdo one's search, especially about the secrets of God, shows a coarseness of mind: "As it is not good to eat much honey, so one who searches into the majesty [of God] is overwhelmed by its glory" [Prv 25:27]; "Seek not what is too difficult for you, nor investigate what is beyond your power. Reflect upon what has been assigned to you, for you do not need what is hidden" (Sir 3:22).

          <td>Circa Thomam considerandum est, quod durus fuit ad credendum, et irrationabilis ad petendum. Durus quidem, quia noluit credere nisi sensibili argumento; et non tamen unius sensus, sed duorum, scilicet visus, quia <i>nisi videro in manibus eius fixuram clavorum</i>, et tactus, <i>et mittam manum meam in latus eius, non credam</i>. Irrationabilis vero fuit, quia petebat vulnera videre ad comprobationem fidei; cum maius videret, scilicet totius hominis resuscitati reparationem. Et licet hoc Thomas propter sui dubietatem diceret, tamen hoc divinitus factum est propter nostram utilitatem et aedificationem. Certum est enim quod qui se totum hominem reparavit resurgendo, potuit etiam vulnerum cicatrices extergere; sed servatae sunt propter nostram utilitatem.
          <td>2550 Thomas was difficult to convince and unreasonable in his demands. He was difficult because he refused to believe without some sensible facts, not just from one sense but from two, sight <b>‑ unless I see in his hands the print of the nails</b> ‑ and touch ‑ <b>and place my hand in his side.</b> He was unreasonable because he insisted on seeing the wounds before believing, although he would be seeing something greater, that is, the entire person risen and restored. And although Thomas said these things because of his own doubts, this was arranged by God for our benefit and progress. It is certain that Christ, who arose as a complete person, could have healed the marks of his wounds; but he kept them for our benefit.

Circa primum tria facit. Primo describit apparitionis tempus; secundo manifestat personas quibus apparuit; tertio modum apparitionis ostendit.
          <td>2551 Now the Evangelist presents our Lord's second appearance. It was to all the disciples, including Thomas. First, he mentions Christ appearing; secondly, we see that Thomas is now convinced; thirdly, the Evangelist comments on what he has included in his gospel (30). He does three things about the first: the time of Christ's appearance is mentioned; then to whom he appeared; and thirdly, the way he came (v 26).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tempus quidem, quia <i>post dies octo</i>, scilicet a die resurrectionis dominicae, in cuius sero facta fuit prima apparitio. Cuius quidem una ratio litteralis est, ut ostenderet etiam Evangelista quod licet Christus pluries apparuisset discipulis, non tamen continue conversatus est cum eis, cum non ad eumdem vivendi modum surrexerit, sicut nec nos ad eamdem vitam resurgemus. Iob XIV, v. 14: <i>cunctis diebus quibus nunc milito, expecto donec veniat immutatio mea</i>. Secundo ut Thomas interim audiens a discipulis apparitionem praecedentem, accendatur ad maius desiderium, et fidelior fieret ad credendum. Alia ratio mystica est, quia huiusmodi apparitio illam designat qua nobis apparebit in gloria; I Io. III, 2: <i>cum apparuerit, similes ei erimus, quoniam videbimus eum sicuti est</i>. Quae quidem apparitio erit in octava aetate resurgentium.
          <td>2552 The time was <b>eight days later</b>, that is, from the day of our Lord's resurrection, on the evening of which he first appeared. One literal reason for mentioning the time was so that the Evangelist could show that although Christ had appeared frequently to the disciples, he did not remain with them continually, since he had not arisen to the same kind of life, just as we will not rise to the same kind of life: "All the days of my service I would wait, till my release should come" [Job 14:14]. A reason for the delay was so that Thomas, hearing about our Lord's first appearance from the disciples, would develop a stronger desire and become more disposed to believe. A mystical reason for our Lord's appearance after eight days is that this indicates how he will appear to us in glory [as immortal, etc.]: "When he appears we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (1 Jn 3:2). He will appear to us in the eighth age, which is the age of those who have risen from the dead.

          <td>Quibus autem apparuit ostendit subdens <i>iterum erant discipuli eius intus, et Thomas cum eis</i>. Ubi notandum, quod Thomas solus hac apparitione indigebat; non tamen ei singulariter dominus apparuit, sed in congregatione existenti, ad designandum quod singularitates non sunt multum Deo acceptae, sed hi qui in communitate caritatis existunt. Matth. XVIII, 20: <i>ubi fuerint duo vel tres congregati in nomine meo, ibi sum in medio eorum</i>. Similiter etiam hi quibus nunc apparet non sunt collecti simul in unum; sic nec in ipsa apparitione simul omnes fuerunt; sed in futura simul omnes erunt, ita quod nullus deerit. Matth. XXIV, 28: <i>ubi fuerit corpus, illic congregabuntur et aquilae</i>. Et infra: <i>mittet Angelos suos cum tuba et voce magna, et congregabunt electos eius a quatuor ventis, a summis caelorum usque ad terminos eorum</i>.
          <td>2553 The Evangelist shows to whom he appeared when he says, <b>his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas was with them.</b> We should note that Thomas was the only one who needed this appearance of Christ, but even so our Lord did not appear to him alone, but to the group. This shows that it is not very pleasing to God to exist in isolation, but it is to live in a unity of charity with others: "For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of them" (Mt 18:20). Those to whom Christ appears [in this life] are not all gathered into one group, and this present assembly of the disciples did not include every such one. But in the future all will be gathered together, and no one absent: "Wherever the body is, there the eagles will be gathered together" (Mt 24:28); "He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other" (Mt 24:31).

Secundo modum standi, quia <i>in medio</i>, ut ab omnibus videretur, et decebat ut in medio staret. Tertio modum loquendi, quia <i>pax vobis</i>, scilicet reconciliationis, quam annuntiavit factam ad Deum. Rom. V, 10: <i>reconciliati sumus Deo per mortem filii eius</i>; Col. I, 20: <i>pacificans per sanguinem crucis eius sive quae in caelis sive quae in terris sunt</i>. Item aeternitatis et immortalitatis futuram, quam promisit eis habendam. Ps.

            2554 He shows the way Christ appeared by saying, <b>The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood among them, and said, Peace be with you.</b> This was explained before. The Evangelist notes three things here. First, how Christ came, <b>the doors were shut.</b> As Augustine says, this was done miraculously, by the same power which enabled him to walk on the water. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a> Secondly, where he stood, <b>among them</b>, so he could be seen by all, as was fitting. Thirdly, we see what he said, <b>Peace be with you</b>, that is, the peace coming from reconciliation, reconciliation with God, which Jesus said had now been accomplished: "We were reconciled to God by the death of his Son" (Rom 5:10); "making peace by the blood of his cross" (Col 1:20). Jesus also announced to them the future peace of eternity and immortality, which he had promised them: "He makes peace in your borders" (Ps 147:14); and also the peace of charity and unity, which he commanded them to maintain: "Be at peace with one another" (Mk 9:49).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur confirmatio et revocatio discipuli dubitantis: in quo apparet secundum signum divinae pietatis, quod electis suis in casu cito subvenit, licet cadant. Cadunt enim electi aliquando, sicut et reprobi, sed differenter: quia reprobi franguntur; electis vero cito dominus supponit manum suam, ut resurgant. Ps. XXXVI, 24: <i>cum ceciderit iustus, non collidetur, quia dominus supponit manum suam</i>. Item: <i>si dicebam, motus est pes meus, misericordia tua, domine, adiuvabat me</i>. Et ideo statim supponit Thomae lapso manum, ita ut cum diceret <i>nisi videro non credam</i>, revocat dicens <i>infer digitum tuum huc</i>. Et circa hoc tria ponuntur. Primo cicatricum exhibitio; secundo Thomae confessio, ibi <i>respondit Thomas</i> etc.; tertio tarditatis eius reprehensio, ibi <i>quia vidisti me, Thoma, credidisti</i>.
          <td>2555 Now the Evangelist shows how the doubting disciple was rescued and persuaded. Here we see a second sign of God's pity, which is that he quickly comes to help his elect even though they fall. Indeed, the elect fall at times, just like the reprobate. But there is a difference: the reprobate are crushed, but the Lord quickly puts his hand under the elect so they can rise up: "When a just person falls he will not be crushed, for the Lord will put his hand under him" [Ps 37:27]; "When I thought, 'My foot slips,' your steadfast love, O Lord, held me up" (Ps 94:18). And so our Lord quickly puts his hand under the fallen Thomas so that when Thomas said, <b>Unless I see... I will not believe</b>, our Lord rescues him, saying, <b>Put your finger here</b>. Three things are mentioned here: first, our Lord shows his wounds; secondly, we see Thomas' profession; and thirdly, his slowness to believe is reproved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Notandum autem circa primum, quod Thomas petiit conditiones ut crederet, scilicet videre et palpare cicatrices, ut dictum est: et si hoc sibi fieret, promisit se crediturum. Et ideo dominus, cum haec diceret, praesentia suae divinitatis assistens, servatis illis conditionibus revocat eum. Unde primo exhibet conditionem; secundo petit promissi solutionem, ibi <i>noli esse incredulus, sed fidelis</i>.
          <td>2556 Regarding the first, note that Thomas laid down his own conditions for believing, which were that he see and feel Christ's wounds, as was said. If these conditions were met, he promised to believe. So our Lord, helping him by the presence of his divinity, rescued him by meeting these conditions. First, we see the conditions being met; secondly Thomas is asked to keep his promise (v 27).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Conditio fuit palpare cicatrices, et ideo dicit <i>infer digitum tuum</i>. Sed hic oritur dubitatio: quia in corporibus glorificatis nullus potest esse defectus, cicatrices autem sunt defectus quidam: quomodo ergo fuerunt in corpore Christi? Ad hoc respondet Augustinus in libro de symbolo, sic dicens: posset autem de corpore suscitato et glorificato omnem maculam cuiuslibet cicatricis in suo corpore abstergere; sed sciebat quare cicatrices in suo corpore servaret. Primo quidem ut demonstraret Thomae non credenti, nisi tangeret et videret; deinde vero ad exprobrandum infidelibus et peccatoribus in iudicio. Non ut eis dicat sicut Thomae: <i>quia vidisti me, credidisti</i>: sed ut convincens eos dicat: ecce hominem quem crucifixistis, videte vulnera quae infixistis, agnoscite latus quod pupugistis: quoniam et propter vos apertum est, nec tamen intrare voluistis.
          <td>
            2557 One condition was that he feel the wounds, so Christ said, <b>Put your finger here.</b> A problem arises here because there can be no defects in a glorified body, and wounds are defects. How then can there be wounds in the body of Christ? Augustine answers this in this book, <i>On the Creed</i>, when he says: "Christ could have removed all traces of his wounds from his risen and glorified body, but he had reasons for retaining them. First, to show them to Thomas, who would not believe unless he touched and saw. Again, he will use them to rebuke unbelievers and sinners at the judgment. He will not say to them, as he did to Thomas, 'Because you have seen me, you have believed,' but rather, to convict them, 'Behold the man you have crucified, the wounds you have inflicted. Look at the side you have pierced. It was opened for your sake, and you refused to enter.'" <a href="John20.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" title="" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Iuxta hoc etiam quaeritur, utrum in corporibus martyrum remaneant vestigia vulnerum? Sed ad hoc similiter respondet Augustinus, XXII de civitate Dei, quod remanebunt quidem, non ad turpitudinem, sed ad immensum decorem, sic dicens: non hoc in eis deformitas, sed dignitas erit; et quidem in corpore, non corporis, sed virtutis pulchritudo fulgebit. Nec ideo tamen si aliqua martyribus amputata vel ablata sunt membra, sine ipsis membris erunt in resurrectione mortuorum, quibus dictum est: <i>capillus de capite vestro non peribit</i>: sed ubi membra, ut praeciderentur, percussa sunt vel secta, ibi cicatrices, sed in eisdem membris redditis, non perditis apparebunt.
          <td>
            2558 Another question on this point is whether or not the traces of the martyrs' wounds will remain on their bodies. Augustine, in his <i>The City of God</i> (22), answers this in a similar manner, saying they will remain, not as a disfigurement but like a great ornamental beauty. He says "These wounds in their body will not be a deformity, but a dignity. And although on their bodies, they will radiate not a bodily but a spiritual beauty. Of course, the martyrs who suffered amputation or decapitation will not appear in the resurrection without their hands and members ‑ for they too have been told that not a hair of their head would perish. Indeed, even though their members were mutilated or cut off, they will be restored, yet the traces of their wounds will remain." <a href="John20.htm#_ftn32" name="_ftnref32" id="_ftnref32">[32]</a>

          <td>Sed, secundum Gregorium, cum quod incorruptibile est, palpari non possit, quomodo dominus corpus suum, quod incorruptibile erat, palpandum praebuit? Rom. VI, v. 9: <i>Christus resurgens ex mortuis iam non moritur</i>. Unde hac ratione motus Eutyches haereticus dixit, quod corpus Christi et corpora omnium resurgentium non erunt palpabilia, sed subtilia et spiritualia ad modum venti et spirituum. Sed quia hoc est contra illud quod dominus dicit Lc. ult., 39: <i>palpate et videte quia spiritus carnem et ossa non habet</i>, incorruptibilem ergo et palpabilem se dominus demonstravit, ut ostenderet corpus suum esse post resurrectionem eiusdem naturae, quod fuerat corruptibile, et induerat incorruptionem, I Cor. XV, 53, et alterius gloriae: quia quod crassum et ignobile fuerat, surrexit in gloria et subtile per effectum spiritualis potentiae.
          <td>
            2559 Gregory asks how the Lord could offer his body to be touched because it was incorruptible, for what is incorruptible cannot be touched. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn33" name="_ftnref33" id="_ftnref33">[33]</a> "Christ being raised from the dead will never die again" (Rom 6:9). The heretic, Eutyches, was influenced by this to say that the body of Christ and the bodies of all those who rise will not be touchable, but fine and spiritual, like the wind or a breath. But since this is contrary to what our Lord said - "Handle me, and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have" (Lk 24:39) ‑ our Lord showed that he was incorruptible and touchable to demonstrate that his body after his resurrection was of the same nature as before, and what had been corruptible had now put on incorruption (1 Cor 15:53). It was the same in nature, but with a different glory: for what had been heavy and lowly arose in glory and subtlety, as the effect of spiritual power.

Thus when Thomas is told to put his finger and hand into the wounds of Christ, we are being told to use our knowledge and works for the service of Christ: "But far be it from me to glory except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ" (Gal 6:14).

And he professed the divinity of Christ when he said, <b>and my God</b>.

Respondeo dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod sensu visus utimur pro quolibet sensu. Dicimus enim: vide quomodo calet, quomodo sonat, quomodo sapit, quomodo redolet. Dicit ergo: <i>infer digitum tuum huc, et vide</i>; non quod in digito sit visus, sed dicitur quasi: tange et experire; ita et hic <i>quia vidisti me</i>, idest quia expertus es etiam per tactum. Vel dicendum, quod Thomas videns vulnera et cicatrices confusus est in seipso, et antequam poneret digitum credidit, et dixit: <i>dominus meus et Deus meus</i>. Sed tamen Gregorius dicit, quod tetigit, et ad visum confessus est.
          <td>
            2565 There is a second question. Because Thomas said that he would not believe unless he saw and touched, and our Lord was willing for him to see and touch, it seems our Lord should have replied, "because you have seen and touched me you have believed." One can say, with Augustine, that we use the sense of sight for any of the senses. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a> We say, "See how warm it is"; "See how it sounds"; "See how it tastes and smells." So our Lord said, <b>Put your finger here, and see</b>, not because the finger can see, but as meaning, "Touch and perceive." So Christ says here, <b>because you have seen me</b>, that is, because you have perceived through touch. Or, one could say that Thomas became flustered when he saw Christ's wounds and scars, and before he touched Christ with his finger he believed and said, <b>My Lord and my God.</b> For Gregory, Thomas did touch Christ, but did not profess his faith until he saw [the wounds]. <a href="John20.htm#_ftn35" name="_ftnref35" id="_ftnref35">[35]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>beati qui non viderunt et crediderunt</i>, commendat facilitatem aliorum ad credendum; et hoc specialiter ad nos pertinet. Utitur autem praeterito pro futuro propter certitudinem.
          <td>2566 When Christ said, <b>Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed</b>, he was praising the readiness of others to believe; and this applies especially to us. He says, "have believed" rather than "shall believe" because of the certitude [of his knowledge].
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed contra hoc Lc. X, 23, dicitur: <i>beati oculi qui viderunt quae vos videtis</i>. Ergo magis beati qui viderunt quam qui non viderunt. Respondeo, quod duplex est beatitudo. Una est rei, quae consistit in munere divino, de quo quanto alicui plus conceditur, tanto beatior est; et sic quantum ad hoc beati sunt oculi qui vident, quia hoc est munus gratiae. Alia est beatitudo spei, quae consistit in merito; unde secundum hanc tanto quis est beatior, quanto potest plus mereri. Plus autem meretur qui credit et non vidit, quam qui videns credit.
          <td>Luke seems to say the contrary: "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see" (Lk 10:23). Thus, those who have seen are more blessed that those who have not seen. I answer that blessedness is of two kinds. One is the actual state of blessedness, which consists in God's reward, where the better one sees the happier, the more blessed, he is. In this respect, the eyes that see are blessed, because this is the reward of grace. The other blessedness is the hoped‑for blessedness, which is based on one's merits. And in this case the more one can merit the more blessed he is. And, the one who believes and does not see, merits more than one who believes when he sees.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur epilogus: et primo ponitur insufficientia huius Scripturae; secundo eius utilitas, ibi <i>haec autem scripta sunt ut credatis</i> et cetera. Insufficientia quidem apparet, quia <i>multa et alia fecit Iesus signa</i> et facta <i>quae non sunt scripta in libro hoc</i>. Iob XXVI, 14: <i>ecce haec ex parte dicta sunt viarum eius: et cum vix parvam stillam sermonis eius audierimus, quis poterit tonitruum magnitudinis illius intueri?</i> Eccli. XLIII, 36: <i>multa sunt abscondita maiora his: pauca enim videmus eius</i>. Sed secundum Chrysostomum, hoc ideo dicit, quia pauciora miracula narrat Ioannes quam alii Evangelistae. Et ideo ne videretur ea negare, dicit hoc: et ideo specialiter subdit <i>quae non sunt scripta in libro hoc</i>. Vel hoc refertur ad passionem et resurrectionem; quasi, multa ostensiva suae resurrectionis post resurrectionem fecit in conspectu discipulorum, quae non ostendit aliis. Act. X, v. 40: <i>dedit eum manifestum fieri non omni populo, sed testibus praeordinatis a Deo</i>.
          <td>
            2567 Now the Evangelist gives his epilogue: first he mentions the incompleteness of his gospel; secondly, the benefits it will give (v 31). Its incompleteness is clear, for <b>Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples</b>, "Lo, these are but the outskirts of his ways; and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand?" (Job 26:14); "Many things greater than these lie hidden, for we have seen but few of his works" (Si 43:32). According to Chrysostom, John said this because he mentioned fewer miracles than the other evangelists and he did not want it to be thought that he was denying these other miracles, and so he especially added, <b>which are not written in this book.</b> <a href="John20.htm#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a> Or, John could be referring to the passion and resurrection of Christ, meaning that after his resurrection Christ gave many indications of his resurrection "in the presence of the disciples" that were not shown to others: "God... made him manifest; not to all the people but to us who were chosen by God as witnesses," (Acts 10:40).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ponitur et huius utilitas, quia effectus fidei, quia <i>haec scripta sunt ut credatis quia Iesus Christus est filius Dei, et ut credentes vitam habeatis in nomine eius</i>. Ad hoc enim est tota Scriptura novi et veteris testamenti; Ps. XXXIX, 9: <i>in capite libri scriptum est de me</i>; supra V, 39: <i>scrutamini Scripturas (...) quoniam ipsae sunt quae testimonium perhibent de me</i>. Item fructus vitae, quia <i>ut credentes vitam habeatis</i>, hic vitam iustitiae, quae habetur per fidem, Hab. II, 4: <i>iustus autem meus ex fide vivit</i>, et in futuro vitam speciei quae habetur per gloriam; et <i>in nomine eius</i>, scilicet Christi. Act. IV, 12: <i>non est aliud nomen sub caelo in quo oporteat nos salvos fieri</i>.
          <td>2568 Now he mentions the benefits given by this gospel. It is useful for producing faith: <b>these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God</b>. Indeed, all Scripture, both the Old and New Testaments, are for this purpose: "The beginning of the book writes about me" [Ps 40:7]; "Search the scriptures... it is they that bear witness to me" (5:39). Another benefit of his gospel is that it also produces the fruit of life, <b>and that believing you may have life</b>: the life of righteousness, which is given by faith ‑ "The righteous shall live by his faith" (Hab 2:4) ‑ and in the future, the life of vision, which is given by glory. This life is in his name, the name of Christ: "There is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved" (Acts 4:12).
