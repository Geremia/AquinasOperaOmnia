                  1 Now on the first day of the week [one day of the Sabbath]
                  Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it was still
                  dark, and saw that the stone had been taken away from the
                  tomb. 2 So she ran, and went to Simon Peter and the other
                  disciple, the one whom Jesus loved, and said to them, "They
                  have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we do not know where
                  they have laid him." 3 Peter then came out with the other
                  disciple, and they went toward the tomb. 4 They both ran, but
                  the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first; 5
                  and stooping to look in, he saw the linen cloths lying there,
                  but he did not go in. 6 Then Simon Peter came, following him,
                  and went into the tomb; he saw the linen cloths lying, and the
                  napkin, which had been on his head, not lying with the linen
                  cloths but rolled up in a place by itself. 8 Then the other
                  disciple, who reached the tomb first, also went in, and he saw
                  and believed; 9 for as yet they did not know the scripture,
                  that he must rise from the dead.

                    2470 Having related the mysteries of the passion of Christ,
                    the Evangelist now speaks of the resurrection. First, he
                    says the resurrection was made known to certain women;
                    secondly, to the disciples (v 19). The revelation of
                    Christ's resurrection to the women went in stages: first,
                    there is the open tomb; secondly, the appearance of the
                    angel (v 11); thirdly, the sight of Christ (v 14). In regard
                    to the first, he first mentions the sight of the open tomb;
                    secondly, this news is reported to the disciples (v 2); and
                    thirdly, they see for themselves (v 3).

                        Circa primum quatuor consideranda occurrunt. Primo
                        scilicet visionis tempus, quia <i>una sabbati</i>,
                        scilicet prima feria. Nam apud Iudaeos dies sabbati
                        solemnior habebatur, et ideo ab eo omnis alius dies
                        denominabatur: unde dicebant prima sabbati, secunda
                        sabbati et cetera. Unde et Matth. XXVIII, v. 1, dicit
                        <i>prima sabbati</i>. Sed Ioannes dicit:
                        <i>una sabbati</i>, propter mysterium, quia in hac die,
                        in qua resurrectio facta est, inchoavit quasi quaedam
                        nova creatura; Ps. CIII, 30:
                        <i
                          >emitte spiritum tuum, et creabuntur, et renovabis
                          faciem terrae</i
                        >; Gal. VI, 15:
                        <i
                          >in Christo Iesu neque circumcisio aliquid valet neque
                          praeputium, sed nova creatura</i
                        >. Moyses autem in principio Gen. de prima die non dicit
                        factus est dies primus, sed unus. Ideo Evangelista ad
                        ipsam renovationem insinuandam utitur verbo Moysi. Item
                        quia in hac die inchoabatur dies aeternitatis, quae est
                        una non habens interpolationem noctis; quia sol qui eam
                        facit, non occidit. Apoc. XXI, 23:
                        <i
                          >civitas illa non eget sole neque luna ut luceant in

                        2471 Four things can be noted about the first. First,
                        the time: it was <b>one day of the sabbath,</b> that is,
                        the first day of the week. The Jews considered the
                        sabbath as a very sacred day, and all the other days
                        were described in reference to the sabbath. Thus they
                        spoke of the first day of the sabbath, the second day of
                        the sabbath, and so on. Matthew [28:1] speaks of the
                        "first day of the sabbath". But John speaks of "one day
                        of the sabbath" because he is referring to a mystery,
                        for this day of the resurrection was the beginning of a
                        new creation: "When you send forth your Spirit, they are
                        created; and you renew the face of the ground" (Ps
                        104:30); "For neither circumcision counts for anything,
                        nor uncircumcision, but a new creation" (Gal 6:15). In
                        Genesis (1:5), when Moses is speaking of the first day
                        of creation he says "one day." "God called the light
                        Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was
                        evening and there was morning, one day." And so the
                        Evangelist uses these words of Moses because he wants to
                        express a newness. And also because this day begins the
                        day of eternity, which is one day, no night interrupting
                        it, because the sun which makes this day will never set.
                        "And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine upon
                        it, for the glory of God is its light, and its lamp is
                        the Lamb" (Rev 21:23); "There will be one day, which is
                        known to the Lord, not day and night, for at evening
                        time there will be light" [Zech 14:7].

                            Matth. ult. connumeratur etiam alia Maria.
                            Responsio. Dicendum secundum Augustinum, quod Maria
                            Magdalena ferventior et devotior erat ad Christum
                            aliis mulieribus: unde Lc. VII, 47, dicitur:
                            <i

                            2472 Secondly, the person who saw the tomb is given,
                            <b
                              >Mary Magdalene came to the tomb early, while it

                            >
                            A question arises here because Mark (16:1) makes
                            mention of Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James,
                            and Salome; and Matthew (28:1) also mentions "the
                            other Mary." According to Augustine the resolution
                            is that Mary Magdalene was more ardent and more
                            devoted to Christ than the other women.
                            <a

                            >
                            Thus we read that "Her sins, which are many, are
                            forgiven, for she loved much" (Lk 7:47). And for
                            this reason the Evangelist mentions her by name.
                            This is also the reason why the Lord appeared to her
                            first, "He appeared first to Mary Magdalene" (Mk
                            16:9); "She [Wisdom] hastens to make herself known
                            to those who desire her" (Wis 6:14).

                                XXIII, 55 s. dicitur, quod mulieres quae cum
                                Iesu venerunt de Galilaea viderunt monumentum,

                                <b>early, while it was still dark.</b> Luke
                                (23:55) tells us that the women who had come
                                with Christ from Galilee saw his tomb and how
                                his body was laid, and they prepared spices and
                                ointments for it. They rested on the sabbath
                                according to the commandment. As soon as the
                                sabbath was over, on the first day of the week,
                                before daylight, she [Mary Magdalene] came to
                                the tomb, incited by her exceedingly great love:
                                "Its flashes," the flashes of love, "are flashes
                                of fire" (Song 8:6).

                                    intelligitur de aurora: unde orto iam sole,

                                    2474 The question arises why Mark says "very
                                    early, after the sun had risen" [Mk 16:2],
                                    while the Evangelist says,
                                    <b>while it was still dark.</b> The answer
                                    is that what Mark says should be understood
                                    as referring to the breaking of the day, so
                                    that the sun had risen, but had not yet
                                    appeared in the sky.

                                        This was a sign that either someone had
                                        taken Christ away, or that he had
                                        arisen. When Matthew (28:2) says that
                                        "an angel of the Lord descended from
                                        heaven and came and rolled back the
                                        stone," we should not think the stone
                                        was rolled away before Christ arose, but
                                        only after. For since Christ came forth
                                        from the closed womb of the Virgin even
                                        though his body was not glorified, it is
                                        not surprising if he passed through the
                                        tomb with his glorified body. The stone
                                        was taken away so that people could see
                                        that Christ was not there, and more
                                        easily believe in his resurrection.

                                            overtake us" (2 Kgs 7:9). And so one
                                            who hears the words of God should
                                            tell it to others without delay:
                                            "Let him who hears say, 'Come'" (Rev
                                            22:17). Mary came to those who were
                                            the more important, and who loved
                                            Christ more ardently, so that they
                                            might either look for Jesus with her
                                            or share her sorrow.

                                                Christ had risen, she said,

                                                We can see from this that Mary
                                                had not been alone at the tomb,
                                                and that she still had doubts
                                                about the resurrection. So it
                                                was not without reason that the
                                                Evangelist wrote that
                                                <b>it was still dark</b>, for
                                                this indicated the condition of
                                                their minds, in which there was
                                                the darkness of doubt: "They
                                                have neither knowledge nor
                                                understanding, they walk about
                                                in darkness" (Ps 82:5). Note
                                                that in the Greek manuscripts it
                                                reads, <b>my Lord</b>, which
                                                shows the impetus of her love
                                                and her affectionate devotion:
                                                "Whom have I in heaven but you?
                                                And there is nothing upon earth
                                                that I desire besides you....
                                                God is the strength of my heart
                                                and my portion for ever" (Ps

                  10 Then the disciples went back to their homes. 11 But Mary
                  stood weeping outside the tomb, and as she wept she stooped to
                  look into the tomb; 12 and she saw two angels in white,
                  sitting where the body of Jesus had lain, one at the head and
                  one at the feet. 13 They said to her, "'Woman, why are you
                  weeping?" She said to them, "Because they have taken away my
                  Lord, and I do not know where they have laid him."

                    apertionem, hic Evangelista ostendit quomodo pervenit ad

                    autem mulieris, quae meruit Angelorum visionem, commendatur

                    2490 Having told how Mary Magdalene came to the opened tomb,
                    the Evangelist now tells how she came to see the angels:
                    first, we see her devotion; secondly, she sees the angels (v
                    12); thirdly, we have her conversation with them (v 13). Her
                    devotion, which made her fit to see the angels, is praised
                    for three things.

                        from where they had run to the tomb. Their fear was so
                        great that they did not stay together: I will strike the
                        shepherd and the sheep will scatter" [Zech 13:7]; "The

                        (Lam 4:1). Further, she stood there, lingering near the

                        disciples had left, but a stronger and more burning
                        affection fixed the weaker sex to the spot.

                            2492 A question arises here, because Mark (16:5‑8)
                            says that the women "went out and fled from the
                            tomb." Therefore, they must have been within it. Why
                            then does John say that <b>Mary stood outside</b> ?
                            We should say to answer this that the tomb of Christ
                            was hewn out of rock and surrounded by a garden, as
                            was stated before. Sometimes, therefore, the
                            Evangelists calls only the place where the body of
                            Christ had been laid the tomb, and at other times
                            the entire enclosure is called the tomb. Thus when
                            the women are said to enter into the tomb [as in
                            Mark 16:5], this should be understood to mean the
                            entire enclosure. But when it says here that
                            <b>Mary stood outside</b>, the Evangelist is
                            referring to the tomb hewn out of rock. But this
                            rock‑hewn tomb was within the enclosure they had
                            already entered. Mary was standing here because of
                            the unwavering love which had inflamed her heart "Be
                            steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work
                            of the Lord" (1 Cor 15:58); "Our feet have been
                            standing within your gates" (Ps 122:2).

                                <i>plorans ploravit in nocte</i>. Est autem

                                <i>lacrymis meis stratum meum rigavi</i>; et
                                devotionis ad caelestia desideranda, Ps. CXXV,
                                6:
                                <i

                                lavit lacrymis maculas criminis. Lc. VII, 47:

                                2493 Secondly, Mary's devotion is admired
                                because it issued in tears, for she stood there
                                <b>weeping</b>: "She weeps bitterly in the
                                night" (Lam 1:2). There are two kinds of tears:
                                tears of compunction, to wash away sins ‑ "Every
                                night I flood my bed with tears" (Ps 6:7) ‑ and
                                tears of devotion, from a desire for heavenly
                                things ‑ "He goes forth," hastening towards
                                heavenly things, "weeping, bearing the seed for
                                sowing" (Ps 126:6). Mary Magdalene had copious
                                tears of compunction at the time of her
                                conversion, when she had been the village
                                sinner. Then, in her love for the truth, she
                                washed the stains of her sins with her tears:
                                "Her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she
                                loved much" (Lk 7:47). She also shed abundant
                                tears of devotion over the passion and
                                resurrection of Christ, as we see here.

                                    because of her earnest search for Christ,
                                    <b
                                      >and as she wept she stooped to look into
                                      the tomb.</b
                                    >
                                    This weeping of Mary came from the desire of
                                    love. For it is the nature of love to want
                                    its beloved present; and if the beloved
                                    cannot be really present, it at least wants
                                    to think of the beloved: "Where your
                                    treasure is, there will your heart be also"
                                    (Mt 6:21). Mary shed these bitter tears
                                    because the eyes which had sought her Lord
                                    and did not find him were now freed for
                                    tears, and she grieved the more because he
                                    had been taken from the tomb. The life of
                                    such a Teacher had been destroyed, but his
                                    memory remained. Since Mary could not have
                                    him present, she wanted at least to look at
                                    the place where he had been buried, so
                                    <b>she stooped</b> to look into the tomb. We
                                    learn from this that we should look at the
                                    death of Christ with a humble heart: "You
                                    have hidden these things from the wise and
                                    understanding and revealed them to babes"
                                    (Mt 11:25). She stooped
                                    <b>to look,</b> giving us the example to
                                    look continually on the death of Christ with
                                    the eyes of our mind, for one look is not
                                    enough for one who loves, for the force of
                                    love increases the desire to explore:
                                    "Looking to Jesus the pioneer and perfecter
                                    of our faith, who for the joy that was set
                                    before him endured the cross, despising the
                                    shame" (Heb 12:2).
                                    <b>She stooped to look,</b> pressed down by
                                    the love of Christ: "The love of Christ
                                    presses us" [2 Cor 5:14]. Or again,
                                    according to Augustine, by a divine impulse
                                    in her soul she was made to look about, and
                                    saw something greater, the angels: "For all
                                    who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of
                                    God" (Rom 8:14).

                                                Matth. v. 2 ss. et Mc. ult., 5
                                                dicitur, quod Maria et aliae
                                                mulieres viderunt unum Angelum
                                                existentem in latere monumenti,

                                                intus. Sed utrumque verum est:
                                                quia illud praecessit quod
                                                narrant Matthaeus et Marcus,
                                                quando scilicet primo venerunt,

                                                A question arises here because
                                                Matthew (28:2) and Mark (16:5)

                                                women saw one angel on the right
                                                side of the tomb, while here we
                                                have two angels and they are
                                                inside. Each one is correct, for
                                                Matthew and Mark tell what
                                                occurred first, when the women
                                                first came, and believing that
                                                Christ was taken, returned to
                                                the disciples. But John recounts
                                                what happened after Mary
                                                returned with the disciples and
                                                remained after they had left.

                  14 Saying this, she turned round and saw Jesus standing, but
                  she did not know that it was Jesus. 15 Jesus said to her,
                  "Woman, why are you weeping? Whom do you seek?" Supposing him
                  to be the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried
                  him away, tell me where you have laid him, and I will take him
                  away." 16 Jesus said to her, "Mary." She turned and said to
                  him in Hebrew, "Rabboni!" (which means Teacher). 17 Jesus said
                  to her, "Do not hold me, for I have not yet ascended to the
                  [my] Father; but go to my brethren and say to them, I am
                  ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your
                  God." 18 Mary Magdalene went and said to the disciples, "I
                  have seen the Lord"; and she told them that he had said these
                  things to her.

                    2504 Now the Evangelist shows how Mary came to see Christ:
                    first, he tells how she saw Christ; secondly, how he was
                    recognized by her. Concerning the first, we see her seeing
                    Christ; and then what Christ said to her.

                        venerandos viros putabat, quare non expectabat eorum

                        Responsio. Dicendum, quod cum mulier Angelis
                        respondisset, Christus advenit, cui Angeli reverentiam
                        exhibentes assurrexerunt, quod videns mulier admirans

                        2505 Firstly, then, <b>Saying this,</b> that is, when
                        Mary said this to the angels,
                        <b>she turned round.</b> Chrysostom wonders why Mary,
                        who was speaking to the angels, whom she considered to
                        be at least men deserving of respect, turned around
                        before they had a chance to answer her.

                        The answer is that while Mary was responding to the
                        angels' question Christ arrived and the angels stood out
                        of reverence. When Mary saw this, she was puzzled and
                        turned around to see what had made them stand up. Thus
                        in Luke (24:4) mention is made that the two angels were
                        seen standing.

                            him. We see from this that if anyone desires to see
                            Christ, they must turn round to him: "Return to me,
                            says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to you"
                            (Zech 1:3). Those come to the point of seeing him
                            who entirely turn themselves to him by love: "She
                            [Wisdom] hastens to make herself known to those who
                            desire her" (Wis 6:14).

                                    risen, or else her eyes were held so that
                                    she would not recognize him, like the two

                                            Angeli causam ploratus exquirunt,
                                            sed Christus quid quaerat,
                                            interrogat. Nam ploratus ex
                                            desiderio inquisitionis causabatur.
                                            Quem quaerit enim interrogat ut
                                            augeatur desiderium, quatenus cum

                                            2508 Concerning the first, note that
                                            Mary was advancing step by step: for
                                            the angels asked her why she was
                                            weeping, but Christ asked her whom
                                            she was looking for, for her weeping
                                            was caused by the desire which led
                                            her to look. Christ asked her whom
                                            she was looking for in order to
                                            increase this desire, for when she
                                            spoke of the one she was seeking,
                                            her love burned more intensely, and
                                            so she would continue to seek him:
                                            "Seek his presence continually" (Ps
                                            105:4); "But the path of the
                                            righteous is like the light of dawn,
                                            which shines brighter and brighter
                                            until full day" (Prv 4:18).

                  19 On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the
                  doors being shut where the disciples were [gathered together],
                  for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and
                  said, to them, "Peace be with you." 20 When he had said this,
                  he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples were
                  glad when they saw the Lord. 21 Jesus said to them again,
                  "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, even so I send
                  you." 22 And when he had said this, he breathed on them, and
                  said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit. 23 If you forgive the
                  sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any,
                  they are retained."

                    2523 Having described how Christ appeared to the holy women,
                    the Evangelist now tells of his appearance to the apostles:
                    first, his appearance at Jerusalem before all except Thomas;
                    secondly, his appearance when Thomas was present (v 26);
                    thirdly, the events near the Sea of Tiberias (ch 21). Three
                    things are done regarding the first: first, we see our Lord
                    appear; secondly, we see a duty imposed on the apostles,
                    <b>I send you</b>; thirdly, our Lord gives them a spiritual
                    gift, <b>Receive the Holy Spirit.</b> He does three things
                    about the first: he mentions the circumstances of Christ's
                    appearance; secondly, the details of the appearance, (v 19);
                    thirdly, the result of this, <b>the disciples were glad.</b>

                        The Evangelist mentions four circumstances in our Lord's
                        appearance to the disciples. First, he mentions the time
                        of day, <b>on the evening;</b> secondly, what day it
                        was, <b>of that day</b>, thirdly, the condition of the

                            Fuit ergo hora apparitionis serotina: cuius duplex
                            est ratio litteralis. Una, quia voluit simul
                            apparere omnibus; et ideo praestolatus est usque in
                            sero, ut qui dispersi erant de die, simul
                            convenirent in sero: nam de nocte simul erant. Alia
                            ratio est quia dominus eis apparuit ut confortaret
                            eos. Illam ergo elegit horam qua magis stupentes
                            confortatione indigebant: haec est sero. Ps. XLV, 2:

                            2524 The time of our Lord's appearance was in the
                            evening; and there were two literal reasons for
                            this. First, he wanted to appear when they were all
                            together; consequently, he waited until evening, so
                            that those who had been at various places during the
                            day would be found together in the evening, when
                            they gathered together. Secondly, our Lord appeared
                            to strengthen and comfort them. And so he chose a
                            time when they would be more afraid and in need of
                            comfort and strength; this was in the evening: "God
                            is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
                            trouble" (Ps 46:1).

                                Est etiam ratio mystica, quia scilicet dominus

                                of the world our Lord will appear to the
                                faithful in the middle of the night when the cry
                                is heard that the bridegroom is coming to reward
                                them. "And when evening came, the owner of the

                                        From the Gospels we can see that our
                                        Lord appeared five times on that day:
                                        Once to Magdalene alone (which we just
                                        considered v 14), and again to her when
                                        she was returning to the disciples with
                                        the other women, when they approached
                                        and held our Lord's feet [Mt 28:9]. The
                                        third time was to the two disciples on
                                        the road to Emmaus (Lk 24:13). The
                                        fourth time was to Simon Peter; but how,
                                        when or where he appeared we do not
                                        know, but just that he appeared: "The
                                        Lord has risen indeed, and has appeared
                                        to Simon" (Lk 24:34). The fifth time was
                                        when he appeared to all the disciples
                                        together in the evening, as John
                                        mentions here (v 19).

                                                    some say that to enter
                                                    through closed doors is a
                                                    property of the glorified
                                                    body. They say that due to
                                                    some inherent property in a
                                                    glorified body, it can be
                                                    simultaneously present in
                                                    the same place as another
                                                    body. Thus, this is
                                                    accomplished without a
                                                    miracle. But this position
                                                    cannot stand, for the fact
                                                    that a non‑glorified human
                                                    body cannot be
                                                    simultaneously in the same
                                                    place as another body is due
                                                    to its very nature.
                                                    Consequently, if the
                                                    glorified body has an
                                                    inherent ability to be in a
                                                    place occupied at the same
                                                    time by another body, it
                                                    must be because it lacks the
                                                    property which now prevents
                                                    this in the case of a
                                                    non‑glorified body. But this
                                                    latter property cannot be
                                                    separated or destroyed from

                                                    say, but the very dimensions
                                                    of the quantified body
                                                    through which it has a local

                                                    Now no property of a
                                                    glorified body can remove
                                                    the dimensions from a body
                                                    and have it still remain a
                                                    body. Thus we should say
                                                    that Christ did this
                                                    miraculously, by the power
                                                    of his divinity, and that
                                                    whenever something similar
                                                    happens with the saints, it
                                                    is miraculous and requires a
                                                    new miracle. Augustine and
                                                    Gregory teach this
                                                    explicitly. Augustine says:
                                                    "Do you want to know how
                                                    Christ could enter through
                                                    closed doors? If you
                                                    understood how, it would not
                                                    be a miracle. Where reason
                                                    falls, faith instructs."

                                                    the womb of his virgin
                                                    mother was a miracle of his

                  24 Now Thomas, one of the twelve, called the Twin [Didymus],
                  was not with them when Jesus came. 25 So the other disciples
                  told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them,

                  my finger in the mark of the nails, and place my hand in his

                    2545 After describing our Savior's appearance, the
                    Evangelist now mentions the doubt of one of the disciples.
                    First, we see that this disciple was absent; secondly, he is
                    told about our Lord's appearance; and thirdly, we see his
                    stubborn doubt.

                        profunditate miserationis, quam habet a Christo: unde de
                        hoc dicitur in Ps. XLI, 8: <i>abyssus</i> profunditatis,

                        2546 The disciple who was absent is first identified by
                        his name, <b>Thomas</b>, which means a "twin" or an
                        "abyss." An abyss has both depth and darkness. And
                        Thomas was an abyss on account of the darkness of his
                        disbelief, of which he was the cause. Again, there is an
                        abyss ‑ the depths of Christ's compassion—which he had
                        for Thomas. We read: "Abyss calls to abyss" [Ps 42:7].
                        That is, the depths of Christ's compassion calls to the
                        depths of darkness [of disbelief] in Thomas, and Thomas'
                        abyss of unwillingness [to believe] calls out, when he
                        professes the faith, to the depths of Christ.

                            for he was <b>one of the twelve.</b> There were not
                            actually twelve at that time, for Judas had died (Mt
                            25:5), but he was called one of the twelve because
                            he had been called to that elevated rank which our
                            Lord had set apart as twelve in number: "He called
                            his disciples, and chose from them twelve, whom he
                            named apostles" (Lk 6:13). And God wanted this
                            number to always remain unchanged.

                                Thirdly, he is described by the meaning of his
                                name, <b>Thomas, called Didymus.</b> Thomas is a
                                Syrian or a Hebrew name and has two meanings:
                                twin and abyss. The English word "twin" is
                                "Didymus" in Greek. Because John wrote his
                                Gospel in Greek, he used the word Didymus.
                                Perhaps he was called the Twin because he was
                                from the tribe of Benjamin, in which some or all
                                were twins. Or, this name could be taken from
                                his doubting, for one who is certain holds
                                firmly to one side, but one who doubts accepts
                                one opinion but fears another might be true.

                                    conferring of peace and the breath giving
                                    the Holy Spirit. This teaches us not to
                                    become separated from one's companions, "not
                                    neglecting to meet together, as is the habit
                                    of some" (Heb 10:25). As Gregory says, it
                                    was not by accident that this chosen
                                    disciple was missing, but by God's will.

                                        This was the reason he allowed the

                                        martyrs to be afflicted: "Therefore I
                                        have hewn them by the prophets, I have
                                        slain them by the words of my mouth"
                                        (Hos 6:5); "If we are afflicted, it is
                                        for your comfort and salvation; and if
                                        we are comforted it is for your comfort
                                        which you experience when you patiently
                                        endure the same sufferings that we
                                        suffer" (2 Cor 1:6). Even more
                                        remarkable is that God allows some saint
                                        to fall into sin in order to teach us.
                                        Why did God allow some saints and holy
                                        men to sin gravely (as David did by
                                        adultery and murder) if not to teach us
                                        to be more careful and humble? It is so
                                        that one who thinks he is standing firm
                                        will take care not to fall, and so that
                                        one who has fallen will make the effort
                                        to rise. Thus, Ambrose said to the
                                        Emperor Theodosius: "The one you
                                        followed by sinning, try now to follow
                                        by repenting."

                                        Thomas was of more benefit to our faith
                                        than the faith of the disciples who did
                                        believe.

                  26 Eight days later, his disciples were again in the house,
                  and Thomas was with them. The doors were shut, but Jesus came
                  and stood among them, and said, "Peace be with you." 27 Then
                  he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see my hands;
                  and put out your hand, and place it in my side; do not be
                  faithless, but believing." 28 Thomas answered him, "My Lord
                  and my God!" 29 Jesus said to him, "Have you believed because
                  you have seen me? [Because you have seen me, Thomas, you have
                  believed.] Blessed are those who have not seen and yet believe
                  [have believed]." 30 Now Jesus did many other signs in the
                  presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book;
                  31 but these are written that you may believe that Jesus is
                  the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have
                  life in his name.

                    appearance. It was to all the disciples, including Thomas.
                    First, he mentions Christ appearing; secondly, we see that
                    Thomas is now convinced; thirdly, the Evangelist comments on
                    what he has included in his gospel (30). He does three
                    things about the first: the time of Christ's appearance is
                    mentioned; then to whom he appeared; and thirdly, the way he
                    came (v 26).

                        ut ostenderet etiam Evangelista quod licet Christus
                        pluries apparuisset discipulis, non tamen continue

                        desiderium, et fidelior fieret ad credendum. Alia ratio
                        mystica est, quia huiusmodi apparitio illam designat qua

                        2552 The time was <b>eight days later</b>, that is, from
                        the day of our Lord's resurrection, on the evening of
                        which he first appeared. One literal reason for
                        mentioning the time was so that the Evangelist could
                        show that although Christ had appeared frequently to the
                        disciples, he did not remain with them continually,
                        since he had not arisen to the same kind of life, just
                        as we will not rise to the same kind of life: "All the
                        days of my service I would wait, till my release should
                        come" [Job 14:14]. A reason for the delay was so that
                        Thomas, hearing about our Lord's first appearance from
                        the disciples, would develop a stronger desire and
                        become more disposed to believe. A mystical reason for
                        our Lord's appearance after eight days is that this
                        indicates how he will appear to us in glory [as
                        immortal, etc.]: "When he appears we shall be like him,
                        for we shall see him as he is" (1 Jn 3:2). He will
                        appear to us in the eighth age, which is the age of
                        those who have risen from the dead.

                            2553 The Evangelist shows to whom he appeared when
                            he says,
                            <b
                              >his disciples were again in the house, and Thomas
                              was with them.</b
                            >
                            We should note that Thomas was the only one who
                            needed this appearance of Christ, but even so our
                            Lord did not appear to him alone, but to the group.
                            This shows that it is not very pleasing to God to
                            exist in isolation, but it is to live in a unity of
                            charity with others: "For where two or three are
                            gathered in my name, there am I in the midst of
                            them" (Mt 18:20). Those to whom Christ appears [in
                            this life] are not all gathered into one group, and
                            this present assembly of the disciples did not
                            include every such one. But in the future all will
                            be gathered together, and no one absent: "Wherever
                            the body is, there the eagles will be gathered
                            together" (Mt 24:28); "He will send out his angels
                            with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his
                            elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to
                            the other" (Mt 24:31).

                                <b
                                  >The doors were shut, but Jesus came and stood

                                This was explained before. The Evangelist notes
                                three things here. First, how Christ came,
                                <b>the doors were shut.</b> As Augustine says,
                                this was done miraculously, by the same power
                                which enabled him to walk on the water.

                                Secondly, where he stood, <b>among them</b>, so
                                he could be seen by all, as was fitting.
                                Thirdly, we see what he said,
                                <b>Peace be with you</b>, that is, the peace
                                coming from reconciliation, reconciliation with
                                God, which Jesus said had now been accomplished:
                                "We were reconciled to God by the death of his
                                Son" (Rom 5:10); "making peace by the blood of
                                his cross" (Col 1:20). Jesus also announced to
                                them the future peace of eternity and
                                immortality, which he had promised them: "He
                                makes peace in your borders" (Ps 147:14); and
                                also the peace of charity and unity, which he
                                commanded them to maintain: "Be at peace with
                                one another" (Mk 9:49).

                                    et reprobi, sed differenter: quia reprobi
                                    franguntur; electis vero cito dominus
                                    supponit manum suam, ut resurgant. Ps.

                                    2555 Now the Evangelist shows how the
                                    doubting disciple was rescued and persuaded.
                                    Here we see a second sign of God's pity,
                                    which is that he quickly comes to help his
                                    elect even though they fall. Indeed, the
                                    elect fall at times, just like the
                                    reprobate. But there is a difference: the
                                    reprobate are crushed, but the Lord quickly
                                    puts his hand under the elect so they can
                                    rise up: "When a just person falls he will
                                    not be crushed, for the Lord will put his
                                    hand under him" [Ps 37:27]; "When I thought,
                                    'My foot slips,' your steadfast love, O
                                    Lord, held me up" (Ps 94:18). And so our
                                    Lord quickly puts his hand under the fallen
                                    Thomas so that when Thomas said,
                                    <b>Unless I see... I will not believe</b>,
                                    our Lord rescues him, saying,
                                    <b>Put your finger here</b>. Three things
                                    are mentioned here: first, our Lord shows
                                    his wounds; secondly, we see Thomas'
                                    profession; and thirdly, his slowness to
                                    believe is reproved.

                                        2556 Regarding the first, note that
                                        Thomas laid down his own conditions for
                                        believing, which were that he see and
                                        feel Christ's wounds, as was said. If
                                        these conditions were met, he promised
                                        to believe. So our Lord, helping him by
                                        the presence of his divinity, rescued
                                        him by meeting these conditions. First,
                                        we see the conditions being met;
                                        secondly Thomas is asked to keep his
                                        promise (v 27).

                                            defectus, cicatrices autem sunt

                                            fuerunt in corpore Christi? Ad hoc
                                            respondet Augustinus in libro de
                                            symbolo, sic dicens: posset autem de
                                            corpore suscitato et glorificato
                                            omnem maculam cuiuslibet cicatricis
                                            in suo corpore abstergere; sed
                                            sciebat quare cicatrices in suo
                                            corpore servaret. Primo quidem ut
                                            demonstraret Thomae non credenti,
                                            nisi tangeret et videret; deinde
                                            vero ad exprobrandum infidelibus et
                                            peccatoribus in iudicio. Non ut eis
                                            dicat sicut Thomae:
                                            <i>quia vidisti me, credidisti</i>:
                                            sed ut convincens eos dicat: ecce
                                            hominem quem crucifixistis, videte
                                            vulnera quae infixistis, agnoscite

                                            the wounds, so Christ said,
                                            <b>Put your finger here.</b> A
                                            problem arises here because there
                                            can be no defects in a glorified
                                            body, and wounds are defects. How
                                            then can there be wounds in the body
                                            of Christ? Augustine answers this in
                                            this book, <i>On the Creed</i>, when
                                            he says: "Christ could have removed
                                            all traces of his wounds from his
                                            risen and glorified body, but he had
                                            reasons for retaining them. First,
                                            to show them to Thomas, who would
                                            not believe unless he touched and
                                            saw. Again, he will use them to
                                            rebuke unbelievers and sinners at
                                            the judgment. He will not say to
                                            them, as he did to Thomas, 'Because
                                            you have seen me, you have
                                            believed,' but rather, to convict
                                            them, 'Behold the man you have
                                            crucified, the wounds you have
                                            inflicted. Look at the side you have
                                            pierced. It was opened for your
                                            sake, and you refused to enter.'"

                                                similiter respondet Augustinus,
                                                XXII de civitate Dei, quod
                                                remanebunt quidem, non ad
                                                turpitudinem, sed ad immensum
                                                decorem, sic dicens: non hoc in
                                                eis deformitas, sed dignitas
                                                erit; et quidem in corpore, non
                                                corporis, sed virtutis
                                                pulchritudo fulgebit. Nec ideo
                                                tamen si aliqua martyribus
                                                amputata vel ablata sunt membra,

                                                2558 Another question on this
                                                point is whether or not the
                                                traces of the martyrs' wounds
                                                will remain on their bodies.
                                                Augustine, in his
                                                <i>The City of God</i> (22),
                                                answers this in a similar
                                                manner, saying they will remain,
                                                not as a disfigurement but like
                                                a great ornamental beauty. He
                                                says "These wounds in their body
                                                will not be a deformity, but a
                                                dignity. And although on their
                                                bodies, they will radiate not a
                                                bodily but a spiritual beauty.
                                                Of course, the martyrs who
                                                suffered amputation or
                                                decapitation will not appear in
                                                the resurrection without their
                                                hands and members ‑ for they too
                                                have been told that not a hair
                                                of their head would perish.
                                                Indeed, even though their
                                                members were mutilated or cut
                                                off, they will be restored, yet
                                                the traces of their wounds will
                                                remain."

                                                    that his body after his
                                                    resurrection was of the same
                                                    nature as before, and what
                                                    had been corruptible had now
