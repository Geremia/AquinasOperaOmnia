            Et quia invenimus diversas actiones sacramentales diversis

            ad tactum pertinent, solus cibus est qui agit per conjunctionem sui
            ad cibatum, quia nutriens et nutritum fit unum; alia vero tangibilia

            whose power the secondary agents enact their secondary actions, as
            is evident in arts that are contained one beneath the other, as the
            military, equestrian, and bridlemaking arts [where in each case the
            latter takes orders from the former]. And since we find a variety of
            sacramental actions distributed among a variety of sacraments, which
            act by the power of the incarnate Word, for a perfect action of this
            genus [to take place] there must be some sacramental action that is
            attributed to the chief agent himself, namely the incarnate Word;
            and thus there had to be the sacrament of the Eucharist, which would
            contain the very Word incarnate, with the remaining sacraments as
            agents [acting] by his power. And thus, fittingly was this sacrament

            very Christ who is the principal agent of [our] sanctification, is
            really put before us. Now, in the Old Law he was not presented but
            rather promised, the Incarnation not yet having happened; and so in
            the Old Law the institution of this sacrament could not be. Hence
            the sacraments of the Old Law functioned in the manner of sensible
            things that are known through a medium, which nevertheless are not
            really joined to the thing sensed, but rather transmit their
            likenesses to the sense-power from afar. Now indeed, the other [six]
            sacraments of the New Law, in which the power of Christ is at work,
            since they do not really contain him, are likened to the sensibles
            just mentioned, which are not incorporated into the one sensing, but
            <i>do</i>
            bring about change according to some quality [they have upon
            contact]. But this sacrament, as was said, as having a greater
            perfection, is likened to that sensible object that is incorporated
            into the one sensing, namely food. Hence it stands further from the
            mode of the sacraments of the Old Law than the other sacraments of
            the New Law do, [and so much less should it have been instituted
            prior to the coming of Christ].</font

            exigebatur ut caput nostrum etiam nobis realiter conjungeretur; et
            ideo quamdiu sub propria specie cum hominibus conversatus est, non
            oportebat hoc sacramentum institui, sed quando ejus corporali
            praesentia destituenda erat Ecclesia; et haec ratio tangitur in
            littera ab Eusebio: <i>quia</i>, inquit,
            <i>corpus assumptum ablaturus erat</i>
            et cetera. Secunda sumitur ex ejus figura. Christus enim quamdiu in
            mundo conversatus est, figuras legis observare voluit, factus sub
            lege, ut eos qui sub lege erant redimeret. Et quia veniente veritate
            cessat figura, ideo non debuit hoc sacramentum institui nisi Christo
            ascendente per mortem, quando figurae veteris legis terminandae
            erant. Tertia ratio sumitur ab ipsa repraesentatione hujus
            sacramenti. Est enim repraesentativum dominicae passionis; et ideo
            congrue jam passione imminente instituitur. Quarta ratio sumitur ex
            ritu quo frequentandum est hoc sacramentum, ut ultimo traditum magis
            memoriae teneretur.</font

            font=""
            >It should be said that this sacrament ought to have been instituted
            at the Last Supper and not before, on account of four reasons. The
            first is apparent from the very necessity of the sacrament that was
            earlier assigned, for it was required for our perfection that our
            head be joined to us even in a real manner [and not just by a
            profession of faith]; and so as long as he conversed with men in the
            proper appearance of a man, he did not need to institute this
            sacrament, but when the Church was being deprived of his bodily
            presence; and this reason is touched on in the text by Eusebius:
            "For," he says, "the body assumed was about to be taken away," etc.
            The second is taken from its figure. For Christ as long as he was
            living in the world wanted to observe the figures of the law: "made
            under the law, that he might redeem those who were under the law"
            (cf. Gal. 4:4-5). And since the figure ceases when the truth is
            come, therefore this sacrament ought not to have been instituted
            except by Christ mounting up through death, when the figures of the
            Old Law were being brought to their end. The third reason is taken
            from the very representation of this sacrament. For it is
            representative of the Passion of the Lord; and so it was congruously
            instituted right when the Passion was at hand. The fourth reason is
            taken from the rite by which this sacrament is to be frequented, so
            that the last thing handed down might be held in greater
            remembrance.</font

            the disciples were more affected regarding the Passion when the
            Passion was about to occur than by the Passion already accomplished,
            when they were already forgetful of the oppression of the Passion on
            account of the joy of the Resurrection; and so the memorial of the
            Passion was better put before them before than after. Nor was it at
            that time a memorial but it was instituted so that later on it might
            be celebrated in memory [of the Passion].</font

            Passion, was instituted in a certain respect, as was said above; and
            further, it is not necessary that there be the same order in the
            institution of the sacraments as there is in their reception, since
            the end that is determined in advance for us is what we arrive at
            last of all. But the Eucharist is, in a certain sense, the end of
            baptism, since through baptism someone is consecrated for the
            reception of the Eucharist, as by Holy Orders one is consecrated for
            the consecration of the Eucharist. And so the argument given does

            intention; and therefore, upon the termination of the sacraments of
            the Old Law, this was the first to be instituted.</font

            <i>sed contra</i>
            ], it should be said that that argument works for the things that
            someone was able to grasp from the beginning. But the Apostles from
            the beginning were not so capable of [receiving] mysteries; and so,
            this [mystery of the Eucharist] was put before them at the very end.
            And further, that argument works for things that are imprinted on
            the memory on account of themselves; but in those things that
            affection for the speaker imprints on the memory, it is otherwise;
            for they are then imprinted more firmly when a greater motion of
            affection is felt for the speaker. Now the longer someone keeps
            company with a friend, the greater love becomes; and when he is
            separated from the friend, the motion of love is more fervently felt
            on account of the pain of separation; and thus the words spoken at
            the last by friends departing from us are the more imprinted upon
            the memory.</font

        beginning of truth" or "an entering upon truth" or even "inchoate
        truth," but all of these suggest somehow either that Christ does not
        bring the fullness of grace and truth with him, or that he started
        something that he did not bring to completion. Thomas is more interested
        in how Christ's truth <i>reaches us:</i> is it a promise of salvation
        for us, the beginning of the fulfillment of this promise, or the eternal
        consummation of this promise? Thus "dawning" suggests that the truth has
        really come with Christ, he is the promise fulfilled, but there is still
        full daylight ahead <i>for us who believe</i> and are not yet bathed in
        the light of heavenly glory.
