In regard to this three things are presented: first, the man's infirmity; secondly, his healing (v 6); thirdly, a discussion among the Jews about this health (v 8). In regard to the first he does two things: first, the man's infirmity is mentioned; secondly, we see an inquiry about its cause (v 2).

          <td>Sciendum est circa primum, quod Iesus abscondens se, et de templo recedens, dum praeteriret, vidit hunc caecum.

VIII, 13: <i>ne accendas carbones peccatorum, arguens eos, et ne incendaris flamma ignis peccatorum illorum</i>. Secundo ut emolliret Iudaeorum duritiam ex miraculo facto et fiendo; infra c.

          <td>1294 It should be noted in regard to the first that Jesus hid himself and left the temple, and while passing by he saw this blind man, as he passed by, he saw a man blind from his birth. Three things are considered here. First, he passed by to avoid the anger of the Jews: "Do not kindle the coals of a sinner lest you be burned in his flaming fire" (Sir 8:10). Secondly, he wanted to try and soften their hardness of heart by working a miracle: "If I had not done among them the works which no one else did, they would not have sin" (15:24). Thirdly, he went on his way in order to confirm his words by working a sign; for our Lord's works produce faith in the things that he says: "He confirmed the message by the sign that attended it" (Mk 16:20).

            In the mystical sense, according to Augustine, this blind man is the human race. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Sin is a spiritual blindness: "Their wickedness blinded them" (Wis 2:21). The human race is blind from birth, because it contracted sin from his its origin, for the blindness occurs through sin in the first man, from whom all of us draw our origin. We read, "We were by nature," by natural origin, "children of wrath" (Eph 2:3).

          <td>Circa primum tria quaerenda occurrunt.

          <td>
            1296 In regard to the first, three things are to be considered. The first is the reason for the disciples questioning Christ. According to Chrysostom, this was because Jesus, leaving the temple and seeing this blind man, looked at him intently, as though seeing in him an opportunity to manifest his power. And so the disciples seeing him look so intently at the blind man were impelled to question him. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a>
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo discipulorum diligentia, quia dicunt <i>Rabbi</i>, vocantes eum magistrum, ut innuant se sic quaerere, quasi discere desiderantes. Tertio quare, quaerentes causam peccati, dixerunt <i>quis peccavit?</i>
          <td>Secondly, we see the seriousness of the disciples, because they say, <b>Rabbi</b>, calling him Teacher, to indicate that they are questioning him in order to learn. Thirdly, we see why they asked, <b>who sinned?</b> when they inquire into the reason for the man's blindness.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicendum, secundum Chrysostomum, quod quia dominus supra V, 14, scilicet quando paralyticum sanavit, dixerat ei: <i>ecce iam sanus factus es: vade, et amplius noli peccare</i>, cogitaverunt discipuli, quod propter peccatum ei illa infirmitas accidisset, aestimantes ulterius quod omnis humana infirmitas proveniret ex peccato, secundum quod Eliphaz dicit, Iob IV, 7: <i>quis unquam innocens periit?</i> Et ideo quaerebant utrum ex peccato suo vel parentum caecus natus fuisset. Sed quod ex peccato suo esset, non videtur: quia nullus peccat antequam nascatur, cum animae ante corpora non fuerint, nec peccaverint, ut quidam falso opinati sunt: secundum illud Rom. IX, 11: <i>cum nondum nati fuissent, aut aliquid boni egissent aut mali (...); non ex operibus, sed ex vocante dictum est ei; quia maior serviet minori</i>. Quod autem hoc ex peccato parentum passus fuerit, non videtur: quia Deut. XXIV, 16, dicitur: <i>non occidentur patres pro filiis, nec filii pro parentibus</i>.
          <td>
            It must be said, according to Chrysostom, that because the Lord said to the paralytic, when he healed him, "See, you are well! Sin no more, that nothing worse befall you," the disciples thought that his infirmity was due to sin. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> They also thought that every human illness arose from sin, as Eliphaz said: "Think now, who that was innocent ever perished?" (Jb 4:7). Therefore, they asked whether he had been born blind on account of his own sin or that of his parents. It does not seem to have been on account of his own sin, because no one sins before he is born, since souls do not exist before their bodies, nor do they sin, as some mistakenly think: "Though they were not yet born and had done nothing, either good or bad not because of works but because of his call, she was told 'The elder will served the younger'" (Rom 9:11). Nor does it seem that he suffered on account of a sin of his parents, for we read: "The fathers shall not be put to death for their children, nor shall the children be put to death for the fathers" (Deut 24:16).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed sciendum, quod est duplex poena qua homines puniuntur. Una est spiritualis quantum ad animam; alia est corporalis quantum ad corpus. Et poena quidem spirituali numquam filius pro patre punitur. Cuius ratio assignatur Ez. XVIII, 4, quia anima filii non est ex patre, sed a Deo. <i>Omnes</i>, inquit, <i>animae meae sunt</i>, scilicet per creationem, <i>sicut anima patris, ita anima filii mea est: anima quae peccaverit ipsa punietur</i>. Hoc etiam dicit Augustinus in quadam epistola. Sed poena corporali filius pro patre punitur, cum quantum ad corpus sit quaedam res patris. Et expresse hoc habetur Gen. XIX, ubi filii Sodomorum occisi sunt pro peccato parentum in subversione Sodomae. Multoties etiam dominus comminatur Iudaeis occisionem puerorum propter peccata parentum.
          <td>
            Note that people are punished with two kinds of punishment. One is spiritual and concerns the soul; the other is bodily and concerns the body. A child is never punished on account of his father with a spiritual punishment, because the soul of a child is not from his father but from God: "All souls are mine," that is, by creation, "the soul of the father as well as the soul of the child is mine: the soul that sins shall be punished" [Ez 18:4]. Augustine also says this in one of his letters. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> But a child is punished on account of his father with a bodily punishment, since he is of his father as far as his body is concerned. This is expressly shown in Genesis (c 19) where when Sodom was destroyed the children of the inhabitants of Sodom were killed on account of the sins of their parents. Again, the Lord very often threatened to destroy the children of the Jews on account of the sins of their parents.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quare autem uno peccato alius puniatur, sciendum, quod poena duo habet, laesionem et remedium. Nam aliquando abscinditur membrum ut totum corpus conservetur: et sic poena huius laesionem infert inquantum abscinditur, sed remedium habet inquantum conservat corpus. Numquam tamen medicus nobilius membrum abscindit propter conservationem minus nobilis, sed e converso. In rebus autem humanis, anima nobilior est corpore, et corpus nobilius exterioribus rebus; et ideo numquam fit ut aliquis propter corpus in anima puniatur, sed potius in corpore propter remedium animae. Quandoque ergo Deus irrogat poenas corporibus, vel rebus exterioribus, propter remedium bonum animae: et tunc huiusmodi poenae non inferuntur ut laesivae tantum, sed ut purgativae in remedium. Unde et ipsa puerorum Sodomitarum occisio fuit ad bonum animarum: non quidem ad meritum, sed ne paternae malitiae imitatores, vivendo peccata cumulantes, atrocius punirentur. Sic etiam pro peccatis parentum pluries aliqui puniuntur.
          <td>
            1297 To understand why one person is punished on account of the sins of another, we must realize that a punishment has two aspects: it is an injury and a remedy. Sometimes a part of the body is cut off to save the entire body. And a punishment of this kind causes an injury insofar as a part is cut off, but it is a remedy insofar as it saves the body itself. Still, a doctor never cuts off a superior member to save one which is inferior, but the other way around. Now in human matters, the soul is superior to the body, and the body is superior to external possessions. And so it never happens that someone is punished in his soul for the sake of his body, but rather he is punished in his body as a curing remedy for his soul. Therefore, God sometimes imposes physical punishments, or difficulties in external concerns, as a beneficial remedy for the soul. And then punishments of this kind are not given just as injuries, but as healing remedies. Thus, the killing of the children of Sodom was for the good of their souls: not because they deserved it, but so they would not be punished more severely for increasing their sins in a life spent in imitating their parents. And in this way some are often punished for the sins of their parents. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>

          <td>Consequenter cum dicit <i>respondit Iesus</i> etc., manifestat dominus causam infirmitatis, et primo excludit causam opinatam; secundo subdit veram; et tertio manifestat ipsam.
          <td>1298 Then when he says, <b>Jesus answered</b>, our Lord reveals the reason for the man's infirmity: first, he excludes the reason they assumed; secondly, he mentions the real reason; and thirdly, he explains it.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Causam quidem opinatam excludit, cum respondit dicens <i>neque hic peccavit, neque parentes eius</i>. Hanc enim esse causam infirmitatis, opinati sunt discipuli, ut dictum est. Sed contra. Rom. III, 23: <i>omnes enim peccaverunt, et egent gloria Dei</i>. Et ibid. V, 12, dicitur, quod peccatum ab Adam in omnes pertransiit. Respondeo dicendum, quod tam caecus quam parentes eius originali peccato tenebantur, et etiam alia actualia vivendo superaddiderant, quia, <i>si dixerimus quod peccatum non habemus, ipsi nos seducimus, et veritas in nobis non est</i>: I Io. I, 8. Quod autem dominus dicit <i>neque hic peccavit</i>, intelligendum est eos non peccasse, ad hoc quod caecus nasceretur; quasi diceret, quod eius caecitas non est consecuta ex eorum peccato.
          <td>1299 He excludes the reason they assumed when he says, <b>it was not that this man sinned, or his parents</b>: for the disciples had assumed that this was the reason for his infirmity, as was said. But a contrary statement is found in Romans [3:23]: "All have sinned and are in need of God's glory." And again we read that sin has passed into all men from Adam. I answer to this that both the blind man and his parents did contract original sin and even added other actual sins during their live, for we read: "If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us" (1 Jn 1:8). But when the Lord says, <b>it was not that this man sinned, or his parents</b>, he means that his blindness did not come as a result of their sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Causam autem veram subdit dicens <i>sed ut manifestentur opera Dei in illo</i>: nam per opera Dei in eius cognitionem ducimur; Rom. I, 20: <i>invisibilia Dei per ea quae facta sunt, intellecta conspiciuntur</i>; supra V: <i>opera quae dedit mihi pater, haec sunt quae testimonium perhibent de me</i>. Cognitio autem Dei est summum bonum hominis, cum in ea consistat hominis beatitudo; infra XVII, 3: <i>haec est vita aeterna, ut cognoscant te solum Deum verum, et quem misisti Iesum Christum</i>. Et Ier. IX, 24: <i>in hoc glorietur qui gloriatur, scire et nosse me</i>. Si ergo infirmitas contingit ut manifestentur opera Dei, et per ipsorum manifestationem Deus innotescit; manifestum est quod huiusmodi corporales infirmitates contingunt propter bonum.
          <td>1300 He mentions the real reason when he says, <b>but that the works of God might be made manifest in him</b>, for through the works of God we are led to a knowledge of him: "his invisible nature has been clearly perceived in the things that have been made" (Rom 1:20); "The very works which my Father has given me to performthey bear witness to me" (5:36). But the knowledge of God is man's greatest good, since his happiness consists in this: "This is eternal life, that they know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou has sent" (17:3); "Let him who glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me" (Jer 9:24). If, therefore, an infirmity occurs in order that God's works be manifested, and God is made known through this manifestation, it is clear that such bodily infirmities occur for a good purpose.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Posset autem alicui videri quod manifestatio operum Dei non sit sufficiens causa infirmitatis huiusmodi, praesertim cum neque hic, neque parentes eius peccaverunt, et ideo volunt dicere, quod ly ut tenetur non causaliter, sed consequenter; quasi dicat: eo existente caeco, opera Dei manifestantur ipsum curantis. Sed hoc non videtur sane dictum; et ideo melius dicendum, quod tenetur causaliter. Est enim duplex malum: scilicet culpae et poenae. Sed malum quidem culpae Deus non facit, sed permittit fieri; quod non permitteret, nisi intenderet inde bonum aliquod. Unde dicit Augustinus in Enchir.: <i>Deus adeo bonus est, quod numquam permitteret aliquod malum fieri, nisi esset adeo potens quod de quolibet malo eliciat bonum</i>. Sic ergo permittit aliqua peccata fieri ex intentione boni quod intendit: sicut permisit saevire tyrannos, ut coronaret martyres. Multo ergo magis debet dici, quod malum poenae, quod ipse fecit, ut dicitur Amos III, 6: <i>non est malum quod dominus non fecerit</i>, numquam inducit nisi ex intentione boni. Et inter alia bona optimum est quod opera Dei manifestentur, et ex eis innotescat Deus. Non est ergo inconveniens si aliqua flagella immittit, vel peccata aliqua fieri permittit, ut bonum inde proveniat.
          <td>
            1301 It might seem that the manifestation of God's works is not a sufficient reason for such an infirmity, especially since neither he nor his parents sinned. Therefore, some say that the words <b>but that</b> do not indicate the reason but merely the sequence of events. The sense then being: the man was blind, and the works of God were manifested in his cure. But this does not seem to be reasonable; and so it is better to say that the reason is being given. For evil is twofold: the evil of fault and the evil of punishment. Now God does not cause the evil of fault, but permits it; yet he would not permit it unless he intended some good from it. So Augustine says in his <i>Enchiridion</i>: "God is so good that he would never permit any evil to occur, unless he was so powerful as to draw some good from every evil." <a href="John9.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> Therefore, he allows certain sins to be committed because he intends some good; in this way, he allows the rage of tyrants so that martyrs may be crowned. Much more, therefore, should it be said that the evil of punishment, which he causes - as Amos (3:6) says: "Does evil befall a city, unless the Lord has done it?" - is never applied except for the good he intends. And among these goods the best is that the works of God be manifested, and from them that God be known. Therefore, it is not unfitting if he sends afflictions or allows sins to be committed in order that some good come from them. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a>

          <td>Et sciendum, quod, ut Gregorius dicit I Moral., quinque modis Deus hominibus immittit flagella. Quandoque quidem ad initium damnationis, secundum illud Ier. VII, 18: <i>duplici contritione contere eos</i>. Et hoc flagello percutitur peccator in hac vita sic, ut sine retractatione et fine puniatur in alia; sicut Herodes qui occidit Iacobum, punitus est in hac vita, et in Inferno similiter: Act. XII, 23. Quandoque autem ad correctionem: et de hac dicitur in Ps. XVII, 36: <i>disciplina tua ipsa me docebit</i>. Quandoque autem flagellatur aliquis non propter praeteritorum correctionem, sed ad futurorum praeservationem: sicut de Paulo legitur II Cor. XII, 7: <i>ne magnitudo revelationum extollat me, datus est mihi stimulus carnis meae, Angelus Satanae, qui me colaphizet</i>. Quandoque autem ad promotionem virtutis: ut scilicet cum in aliquo <i>nec praeterita culpa corrigitur, nec futura prohibetur, dum inopinata salus persecutionem sequitur, salvantis virtute cognita, ardentius amatur</i>; II ad Cor. XII, 9: <i>virtus in infirmitate perficitur</i>; Iac. I, 4: <i>patientia opus perfectum habet</i>. Quandoque vero ad manifestationem divinae gloriae: unde et hic dicitur <i>ut manifestentur opera Dei in illo</i>.
          <td>
            1302 It should be noted, as Gregory says in <i>I Morals</i>, that God sends afflictions to men in five ways. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a> Sometimes they are the beginning of damnation, according to Jeremiah: "Strike them with a double punishment." A sinner is struck with this kind of punishment in this life so that without interruption or end he might be punished in the other life. For example, Herod, who killed James, was punished in this life and also in hell (Acts 12:23). Sometimes afflictions are sent as a correction, as we read: "Your discipline will teach me" [Ps 17:36]. And sometimes a person is afflicted not to correct past wrongs, but to preserve him from future ones, as we read of Paul: "And to keep me from being too elated by the abundance of revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan, to harass me, to keep me from being too elated" (2 Cor 12:7). Again, sometimes it is done to encourage virtue: as when a person's past sins are not being corrected, nor future ones hindered, but he is led to a stronger love by knowing the power of the one who unexpectedly delivered him from some difficulty: "Virtue is made perfect in infirmity" [2 Cor 12:9]; "Patience has a perfect work" [Jas 1:4]. And finally, sometimes afflictions are sent to manifest the divine glory; thus we read here, <b>that the works of God might be made manifest in him</b>.

          <td>1304 He says, therefore, this man was born blind <b>that the works of God might be made manifest in him</b>. And it was necessary that they be manifested, for <b>we must work the works of him who sent me</b>, that is, the works entrusted to me by my Father: "I have come to do the will of him who sent me" (6:38). And below he says: "Father, I have accomplished the work you gave me to do" (17:4). Or, these words can refer to Christ insofar as he is God; and then they indicate the equality of his power with that of the Father. Then the meaning is, <b>we must work the works of him who sent me</b>, that is, the works which I have from the Father. For everything that the Son does, even according to his divine nature, he has from his Father: "The Son can do nothing of his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing" (5:19).

But the Sun of Justice or Righteousness is Christ, our God: "But for you who fear my name the sun of righteousness shall rise" (Mal 4:2). Therefore, as long as this Sun is present to us, the works of God can be done in us, for us, and by us. At one time this Sun was physically present to us; and then it was day: "This is the day which the Lord has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it" (Ps 118:24). Therefore, it was fitting to do the works of God. He is also present us by grace; and then it is the day of grace, when it is fitting to do the works of God, <b>while it is day</b>; "The night is far gone, the day is at hand. Let us then cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light" (Rom 13:12); "Those who sleep, sleep at night" (1 Thess 5:7).

In the same way for Christ, the Sun of Justice, it is always day and the time for acting; but not with respect to us, because we are not always able to receive his grace due to some obstacle on our part.

One is by the physical departure of the Sun of Justice, which is what the Apostles experienced when they were demoralized at the time of the passion, when Christ was physically taken from them: "you will all fall away because of me this night" (Mt 26:31). Then it was not the time for acting, but for suffering.

Una per subtractionem actualis gratiae quam inducit peccatum mortale; I Thess. V, 7: <i>qui dormiunt, nocte dormiunt</i>. Et quando haec nox venit, nemo potest operari opera meritoria vitae aeternae. Alia nox est consummata, quando non solum privatur actuali gratia quis per peccatum mortale, sed etiam facultate adipiscendi, per aeternam damnationem in Inferno, ubi profunda nox est, quae erit illis quibus dicitur: <i>ite, maledicti, in ignem aeternum</i>: Matth. XXV, 41. Et tunc nemo potest operari, quia non est tempus merendi, sed secundum merita recipiendi. Dum ergo vivis, fac sicut facturus es. Unde Eccle. IX, 10: <i>quaecumque potest manus tua, instanter operare: quia neque ratio, neque opus, nec sapientia, nec scientia erunt apud Inferos, quo tu properas</i>.
          <td>But it is better to say that even when Christ was physically absent because of his ascension, it was still day for the Apostles insofar as the Sun of Justice shone on them, and it was a time for working. And so night in this passage refers to that night which comes from the spiritual separation from the Sun of Justice, that is, by the separation from grace. This night is of two kinds. One is by the loss of actual grace through mortal sin: "Those who sleep, sleep at night" (1 Thess 5:7). When this night comes, no one can perform works that merit eternal life. The other night is total, when one is deprived not only of actual grace by mortal sin, but even of the ability of obtaining grace because of an eternal damnation in hell. Here there is a vast night for those to whom it will be said: "Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire" (Mt 24:41). During this night no one can work, because it is not the time for meriting, but for receiving according to one's merits. Therefore, while you are living, do now what you will want to have done then: "Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or thought of knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going" (Eccl 9:10).

Licet enim omnia miracula dominus solo verbo facere potuisset, quia <i>ipse dixit, et facta sunt</i>, frequenter tamen corpore suo in eis utitur, ut ostendat ipsum, inquantum est divinitatis organum, virtutem quamdam salutarem esse sortitum. Lutum autem fecit ex sputo, ut ostendat se membra homini deficientia posse formare, qui formaverat totum primum hominem. Unde sicut primum hominem de luto formavit, ita lutum fecit ut formaret oculos caeci nati.

            1310 The literal meaning is explained by Chrysostom in this way. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" id="_ftnref10">[10]</a> Christ restored the man's sight by spittle in order to show that he accomplished this by a power coming from himself, and that the miracle should not be attributed to anything else: "Power came forth from him" (Lk 6:19). Although our Lord could have performed all his miracles by his mere word, because "he commanded and they were created" (Ps 148:5), he frequently used his body in them to show that as an instrument of his divinity it held a definite healing power. He made clay from his spittle to show that he who had formed the entire first man can reshape the deficient members of a man. Thus, just as he formed the first man from clay, so he made clay to re-form the eyes of the one born blind.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Linivit autem lutum super oculos caeci nati, ut ostenderet se conditorem corporum, per id quod potissimum est in corporibus. Homo enim inter creaturas corporales praecellentior est; inter membra vero hominis praecellit caput; inter membra autem capitis, oculus excellentior invenitur. Unde Matthaeus VI, 21: <i>lucerna corporis tui est oculus tuus</i>. Formando ergo oculum ceteris corporalibus excellentiorem, ostendit se creatorem esse totius hominis et naturae corporeae. Dixit autem ei <i>vade, et lava te in natatoria Siloe</i>, ne videretur terra super oculos linita virtutem sanativam oculi habere. Unde quamdiu lutum in oculis habuit, non vidit, sed postquam lavit.
          <td>He rubbed the clay on the eyes of the one born blind to show, by healing what is most important in bodies, that he was the creator of bodies. For man is more excellent than all other bodily substances; and among his members, the head is the more excellent; and among the organs of the head, the eye is more excellent than the others: "The eye is the lamp of the body" (Mt 6:22). Therefore, by repairing the eye, which is more excellent than the other bodily members, he showed that he was the creator of the entire man and of all corporeal nature. He said, <b>go, wash in the pool of Siloam</b>, so that it would not seem that the clay he rubbed on the eyes had the power to heal them. Thus, as long as he had the clay on his eyes, the man did not see, but saw only after he washed.

          <td>Misit autem eum longe ad lavandum, scilicet ad natatoria Siloe: primo quidem ad confutandam Iudaeorum duritiam; nam oportebat eum transire civitatem, ut sic omnes viderent eumdem caecum euntem, lutum super oculos habentem, et redeuntem visu suo restituto. Secundo vero ut commendetur caeci obedientia et fides: frequenter enim forte lutum in faciem receperat, frequenter in natatoria Siloe se laverat, et tamen non viderat. Unde potuisset dicere: lutum solet magis excaecare, et multoties me ibidem lavi, et in nullo sum adiutus, sicut de Naaman legitur IV Reg. V, 10 ss. Sed non contradixit, immo simpliciter obedivit. Unde sequitur <i>abiit, et lavit</i>. Ideo autem ad natatoria Siloe eum misit, quia per illam aquam signatus est populus Iudaeorum; Is. VIII, 6: <i>populus iste abiecit aquas Siloe, quae currunt cum silentio</i>. Ut ergo ostendat quod non est alienus ab amore populi Iudaici, ad Siloe mittit eum.
          <td>He sent him some distance to wash, to the pool of Siloam, first, to overcome the obstinacy of the Jews. For he had to cross the city, and so all would see the blind man going with the clay on his eyes, and then returning with his sight restored. Secondly, he did this to acclaim the obedience and faith of the blind man; for perhaps he had frequently had clay put on his face, and had often washed in the pool of Siloam, and yet had not seen. So he could have said: "Clay usually makes me worse, and I have often washed in the pool but was never helped," as we read of Naaman in 2 Kings (5:10). Yet he did not argue, but simply obeyed. Thus it follows, <b>so he went and washed</b>. The reason why he sent him to the pool of Siloam was because the Jewish people were signified by that water: "Because this people have refused the waters of Shiloah that flow gently" (Is 8:6) Therefore, he sent him to Siloam to show that he still loved the Jewish people.

Tunc ergo dominus de sputo et terra lutum fecit, cum verbum caro factum est. <i>Linivit autem oculos caeci</i>, idest humani generis, oculos scilicet cordis, per fidem incarnationis Christi. Sed nondum videbat: quia quando forte inunxit, catechumenum fecit, qui fidem habet, sed nondum est baptizatus. Et ideo mittit eum ad piscinam, quae vocatur Siloe, ut lavetur et illuminetur, idest baptizetur et in Baptismo plenam illuminationem recipiat. Unde, secundum Dionysium, Baptismus dicitur illuminatio; Ez. XXXVI, 25: <i>effundam super vos aquam mundam, et mundabimini ab omnibus inquinamentis vestris</i>. Et ideo signanter hoc Evangelium legitur illo die in Quadragesima quo incipit fieri scrutinium baptizandorum in sabbato sancto. Nec sine causa Evangelista subdit interpretationem piscinae, dicens <i>quod interpretatur missus</i>: quia quicumque baptizantur oportet baptizari in Christo, qui est missus a patre; Gal. III, 27: <i>quotquot baptizati estis, Christum induistis</i>. Nisi enim ille fuisset missus, nemo nostrum esset ab iniquitate dimissus.
          <td>
            1311 Augustine gives the mystical and allegorical explanation. He says that the spittle, which is saliva that descends from the head, signifies the Word of God, who proceeds from the Father, the head of all things: "I came forth from the mouth of the Most High" (Sir 24:3). Therefore, the Lord made clay from spittle and the earth when the Word was made flesh. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> He anointed the eyes of the blind man, that is, of the human race. And the eyes are the eyes of the heart, anointed by faith in the incarnation of Christ. But the blind man did not yet see, because the anointing produced a catechumen, who has faith but has not yet been baptized. So he sends him to the pool of Siloam to wash and receive his sight, i.e., to be baptized, and in baptism to receive full enlightenment. Thus, according to Dionysius, baptism is an enlightenment: "I will sprinkle clean water upon you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness" (Ezek 36:25). <a href="John9.htm#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" id="_ftnref12">[12]</a> And so this Gospel is appropriately read in Lent, on Holy Saturday, when those about to be baptized are examined. Nor is it without reason that the Evangelist adds the meaning of the pool, saying, <b>which means Sent</b>, because whoever is baptized must be baptized in Christ, who was sent by the Father: "As many of you as were baptized in Christ have put on Christ" (Gal 3:27). For if Christ had not been sent, none of us would have been freed from sin.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum Gregorium autem, per salivam sapor intimae contemplationi accipitur, quae ad os de capite defluit, quia de caritate conditoris adhuc in hac vita nos positos, gustu revelationis tangit. Unde dominus salivam luto miscuit, et caeci nati oculos reparavit, quia superna gratia carnalem cogitationem nostram per mixtionem suae contemplationis irradiat, et ab originali caecitate homines ad intellectum reformat et cetera.
          <td>
            According to Gregory, however, the spittle signifies the savor of intimate contemplation, which flows from the head into the mouth, because due to the love of our Creator we have been touched even in this life with the savor of revelation. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> Thus the Lord mixed spittle with earth and restored sight to the man born with his contemplation, and heals our understanding from its original blindness.

He says, <b>the neighbors and those who had seen him before as a beggar said: Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?</b> Here two things are to be considered. One is that due to the greatness of the miracle, it was considered incredible. So we read below: "Never since the world began has it been heard that any one opened the eyes of a man born blind" (9:32). This fulfills for them what is said in Habakkuk (1:5), "I am doing a work in your days that you would not believe if told." Secondly, we should note the wonderful compassion of God, because our Lord performs miracles not only for the powerful, but also for outcasts, since he healed, with great pity, those who begged. This shows that he who came for our salvation rejected no one because of their poverty: "Has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom?" (Jas 2:5). Thus they explicitly say, <b>Is not this the man who used to sit and beg?</b> This is like saying: He is an outcast and does not deserve to be cured. But Baruch says the opposite: "The giants who were born thereGod did not choose them" (3:26).

So he did not say, "He made clay from spittle," but only, he <b>made clay and anointed my eyes</b>: "That which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon and touched with our handswe proclaim also to you" (1 Jn 1:1).

            Secondly, we have the answer of the blind man, <b>I do not know</b>.

The anointing represents the beginning of his physical health, and the washing leads to complete health. In particular, an anointing produces a catechumen; and the washing, that is, baptism, perfects and enlightens him. Thus we have a representation of the difference in faith found at different stages. For when he says, <b>I do not know</b>, this represents the imperfect faith of catechumens: "You worship what you do not know" (4:22). This can also signify our faith: "For our knowledge is imperfect and our prophesying is imperfect" (1 Cor 13:9).

So because they did not have Christ they took the blind man, so that by questioning him more roughly they might force him by fear to make up something false about Christ: "I will go to the great, and will speak to them; for they know the way of the Lord, the law of their God.

The blind man answers them, not contradicting what he said before, nor deviating from the truth. <b>He</b>, that is, the blind man, <b>said to them, He put clay on my eyes</b>. We must, first, admire the perseverance of this blind man, for although it may not seem such a great thing to have spoken the truth when he, without danger, was questioned by the crowd, he showed remarkable perseverance when in greater danger before the Pharisees he neither denied what he had said before nor changed his account: "I will also speak of thy testimonies before kings, and shall not be put to shame" (Ps 119:46). Secondly, we should admire his skill, for it is good practice to first relate an event in detail and with all its circumstances, and then if it has to be repeated, to speak more concisely. So here, he does not repeat the name of the one who spoke to him, nor that he was told to go and wash. But without hesitation he relays only the essential, and says, <b>He put clay on my eyes</b>.

This is what they are doing here: for they do not mention what seemed good, that is, the restoration of the blind man's sight, but stress what they can against Christ, that is, his breaking of the Sabbath. Thus <b>some of the Pharisees said</b>, that is, those who were malicious and corrupt, <b>this man is not from God, for he does not keep the Sabbath</b>. But Christ did keep the Sabbath, for when the Lord forbade work on the Sabbath he had in mind servile work, which is a sin: "Every one who does sinful works on the Sabbath breaks the Sabbath.

They did this in an attempt to nullify the miracle of Christ and to preserve their own glory: "How can you believe, who receive glory from one another?" (Jn 5:44).

First, about their son, saying <b>Is this your son?</b> Secondly, about his blindness; and so they add, <b>who you say was born blind</b>.

          <td>Thirdly, they ask how he had obtained his sight, <b>How then does he now see?</b> This was like saying: Either it is false that he now sees, or that he was once blind; but obviously the truth is that he sees; therefore it was false to say that he had been blind: "The powerful man will test you through much talking, and while he smiles he will be examining you" (Sir 13:11).

First, they admit the first, namely, that he is their son; so they say, <b>we know that this is our son</b>. They also admit the second when they add, <b>and that he was born blind</b>. This shows that the truth always conquers what is false, as we read in the apocryphal 3 Esdras (3:13): "Truth conquers all."

They answer this way because the question was directed against the one who gave sight to their son, and so they refer this to their son, saying, <b>Ask him, he is of age</b>. This was like saying: He was born blind, not mute; thus he can speak for himself in this matter. The testimony about this miracle was from several sources so as to make it more believable: the parents told what they knew, and their blind son confirmed that he had been cured.

            1334 The reason for their answer is given when he says, <b>his parents said this because they feared the Jews</b>; for they were still imperfect and did not dare do what our Lord says: "Do not fear those who kill the body" (Mt 10:28). The reason for their fear was <b>that the Jews had already agreed that if any one should confess him to be Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue</b>. "I have said all this to you to keep you from falling away. They will put you out of the synagogues" (Jn 16:11). As Augustine says, it was no longer an evil to be cast out of the synagogue, for the ones they rejected Christ welcomed. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>

First, they attempt to make him deny the truth; secondly, they revile him (v 28); and thirdly, they condemn him (v 34). The Evangelist does two things about the first. First, he shows how they tried to get the man born blind to deny the truth; secondly, how they continued to question him in order to malign him (v 26). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows their malice; and secondly, the steadfastness of the man born blind (v 25). The malice of the Pharisees is shown by their attempt to have him deny the truth, while the steadfastness of the blind man appears by his resolute profession of the truth.

            1336 In regard to the first he says, <b>for the second time they called the man who had been blind</b>, for his parents had referred them to the blind man, <b>and said to him: Give God the praise</b>. They say one thing but mean another. For they wish to force him to say that his sight was not restored by Christ, or if they are unable to do this, to force him to admit that he was cured by him through sorcery. They do not say this openly, but implicitly, with an appearance of devotion. They attempt this by saying, <b>Give God the praise</b>. As if to say: Your sight has been given to you. But only God can do this. Therefore, you should not attribute this to anyone but God, and not to this man, that is, Christ, because if you do this you are indicating that you have not received the gift of your healing from God, for the reason that God does not perform miracles through sinners. Thus they add, <b>we know that this man is a sinner</b>. But, as Augustine says, if he had done this, he would not be giving glory to God but rather, being ungrateful, would be blaspheming. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn22" name="_ftnref22" title="" id="_ftnref22">[22]</a> But in truth, the Pharisees were lying when they said, <b>we know that this man is a sinner</b>; for above (8:46), they could not convict him of sin, and he said: "which of you convicts me of sin?"

So they did not ask "How is it that you see?" but <b>How did he open your eyes?</b> It was like saying: "He did this by some trick or sorcery, didn't he?"

He first belittles the repeated questioning of the Pharisees, saying, <b>I have told you already and you would not listen. Why do you want to hear it again?</b> This was like saying: I told you once. Why do you want to hear it again? That's foolish! It looks like you are not paying attention to what I am saying. So, I have nothing further to say to you because your questioning is useless, and you want to cavil rather than learn.

Quia ergo isti diligenter quaerebant, et caecus non ausus est eis imponere quod mala intentione quaererent, declinat ad aliam partem, dicens <i>numquid et vos vultis discipuli eius fieri?</i> Quasi dicat: si non quaeritis malitiose, ergo vultis adhaerere ei; Ier.

Now because the Pharisees were carefully investigating this, and because the man born blind did not dare impute an evil intention to them, he takes the alternative, saying, <b>Do you too want to become his disciples?</b> He means by this: If you are not investigating this maliciously, you therefore wish to join him: "Can the Ethiopian change his skin or the leopard his spots? Then also you can do good who are accustomed to do evil" (Jer 13:23). As Augustine says: The one who had received his sight gladly desired to give them light. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn25" name="_ftnref25" id="_ftnref25">[25]</a> Thus, he significantly says, <b>you too</b>, implying that he himself was a disciple. He is saying in effect: <b>Do you want to become his disciples</b> as I am? I already see, and do not envy your coming to the light. And as Chrysostom says, from the steadfastness of the blind man we can see how strong truth really is, for when it convinces the lowly, it makes them noble and strong.

Still, the Evangelist stated that they reviled him by saying this because what they said came from their evil hearts: "Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are smooth lips with an evil heart" (Prov 26:23).

First, they set forth their own situation, saying, <b>we are disciples of Moses</b>. But this pride of theirs is false, because they neither followed Moses nor fulfilled his commands: "If you believed Moses, you would believe me" (Jn 5:46); this was like saying: You do not follow the servant [Moses], and later go against his Lord.

          <td>Secondly, they praise the dignity of Moses when they say, <b>we know that God has spoken to Moses</b>. Here they are telling the truth, for as we read: "The Lord used to speak to Moses face to face, as a man speaks to his friend" (Ex 33:11); and "If there is a prophet among you, I, the Lord, make myself known to him in a vision, I speak with him in a dream. Not so with my servant Moses; he is entrusted with all my house. With him I speak mouth to mouth" (Num 12:6). Thus God spoke to Moses in a more excellent way than to the other prophets. And it is about this that they are speaking. However, it is clear that since God spoke his Word to Moses, the dignity of Moses came from the Word of God. And so the Word of God is of greater dignity than Moses: "Yet Jesus has been counted worthy of as much more glory than Moses as the builder of a house has more honor than the house" (Heb 3:3).

But their statement is false as they understood it, for when they said, we do <b>not know where he comes from</b>, they meant he had no authority and was unverified, so that is was not clear whether or not he came from God.

We are also amazed at great evil: "Be appalled, O heavens, at thisfor my people have committed two evils" (Jer 2:12). In line with this, the blind man says in answer, <b>Why this is a marvel! You do not know where he comes from</b>. He is saying in effect: It would not be remarkable if you regarded someone insignificant and like me as having no authority.

But there are statements which contradict this: "If they sin against thee - for there is no man who does not sin - but later repent with all their heart, then hear thou from heaven and forgive thy people" [2 Chron 6:36-39]; and in Luke (18:14) we read that the tax collector "went down to his house justified."

Sic ergo Deus audit peccatores, non per modum meriti, sed inquantum ex divina virtute, quam praedicant, impetrant quod petunt.

Thus, sometimes it obtains what it asks, and does not merit; at other times, it merits and does not obtain. And so nothing prevents the prayer of a sinner from obtaining what it asks although it does not merit. This is the way that God hears sinners; not as a matter of merit, but they obtain what they ask from the divine power, which they acknowledge. The other answer is special and applies to this particular case, when the miracle that was done makes known the person of Christ.

          <td>Sciendum est autem, quod omne miraculum factum testimonium quoddam est.

Dico ergo quod, quandocumque miraculum fit in testimonium doctrinae praedicatae, necessarium est doctrinam illam esse veram, etsi persona praedicans non sit bona. Quando etiam fit in testimonium personae, necesse est similiter quod persona illa sit bona. Constat autem quod miracula Christi fiebant in testimonium personae eius; supra V, 36: <i>opera quae dedit mihi pater ut perficiam ea, testimonium perhibent de me</i>. Hoc ergo modo loquendo caecus dixit, quod <i>numquam Deus peccatores audit</i>, scilicet quod faciant miracula attestantia sanctitati peccatorum.
          <td>
            1349 It should be mentioned that every miracle is a sort of testimony. Sometimes, a miracle is accomplished as a testimony to the truth that is being preached; at other times, it is a testimony to the person performing it. We must also realize that no true miracle happens except by the divine power, and that God is never a witness to a lie. I say, therefore, that whenever a miracle is performed in testimony to a doctrine that is being preached, that doctrine must be true, even if the person who is preaching it is not good. And when it is performed in testimony to the person, it is also necessary that the person be good. Now it is evident that the miracles of Christ were performed in testimony to his person: "The works which the Father has granted me to accomplishbear me witness that the Father has sent me" (5:36). It was with this meaning that the blind man said that <b>God does not listen to sinners</b>, that is, so that they could perform miracles as a testimony to their supposed holiness. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn28" name="_ftnref28" id="_ftnref28">[28]</a>

Cuius ratio est, quia miracula fiunt per omnipotentiam Dei, cui fides innititur: qui ergo vult impetrare a Deo aliquid, oportet quod habeat fidem; Iac. I, 6: <i>postulet autem in fide</i>. Si autem vult merendo impetrare, oportet quod faciat Dei voluntatem. Et ista duo hic ponuntur. Quantum ad primum dicit <i>sed si quis Dei cultor est</i>, per sacrificia et hostias; Is.

          <td>1350 Then when he says, <b>but if any one is a worshiper of God</b> he shows that God hears the just through merit. We must realize that the performing of miracles is attributed to faith: "If you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and cast into the sea,' it will be done" (Mt 21:21). The reason for this is that miracles are accomplished by the omnipotence of God, on which faith relies. Therefore, whoever wishes to obtain something from God has to have faith: "Let him ask in faith" (Jas 1:6). However, if he wishes to obtain it through merit, he must do God's will. And these two conditions are mentioned here. As to the first, he says, <b>If any one is a worshipper of God</b> by sacrifices and offerings: "They will worship him with sacrifice and burnt offering" (Is 19:21). These belong to the worship of <i>latria</i>, which attests to one's faith. As to the second he says, <b>and does his will</b> by obeying his commandments, <b>God listens to him</b>.

This was the opinion given by Eliphaz: "Think now, who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? As I have seen those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. By the breath of God they perish" (Job 4:7). The reason for this opinion is that in the Old Law temporal goods were promised to the good, and temporal punishment to the evil: "If you are willing and obedient, you shall eat the good of the land" (Is 1:19). Therefore, seeing that this man had been born blind, they believed that this happened on account of his sins, and so they say, <b>you were born in utter sin</b>.

Thus the Apostle teaches (1 Cor 14:30) that if something is revealed to one who is inferior, those who are greater should keep silent and listen.

          <td>1355 Christ's eagerness to teach is described in three ways. First, by his attentive consideration to what was done to the man born blind. For just as a trainer carefully considers what his athlete undergoes for his sake, so Christ attentively considered what the man born blind underwent for the sake of the truth and because of his assertions. And so he says that <b>Jesus heard</b>, attentively considered, that the Pharisees <b>had cast him out</b>, of the temple: "Give heed to me, O Lord, and to the voices of my adversaries" [Jer 18:19].

Unde colligitur quod plus diligitur unus iustus a Deo, quam decem millia peccatorum, Is. XIII, v. 12: <i>pretiosior erit vir auro, et homo mundo obrizo</i>. Et Gen. XVII, dominus pro decem iustis voluit servare Sodomam.

It is clear from this that Christ was looking for him alone, because he found more faith in him alone that in all the others. And we can see from this that God loves one just person more than ten thousand sinners: "I will make men more rare than fine gold, and mankind than the gold of Ophir" (Is 13:12).

          <td>Tertio ex seriosa interrogatione; unde <i>dixit ei: tu credis in filium Dei?</i> Iste caecus typum baptizandorum gerebat. Unde etiam consuetudo inolevit in Ecclesia ut baptizandi interrogentur de fide; I Petr. III, 21: <i>nos salvos facit Baptisma, non carnis depositio sordium sed bonae conscientiae interrogatio in Deum</i>. Interrogans autem de fide non dicit, credis in Christum? Sed <i>in filium Dei</i>: quia, ut Hilarius dicit, futurum erat ut aliqui Christum confiterentur, quem tamen filium Dei et Deum negarent; quod postmodum Arius finxit. Unde per hoc error eius manifeste excluditur. Nam si Christus non esset Deus, non esset in eum credendum, cum solus Deus sit obiectum fidei, quae in prima veritate quiescit. Unde et signanter dicit, <i>in filium</i>: nam bene possum credere alicui creaturae, puta Petro et Paulo; non tamen in Petrum, sed in Deum solum sicut in obiectum. Unde patet quod filius Dei non est creatura; Io. XIV, 1: <i>creditis in Deum, et in me credite</i>.
          <td>
            Thirdly, our Lord's eagerness is seen from the seriousness of his question; he said, <b>Do you believe in the Son of God?</b> The blind man was an image of those to be baptized. Thus the custom arose in the Church of questioning those to be baptized about their faith: "Baptismnow saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body, but as an appeal to God for a clean conscience" (1 Pet 3:21). When asked about his faith he does not say, "Do you believe in Christ?" but <b>Do you believe in the Son of God?</b> He does this, as Hilary says, because it would develop that some would profess Christ, and yet deny that he was the Son of God and God, as Arius erred. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn31" name="_ftnref31" id="_ftnref31">[31]</a> These words clearly exclude this error: for if Christ were not God, we would not have to believe in him, since God alone is the object of faith, which rests on the first truth. Thus he significantly says, <b>in the Son</b> (<i>in Filium</i>); for I am certainly able to believe some creature, such as Peter and Paul (<i>credere Petro et Paulo</i>), yet I do not believe in Peter (<i>credere in Petrum</i>), but in God (<i>in Deum</i>) alone as the object of faith [cf. no. 901]. Thus it is clear that the Son of God is not a creature: "You believe in God, believe also in me" (Jn 14:1).

          <td>Hic ponitur desiderium caeci ad credendum. Sciendum est autem circa hoc, quod caecus iste adhuc non viderat Christum corporaliter: nam quando Christus linivit oculos suos, et misit eum ad natatoria Siloe, nondum viderat eum; et antequam ad eum reverteretur, postquam lavit et vidit, detentus fuit a Pharisaeis et Iudaeis. Licet autem corporaliter eum non vidisset, credebat tamen eum qui aperuit oculos suos, esse filium Dei. Et ideo in verba desiderantis et valde inquirentis animae prorumpit, dicens <i>quis est, domine?</i> Scilicet filius Dei, qui aperuit mihi oculos, <i>ut credam in eum?</i> Ex quo hic apparet, quod eum ex parte cognoscebat, et ex parte ignorabat. Nisi enim eum cognovisset, non tam constanter pro eo disputasset, et si non ignorasset, non utique dixisset <i>quis est, domine?</i> Is. XXVI, 9: <i>anima mea desideravit te in nocte</i>, scilicet ignorantiae.
          <td>1356 Next he mentions the desire of the man born blind to believe. We have to recall that this man had not yet physically seen Christ: for he had not seen him when Christ anointed his eyes and sent him to the pool of Siloam, and when he wanted to go back to him he was detained by the Pharisees and the Jews. However, although he had not physically seen Jesus, he believed that the one who opened his eyes was the Son of God. And so he breaks out in words of desire and intense longing, and says, <b>And who is he, sir</b>, namely, the Son of God, who opened my eyes, <b>that I may believe in him?</b> It is clear from this that he knew something about Jesus, and did not know other things about him. For if he had not known him, he would not have argued so firmly on his behalf; and if he had not been ignorant of other things, he certainly would not have said, <b>Who is he, sir?</b> "My soul yearns for you in the night," that is, the night of ignorance (Is 26:9).

Here Christ is giving him a teaching of faith. First, he mentions the gift he received, saying <b>you have seen him</b>, that is, you, who did not see before, have now seen him. He is saying in effect that the man born blind received the ability to see from him: "Blessed are the eyes which see what you see" (Lk 10:23); "Lord, now let your servant depart in peacefor my eyes have seen your salvation" [Lk 2:29]. Secondly, the teaching itself is given when he says, <b>It is he who speaks to you</b>: "In these last days he has spoken to us by a Son" (Heb 1:2).

Secondly, he shows it in his conduct, <b>and he worshipped him</b>. This shows that he believes in the divine nature of Christ, because those whose consciences have been cleansed know Christ not only as the son of man, which was externally obvious, but as the Son of God, who had taken flesh: for adoration is due to God alone: "You will adore the Lord, your God" [Dt 6:13].

But on the other hand, we also read: "God sent the Son into the world, not to judge the world" [Jn 3:17]. My answer is this: In the second statement [3:17] he is speaking of the judgment of condemnation, about which we read: "Those who have done evil [will rise] to the resurrection of judgment" (Jn 5:29), that is, to a judgment of condemnation. And God did not send his Son for this purpose at his first coming; he was sent to save us. But here in the present statement [9:39], he is speaking of the judgment of distinction, about which we read: "Vindicate me, O Lord, and distinguish my cause" [Ps 43:1]. For Jesus came to distinguish the good from the evil. The words which follow show this: <b>that those who do not see may see, and that those who see may become blind.</b>

Ille ergo reputat se videntem, qui peccata sua non recognoscit; non videre autem se reputat qui recognoscit se peccatorem. Primum est proprium superborum; secundum est humilium. Est ergo sensus: <i>in iudicium veni ut non videntes videant</i>, ut discernam humiles a superbis. Dies enim erat inter lucem et tenebras discernens, ut scilicet, humiles, <i>qui non vident</i>, idest reputant se peccatores, <i>videant</i>, illuminati per fidem, et <i>qui vident</i>, idest superbi, <i>caeci fiant</i>, idest remaneant in tenebris.

            According to Augustine, those who think they see do not see, and those who do not think they see, see.

The first is characteristic of the proud; the second, of the humble. So the meaning is this: I have come to distinguish the humble from the proud, so that the humble, <b>who do not see</b>, that is, who regard themselves as sinners, <b>may see</b>, having been illuminated by faith, <b>and that those who see</b>, that is, the proud, <b>may become blind</b>, that is, may remain in the darkness.

          <td>
            1361 Chrysostom understands this passage in terms of the judgment of condemnation, so that the statement, <b>for judgment I came into this world</b> is not understood in a causal sense, but it indicates the sequence of events. <a href="John9.htm#_ftn34" name="_ftnref34" id="_ftnref34">[34]</a> It is like saying: After my coming into the world, there follows for some the judgment of condemnation increases in them. In Luke (2:23) we find something similar: "This child is set for the falling and rising of many in Israel," not because Christ is the cause of their fall, but because this follows his coming. He adds, <b>that those who do not see</b>, that is, the Gentiles, who lacked the light of divine knowledge, <b>may see</b>, i.e., be admitted to the knowledge of God: "The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light" (Is 9:2); <b>and that those who see</b>, the Jews, who did have a knowledge of God - "In Judah God is known" (Ps 76:1) - <b>may become blind</b>, fall away from the knowledge of God. The Apostle explicitly mentions this: "The Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it" (Rom 9:30).

          <td>Hic ponitur murmur Iudaeorum: quia enim verba domini carnaliter intellexerunt, videntes caecum corporaliter illuminatum, et intelligentes quod dominus commendaret in ipso solum lumen faciei et non mentis, crediderunt similiter quod comminaretur eis corporalem caecitatem, et exprobraret, cum dixit <i>caeci fiant</i> et ideo dicit <i>quod audierunt quidam ex Pharisaeis qui cum ipso erant</i>, verba praedicta. Ideo autem dicit <i>qui cum ipso erant</i>, ut ostendat eorum instabilitatem: quia quandoque cum ipso sunt propter aliqua miracula quae vident; sed tamen ab eo recedunt, cum aperitur eis veritas; Lc. VIII, 13: <i>ad tempus credunt, et in tempore tentationis recedunt. Et dixerunt ei: numquid et nos caeci sumus?</i> Scilicet corporaliter; quamvis spiritualiter caeci essent; Matth. XV, 14: <i>sinite illos: caeci sunt et duces caecorum</i>.
          <td>1362 Now we see the grumbling of the Jews. They had understood our Lord's words in a bodily sense because they had seen the man born blind physically restored to sight, and had thought that our Lord was concerned only with the light in his eyes rather than in his mind. And so they believed that he was warning and threatening them with physical blindness when he said <b>may become blind</b>. Therefore, the Evangelist says, <b>some of the Pharisees near him heard this</b>, the above words. He says who were <b>near him</b>, to show their vacillation: for sometimes they were with him because of some miracles which they saw, and then would leave when the truth was made known to them: "They believe for a while, and in time of tribulation fall away" (Lk 8:13). <b>And they said to him, Are we also blind</b>, i.e., physically? Yet they were spiritually blind: "Let them alone; they are blind guides" (Mt 15:14).
