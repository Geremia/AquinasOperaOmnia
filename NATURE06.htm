<P>THE INFINITE</H2></CENTER></P>

<BR>
<P>Infinity comes up for discussion at this point because it is related to the
continuity of motion: A continuum is infinitely divisible.  It also affects some
basic conditions of motion, such as direction, diversity of elements etc.  On the
other hand, it is not a central discussion in the philosophy of nature.</P>

without limit.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.3  Distinctions concerning infinitude</STRONG></P>

<P>Some clarification of the notion of infinitude is needed.  The first is to
distinguish between an infinite continuum and an infinite number of things.</P>

<P>	Secondly, as a privitive term it can have various meanings, just as
"invisible can be said in three ways: 1) what is of its very nature not apt to
be seen, for example, a sound which is not in the genus of visible things; 2)
what is difficult to see, as what is seen in the dark or form a distance; 3) what
is apt to be seen but is not, as something in total darkness.  Likewise
"infinite" (what cannot be crossed) can mean 1) what is outside the genus of
traversable things, such as a point and a form; 2) what can be passed over but
its passage is impossible or very difficult for us; in this way we say that the
depth of the sea is infinite; 3) what is passable, but not to its end, such as
a line without end or any other quantity without limits.  This is the proper
sense of the word "infinite".</P>

<P>	Thirdly, we can talk of an actual infinite size or number, or a potential
infinite: what can always be further divided or added to.</P>

<P>	Finally, we can distinguish between metaphysical infinitude (such as that
of God and his power etc.), abstract mathematical infinitude, and the infinitude
of a sensible body.  It is only the latter we are concerned with in this course.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.4  Dialectical arguments against infinitude</STRONG> (Book 3, Lesson 8)</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would seem that no body can be infinite, because it is limited by a surface,
which must be finite, since it is expandable.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It would seem that no infinite multitude, since if it can be numbered, whatever
that number is, is finite.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every composite sensible body is made up of elements.  If one of different
kinds of elements is infinite, that would so dominate the whole that it would
counteract any influence of the others, and thus destroy the equilibrium of the
composite.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The component elements of a body cannot be infinite, because each one of them
would occupy all space, unless they were to interpenetrate, which is impossible.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If any element were infinite, it would be impossible for the whole universe to
be anything but that element, both because it would occupy all space and because
it would overpower other elements, as Heraclitus says that at some future time
all things will be converted into fire because of the excelling power of fire.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>(Lesson 9) A body of infinite size could either never be in motion or would
always be in motion, since it would have no orientation of up or down, centre or
edge, or any direction whatsoever, within or without itself.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Were there to be motion of dissimilar parts (such as water and earth) within
such a body, then the infinite whole would not be one body simply, but only a
collection of contiguous bodies.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There can be no infinite body without an infinite number of parts.  They could
be only of one kind, since that would destroy all competition.</P>

<p style=margin-left:.25in><span style=font-family:Symbol;text-indent:-.25in></span><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Every body is in a place, and place means being in some definite reference
point to other bodies, up or down, right or left, as determined by gravitation
to a place of rest.  Such directional reference would be impossible in an
infinite body.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.5  The infinite as existing in potency</STRONG> (Book 3, Lesson 10)</P>

<P>The foregoing would indicate that there is no body of infinite size.  On the
other hand, some kind of infinitude must exist; otherwise time could not go on
indefinitely (in an eternal world), and magnitudes would be divisible into parts
that are not magnitudes because they are indivisible; likewise number could not
increase indefinitely.</P>

<P>	Therefore infinitude exists as something in potency, in the sense that
every magnitude is always divisible and every number can be added to.  But
something is found to be in potency in two ways:  In one way the whole can be
reduced to act, as it is possible for this bronze to be a statue.  But the
infinite in potency is not meant ever to be entirely in act; rather it will be
in act not all at once, but part after part.  It is just as we say that today is
actual, because one instant of this day is presently actual.</P>

<P>	The infinitude of magnitudes and of numbers both consists in a finite
actualization of something that can always be further actualized, by division or
addition.  But the two differ in that a magnitude that is divided or added to
remains permanent and is not corrupted, but the finite parts of an infinite time
and of successive generation are corrupted, while time and generation go on.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.6  Definition of infinitude</STRONG> (Book 3, Lesson 11)</P>

<P>The <STRONG>infinite</STRONG> is <EM>that beyond which there is always something</EM>.  This definition
excludes a circle, which can be the subject of infinite motion, but the same
parts are gone over again and again.  It also excludes the definition of early
philosophers, "that outside of which there is nothing", which is the definition
of a perfect and whole thing.  But the infinite, in as much as it is in potency,
is like matter with respect to the perfection of magnitude, and like a whole in
potency, not a whole in act.  It is something imperfect, comparable to matter not
having perfection.  And, since the whole contains but matter is contained, the
infinite as such does not contain but is contained, since whatever amount of the
infinite is is in act is always contained by something greater, as it is possible
to move to something beyond it.</P>

<P>	From this, two other conclusions follow.  One is that the infinite, as
such, is unknown, because it is like matter without definition or form, and
matter is not known except through form.  The other conclusion is that the
infinite has more the notion of a part than of a whole, since matter is compared
to the whole as a part.  And it is not a surprise that the infinite conducts
itself as a part, in as much as only a part of it is ever actual.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.7  Explanations</STRONG> (Book 3, Lesson 12)</P>

<P>Infinity in numbers is opposite to that of magnitudes.  For the unit is the
principle of number, and divisions of numbers cannot go below the unit [since
fractions and negative numbers are still computed in terms of a unit], but
addition to number can go on without end.  Magnitude, however, is always of a
finite size, yet its division can go on infinitely [quantitatively, but
physically there is a limit, just as there a physical limit to the size of
anything].</P>

<P>	Infinitude is not found according to the same respect in motion, magnitude
and time.  Rather, the infinitude of time derives from that of motion, of which
it is a measure, and the infinitude of motion derives from that of magnitude,
over which motion takes place, as will be explained in Chapter 7.</P>

<P>	The infinite is a principle resembling matter, but not in so far as matter
lies under a form, but in as much as matter has privation --for the infinite
implies the lack of perfection and term.  That is why the Philosopher adds that
the notion of the infinite consists in privation.  The <EM>per se</EM> subject of the
privation which constitutes the nature of the infinite is the sensible continuum.
This is clear from the fact that the infinite found in numbers is caused from the
infinite division of magnitude; and similarly, the infinite in time and motion
are caused by magnitude.  Hence the first subject of the infinite is the
continuum.  And since really existing magnitude is not separated from sensible
things, it follows that the subject of the infinite is sensible.</P>

<P><STRONG>6.8  Answer to arguments for the existence of an actual infinite</STRONG> (Book 3, Lesson
13)</P>

<P>Here Aristotle answers five arguments advanced for the existence of something
actually infinite:</P>

<P>	1) If the world has always existed (as is logically possible), then there
must be an infinite series of generations.  <B>Reply:</B> Such infinitude does not exist in
act, but only in potency; each generation exists in act only successively.</P>

<P>	2) Every body must be defined by its border with another body, and so on
to infinity.  <B>Reply:</B>It is one thing to be "touched" and another to be "terminated.
All that is required is that a body be terminated by its own surface.  It is
incidental to the finite that it be touching something else.  Thus the outermost
bodies of the universe need not be in contact with something further.</P>

<P>	3) Space can be imagined as infinite.  <B>Reply:</B>We cannot transfer imagination to
reality.</P>

<P>	4) Time and motion are infinite.  <B>Reply:</B>They are not infinite in act, but only
the present moment is actual.</P>

<P>	5) Magnitude is infinitely divisible.  <B>Reply:</B>That points to a potential, not
an actual infinite.</P>
