            THE first point of inquiry is whether God is simple: and seemingly
            he is not.

            Ab uno enim simplici non est natum esse nisi unum: idem enim semper
            facit idem, secundum philosophum. Sed a Deo procedit multitudo. Ergo
            ipse non est simplex.
          </td>
          <td>
            1. From one simple thing only one thing can naturally proceed: for
            the same always produces the same according to the Philosopher (<i
              >De Gener.</i
            >
            ii). But many things come from God. Therefore he is not simple.

            Praeterea, simplex si attingitur, totum attingitur. Sed Deus a
            beatis attingitur: quia, ut dicit Augustinus, attingere mente Deum
            magna est beatitudo. Si ergo sit simplex, totus attingitur a beatis.
            Sed quod totum attingitur, comprehenditur. Ergo Deus a beatis
            comprehenditur, quod est impossibile. Ergo Deus non est simplex.
          </td>
          <td>
            2. If a simple thing is reached the whole of it is reached. Now God
            is reached by the blessed: for as Augustine says (<i
              >De videndo Deum</i
            >), “to reach God with the mind is great happiness.” If, then, God
            is simple he is wholly reached by the blessed. Now that which is
            wholly reached is comprehended. Therefore God is comprehended by,
            the blessed: which is impossible. Therefore God is not simple.

            3. The same thing cannot be several kinds of cause. Now God is
            several kinds of cause (<i>Metaph.</i> xi). Therefore there must be
            various things in him: and consequently he is composite.

            4. Whatsoever contains one thing in addition to another is

            5. It will be replied that the property is the same thing as the
            essence. On the contrary, affirmation and negation are not true of
            the same. Now the divine essence is common to the three Persons,
            whereas the properties are incommunicable. Therefore property and
            essence are not the same.

            follows power and substance. Now there are several divine
            operations. Therefore there is plurality and composition in the
            divine substance.

            8. Wherever there is plurality of forms there must be composition.
            Now in God there is plurality of forms, for as the Commentator says
            (<i>Metaph.</i> xi, com. 18), all forms exist actually in the first
            mover, even as they are potentially in primal matter. Therefore

            Therefore these things are in him accidentally. But an accident with
            its subject forms a kind of composition. Therefore composition is in

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod Deum esse simplicem modis omnibus tenendum
            est. Quod quidem ad praesens tribus rationibus potest probari;
            quarum prima talis est: ostensum est enim in alia disputatione,
            omnia entia ab uno primo ente esse, quod quidem primum ens Deum
            dicimus. Quamvis autem in uno et eodem quod quandoque invenitur in
            actu, quandoque in potentia, potentia tempore prius sit actu, natura
            autem posterius, simpliciter tamen oportet actum esse priorem
            potentia, non solum natura sed tempore, eo quod omne ens in potentia
            reducitur in actum ab aliquo ente actu. Illud ergo ens quod omnia
            entia fecit esse actu, et ipsum a nullo alio est, oportet esse
            primum in actu, absque aliqua potentiae permixtione. Nam si esset
            aliquo modo in potentia, oporteret aliud ens prius esse per quod
            fieret actu. In omni autem composito qualicumque compositione,
            oportet potentiam actui commisceri. In compositis enim vel unum
            eorum ex quibus est compositio est in potentia ad alterum, ut
            materia ad formam, subiectum ad accidens, genus ad differentiam; vel
            saltem omnes partes sunt in potentia ad totum. Nam partes ad
            materiam reducuntur, totum vero ad formam, ut patet in II Physic.,
            et sic nullum compositum potest esse actus primus. Ens autem primum,
            quod Deus est, oportet esse actum purum, ut ostensum est.
            Impossibile est ergo Deum compositum esse; unde oportet quod sit
            omnino simplex. Secunda ratio est quia cum compositio non sit nisi
            ex diversis, ipsa diversa indigent aliquo agente ad hoc quod
            uniantur. Non enim diversa, inquantum huiusmodi, unita sunt. Omne
            autem compositum habet esse, secundum quod ea, ex quibus componitur,
            uniuntur. Oportet ergo quod omne compositum dependeat ab aliquo
            priore agente. Primum ergo ens, quod Deus est, a quo sunt omnia, non
            potest esse compositum. Tertia ratio est, quia oportet primum ens,
            quod Deus est, esse perfectissimum, et per consequens optimum; non
            enim rerum principia imperfecta sunt, ut Pythagoras et Leucippus
            aestimaverunt. Optimum autem est in quo nihil est quod careat
            bonitate, sicut albissimum est in quo nihil nigredinis admiscetur.
            Hoc autem in nullo composito est possibile. Nam bonum quod resultat
            ex compositione partium, per quod totum est bonum, non inest alicui
            partium. Unde partes non sunt bonae illa bonitate quae est totius
            propria. Oportet ergo id quod est optimum, esse simplicissimum, et
            omni compositione carere. Et hanc rationem ponit philosophus et
            Hilarius ubi dicit, quod Deus, quia lux est, non ex obscuris
            coarctatur, neque quia virtus est, ex infirmis continetur.
          </td>
          <td>
            I answer that we must hold that God is altogether simple and for the
            nonce this may be proved by three arguments. The first is as
            follows. We have proved (Q. iii, A. 5) in a former discussion, that
            all beings proceed from a first being which we call God. Now
            although in one and the same thing that is at one time in act, at
            another time in potentiality, potentiality precedes act in time but
            follows it
            <i>in</i>
            nature: yet absolutely speaking act precedes potentiality not only
            in nature, but also in time, since everything that is in
            potentiality is made actual by some being that is in act.
            Accordingly the being that made all things actual, and itself
            proceeds from no other being, must be the first actual being without
            any admixture of potentiality. For were it in any way in
            potentiality, there would be need of another previous being to make
            it actual. Now in every composite of whatsoever kind of composition
            there must needs be a mixture of act and potentiality: because of
            the things whereof it is composed, either one is in potentiality to
            the other, as matter to form, subject to accident, genus to
            difference, or all the parts together are in potentiality to the
            whole, since parts are reducible to matter, and the whole is
            reducible to form (<i>Phys.</i> ii) so that no composite is first
            act. But the first being which is God must needs be pure act, as we
            have proved (Q. i, A. i). Therefore it is impossible that God be
            composite: and thus it follows that he is utterly simple. The second
            reason is because seeing that composition requires difference in
            the. component parts, these different parts require an agent to
            unite them together: since different things as such are not united.
            Now every composite has being through the union of its component
            parts. Therefore every composite depends on a pre-existing agent:
            and consequently the first being which is God, from whom all things
            proceed, cannot be composite. The third reason is because the first
            being, which is God, must needs be most perfect and consequently
            supremely good: since the principles of things are not imperfect, as
            Pythagoras and Leucippus contended. Now the supremely good is that
            in which there is nothing lacking in goodness, even as the supremely
            white is that in which there is no admixture of blackness. But this
            is impossible in any composite thing because the good that results
            from the composition of its parts, and whereby the, whole is good,
            is not in any single part. Wherefore the parts are not good with the
            goodness proper to the whole. Consequently that which is supremely
            good must be supremely simple and void of all composition. This
            argument is given by the Philosopher (<i>Metaph.</i> xi) and by
            Hilary (<i>De Trin.</i> vii), where he says that “God who is light
            is not composed of things that are dim, nor is he who is strength
            composed of things that are weak.”

            Aristotle does not mean that a multitude cannot proceed from one.
            For since an agent produces its like, and since an effect falls
            short of reproducing its cause, it follows that where we find unity
            in the cause we shall find multiplicity in the effects: thus in the
            sun’s power all the forms of generable bodies are, in a fashion,
            one, and yet they are diversified in its effects. Hence it is that
            by its one power a thing is able to produce various effects: thus
            fire by its heat liquefies and solidifies, softens and hardens,
            flames and blackens: and man by. the power of his reason acquires
            various sciences and produces various works of art. Wherefore
            <i>a fortiori</i>
            God by his one simple power is able to create many things. The
            Philosopher means then that a thing so long as it remains the same
            does not produce different effects at different times, if it act by
            natural necessity: except perhaps accidentally, through diversity of
            matter, or the intervention of another agent, but this is not to the
            point.

            God’s operation may be considered from the point of view either of

            the operator, then in God there is but one operation and this is in
            his essence: for he produces his effects not by an action that is
            between him and the thing done, but by his intelligence and will
            which are his very being. If, however, we consider God’s operation
            on the part of the work done, then there are various operations, and
            various effects of the divine operation: but this does not argue

            <i>Reply to the Eighth Objection.</i>
            The form of the effect has a different mode of being in the natural
            agent and the agent by art. The form of the effect is in the natural
            agent inasmuch as the agent produces an effect of like nature, since
            every agent produces its like. Now this happens in two ways. When
            the effect bears a perfect likeness to the agent, as proportionate
            to the agent’s power, then the form of the effect is in the agent in
            the same degree: thus it is in univocal agents, for instance fire
            generates fire. When, however, the effect is not perfectly likened
            to the agent, as being improportionate to the agent’s power, then
            the form of the effect is not in the same degree in the agent but in
            a higher degree: this is the case in equivocal agents, for instance
            the sun generates fire. On the other hand in agents by art, the form
            of the effect pre-exists in the same degree,but not in the same mode
            of being: because in the effect the form has material being, whereas
            in the mind of the craftsman it has intelligible being. Now whereas
            a thing may be in the intellect as the thing which we understand,
            and as the species whereby we understand, art-forms are in the
            intellect as that whereby we understand: because it is through
            conceiving the form of his art-work that the craftsman produces that
            work in matter. Accordingly the forms of things are in God in both
            ways. Because while his action in reference to things is from his
            intellect, it is not without the action of nature. But whereas here
            below the craftsman’s art acts by virtue of an extraneous nature
            which it employs as an instrument, as a brick maker uses fire to
            bake his bricks: on the other hand God’s art employs no extraneous
            nature in its action, but produces its effect by virtue of his own
            nature. Hence the forms of things are in the divine nature as in the
            power that produces them, but not according to the same degree,
            since no effect is equal to that power. Consequently all forms that
            are manifold in his effects are in his power as one thing, so that
            their multiplicity argues no composition in him. Likewise in his
            intellect there are many things understood through one thing which
            is his essence. Now it is no proof of composition in one who
            understands that he understand many things by one: wherefore neither
            from this point of view does it follow that there is composition in
            God.

            I answer that in God there is no distinction between existence and
            essence. In order to make this clear we must observe that when
            several causes producing various effects produce one effect in
            common in addition to their various effects, they must needs produce
            this common effect by virtue of some higher cause to which this
            effect properly belongs. The reason for this is that since a proper
            effect is produced by a particular cause in respect of its, proper
            nature or form, different causes having different natures and forms
            must needs have their respective different proper effects: so that
            if they have one effect in common, this is not the proper effect of
            any one of them, but of some higher cause by whose virtue they act:
            thus pepper, ginger and the like which differ in characteristics
            have the common effect of producing heat; yet each one has its
            peculiar effect differing from the effects of the others. Hence we
            must trace their common effect to a higher cause, namely fire to
            whom that effect properly belongs. Likewise in the heavenly
            movements each planet has its peculiar movement, and besides this
            they have all a common movement which must be the proper movement of
            some higher sphere that causes them all to revolve with the daily
            movement. Now all created causes have one common effect which is
            <i>being,</i>
            although each one has its peculiar effect whereby they are
            differentiated: thus heat makes a thing
            <i>to be</i>
            hot, and a builder gives
            <i>being</i>
            to a house. Accordingly they have this in common that they cause
            <i>being,</i>
            but they differ in that fire causes fire, and a builder causes a
            house. There must therefore be some cause higher than all other by
            virtue of which they all cause being and whose proper cause is
            <i>being</i>: and this cause is God, Now the proper effect of any
            cause proceeds therefrom in likeness to its nature. Therefore
            <i>being</i>
            must be the essence or nature of God. For this reason it is stated
            in
            <i>De Causis</i>

            <i>being</i>

            ‘Being’ and ‘is’ maybe taken in two ways (<i>Metaph.</i>
            x, 13, 14). Sometimes they signify the essence of a thing and the
            act of being, and sometimes they denote the truth of a proposition
            even in things that have no being: thus we say that
            <i>blindness is</i>
            because it is true that a man is blind. Accordingly when Damascene
            says that God’s existence is evident to us, the existence of God is
            taken in the second sense and not the first. For in the first sense
            God’s existence is the same as his essence, and as his essence is
            unknown so also is his existence. In the second sense we know that
            God is, because we conceive this proposition in our mind from his
            effects.

            distinct from all other being: so that by his very being God is
            distinct from every other being.

            stated in
            <i>De Causis</i>
            (prop. iv) God’s being is individualised and distinct from every
            other being by the very fact that it is self-subsistent being, and
            is not something additional to a nature that is distinct from its
            being. Now every other being that is not subsistent must be
            individualised by the nature and essence that subsists in that
            being: and of such beings it is true that the being of A is distinct
            from the being of B by the fact that it is the being of another
            nature: even so if there were one heat existing of itself without
            matter or subject, by that very fact it would be distinct from every
            other heat, just as heats existing in a subject are not
            differentiated otherwise than by their subjects.

            Being to which no addition is made is universal being, though the
            possibility of addition thereto is not incompatible with the notion
            of universal being: whereas the divine being is being to which no
            addition can be made and this enters into the very notion of the
            divine being: wherefore the divine being is not universal being.
            Thus by adding the difference
            <i>rational</i>
            to animal in general we do not add anything to the notion of animal
            in general: and yet it is not incompatible with the idea of animal
            in general that an addition to it be possible: for this enters into
            the notion of irrational animal which is a species of animal.

            The mode of signification of the names we give things is consequent
            upon our mode of understanding: for names signify the concepts of
            our intellect (<i>Peri Herm.</i>

            which it finds it in things here below from which it gathers its
            knowledge, and wherein being is not subsistent but inherent. Now our
            reason tells us that there is a self-subsistent being: wherefore
            although the term

            propriae materiae loco differentiae, sicut cum dicitur quod anima
            est actus corporis physici organici. Et per hunc modum, hoc esse ab
            illo esse distinguitur, in quantum est talis vel talis naturae. Et
            per hoc dicit Dionysius, quod licet viventia sint nobiliora quam

            <i>Reply to the Ninth Objection. Being,</i>
            as we understand it here, signifies the highest perfection of all:
            and the proof is that act is always more perfect than potentiality.
            Now no signate form is understood to be in act unless it be supposed
            to have
            <i>being.</i>
            Thus we may take human nature or fiery nature as existing
            potentially in matter, or as existing in the power of an agent, or
            even as in the mind: but when it has being it becomes actually
            existent. Wherefore it is clear that
            <i>being</i>
            as we understand it here is the actuality of all acts, and therefore
            the perfection of all perfections. Nor may we think that being, in
            this sense, can have anything added to it that is more formal and
            determines it as act determines potentiality: because
            <i>being</i>
            in this latter sense is essentially distinct from that to which it
            is added and whereby it is determined. But nothing that is outside
            the range of being can be added to
            <i>being:</i>
            for nothing is outside its range except
            <i>non-being,</i>
            which can be neither form nor matter. Hence
            <i>being</i>
            is not determined by something else as potentiality by act but
            rather as act by potentiality: since in defining a form we include
            its proper matter instead of the difference: thus we define a soul
            as the act of an organic physical body. Accordingly this
            <i>being</i>
            is distinct from that
            <i>being</i>
            inasmuch as it is the
            <i>being</i>
            of this or that nature. For this reason Dionysius says (<i
              >Div. Nom.</i
            >
            v) that though things having life excel those that merely have
            being, yet being excels life, since living things have not only life
            but also being.

            The order of agents follows the order of ends, in that the last end
            corresponds to the first agent and in due proportion other ends to
            other agents in their order. Take, for example, the ruler of a
            state, the commander of the army and a private soldier: the ruler is
            clearly the first in the order of agents; at whose orders the
            commander goes forth to the war; and under him is the private
            soldier who engages in hand-to-hand combat at the orders of his
            commander. Now the end of the, private soldier is to overthrow his
            opponent, and this is directed yet further to the victory of the
            army, which is the end of the commander-in-chief; and this again is
            directed to the welfare of the state or kingdom, which is the end of
            the ruler or king. Accordingly
            <i>being</i>
            which is the proper effect and end of the operation of the first
            agent must occupy the position of last end. Now although the end is
            first in the intention, it is last in execution, and is the effect
            of other causes. Therefore created
            <i>being,</i>
            which is the proper effect corresponding to the first agent, is
            caused from other principles, and yet the first cause of
            <i>being</i>
            is the first principle of all.

            A proposition may be self-evident in itself and yet not self-evident
            to this or that individual; when, to wit, the predicate belongs to
            the definition of the subject, which definition is unknown to him:

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod Deus non est in genere: quod quidem ad

            I answer that God is not contained in a genus, and for the nonce
            this may be proved by three arguments. The first argument is that
            nothing is assigned to a genus by reason of its
            <i>being</i> but by reason of its quiddity; and this is clear from
            the fact that the <i>being</i> of a thing is proper to that thing
            and distinct from the <i>being</i> of anything else: whereas the
            essence may be common. Hence the Philosopher (<i>Metaph.</i> ii, 3)
            says that <i>being is</i> not a genus. Now God is
            <i>Being</i> itself: wherefore he cannot be in a genus.

            Secunda ratio est, quia quamvis materia non sit genus, nec forma sit
            differentia, tamen ratio generis sumitur ex materia, et ratio
            differentiae sumitur ex forma: sicut patet quod in homine natura
            sensibilis ex qua sumitur ratio animalis, est materialis respectu
            rationis, ex qua sumitur differentia rationalis. Nam animal est quod
            habet naturam sensitivam; rationale autem quod rationem habet. Unde
            in omni eo quod est in genere, oportet esse compositionem materiae
            et formae, vel actus et potentiae; quod quidem in Deo esse non

          <td>
            The second reason is that although matter is not a genus nor form a
            difference, nevertheless the notion of the genus is taken from the
            matter, and the notion of the difference from the form: for
            instance, in man the sensible nature whence he derives his animality
            is material in relation to his reason whence derives the difference
            of rationality. For an animal is that which has a sensitive nature,
            and a rational being is one that has reason. Hence in everything
            that is contained in a genus there must be composition of matter and
            form, or of act and potentiality: and this cannot be in God who is
            pure act as we have shown (A. 1). Therefore he cannot be in a genus.

            Tertia ratio est, quia, cum Deus sit simpliciter perfectus,

            simpliciter perfecti, ut dicitur V Metaph. Quod autem est in aliquo

            The third reason is that as God is simply perfect he contains the
            perfections of all genera: for this is what is meant by being simply
            perfect (<i>Metaph.</i> v). Now that which is contained in a genus
            is confined within the limits of that genus. Wherefore God cannot be
            in a genus: for in that case his essence would not be infinite nor
            absolutely perfect, but his essence and perfection would be confined
            within the limits of a definite genus.

            Damascene uses the word species metaphorically and not in the strict

            predicated essentially of several distinct individuals: but it
            cannot be called a species strictly speaking, since a species is not

            A distinction is to be noted between difference and diversity
            according to the Philosopher (<i>Metaph.</i>
            x). Diversity is absolute and is applied to things which are not the
            same: whereas difference is relative, since that which is different
            differs in a certain respect. Accordingly if we take the term
            <i>different</i>
            strictly, it is not true that
            <i>things which are in no way different are the same</i>: but if we
            take the term
            <i>different</i>
            in a broad sense it is true: and in this sense we grant that God
            differs from other things. It does not follow, however, that he
            differs by reason of a difference, but that he differs from other
            things by reason of his essence: for this must needs be the case in
            first principles and simple things. Thus man differs from a donkey
            by the difference of rationality: but rationality is not
            distinguished from a donkey by a still further difference (since
            thus there would be no end to the process), for it differs therefrom
            by itself.

            According to Avicenna (<i>Metaph.</i>

            for
            <i>being</i>
            cannot be the genus of a thing according to the Philosopher (<i
              >Metaph.</i

            ii, 3), because nothing can be added to being that has not a share
            of being, and a difference should not be a part of the genus. If,
            however, substance can be defined notwithstanding that it is the
            most universal of genera, its definition will be a

            consequent upon the nature of a thing is an accidental predicate.

            <i>good, just</i> and <i>holy</i> when said of God, are consequent
            to his nature and do not signify his essence. Therefore they

            signification of these terms. —On the contrary, a mode of
            signification that results from the generic nature must have a real
            foundation: since when the predicate of a proposition is a genus it
            denotes the substance of the subject, for it is an essential
            predication. Now the mode of signification of the terms in question
            is consequent upon the nature in respect of the genus: for they are
            in the genus of quality, which by its very nature bears a relation
            to the subject: for a quality is whereby we are disposed in this or
            that way (<i>quales</i>). Therefore this mode of signification must
            be based on a reality; in other words the things signified by these
            words are consequent upon the nature of the thing of which they are
            predicated and therefore accidents.

            3. But it will be said that these terms are not predicated of God in
            reference to their genus, which is quality; because the expressions
            we apply to God are not to be taken in their strict sense. —On the
            contrary, the species is falsely predicated of that which is not
            included in the genus: thus if a thing is not an animal it is untrue
            to say that it is a man. If then the genus of the aforesaid, which
            is quality, is not predicated of God, these terms will be not only
            improperly but also falsely predicated of God: and consequently it
            will be untrue to say that God is just or holy: and this cannot be

            of God accidentally.

            Prima ratio est, quia nulli naturae vel essentiae vel formae aliquid
            extraneum adiungitur, licet id quod habet naturam vel formam vel
            essentiam, possit aliquid extraneum in se habere; humanitas enim non
            recipit in se nisi quod est de ratione humanitatis. Quod ex hoc
            patet, quia in definitionibus quae essentiam rerum significant
            quodlibet additum vel subtractum variat speciem, sicut etiam in
            numeris, ut dicit philosophus. Homo autem qui habet humanitatem,
            potest aliquid aliud habere quod non sit de ratione humanitatis,
            sicut albedinem et huiusmodi, quae non insunt humanitati, sed
            homini. In qualibet autem creatura invenitur differentia habentis et
            habiti. In creaturis namque compositis invenitur duplex differentia,
            quia ipsum suppositum sive individuum habet naturam speciei, sicut
            homo humanitatem, et habet ulterius esse: homo enim nec est
            humanitas nec esse suum; unde homini potest inesse aliquod accidens,
            non autem ipsi humanitati vel eius esse. In substantiis vero
            simplicibus est una tantum differentia, scilicet essentiae et esse.
            In Angelis enim quodlibet suppositum est sua natura: quidditas enim
            simplicis est ipsum simplex, ut dicit Avicenna; non est autem suum
            esse; unde ipsa quidditas est in suo esse subsistens. Unde in
            huiusmodi substantiis potest inveniri aliquod accidens
            intelligibile, non autem materiale. In Deo autem nulla est
            differentia habentis et habiti, vel participantis et participati;
            immo ipse est et sua natura et suum esse; et ideo nihil alienum vel
            accidentale potest ei inesse. Et hanc rationem videtur tangere
            Boetius, dicens: id quod est, habere potest aliquod praeterquam quod
            ipsum est; ipsum vero esse, nihil aliud praeter se habet admixtum.
          </td>
          <td>
            The first argument is that no nature, essence or form can receive
            the addition of something extraneous: although that which has a
            nature, form or essence can receive something extraneous thereto,
            thus humanity contains nothing but what belongs intrinsically to
            humanity. This is clear from the fact that if anything be added to
            or subtracted from definitions which indicate the essence of a
            thing, the species is changed, as is the case with numbers, as the
            Philosopher observes (<i>Metaph.</i> viii). Man, however, who has
            humanity, can have something else which is not contained in the
            notion of humanity, such as whiteness and the like which are not
            humanity but in the man. Now in every creature there is a
            distinction between the one who has a thing and the thing which he
            has. In composite creatures there is a twofold difference; since the
            supposit or individual has the nature of its species —thus a man has
            humanity—and also has being: for a man is neither humanity nor is he
            his own being. Wherefore a man can have an accident, but his
            humanity or his being cannot. In simple substances there is only one
            difference, that namely between essence and existence. Thus in the
            angels every supposit is his own nature, since the quiddity of a
            simple being is the simple being itself according to Avicenna (<i
              >Metaph.</i
            >
            v), but it is not its own being, so that the quiddity subsists in
            its own being. In these substances therefore there can be an
            intelligible but not a material accident. On the other hand in God
            there is no distinction between haver and the thing had, or between
            participator. and the thing participated: indeed he is both his own
            nature and his own being, wherefore nothing in him can be
            adventitious or accidental. This argument is apparently indicated by
            Boethius (<i>De Hebd.</i>) when he says: “That which has being can
            have something in addition to its being: but that which is being,
            has nothing besides itself.”

            The second reason is that since an accident is extraneous to the
            essence of its subject, and things that are diverse are not united
            together save by some cause, it follows, if any accident accrue to
            God, that this is due to some cause. It cannot, however, be due to
            some extrinsic cause, since it would follow that this extrinsic
            cause acts on God, and is previous to him, even as the mover
            precedes that Which is moved and the maker that which is made: for
            an accident is produced in a subject by an extrinsic cause acting on
            the subject in which the accident is produced. Again it cannot be
            due to an intrinsic cause as happens with
            <i>per se</i>
            accidents whose cause is in their subject. For a subject cannot both
            cause and receive an accident on the same count, since no power
            moves itself into action: wherefore it must receive the accident on
            one count, and cause it on another, and thus it will be composite:
            thus certain things receive an accident on account of their matter,
            and cause it on account of the nature of their form. Now we have
            shown (A. i) that God is not composite. Therefore no accident can
            possibly be in him.

            The third argument is that accident is compared to subject as act to
            potentiality, since it is a kind of form thereof. Wherefore since
            God is pure act without any admixture of potentiality, he cannot be
            the subject of an accident.

            Although quality is the genus of human goodness, wisdom and justice,
            it is not their genus if we take them as predicated of God, because
            quality as such is a being forasmuch as it qualifies the subject in
            which it is. But wisdom and justice are denominated not from this
            but rather from a certain perfection or act: wherefore such things
            are predicated of God by reason of their difference and not of their
            genus. Hence Augustine says (<i>De Trin.</i> v, i): As far as we

            If we understand a thing in its essence then it is true that
            anything which does not enter into that consideration is accidental:
            since given that we understand it in its essence, we must needs
            understand whatsoever pertains to its essence; thus if we understand
            what a man is, we must needs understand what is an animal. Here,
            however, we do not see God in his essence, but consider him in his
            effects. Wherefore nothing prevents us from considering him in his
            effect that is
            <i>being,</i>
            without considering him in his effect that is
            <i>goodness</i>; and this is what Boethius intends to say. Yet it
            must be observed that although we may understand God somewhat
            without understanding his goodness; we cannot understand God and
            understand that he is not good—thus we cannot understand man and
            understand that he is not an animal—for this would be to deny God’s
            essence which is goodness. On the other hand the saints in heaven

            essentially but metaphorically: inasmuch, as it is said secondly of
            God and first of the thing whence the simile is taken: whereas that
            which signifies the essence of a thing is said of that thing first.

            viii) that which signifies the essence, denotes that and nothing
            else. Wherefore if this word
            <i>good</i> signifies the divine essence, there win be nothing in
            the divine essence that is not signified thereby: even so there is
            nothing in the essence of man that is not signified by this word
            <i>man.</i> But this word <i>good</i> does not signify
            <i>wisdom</i>: so that wisdom will not be the divine essence, and
            for the same reason neither will the other terms. Therefore all

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod: quidam posuerunt, quod ista nomina dicta
            de Deo, non significant divinam substantiam, quod maxime expresse
            dicit Rabbi Moyses. Dicit autem, huiusmodi nomina de Deo dupliciter
            esse intelligenda: uno modo per similitudinem effectus, ut dicatur
            Deus sapiens non quia sapientia aliquid sit in ipso, sed quia ad
            modum sapientis in suis effectibus operatur, ordinando scilicet
            unumquodque ad debitum finem; et similiter dicitur vivens in quantum
            ad modum viventis operatur, quasi ex se ipso agens. Alio modo per
            modum negationis; ut per hoc quod dicimus Deum esse viventem, non
            significemus vitam in eo aliquid esse, sed removeamus a Deo illum
            modum essendi quo res inanimatae existunt. Similiter cum dicimus
            Deum intelligentem, non intelligimus significare intellectum aliquid
            in ipso esse, sed removemus a Deo illum modum essendi quo bruta
            existunt; et sic de aliis. Uterque autem modus videtur esse
            insufficiens et inconveniens. Primus quidem duplici ratione: quarum
            prima est, quia secundum expositionem nulla differentia esset inter
            hoc quod dicitur, Deus est sapiens et Deus est iratus, vel Deus
            ignis est. Dicitur enim iratus quia operatur ad modum irati dum
            punit: hoc enim homines irati facere consueverunt. Dicitur etiam
            ignis, quia operatur ad modum ignis dum purgat, quod ignis suo modo
            facit. Hoc autem est contra positionem sanctorum et prophetarum
            loquentium de Deo, qui quaedam de Deo probant, et quaedam ab eo
            removent; probant enim eum esse vivum, sapientem et huiusmodi, et
            non esse corpus, neque passionibus subiectum. Secundum autem
            praedictam opinionem omnia de Deo pari ratione possent dici et
            removeri, non magis haec quam illa. Secunda ratio, quia cum secundum
            fidem nostram ponamus creaturam non semper fuisse, quod et ipse
            concedit, sequeretur quod non possemus dicere fuisse sapientem vel
            bonum antequam creaturae essent. Constat enim quod antequam
            creaturae essent, nihil in effectibus operabatur, nec ad modum boni
            nec ad modum sapientis. Hoc autem omnino sanae fidei repugnat: nisi
            forte dicere velit quod ante creaturas sapiens dici poterat, non
            quia operaretur ut sapiens, sed quia poterat ut sapiens operari. Et
            sic sequeretur quod aliquid existens in Deo per hoc significetur, et
            sit per consequens substantia, cum quidquid est in Deo sit sua
            substantia. Secundus autem modus eadem ratione videtur esse
            inconveniens. Non enim est aliquod nomen alicuius speciei per quod
            non removeatur aliquis modus qui Deo non competit. In nomine enim
            cuiuslibet speciei includitur significatio differentiae, per quam
            excluditur alia species quae contra eam dividitur: sicut in nomine
            leonis includitur haec differentia quae est quadrupes, per quam leo
            differt ab ave. Si ergo praedicationes de Deo non essent introductae
            nisi ad removendum, sicut dicimus Deum esse viventem,- quia non
            habet esse ad modum inanimatorum, ut ipse dicit - ita possemus
            dicere Deum esse leonem, quia non habet esse ad modum avis. Et
            praeterea intellectus negationis semper fundatur in aliqua
            affirmatione: quod ex hoc patet quia omnis negativa per affirmativam
            probatur; unde nisi intellectus humanus aliquid de Deo affirmative
            cognosceret, nihil de Deo posset negare. Non autem cognosceret, si
            nihil quod de Deo dicit, de eo verificaretur affirmative. Et ideo,
            secundum sententiam Dionysii, dicendum est, quod huiusmodi nomina
            significant divinam substantiam, quamvis deficienter et imperfecte:
            quod sic patet.

            I answer that some have maintained, and Rabbi Moses most
            emphatically, that these terms when predicated of God do not signify
            the divine essence. He says in effect that these expressions are to
            be taken in reference to God in two ways. First, as indicating a
            likeness of effect: and that God is said to be
            <i>wise,</i>
            not that wisdom is something in him, but because in his effects he
            acts like a wise man, namely by directing each one to its due end;
            again that he is said to be a living God inasmuch as he acts like a
            living being, in that he acts of himself. Secondly, by way of
            negation: so that when we say God lives we do not mean that life is
            something in him, but that God has not that mode of existence which
            is in things inanimate. Likewise when we say that God is an
            intelligent being, we do not mean that intelligence is really in
            him, but that he has not that mode of existence whereby dumb animals
            exist: and so on. In either case, however, this explanation is
            apparently insufficient and objectionable. The first, for two
            reasons. First, because according to this explanation there, would
            be no difference in saying
            <i>God is wise,</i>
            or
            <i>God is angry</i>
            or
            <i>God is a fire: since</i>
            he is said to be angry because he acts like an angry man by
            punishing; for angry men are wont to act thus. Also he is said to be
            a fire, because he acts like fire when he cleanses, and fire does
            this in his own way. Now this is contrary to the view taken by the
            saints and prophets in speaking of God: since certain things they
            affirm of him and deny others: for they assert that he is living,
            wise and the like, and deny that he is a body or subject to
            passions. But in the opinion we are discussing anything may be said
            or denied of God with equal reason. The second reason is that since,
            as our faith teaches and as he also grants, creatures have not’
            always existed, it follows that we could not say that God was wise
            or good before the existence of creatures. For it is evident that
            before creatures existed he did nothing as regards his effects,
            neither as good nor as wise. Now this is altogether contrary to
            sound faith: unless perhaps he meant to say that before the
            existence of creatures God would be called wise, not that he worked
            as being wise, but because he could do so: and then it would follow
            that wisdom denotes something in God and consequently is his
            essence, since whatsoever is in. God is his essence. The second
            explanation appears likewise to be unsatisfactory: because there is
            not a specific term that does not exclude from God some mode of
            being that is unbecoming to him. For every specific term includes
            the difference whereby the opposite species is excluded: thus the
            term lion includes the difference
            <i>quadruped</i>
            which differentiates a lion from a bird. Accordingly if predicates
            about God were employed merely for the purpose of exclusion, just as
            we say that God is living because, according to him (Rabbi Moses),
            God has not being in the same way as inanimate creatures: even so
            might we say that God is a lion because he has not the mode of being
            of a bird. Moreover the idea of negation is always based on an
            affirmation: as evinced by the fact that every negative proposition
            is proved by an affirmative: wherefore unless the human mind knew
            something positively about God, it would be unable to deny anything
            about him. And it would know nothing if nothing that it affirmed
            about God were positively verified about him. Hence following
            Dionysius (<i>Div. Nom.</i> xiii) we must hold that these terms
            signify the divine essence, albeit defectively and imperfectly: the
            proof of which is as follows.

            ostenditur nobis quod quilibet eius effectus deficit a virtute
            agentis. Nulla ergo forma alicuius effectus divini est per eamdem

            eius. Intellectus autem noster cum a rebus creatis cognitionem
            accipiat, informatur similitudinibus perfectionum in creaturis
            inventarum, sicut sapientiae, virtutis, bonitatis et huiusmodi. Unde
            sicut res creatae per suas perfectiones aliqualiter, —licet
            deficienter— Deo assimilantur, ita et intellectus noster harum
            perfectionum speciebus informatur. Quandocumque autem intellectus

            quod concipit et enuntiat secundum illam intelligibilem speciem
            verificatur de re illa cui per suam speciem similatur: nam scientia

            Since every agent acts inasmuch as it is actual and consequently
            produces its like, the form of the thing produced must in some
            manner be in the agent: in different ways, however. When the effect
            is proportionate to the power of the agent, this form must be of the
            same kind in the maker and the thing made: for then maker and thing
            made are of the same species, and this is the case in all univocal
            causes: thus man begets a man, and fire generates fire. When,
            however, the effect is improportionate to the power of the cause,
            the form is not of the same kind in both maker and thing made, but
            is in the agent in a more eminent way. Because according as the form
            is in the agent, the latter has the power to produce the effect: so
            that if the whole power of the agent is not reflected in the thing
            made, it follows that the form is in the maker in a more eminent way
            than in the thing made. This is the case in all equivocal agents,
            for instance when the sun generates fire. Now it is plain that no
            effect equals the power of the first agent which is God, else only
            one effect would proceed from his one power. But seeing that from
            his one power many and various effects proceed, it is evident that
            every effect of his falls short of the power of its cause.
            Consequently no form of a divine effect is in the effect in the same
            degree as in God: and yet they must needs be in him in a more
            eminent way. Wherefore all forms which in the various effects are
            distinct and different from one another are united in him as in one
            common power: even so all the forms produced by the power of the sun
            in this lower world are in the sun in respect of its one power, to
            which all things generated by the sun’s action are assimilated as
            regards their forms. In like manner the perfections of creatures are
            assimilated to God in respect of his one simple essence. Since then
            our intellect takes its knowledge from creatures, it is informed
            with the likenesses of perfections observed in creatures, namely of
            wisdom, power, goodness and so forth. Wherefore just as creatures by
            their perfections are somewhat, albeit deficiently, like God, even
            so our intellect is informed with the species of these perfections.
            Now whenever an intellect is by its intelligible form assimilated to
            a thing, that which it conceives and affirms in accordance with that
            intelligible species is true of that thing to which it is
            assimilated by its species: inasmuch as knowledge is assimilation of
            the mind to the thing known. Hence it follows that whatsoever the
            intellect informed with the species of these perfections conceives
            or asserts about God, truly exists in God who corresponds to each
            one of these species inasmuch as they are all like him. Now if such
            an intelligible species of our intellect were equal to God in its
            likeness to him, our intellect would comprehend him, and the
            intellect’s conception would be a perfect definition of God, just as
            a walking animal biped is a perfect definition of a man. However,
            this species does not perfectly reflect the divine essence, as
            stated above, and therefore although these terms which our intellect
            attributes to God from such conceptions signify the divine essence,
            they do not signify it perfectly as it exists in itself, but as it
            is conceived by us.

            Accordingly we conclude that each of these terms signifies the
            divine essence, not comprehensively but imperfectly. Wherefore this
            name
            <i>He Who Is is</i>
            most becoming to God, since it does not ascribe any particular form
            to God, but signifies
            <i>being</i>
            without any limitation. This is the meaning of Damascene (<i
              >De Fide Orthod.</i
            >
            i, 12) when he says that the name
            <i>He Who Is</i>
            denotes “a boundless sea of substance.” This solution of the
            question is confirmed by the words of Dionysius (<i>Div. Nom.</i>
            i): Since all things are comprised in the Godhead simply and without
            limit, it is fitting that he should be praised and named on account
            of them all. Simply because the perfections which are in creatures
            by reason of various forms are ascribed to God in reference to his
            simple essence:
            <i>without limit,</i>
            because no perfection found in creatures is equal to the divine
            essence, so as to enable the mind under the head of that perfection
            to define God as he is in himself. A further confirmation may be
            found in

            <i>Reply to the Second Objection.</i>
            Although Dionysius says that there is truth in denying these
            expressions of God he does not say that there is untruth in
            affirming them, but that their signification is vague: because as
            regards the thing signified they are truly ascribed to God, since in
            a way it is in him, as we have shown. But as regards their mode of
            signification they can be denied of God, since each of these terms
            denotes a definite form, and in this way they are not ascribed to
            God as we have already stated. Wherefore absolutely speaking they
            can be denied of God, because they are not becoming to him in the
            way signified: since this mode is according to the way in which they
            are in our intellect, as already stated, whereas they are becoming
            to God in a more eminent way. For this reason the affirmation of
            them is described as vague as being not altogether fitting on
            account of the difference of mode. Hence, according to the teaching
            of Dionysius (<i>Myst. Theol.</i>
            i;
            <i>Coel. Hier.</i>
            ii;
            <i>Div. Nom.</i>
            ii, iii), these terms are applied to God in three ways. First,
            affirmatively: for instance,
            <i>God is wise: since</i>
            we must needs say this of God because in him there is a likeness to
            the wisdom that derives from him.—Nevertheless seeing that wisdom in
            God is not such as that which we understand and name, it can be
            truly denied, so that we may say:
            <i>God is not wise</i>.—Again, since wisdom is not denied of God as
            though he were lacking in wisdom, but because in him it transcends
            the wisdom e indicate and name, we ought to say that
            <i>God is super-wise.</i>
            Accordingly Dionysius explains perfectly by these three ways of
            ascribing wisdom to God, how these expressions are to be applied to
            God.

            An effect includes something whereby it is like its cause, and
            something whereby it differs therefrom: and this by reason of its
            matter or something of the kind. Take for example a brick hardened
            by fire: the clay is heated by the fire and thus becomes like the
            fire: then it is condensed and hardened, and this is due to the
            nature of the material. Accordingly if we ascribe to the fire that
            wherein the brick is likened to it, it will be ascribed to it
            properly in a more eminent degree and with priority: because fire is
            hotter than the brick: and it is hot in a more eminent way, since
            the brick is hot by being made hot, while the fire is hot by nature.
            On the other hand if we ascribe to the fire that wherein the brick
            differs from the fire, it will be untrue, and any term that
            signifies this condition of dissimilarity cannot be said of fire
            unless metaphorically. Thus it is false to say that fire, the most
            subtle of bodies, is dense. It can, however, be described as hard on
            account of the violence of its action, and the difficulty to quench
            it. Accordingly in creatures there are certain perfections whereby
            they are likened to God, and which as regards the thing signified do
            not denote any imperfection, such as being, life, understanding and
            so forth: and these are ascribed to God properly, in fact they are
            ascribed to him first and in a more eminent way than to creatures.
            And there are in creatures certain perfections wherein they differ
            from God, and which the creature owes to its being made from
            nothing, such as potentiality, privation, movement and the like.
            These are falsely ascribed to God: and whatsoever terms imply
            suchlike conditions cannot be ascribed to God otherwise than
            metaphorically, for instance lion, stone and so on, inasmuch as
            matter is included in their definition. They are, however, ascribed
            to him metaphorically by reason of a likeness in their effects.

            and comprehensively: but none of these expressions denote the divine

            I answer that all those who have considered the question are agreed
            in saying that these terms are not synonymous. This view offers no
            difficulty to those who held that these expressions signify not
            God’s essence, but certain notions added to his essence, or modes of
            the divine action in its effects, or the denial of what they signify
            in creatures. But given that they signify the divine essence, as we
            have proved (A. 5), the question would seem to present considerable
            difficulty: since then we have all these terms with one simple
            signification, namely the divine essence. But it must be observed
            that the signification of a term does not refer to the thing
            immediately but through the medium of the mind: because words are
            the tokens of the soul’s impressions, and the conceptions of the
            mind. are images of things, according to the Philosopher (<i

            non attribuit rebus prout in se ipsis sunt, sed solum prout
            intellectae sunt; sicut patet in ratione generis et speciei, et
            aliarum intentionum intellectualium: nam nihil est in rebus quae
            sunt extra animam, cuius similitudo sit ratio generis vel speciei.
            Nec tamen intellectus est falsus: quia ea quorum sunt istae
            rationes, scilicet genus et species, non attribuit rebus secundum
            quod sunt extra animam, sed solum secundum quod sunt in intellectu.
            Ex hoc enim quod intellectus in se ipsum reflectitur, sicut
            intelligit res existentes extra animam, ita intelligit eas esse
            intellectas: et sic, sicut est quaedam conceptio intellectus vel
            ratio, —cui respondet res ipsa quae est extra animam— ita est

            Now terms may be hindered from being synonymous either by reason of
            the things signified, or on the part of the notion conveyed by the
            term and to signify which the term is employed. Wherefore the terms
            which are applied to God cannot be hindered from being synonymous by
            reason of their signifying different things, according to what has
            been said above, but only by the various aspects consequent to the
            conception of the mind. Hence the Commentator (<i>Metaph.</i>
            xi) says that multiplicity in God is, only according to differences
            in the intellect and not in being, and we express the same when we
            say that he is one in reality and many things logically. Now these
            various aspects which are in our mind cannot be such that nothing
            corresponds to them on the part of the thing: since the things which
            these aspects regard are ascribed to God by the mind. Wherefore if
            there were nothing in God, either in himself or in his effect,
            corresponding to these points of view, the intellect would be in
            error in attributing them to him, and all propositions expressive of
            such attributions would be false; which is inadmissible. Now there
            are certain aspects to which nothing corresponds in the thing
            understood: but the things thus conceived the mind does not
            attribute to things as they are in themselves, but only as they are
            understood: for example, the aspect of genus or species and other
            intellectual ‘intentions’; since in the things themselves that are
            outside the mind there is nothing that is a likeness of the notion
            of genus or species. And yet the intellect is not in error: for the
            things reflected by these notions, namely genus and species, are not
            attributed by the intellect to things as existing outside the mind
            but only as existing therein. Because just as the intellect
            understands things existing outside the mind, so does it, by
            reflecting on itself, understand that it understands them: wherefore
            just as the intellect has a conception or notion to which the thing
            as existing outside the mind corresponds, so has it a conception or
            notion to which the thing corresponds as,understood: for instance,
            to the notion or conception of a man there corresponds the thing
            outside the mind, while nothing but the thing as understood
            corresponds to the notion or conception of the genus or species. But
            it is impossible that such be the meaning of these expressions that
            are applied to God: for in that case the intellect would not
            attribute them to him as he is in himself but as he is understood:
            and this is plainly false; for when we say
            <i>God is good,</i>
            the sense would be that we think him to be so, but that he is not so
            in reality.

            huiusmodi nomina per prius dicerentur de creatura quam de creatore;

            Accordingly some hold that the meanings of these terms connote
            various corresponding divine effects: for they maintain that when we
            say
            <i>God is good,</i>
            we indicate God’s essence together with a connoted effect, the sense
            being
            <i>God is and causes goodness</i>, so that the difference in these
            attributions arises from the difference in his effects. But this
            does not seem right: because seeing that an effect proceeds in
            likeness to its cause, we must needs understand a cause to be such
            before its effects are such. Wherefore God is not called wise
            because he is the cause of wisdom: but because he is wise, therefore
            does he cause wisdom. Hence Augustine says (<i>De Doct. Christ.</i>
            ii, 32) that
            <i
              >because God is good, therefore we exist, and inasmuch as we exist
              we are good.</i
            >
            Moreover according to this view it would follow that these
            expressions are attributed to the creature before the Creator: just
            as health is attributed first to a healthy man and afterwards to
            that which gives health, since the latter is called healthy through
            being a cause of health.—Again if when we say
            <i>God is good</i>
            we mean nothing more than
            <i>God is and is the cause of goodness,</i>
            it would follow that we could equally predicate of him the names of
            all the divine effects, for instance, that
            <i>God is heaven</i>
            since he is the cause of heaven. —Again this is clearly false if it
            refer to actual causality: because then we could not say that God
            was good, wise or the like from eternity, for he did not cause
            things actually from eternity. If on the other hand it refer to
            virtual causality, so that God be called good because he is and has
            the power to infuse goodness; then we shall have to say that the
            term
            <i>good</i>
            signifies that power. Now that power is a supereminent likeness of
            its effect even as the power of any equivocal agent. Thus it would
            follow that the intellect in conceiving goodness is like that which
            is in God and is God: so that something that is in God and that is
            God corresponds to the notion or conception of goodness.

            We must say then that all these many and diverse notions correspond
            to something in God of which they are likenesses. For it is plain
            that one form can have but one specific likeness proportionate to
            it: while there can be many imperfect likenesses, each one of which
            falls short of a perfect representation of the form. Since then, as
            we have proved above, the ideas we conceive of the perfections; we
            observe in creatures are imperfect and improportionate likenesses of
            the divine essence, nothing prevents the same one essence from
            corresponding to all these ideas, as being imperfectly represented
            thereby. So that all these conceptions are in the mind as their
            subject, but in God, as the foundation of their truth. For the idea
            that the intellect has of a thing is not true unless that thing
            corresponds to the idea by its likeness to it. Accordingly the cause
            of difference or multiplicity in these expressions is on the part of
            the intellect, which is unable to compass the vision of that divine
            essence in itself, but sees it through many faulty likenesses
            thereof which are reflected by creatures as by a mirror. Whereof if
            it saw that very essence, it would not need to use many terms, nor
            would it need many conceptions.

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod impossibile est aliquid univoce praedicari

            finita, potest adaequare virtutem primi agentis, cum sit infinita.
            Unde impossibile est quod similitudo Dei univoce in creatura
            recipiatur. Item patet quod, etsi una sit ratio formae existentis in
            agente et in effectu, diversus tamen modus existendi impedit
            univocam praedicationem; licet enim eadem sit ratio domus quae sit
            in materia et domus quae est in mente artificis,- quia unum est
            ratio alterius,- non tamen domus univoce de utraque praedicatur,

            propter hoc quod substantia est ens tamquam per se habens esse,
            accidens vero tamquam cuius esse est inesse. Ex quo patet quod
            diversa habitudo ad esse impedit univocam praedicationem entis. Deus
            autem alio modo se habet ad esse quam aliqua alia creatura; nam ipse

            I answer that it is impossible for anything to be predicated
            univocally of God and a creature: this is made plain as follows.
            Every effect of an univocal agent is adequate to the agent’s power:
            and no creature, being finite, can be adequate to the power of the
            first agent which is infinite. Wherefore it is impossible for a
            creature to receive a likeness to God univocally. Again it is clear
            that although the form in the agent and the form in the effect have
            a common ratio, the fact that they have different modes of existence
            precludes their univocal predication: thus though the material house
            is of the same type as the house in the mind of the builder, since
            the one is the type of the other; nevertheless
            <i>house</i>
            cannot be univocally predicated of both, because the form of the
            material house has its being in matter, whereas in the builder’s
            mind it has immaterial being. Hence granted the impossibility that
            goodness in God and in the creature be of the same kind,
            nevertheless good would not be predicated of God univocally: since
            that which in God is immaterial and simple, is in the creature
            material and manifold. Moreover being is not predicated univocally
            of substance and accident, because substance is a being as
            subsisting in itself, while accident is that whose being is to be in
            something else. Wherefore it is evident that a different relation to
            being precludes an univocal predication of being. Now God’s relation
            to being is different from that of any creature’s: for he is his own
            being, which cannot be said of any creature. Hence in no way can it
            be predicated univocally of God and a creature, and consequently
            neither can any of the other predicables among which is included
            even the first,
            <i>being</i>: for if there be diversity in the first, there must be
            diversity in the others: wherefore nothing is predicated univocally
            of substance and accident.

            Others, however, took a different view, and held that nothing is
            predicated of God and a creature by analogy but by pure
            equivocation. This is the opinion of Rabbi Moses, as appears from
            his writings. This opinion, however, is false, because in all purely
            equivocal terms which the Philosopher calls equivocal
            <i>by chance,</i>
            a term is predicated of a thing without any respect to something
            else: whereas all things predicated of God and creatures are
            predicated of God with a certain respect to creatures or vice versa,
            and this is clearly admitted in all the aforesaid explanations of
            the divine names. Wherefore they cannot be pure equivocations.
            Again, since all our knowledge of God is taken from creatures, if
            the agreement were purely nominal, we should know nothing about God
            except empty expressions to which nothing corresponds in reality.
            Moreover, it would follow that all the proofs advanced about God by
            philosophers are sophisms: for instance, if one were to argue that
            whatsoever is in potentiality is reduced to actuality by something
            actual and that therefore God is actual being, since all things are
            brought into being by him, there will be a fallacy of equivocation;
            and similarly in all other arguments. And again the effect must in
            some way be like its cause, wherefore nothing is predicated
            equivocally of cause and effect; for instance,
            <i>health</i>
            of medicine and an animal.

            which are attributed to them in common are predicated not
            equivocally but analogically. Now this kind of predication is
            twofold. The first is when one thing is predicated of two with
            respect to a third: thus being is predicated of quantity and quality
            with respect to substance. The other is when a thing is predicated
            of two by reason of a relationship between these two: thus being is
            predicated of substance and quantity. In the first kind of
            predication the two things must be preceded by something to which
            each of them bears some relation: thus substance has a respect to
            quantity and quality: whereas in the second kind of predication this
            is not necessary, but one of the two must precede the other.
            Wherefore since nothing precedes God, but he precedes the creature,
            the second kind of analogical predication is applicable to him but

            The likeness of the creature to God falls short of univocal.
            likeness in two respects. First it does not arise from the
            participation of one form, as two hot things are like by
            participation of one heat: because what is affirmed, of God and
            creatures is predicated of him essentially, but of creatures, by
            participation: so that a creature’s likeness to God is as that of a
            hot thing to heat, not of a hot thing to one that is hotter.
            Secondly, because this very form of which the creature participates
            falls short of the nature of the thing which is God just as the heat
            of fire falls short of the nature of the sun’s power whereby it
            produces heat.

            accordingly. First when it is only a question of the quantity of the
            thing participated: thus snow is said to be whiter than the wall,
            because whiteness is more perfect in the snow than in the wall, and

            or
            <i>less</i>
            does not cause a difference of species. Secondly when the one is
            predicated participatively and the other essentially: thus we might
            say that goodness is better than a good thing. Thirdly when the one
            same term is ascribed to one thing in a more eminent degree than to
            another, for instance, heat to the sun than to fire. These last two

            There is a twofold likeness between God and creatures. One is the
            likeness of the creature to the divine mind, and thus the form
            understood by God and the thing itself are homogeneous, although
            they have not the same mode of being, since the form understood is
            only in the mind, while the form of the creature is in the thing.
            There is another likeness inasmuch as the divine essence itself is
            the supereminent but not homogeneous likeness of all things. It is
            by reason of this latter likeness that good and the like are
            predicated in common of God and creatures: but not by reason of the
            former, because when we say
            <i>God is good</i>
            we do not mean to define him from the fact that he understands the

            The equivocal agent must precede the univocal: because the latter’s

            on the contrary side. The Philosopher refers to things that are
            common physically, not logically. Now things that have a different
            mode of existence have nothing in common in respect of that being
            which is considered by the physicist, but they may have some common
            ‘intention’ that the logician may consider. Moreover, even from the
            physicist’s point of view the elemental and the heavenly body are
            not in the same genus: but in the view of the logician they are.
            However, the Philosopher does not mean to exclude analogical but
            only univocal community: since he wishes to prove that the
            corruptible and the incorruptible have not a common genus.

            between a creature and God.

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod relatio in hoc differt a quantitate et
            qualitate: quia quantitas et qualitas sunt quaedam accidentia in
            subiecto remanentia; relatio autem non significat, ut Boetius dicit,
            ut in subiecto manens, sed ut in transitu quodam ad aliud; unde et
            Porretani dixerunt, relationes non esse inhaerentes, sed
            assistentes, quod aliqualiter verum est, ut posterius ostendetur.
            Quod autem attribuitur alicui ut ab eo in aliud procedens non facit
            compositionem cum eo, sicut nec actio cum agente. Et propter hoc
            etiam probat philosophus V Phys., quod in ad aliquid non potest esse
            motus: quia, sine aliqua mutatione eius quod ad aliud refertur,
            potest relatio desinere ex sola mutatione alterius, sicut etiam de
            actione patet, quod non est motus secundum actionem nisi metaphorice
            et improprie; sicut exiens de otio in actum mutari dicimus, quod non
            esset si relatio vel actio significaret aliquid in subiecto manens.
            Ex hoc autem apparet quod non est contra rationem simplicitatis
            alicuius multitudo relationum quae est inter ipsum et alia; immo
            quanto simplicius est tanto concomitantur ipsum plures relationes.
            Quanto enim aliquid est simplicius, tanto virtus (eius) est minus
            limitata, unde ad plura se extendit sua causalitas. Et ideo in libro
            de causis dicitur, quod omnis virtus unita plus est infinita quam
            virtus multiplicata. Oportet autem intelligi aliquam relationem
            inter principium et ea quae a principio sunt, non solum quidem
            relationem originis, secundum quod principiata oriuntur a principio,
            sed etiam relationem diversitatis: quia oportet effectum a causa
            distingui, cum nihil sit causa sui ipsius. Et ideo ad summam Dei
            simplicitatem consequitur quod infinitae habitudines sive relationes
            existant inter creaturas et ipsum, secundum quod ipse creaturas
            producit a seipso diversas, aliqualiter tamen sibi assimilatas.

            I answer that relation differs from quantity and quality in that
            quantity and quality are accidents residing in the subject, whereas
            relation, as Boethius says (<i>De Trin.</i>), signifies something
            not as adhering to a subject but as passing from it to something
            else: wherefore de la Porrée said that relations are not adherent
            but assistant, which is true in a sense as we shall show further on.
            Now when a thing is attributed to someone as proceeding from him to
            another this does not argue composition between them, as neither
            does action imply composition with the agent. And for this reason
            the Philosopher proves (<i>Phys.</i>
            v) that there can be no movement in relation: since without any
            change in the thing that is related to another, the relation can
            cease for the sole reason that this other is changed. Thus it is
            clear with regard to action that there is no movement in respect of
            action except metaphorically and improperly speaking, just as we say
            that one who passes from inaction into action is changed: and this,
            would not be the case if relation or action signified something
            abiding in the subject. Hence it is evident that it is not
            incompatible with a thing’s simplicity to have many relations
            towards other things: indeed the more simple a thing is the greater
            the number of its concomitant relations: since its power is so much
            the less limited and consequently its causality so much the more
            extended. Wherefore it is stated in
            <i>De Causis</i> (prop. xvii) that a united force is less confined
            than a distributed force. Now we must needs admit a relation between
            a principle and the things which proceed from it; and not only a
            relation of origin inasmuch as a result springs from its source, but
            also a relation of distinction, seeing that an effect must needs be
            distinct from its cause, for nothing is its own cause. Accordingly
            from God’s supreme simplicity there results an infinite number of
            respects or relations between creatures and him, inasmuch as he
            produced creatures distinct from himself and yet somewhat likened to
            him.

            Those relatives are naturally simultaneous which have the same
            reason for their mutual relationship, for instance, father and son,
            master and servant, double and half. But when there is not the same
            reason on either side for referring one thing to another, then
            relatives are not naturally simultaneous, but one naturally precedes
            the other: as the Philosopher states with regard to sense and the
            sensible object, knowledge and the thing knowable (<i>De Praed.</i>
            v). Wherefore it clearly does not follow that God and the creature
            are naturally simultaneous, since there is not the same reason on
            either side for one being referred to the other. It is not
            necessary, however, even in relatives that are naturally
            simultaneous that the subjects be naturally simultaneous, but only
            the relations.

            Not all the things that are related can be compared to each other,.

            Ad quartum dicendum, quod oppositio relationis in duobus differt ab
            aliis oppositionibus: quorum primum est quod in aliis oppositis unum
            dicitur alteri opponi, in quantum ipsum removet: negatio enim
            removet affirmationem, et secundum hoc ei opponitur; oppositio vero
            privationis et habitus et contrarietatis includit oppositionem
            contradictionis, ut IV Metaph. dicitur. Non autem est hoc in

            privatione et altero contrariorum. Hoc autem in relativis non

            Deum, non autem alia oppositio,- cum ex Deo sit magis creaturarum
            positio quam earum remotio; est tamen aliqua habitudo, creaturarum
            ad Deum. Ratione vero secundae differentiae est in ipsis divinis
            personis (in quibus nihil imperfectum esse potest) oppositio
            relationi, et non alia, ut posterius, apparebit.

            Relative opposition differs in two ways from other kinds of
            opposition. First in the latter one thing is said to be opposite to
            another inasmuch as it excludes it,—as negation excludes
            affirmation, and in this respect is opposed to it: and opposition of
            privation and habit, and of contrariety includes opposition of
            contradiction (<i>Metaph.</i> iv). But it is not thus with things
            that are opposed relatively. For son is not opposed to father by
            excluding him, but on account of the nature of his relationship to
            him. Hence follows the second difference: because in other kinds of
            opposition one of the opposites is always imperfect by reason of the
            negation attaching to privation and one of the contraries. But this
            is not necessarily so in relative opposition, indeed it is possible
            to consider both relatives as perfect, as is especially evident in
            equiparent relatives and in relatives of origin, for instance,
            things that are equal to or like one another, father and son.
            Wherefore relation is more attributable to God than other kinds of
            opposition. By reason of the first difference relative opposition
            may be observed between the creature and God, but not any other
            kind: seeing that it is owing to God that creatures are affirmed
            rather than excluded; and yet creatures have a certain relationship
            to God. By reason of the second difference, in the divine Persons
            (in whom there can be no imperfection) there can be relative
            opposition and no other, as we shall show further on (Q. viii).

            To become is to be changed properly speaking: wherefore just as a
            thing is not changed in respect of a relation except accidentally,
            to wit through a change in the thing to which the relation is
            consequent, so neither is a thing said to become in respect of a
            relation, except accidentally. Thus a body through a change in its
            quantity becomes equal (to another), yet the change is not
            essentially connected with equality but is related thereto
            accidentally. And yet a thing does not need to be changed in order
            that a relation begin to be predicated of it but it suffices that a
            change occur in one of the extremes since the cause of relationship
            between two is something inherent in both. Consequently from
            whichever extreme a change is wrought in that which caused the
            relationship, the relationship between them ceases. Accordingly from
            the fact that a change is wrought in the creature, a relation begins
            ‘to be attributed to God. Hence he cannot be said to become except
            metaphorically; inasmuch as he is like a thing that becomes, through
            something new that is said about him: thus we say (Ps. lxxxix, i)

            When these relations begin to be ascribed to God on account of some

            being attributed to him is on the part of the creature, and that
            they are predicated of God accidentally. But as Augustine says this
            does not imply an accident in God, but refers to something outside
            him and compared to him accidentally: for God’s existence does not
            depend on creatures as neither does the builder’s existence depend
            on the house: wherefore just as it is accidental to the builder that
            the house exists, so is it accidental to God that the creature
            exists. For we say that anything without which a thing can exist is
            accidental to it.

            which God begins to be predicated. Now an accident is something real

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod relatio ad Deum est aliqua res in creatura.
            Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est, quod sicut dicit Commentator in XI
            Metaph., quia relatio est debilioris esse inter omnia praedicamenta,
            ideo putaverunt quidam eam esse ex secundis intellectibus. Prima
            enim intellecta sunt res extra animam, in quae primo intellectus
            intelligenda fertur. Secunda autem intellecta dicuntur intentiones
            consequentes modum intelligendi: hoc enim secundo intellectus
            intelligit in quantum reflectitur supra se ipsum, intelligens se
            intelligere et modum quo intelligit. Secundum ergo hanc positionem
            sequeretur quod relatio non sit in rebus extra animam, sed in solo
            intellectu, sicut intentio generis et speciei, et secundarum
            substantiarum. Hoc autem esse non potest. In nullo enim
            praedicamento ponitur aliquid nisi res extra animam existens. Nam
            ens rationis dividitur contra ens divisum per decem praedicamenta ut
            patet V Metaph. Si autem relatio non esset in rebus extra animam non
            poneretur ad aliquid unum genus praedicamenti. Et praeterea
            perfectio et bonum quae sunt in rebus extra animam, non solum
            attenditur secundum aliquid absolute inhaerens rebus, sed etiam
            secundum ordinem unius rei ad aliam, sicut etiam in ordine partium
            exercitus, bonum exercitus consistit: huic enim ordini comparat
            philosophus ordinem universi. Oportet ergo in ipsis rebus ordinem
            quemdam esse; hic autem ordo relatio quaedam est. Unde oportet in
            rebus ipsis relationes quasdam esse, secundum quas unum ad alterum
            ordinatur. Ordinatur autem una res ad aliam vel secundum
            quantitatem, vel secundum virtutem activam seu passivam. Ex his enim
            solum duobus attenditur aliquid in uno, respectu extrinseci.
          </td>
          <td>
            I answer that relation to God is something real in the creature. To
            make this clear we must observe that as the Commentator says (<i
              >Metaph.</i
            >
            xi, text. 19), seeing that of all the predicaments relation has the
            least stability, some have thought that it should be reckoned among
            the predicables because the predicaments (<i>prima intellecta</i>)
            have an objective reality and are the first things to be understood
            by the intellect: whereas the predicables (<i>secunda intellecta</i
            >) are certain ‘intentions’ consequent to our mode of understanding:
            inasmuch as by a second act the intellect reflects on itself, and
            knows both the fact that it understands and the manner of its
            understanding. According then to this view it would follow that
            relation has no objective reality, but exists only in the mind, even
            as the notion of genus or species and of second substances. But this
            is impossible: because nothing is assigned to a predicament unless
            it has objective reality: since logical being is divided against the
            being that is divided by the ten predicaments (<i>Metaph.</i> v).
            Now if relation had no objective reality, it would not be placed
            among the predicaments. Moreover the perfection and goodness that
            are in things outside the mind are ascribed not only to something
            absolute and inherent to things but also to the order between one
            thing and another: thus the good of an army consists in the mutual
            ordering of its parts, to which good the Philosopher (<i>Metaph.</i>
            x) compares the good of the universe. Consequently there must be
            order in things themselves, and this order is a kind of relation.
            Wherefore there must be relations in things themselves, whereby one
            is ordered to another. Now one thing is ordered to another either as
            to quantity or as to active or passive power: for on these two
            counts alone can we find in a thin something whereby we compare it
            with another.

            qualitatem ordinatur aliquid ad seipsum tantum, non ad alterum, nisi

            partes exercitus, est propter ordinem exercitus ad ducem, ut patet
            XII Metaph. Unde oportet quod creaturae realiter referantur ad Deum,

            For a thing is measured not only by its intrinsic quantity but also
            in reference to an extrinsic quantity. And again by its active power
            one thing acts on another, and by its passive power is acted on by
            another: while by its substance and quality a thing is ordered to
            itself alone and not to another, except accidentally: namely
            inasmuch as a quality, substantial form or matter is a kind of
            active or passive power, and forasmuch as one may ascribe to them a
            certain kind of quantity: thus one thing produces the same in
            substance; and one thing produces its like in quality; and number or
            multitude causes dissimilarity and diversity in the same things; and
            dissimilarity in that one thing is considered as being more or less
            so and so than another, thus one thing is said to be whiter than
            another. Hence the Philosopher (<i>Metaph.</i> v) in giving the
            species of relations, says that some are based on quantity and some
            on action and passion. Accordingly things that are ordered to
            something must be really related to it, and this relation must be
            some real thing in them. Now all creatures are ordered to God both
            as to their beginning and as to their end: since the order of the
            parts of the universe to one another results from the order of the
            whole universe to God: even as the mutual order of the parts of an
            army is on account of the order of the whole army to its commander
            (<i>Metaph.</i> xii). Therefore creatures are really related to God,
            and this relation is something real in the creature.

            When it is said that the creature proceeds from God immediately, we
            exclude an intermediate creative cause, but not the intermediate
            real relationship which arises naturally from the creature’s
            production, even as equality results immediately from quantity: thus
            a real relation follows naturally the production of created
            substance.

            Creatures depend on God’s knowledge as an effect depends on its
            cause, and not as though their very existence consisted in that
            knowledge, so that for a creature to exist would mean nothing else
            but that it is known by God. This was the view of those who
            contended that whatsoever is perceived is real, and that the reality
            of things depends on’ our thoughts and perception, so that to exist
            would be nothing but to be an object of perception or thought.

            The very relation that is nothing but the order between one creature
            and another may be considered as an accident, or as a relation.
            Considered as an accident it is something adhering to a subject; but
            not considered as a relation or order, for then it is mere
            towardness, something passing as it were from one thing to another
            and assisting that which is related. Accordingly a relation is
            something inherent, but not because it is a relation: thus action as
            action is considered as issuing from the agent; but, as an accident,
            is considered as inherent to the active subject. Wherefore nothing
            prevents such an accident from ceasing to exist without ‘any change
            in its subject, because it is not essentially complete through its
            existence in its subject but through transition into something else:
            and if this be removed the essence of this accident is removed as
            regards the action, but remains as regards its cause: even so, if
            the matter be removed, the heating is removed, although the cause of
            heating remain.

            2. It will be replied that he moves creatures without any change in
            himself; wherefore he is not really related to the thing moved. On
            the contrary, the presence of one of two relative opposites in a
            thing is not a reason for attributing the other to the. same thing:
            thus a thing is not double because it is a half, nor is God Father

            related, it does not follow that where there is the relation of

            Again, Dionysius says (<i>Div. Nom.</i> ix): “Likeness is not
            reciprocal between cause and effect, for an effect is said to be
            like its cause and not vice versa.” Now the same would seem to apply
            to other relations as to that of likeness. Therefore,seemingly
            neither is there reciprocity in the relations between God and the
            creature, and we cannot argue that because the creature is really
            related to God, therefore is God really related to the creature.

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod relationes, quae dicuntur de Deo ad

            aliam, ut dictum est; in illis tantum mutua realis relatio invenitur
            in quibus ex utraque parte est eadem ratio ordinis unius ad alterum:
            quod quidem invenitur in omnibus relationibus consequentibus
            quantitatem. Nam cum quantitatis ratio sit ab omni sensibili
            abstracta, eiusdem rationis est quantitas in omnibus naturalibus
            corporibus. Et pari ratione qua unum habentium quantitatem realiter

            absolute considerata ad aliam ordinem secundum rationem mensurae et

            I answer that the relations whereby we refer God to creatures are
            not really in God. To make this clear we must observe that since a
            real relation consists in the order of one thing to another, as
            already stated, a real relation is mutual in those things alone
            wherein on either side there is the same reason for mutual order:
            and this apples to all relations consequent to quantity. For since
            the notion of quantity is independent of all objects of sense, it is
            the same in all corporeal natures. And for the same reason that a
            quantitative thing A is really related to the quantitative thing B,
            B is really related to A. Now between one quantity, considered
            absolutely, and another there is the order deriving from measure and
            thing measured, under the name of whole and part and other such
            things that result from quantity.

            This is especially evident in univocal agents which by their action
            produce their like in species, and consequently perpetuate their
            species as far as this is possible. This is also evident in all
            other things which move, act or cause through themselves being

            effects; and again in all those things where any good accrues to the

            For this reason the relation which arises from the act of the mind
            cannot be in that thing. The same applies to sense and the sensible
            object: for although the sensible object by its own action affects
            the organ of sense, and consequently bears a relation to it, just as
            other natural agents have a relation to the things on which they
            act, nevertheless it is not the alteration of the organ that
            perfects the act of perception, but the act of the sensitive power;
            to which act the sensible object outside the soul is altogether
            foreign. In like manner a man who stands to the right of a pillar
            bears a corresponding relation to the pillar by reason of his motive
            power whereby he is competent to be to the right or to the left,
            before or behind, above or below. Wherefore such-like relations in
            man or animal are real, but not in the thing which lacks that power.
            In like manner again money is external to the action whereby prices
            are fixed, which action is a convention between certain persons: and
            man is outside the genus of those actions whereby the artist
            produces his image. Hence there is not a real relation either in a
            man to his image, or in money to the price, but vice versa. Now God
            does not work by an intermediary action to be regarded as issuing
            from God and terminating in the creature: but his action is his
            substance and is wholly outside the genus of created being whereby
            the creature is related to him. Nor again does any good accrue to
            the creator from the production of the creature: wherefore his
            action is supremely liberal as Avicenna says (<i>Metaph.</i> viii,
            7). It is also evident that he is not moved to act, and that without
            any change in himself he makes all changeable things. It follows
            then that there is no real relation in him to creatures, although
            creatures are really related to him, as effects to their cause.

            natural form, and it suffices for it to be expressed, grammatically
            speaking, by way of a form: thus a man is denominated from an
            action, his apparel and the like which are not really forms.

            If by proportion is meant a definite excess, then there is no
            proportion in God to the creature. But if proportion stands for
            relation alone, then there is relation between the Creator and the

            received by the teacher’s mind otherwise than in nature, because

            distinction between predicamental and transcendental relatives does
            not prove the relations in question to be real. Certain
            predicamental relative terms do not signify a real relation, for

            transcendental relative terms signify real relations, for instance,
            knowledge and sensation. Because relatives are said to be
            predicamental when terms are employed to signify the relations
            themselves, while they are said to be transcendental when thee terms
            are employed to signify qualities or something of the kind
            primarily, from which relations arise. Nor as regards the question
            at issue does it matter whether they be real or logical relations.

            Secondly, when these relations arise from the mode of understanding,
            namely when the mind understands one thing in its relation to
            another, although that relation is not discovered by the intellect
            but follows by a kind of necessity its mode of understanding. Such
            relations are attributed by the intellect not to that which is in
            the intellect but to that which has objective reality. This happens
            forasmuch as certain things not mutually related are understood in
            relation to one another, although the mind does not understand them
            to be related, for in that case it would be in error. Now in order
            that two things be related they must each have existence, be
            distinct from each other (for nothing bears a relation to itself),
            and be referable to the other. Now the mind sometimes conceives two
            things as having,existence, whereas one or neither of them is a
            being: as when it considers two futures, or one present and one
            future, and considers one in relation to the other by placing one
            before the other; wherefore such relations are purely logical since
            they arise from the mode of understanding. And sometimes the mind
            considers one thing as though it were two, and considers them in the
            light of a certain relationship: as when a thing is said to be
            identical with itself, and such a relation is purely logical.
            Sometimes the mind considers two things as referable to each other,
            whereas there is no relation between them, in fact one of them is
            itself essentially a relation: as when a relation is said to be
            accidental to its subject, wherefore such a logical relation has
            merely a logical relationship to anything else. Again the mind
            sometimes considers something in relation to another inasmuch as it
            is the term of the relationship of another thing to it, and yet
            itself is not related to the other: as when it considers something
            knowable as terminating the relationship of knowledge to it; and
            thus it imputes to the thing knowable a certain relation to
            knowledge, and such a relation is purely logical. In like manner our
            mind attributes to God certain relative terms, inasmuch as it
            considers God as the term of the creature’s relation to him:
            wherefore such relations are purely logical.

            Ad quintum dicendum, quod relatio scientiae Dei ad creaturam non est
            primo et per se, ut dictum est prius, sed ad essentiam creatoris,

            things.
