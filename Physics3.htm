                Nature has been defined as a 'principle of motion and change',
                and it is the subject of our inquiry. We must therefore see that
                we understand the meaning of 'motion'; for if it were unknown,
                the meaning of 'nature' too would be unknown.

                When we have determined the nature of motion, our next task will
                be to attack in the same way the terms which are involved in it.
                Now motion is supposed to belong to the class of things which
                are continuous; and the infinite presents itself first in the
                continuous—that is how it comes about that 'infinite' is often
                used in definitions of the continuous ('what is infinitely
                divisible is continuous'). Besides these, place, void, and time
                are thought to be necessary conditions of motion. Clearly, then,
                for these reasons and also because the attributes mentioned are
                common to, and coextensive with, all the objects of our science,
                we must first take each of them in hand and discuss it. For the
                investigation of special attributes comes after that of the
                common attributes. To begin then, as we said, with motion.

                We may start by distinguishing (1) what exists in a state of
                fulfilment only, (2) what exists as potential, (3) what exists
                as potential and also in fulfilment—one being a 'this', another
                'so much', a third 'such', and similarly in each of the other
                modes of the predication of being. Further, the word 'relative'
                is used with reference to (1) excess and defect, (2) agent and
                patient and generally what can move and what can be moved. For
                'what can cause movement' is relative to 'what can be moved',

                Again, there is no such thing as motion over and above the
                things. It is always with respect to substance or to quantity or
                to quality or to place that what changes changes. But it is
                impossible, as we assert, to find anything common to these which
                is neither 'this' nor quantum nor quale nor any of the other
                predicates. Hence neither will motion and change have reference
                to something over and above the things mentioned, for there is
                nothing over and above them.

              276. As to the first [189] he uses the following argument: Nature
              is the principle of motion and change, as is evident from the
              definition set down in Book II. (But how motion and change differ,
              will be shown in Book V.) And thus it is evident that if one does
              not know motion, one does not know nature, since the former
              [motion] is placed in the definition of the latter [nature].
              Since, therefore, we intend to present the science of nature, we
              must make motion understood.

              280. With respect to the first of these, he sets down three
              divisions:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  The first of these is that being is divided by potency and
                  act. Now this division does not distinguish beings into
                  genera—for potency and act are found in every genus.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The second division is of being as divided according to the
                  ten genera: the first of these is “this something,” i.e.,
                  substance; others are: how much [i.e., quantity], or how
                  [quality], or some other of the Predicaments.

                <li>
                  The third division is of one genus of beings, namely, of the
                  one which is “to something” [relation]. For motion seems in a
                  certain way to pertain to this genus, insofar as the mover is
                  referred to the movable thing.

              else—it is necessary that it be grounded on some other accident.
              For the more perfect accidents are closer to the substance, and it
              is through them as intermediates that the other accidents inhere

              no. 296), is an imperfect act, and since everything which is
              imperfect falls under the same genus with that which is perfect in
              respect to it—not, indeed, as a species, but by reduction (as
              prime matter is by reduction in the genus of “substance”)
              necessarily motion is not outside the genera of things in which
              motion occurs. And this is what he [Aristotle] states, namely,
              that motion is not “outside of things,” i.e., outside the genera
              of things in which motion is found, in such a way as to be
              something extraneous to, or something common to, these genera.

              Now there is not to be found in these genera some common univocal
              element which would not be found under some predicament but would
              be their genus; but being is common to them according to analogy,

              For it is plain that in all the genera a thing may be present in
              two ways, either as something perfect, or as something imperfect.
              The reason for this is that privation and possession is the prime
              contrariety, which is found in all the contraries, as is stated in
              <i>Metaphysics</i>
              X (l.6). Whence, since all the genera are divided through contrary
              differences, it is necessary that in all there be the perfect and
              the imperfect: as in “substance” something is as form and
              something is as privation; and in “quality” there is something
              such as white, which is perfect, and something such as black,
              which is, as it were, imperfect; and in “quantity” one thing is
              perfect quantity, another imperfect; and in “place” something is
              above, which is, as it were, perfect, and something is below,
              which is, so to speak, imperfect; or else there is light and
              heavy, which are placed in “where” [place] by virtue of the
              inclination [to a certain place] which is in them. Hence it is
              plain that according to the divisions of being, there are
              corresponding divisions of motion.

                potential and fully real, not indeed at the same time or not in
                the same respect, but e.g. potentially hot and actually cold.

              terms of what is prior and better known otherwise than the
              Philosopher here does. For it has been pointed out already that
              every genus is divided by potency and act. Now potency and act,
              since they are among the first differences of being, are naturally
              prior to motion, and it is these that the Philosopher uses to
              define motion.

              Consider, therefore, that something is in act only, something is
              in potency only, something else is midway between potency and act.
              What is in potency only is not yet being moved; what is already in
              perfect act is not being moved but has already been moved.
              Consequently, that is being moved which is midway between pure
              potency and act, which is partly in potency and partly in act—as
              is evident in alteration. [or when water is only potentially hot,
              it is not being moved; when it has now been heated, the motion of
              heating is finished; but when it possesses “ some heat, through
              imperfectly, then it is being moved—for whatever is being heated
              gradually acquires heat step by step. Therefore this imperfect act
              of heat existing in a heatable object is motion—not, indeed, by
              reason of what the heatable object has already become, but
              inasmuch as, being already in act, it has an order to a further
              act. For should this order to a further act be taken away, the act
              already present, however, imperfect, would be the term of motion
              and not motion itself—as happens when something becomes
              half-heated. This order to a further act belongs to the thing that
              is in potency to it.

              Similarly, if the imperfect act were considered solely as ordered

              the nature of motion but of a principle of motion—for heating can

              idem sit subiectum existens in potentia et in actu, non tamen est
              idem secundum rationem esse in potentia et esse in actu, sicut aes

              ratio aeris inquantum est aes et inquantum est potentia ad
              statuam. Motus autem non est actus aeris inquantum est aes, sed
              inquantum est in potentia ad statuam: alias oporteret quod quandiu
              aes esset, tandiu aes moveretur, quod patet esse falsum. Unde

              He says therefore first that the phrase, “insofar as it is such,”
              had to be added, because what is in potency is at the same time
              something in act. And although the subject which is both in
              potency and in act may be the same, nevertheless to be in potency
              and to be in act is not contained under the same notion. Thus,
              although brass is a statue in potency but is brass actually,
              nevertheless the notion of the brass as brass is not the same as
              the notion of the brass as it is in potency to a statue. Now
              motion is not an act of the brass insofar as it is brass but
              insofar as it is in potency to a statue; otherwise. during the
              whole time that it was brass it would be undergoing motion, which
              is clearly false. That is why it is necessary to add “insofar as
              it is such.

              based on the nature of contraries. For it is clear that a given
              subject is in potency to contraries—as a humor or the blood is in
              potency to health and to sickness. But to be in potency to health
              is one thing and to be in potency to sickness is another, if one

              to be able to be well were the same thing, it then would follow
              that being sick and being well would be the same. Hence to be able
              to be sick and to be able to be healthy are different notions,

                Further it is evident that motion is an attribute of a thing
                just when it is fully real in this way, and neither before nor
                after. For each thing of this kind is capable of being at one
                time actual, at another not. Take for instance the buildable as
                buildable. The actuality of the buildable as buildable is the
                process of building. For the actuality of the buildable must be
                either this or the house. But when there is a house, the
                buildable is no longer buildable. On the other hand, it is the
                buildable which is being built. The process then of being built
                must be the kind of actuality required But building is a kind of
                motion, and the same account will apply to the other kinds also.

                The reason in turn why motion is thought to be indefinite is
                that it cannot be classed simply as a potentiality or as an
                actuality—a thing that is merely capable of having a certain
                size is not undergoing change, nor yet a thing that is actually
                of a certain size, and motion is thought to be a sort of
                actuality, but incomplete, the reason for this view being that
                the potential whose actuality it is is incomplete. This is why
                it is hard to grasp what motion is. It is necessary to class it
                with privation or with potentiality or with sheer actuality, yet
                none of these seems possible. There remains then the suggested
                mode of definition, namely that it is a sort of actuality, or
                actuality of the kind described, hard to grasp, but not
                incapable of existing.

              motion is a good one: First, because the definitions that others
              have given are unsuitable; Secondly, because it is impossible to
              define motion otherwise than as Aristotle has defined it, the
              reason being that motion cannot be placed in any other genus but
              that of “act of a thing existing in potency.”

              For they said that motion is “otherness,” because the thing being
              moved constantly changes from one state to another. Similarly,
              they said motion is “unequalness,” because the thing being moved
              approaches its term always more and more. They also said that
              motion is “non-being,” because the thing being moved does not yet
              have that to which it is being moved as long as it is being
              moved—as that which is being moved toward whiteness is not yet
              white.

              He does so first by looking at the subject of motion. For if

              whatever would possess any one of these three characteristics
              would of necessity be undergoing motion—in whatever this motion
              is, that thing is being moved. But things that are other are not
              necessarily being moved by the fact that they are “other,” nor by
              the fact that they are “unequal,” nor by the fact that they “do
              not exist.” It follows, therefore, that otherness and unequalness
              and non-being are not motion.

              is a change to “being”, and corruption to “non-being.” Hence

              their opposites. Hence there is no reason to place motion in the

              He says therefore that the reason why the older philosophers
              placed motion in the above-mentioned genera (namely, “otherness,”
              “unequalness” and “non-being”) is that motion seems to be
              something indeterminate, i.e., something incomplete and imperfect
              as though possessing no determinate nature. And because it is
              indeterminate, its proper place seemed to be in the genus of
              privation. For when Pythagoras laid down two ordinations of
              reality, in each of which he placed ten principles, the principles
              in the second group were said by him to be indeterminate because
              they were privative. They were not, indeed, determined by a form
              in the genus of substance, nor by the form of quality, or by any
              special form in either of these genera or by the form of any of

              were placed under potency, whatever would be in potency, for
              example, to quantity, would be being moved according to quantity.

              things were actually quantified would be being moved according to

              Now it is indeed true that motion is act, yet it is imperfect act,
              a medium between potency and act. And that it is imperfect act is
              clear from the fact that that of which it is an act is a being in
              potency as stated above (l.2, no.285). And that is why it is
              difficult to grasp what motion is. For at first sight It seems to
              be either entirely act or entirely potency or else to be contained
              under privation as it seemed to the ancients who called it
              “non-being” or “unequalness.” But none of these is possible, as we
              have shown above (no.294). Hence it follows that there is just one
              way to define motion; namely, that it is the kind of act we have
              said, i.e., that of a thing existing in potency.

              hic ponit aliam definitionem motus, quae se habet ad praemissam ut
              materialis ad formalem, et conclusio ad principium. Et haec est
              definitio: motus est actus mobilis inquantum est mobile. Haec enim

              existentis in potentia inquantum huiusmodi; existens autem in

              297. After defining motion, the Philosopher now shows whose act
              motion is, i.e., whether it is the act of the mobile or of the
              mover. Also it may be said that he gives another definition of
              notion which is related to the previous one as material to formal
              and as a conclusion to its principle. And this is the definition:
              motion is “the act of the mobile inasmuch as it is mobile.” This
              definition is a conclusion from the previous one. For since motion
              is “the act of a thing existing in potency inasmuch as it is in
              potency,” and since that which exists in potency as such is the
              mobile and not the mover (for the mover as such is in act), it
              follows that motion is an act of the mobile as such.

              299. He shows in two ways that the mover is moved. This is so
              first of all because anything that is previously in potency and
              then in act is somehow being moved. But movers are found that are
              previously movers in potency and afterwards movers in act;
              therefore they are moved. He states, therefore, that every mover,
              since it is such that it is in potency to being a mover, is
              likewise moved. This is clear from what has been already said, for
              it was said that motion is an act of a thing existing in potency
              and this occurs in every natural mover; that is why it was said
              above that every physical mover is moved.

              300. Secondly [206] he brings out the same point in another way:
              Whatsoever’s immobility is its rest is capable of motion; for rest
              and motion, since they are opposites, happen to the same. But the
              immobility of a mover, i.e., its ceasing from moving, is called
              rest; for there are things which said to rest when they cease to
              act. Therefore every such mover, i.e., one whose immobility is
              rest, is moved.

              301. Then [207] he shows why it happens that a mover is moved. For
              it does not happen precisely because it is a mover but because it
              is such by touching; because to move is to act in order to cause
              something to be moved and what is so acted upon by the mover is
              moved. But whatever acts does so by touching, for bodies act by
              touching; hence it follows that what acts is at the same time
              acted upon, because that which touches is acted upon. However,
              this must be understood of those cases where there is mutual
              touching; namely, when the thing touching is also touched, as
              happens in things which are material, where both of the things are
              acted upon when they touch one another. But heavenly bodies,
              because they do not have material like the lower bodies, so act on
              them that they are not acted upon in return and they touch without
              being touched as is stated in <i>De Generatione</i> I (l.18).

              the aforesaid that although the mover is moved, motion
              nevertheless is not an act of the mover but of the mobile inasmuch
              as it is mobile. He shows this subsequently by the fact that “to
              be moved” is accidental to the mover and does not belong
              essentially to it. Whence, if something is moved precisely
              inasmuch as its act is motion it follows that motion is an act not
              of the mover but of the mobile, not, indeed, insofar as it is a
              mover but insofar as it is a mobile.

              mover; from which it follows that at the same time that it is

            <td>
              That “to be moved” does not belong essentially to the mover is
              clear from the fact that some form is always seen to be the
              mover—as the form which is in the genus of substance is the mover
              in substantial change, and a form in the genus of quality is the
              mover in alteration, and a form in the genus of quantity in growth
              and decrease. Forms of this type are the causes and principles of
              motions, since every agent moves according to its form. For every
              agent acts inasmuch it is actual—as an actual man makes an actual
              man of man in potency. Hence, since it is through its form that a
              thing is actual it follows that form is the moving principle. Thus
              “to move” belongs to a thing inasmuch as it has a form through
              which it is actual. Wherefore, since motion. is the act of a thing
              existing in potency, as said above (l.2, no.285), it follows that
              motion belongs to a thing not insofar as it is a mover but insofar
              as it is mobile. For that reason the definition says that motion
              is an act of the mobile inasmuch as it is mobile.

              305. Secondly [211] he explains this. And in regard to this he
              does three things. First he shows that there is an act of the
              mover as well as of the mobile. For whatever is described
              according to potency and act has some act competent to it. Now
              just as that which is moved is called “mobile” in potency since it
              is capable of being moved, and is called “moved” according to act
              inasmuch it is actually being moved, so on the part of the mover,
              a mover is described “potential mover” inasmuch as it is able to

              306. Secondly [212] he shows that the act of the mover and of the
              mobile is the same act. For something is called “mover” inasmuch
              as it acts and “moved” inasmuch as it is being acted upon. But
              what the mover causes by acting and what the moved receives is
              being acted upon are one and the same. thing. And this is what he
              means when he says that the mover actualizes the mobile, i.e.,
              causes the act of the mobile. Wherefore, they must both, namely,
              mover and moved, have the same act; for what is from the mover as
              agent cause is the same as what is in the moved as patient and
              receiver.

              mobile, est actus moventis; secundum autem quod est in mobili a

              307. Thirdly [213] he illustrates this by an example. For the
              distance from one to two is the same as that from two to one, but
              they differ according to conception; for in relating two to one we
              have “double,” but in relating one to two we have “one-half.” The
              same thing is true of the distance covered by one ascending and by
              one descending, but by reason of the diversity of starting point
              and term, one is called “ascent” and one “descent.” A parallel
              case is true of the mover and of the thing moved. For motion,
              inasmuch as it proceeds from the mover into the mobile, is an act
              of the mover, but inasmuch as it is in the mobile from the mover,
              it is an act of the mobile.

              of the moved. As a matter of fact, the act of the active is called
              “action” and the act of the passive is called “passion”. This he
              proves by saying that the work and end of anything is its act and
              perfection; hence, since the work and end of the agent is action
              and that of the patient is passion (or undergoing), it follows
              that action is the act of the agent and passion that of the
              patient.

              310. Then [215] he develops this doubt. For it is clear that both
              action and passion are motion; for each is the same as motion.
              Therefore, action and passion are either the same motion or
              diverse motions. If they are diverse, then each of them must be in
              some subject. Either both will be in the patient, i.e., the thing
              moved, or one of them (action) is in the agent and the other
              (passion) is in the patient. To say the opposite, i.e., that what
              is in the agent is passion and what is in the patient is action is
              to speak equivocally, or it would be calling passion action and
              vice versa. The fourth possibility, namely, that both are in the
              agent is left out, but this is because it has already been shown
              (nos. 302-303) that motion is in the mobile, which excludes the
              fourth possibility that neither be in the patient but both in the
              agent.

              first [216]. For if anyone says that action is in the agent and
              passion in the patient, then since action is a certain motion, as
              was stated (no. 310), it follows that motion is in the mover. For
              the same thing should be true both of the mover and of the moved,
              namely, that if motion is in either one it is being moved. Or
              else, that is true of the mover and of the moved which is true of
              the patient and of the agent. Now, if motion is in something, that
              thing is being moved; wherefore, it follows that either every
              mover is being moved or that something has motion but is not being
              moved; each of these seems unreasonable.

              He says that if anyone should say that both of them, namely,
              action and passion, since they are two motions, are in the
              patient, which is equivalent to saying that teaching which is on
              the part of the teacher and learning which is on the part of the
              learner are both in the learner, then two conflicts arise. The
              first is that if what we said previously is true, namely, that
              action is an act of the agent, then if action is not in the agent
              but in the patient, it will follow that the proper act of each

            <td>
              Then another conflict follows, namely, that one and the same thing
              is being moved according to two motions. For action and passion
              are now supposed to be two motions. Now in whatever thing there is
              a motion that thing is being moved according to that motion; if
              then action and passion are in the mobile, it follows that the
              mobile is being moved according to two motions. This would be
              tantamount to having two alterations in one subject both of them
              specifically the same; for example, one subject being moved to two
              whitenings, which is impossible. This does not mean that one
              subject could not be moved by two alterations tending toward two
              specifically different terms, for example, whitening and heating.
              Nevertheless, it is clear that action and passion terminate at the
              same specific term; for what the agent does and what the patient
              receives are one and the same.

              313. Then [218] he develops the other possibility. For it could be
              said that action and passion are not two motions but one. But this
              leads to four difficulties. The first is that the act of things of
              different species would be the same. For it has been already
              pointed out (no. 309) that action is an act of the agent and
              passion ant act of the patient and that these are specifically
              diverse; but if action and passion are the same motion then the
              act of specifically different things will be the same. The second
              difficulty is that if action and passion are one motion, then
              action is the same as passion, so that teaching which is laid to
              the teacher is the same as learning which is in the learner. The
              third difficulty is that acting would be the same as being acted
              upon and teaching would be the same as learning. The fourth
              difficulty that follows from this is that every teacher would be
              learning and every agent would be being acted upon.

              previously, (nos. 304,306) it is clear that action and passion are
              not two motions but one and the same motion; for insofar as motion
              is from the agent it is called “action,” and insofar as it is in

              supposition that action and passion are one motion: because since
              action is an act of the agent, then if action and passion are one
              motion, it follows that the act of the agent is somehow in the
              patient and thus the act of one thing will be in something else.

              logically from the other he takes care of in reverse order. He
              disposes first of the last difficulty deduced, because it is so
              evidently improper. Thus he is now, thirdly, settling the fifth
              difficulty. He says that it is not necessary to say that one who
              is teaching is learning or that an agent is being acted upon just
              because to act and to be acted upon are the same, as long as we
              understand that they are not the same in the way that dress and
              clothing are the same (for these are the same in motion) but in
              the way, as said above (nos. 307,318), that the road from Thebes
              to Athens and from Athens to Thebes are the same, i.e., as being
              the same as to subject but differing as to notion. For it is not
              necessary that things which are somehow the same should be the
              same in all ways; that is true only of things that are the same in
              subject or reality and also in motion. And therefore even granting
              that to act and to be acted upon are the same, yet since they are
              not the same in notion, it will not follow that it is the same for
              an object to act and to be acted upon.

              even though teaching and the doctrine of the learner were the
              same, it does not follow that to teach and to learn are the same;
              because teaching and doctrine are abstract terms, whereas to teach
              and to learn are concrete. Hence they are being applied to ends or
              to terms which serve as the basis for the difference in notion
              between action and passion. For just as the distance between two
              points is one and the same space in the abstract, yet if we apply
              it to two concrete places it is not one and the same, as when we
              say that there is a distance between here and there and between
              there and here.

              320. Then [222] he answers the third difficulty by destroying the
              inference that if action and passion are one motion, they are the
              same. And he says it necessary to say finally that it does not
              follow that action and passion are the same or that teaching and
              learning are, but rather that the motion in which both are is the
              same. This motion as a matter of fact is action from one viewpoint
              and passion from another. For it is one thing as to notion to be
              an act of a thing as being in it and another to be the act of a
              thing as being from it. Now motion is called “action” inasmuch as
              it is an act of the agent as from the agent; it is called
              “passion” inasmuch as it is an act of the patient as in the
              patient. Thus it is clear that although the motion of the mover
              and of the moved is the same thing due to the fact that motion as
              such abstracts from these aspects, yet action and passion differ
              due to the fact that these aspects are included in their
              signification. From this it is also apparent that since motion
              abstracts from the notion of action and passion, it belongs
              neither in the predicament “action” nor in the predicament
              “passion,” as some supposed.

              first is this: if action and passion are one motion, and they
              differ merely in thought, as said above (no. 317), it seems that
              they should not be listed as two distinct predicaments, since the
              predicaments are genera of things. Secondly, if motion is either
              action or passion, motion will not be found in substance, quality,
              quantity, and place, as said above (no. 286), but only in action
              and passion.

              its species, but according to the diverse manner of existing. Now
              the modes of existing are parallel to the modes of predicating.
              For in predicating something of something, we say that this is
              that; that is why the ten genera of being are called
              “predicaments.”

              matter); or it is traceable to the form and in this case, there is

              founded on quality, as color in a surface, and figure in lines or

              between subject and something else and thus we have the
              predicament of “relation”, (for when I say, “The man is a father,”

              Speaking generally, a thing can be denominated by something
              extrinsic either according to the notion of cause or according to
              that of measure. For something is denominated “caused” or
              “measured” on account of its relationship to something extrinsic.
              Now there are four genera of causes, two of which are parts of the
              essence, namely, matter and form; hence any predication based on
              these two pertains to the predicament of “substance,” as when I
              say that man is rational and man is corporeal. In regard to the
              other two causes, the final cause does not cause separately from
              the agent; for the end is a cause only insofar as it influences
              the agent. Therefore, the only cause according to which a thing
              can be denominated something as based on something extrinsic is
              the agent cause. Consequently, when something is denominated from
              the agent cause, it is the predicament of “passion,” for to
              undergo (<i>pati</i>) is nothing but the undergoing of something
              from an agent; on the other hand, if the agent cause is
              denominated something on account of its effect, one has the
              predicament of “action,” for action is an act from the agent into
              something else, as stated above (no, 316).

              An intrinsic measure would be a thing’s own length and width and

              There is a special predicament for men. For in other animals
              nature provided the requirements for preserving life, such as
              horns for defense, a tough and wooly hide as a covering, claws or
              the like for proceeding without harm. Hence, when by reason of
              this equipment animals are said to be “armed” or “covered” or
              “shod,” they are somehow so called not by reason of something;
              extrinsic but of something intrinsic, which is part of them.
              Hence, such are referred to the predicament of “substance,” as the
              same would be if man were said to be “endowed with hands” or
              “feet.” But the other things could not be endowed upon man by
              nature, both because they would be out of keeping with the
              subtlety of his complexion and because reason makes man capable of
              an enormous number of works for the performance of which nature
              could not have endowed him with specific instruments. In the place
              of all these instruments man has reason, which he can use to make
              for himself the things that are intrinsic to other animals. So
              when a man is said to be armed or clothed or shod, he is
              denominated thus by reason of something extrinsic to him that is
              neither a cause nor a measure; hence it is located in a special
              predicament called “habitus.” But we should not fail to note that
              this predicament is in certain matters used also for other animals
              not inasmuch as they are considered in their nature but insofar as

              completur non solum per id quod est de motu in rerum natura, sed
              etiam per id quod ratio apprehendit. De motu enim in rerum natura
              nihil aliud est quam actus imperfectus, qui est inchoatio quaedam
              actus perfecti in eo quod movetur: sicut in eo quod dealbatur, iam
              incipit esse aliquid albedinis. Sed ad hoc quod illud imperfectum
              habeat rationem motus, requiritur ulterius quod intelligamus ipsum
              quasi medium inter duo; quorum praecedens comparatur ad ipsum
              sicut potentia ad actum, unde motus dicitur actus; consequens vero
              comparatur ad ipsum sicut perfectum ad imperfectum vel actus ad
              potentiam, propter quod dicitur actus existentis in potentia, ut
              supra dictum est. Unde quodcumque imperfectum accipiatur ut non in
              aliud perfectum tendens, dicitur terminus motus et non erit motus
              secundum quem aliquid moveatur; utpote si aliquid incipiat
              dealbari, et statim alteratio interrumpatur.

              324. The second doubt is easy to solve. For the idea of motion
              depends not only on that which pertains to motion in reality but
              also on that which reason apprehends. In reality, motion is
              nothing more than an imperfect act which is a sort of beginning of
              a perfect act in that which is being moved; thus, in that which is
              becoming white, some whiteness has begun to be. But in order that
              what is imperfect have the aspect of motion it is further required
              that we understand it as a medium between two: the preceding one
              of them is compared to motion as potency to act (whence motion is
              called act); the consequent one is compared to motion as the
              perfect to the imperfect or as act to potency, wherefore motion is
              called “the act of a being that exists in potency,” as we said
              above (no. 285). But anything imperfect, if it is not considered
              to be tending on to something other as perfect, is called the
              terminus of motion and one will not have a motion according to
              which something is being moved; as, for example, if something
              should start to become white and then the alteration was
              immediately stopped.

              Therefore, in regard to what there is of motion in external
              reality, motion is placed reductively in that genus which
              terminates the motion, as the imperfect is reduced to the perfect,
              as stated above (no. 281). But in regard to what reason apprehends
              about motion, namely, that it is midway between two-terms, here
              the notion of cause and effect are brought in; because for
              something to be reduced from potency to act an agent cause is
              required. From this aspect, motion pertains to the predicaments of
              “action” and “passion”; for these two predicaments are based on
              the notions of acting cause and of effect, as was said above (no.

              particular—because from what was said about the definition of
              motion in general is clear how it can be defined in particular.

                Further, the Pythagoreans identify the infinite with the even.
                For this, they say, when it is cut off and shut in by the odd,
                provides things with the element of infinity. An indication of
                this is what happens with numbers. If the gnomons are placed
                round the one, and without the one, in the one construction the

                The physicists, on the other hand, all of them, always regard
                the infinite as an attribute of a substance which is different
                from it and belongs to the class of the so-called elements—water
                or air or what is intermediate between them. Those who make them
                limited in number never make them infinite in amount. But those
                who make the elements infinite in number, as Anaxagoras and
                Democritus do, say that the infinite is continuous by
                contact—compounded of the homogeneous parts according to the
                one, of the seed-mass of the atomic shapes according to the
                other. Further, Anaxagoras held that any part is a mixture in
                the same way as the All, on the ground of the observed fact that
                anything comes out of anything. For it is probably for this
                reason that he maintains that once upon a time all things were
                together. (This flesh and this bone were together, and so of any
                thing: therefore all things: and at the same time too.) For
                there is a beginning of separation, not only for each thing, but
                for all. Each thing that comes to be comes from a similar body,
                and there is a coming to be of all things, though not, it is
                true, at the same time. Hence there must also be an origin of
                coming to be. One such source there is which he calls Mind, and
                Mind begins its work of thinking from some starting-point. So
                necessarily all things must have been together at a certain
                time, and must have begun to be moved at a certain time.
                Democritus, for his part, asserts the contrary, namely that no
                element arises from another element. Nevertheless for him the
                common body is a source of all things, differing from part to
                part in size and in shape. It is clear then from these
                considerations that the inquiry concerns the physicist.

                only effectiveness which we can ascribe to it is that of a
                principle. Everything is either a source or derived from a
                source. But there cannot be a source of the infinite or
                limitless, for that would be a limit of it. Further, as it is a
                beginning, it is both uncreatable and indestructible. For there
                must be a point at which what has come to be reaches completion,
                and also a termination of all passing away. That is why, as we
                say, there is no principle of this, but it is this which is held
                to be the principle of other things, and to encompass all and to
                steer all, as those assert who do not recognize, alongside the
                infinite, other causes, such as Mind or Friendship. Further they
                identify it with the Divine, for it is 'deathless and
                imperishable' as Anaximander says, with the majority of the
                physicists.

              Pythagoreans, not laying down number to be separated from sensible
              things, but stating number to be, rather, the substance of
              sensible things, consequently did not lay down any infinite except

              And he says that the Pythagoreans attributed the infinite to a
              basis which was “even number.” And they demonstrated this in two
              ways. The first was an argument. That which is enclosed by
              another, and is terminated by another has the nature of the
              infinite; whereas that which encloses and terminated has the
              nature of a term. Now even number is comprehended and included
              under odd number. For if some even number is proposed, it is seen
              as in every way divisible. But when by the addition of unity it is
              reduced to an odd number, it now takes on a certain
              indivisibility, as though even was compressed under odd. Hence it
              seems as though “even” is infinite in itself, and causes infinity
              in others.

              to the order of natural progression, and to unity, which is a
              square as to power (since one times one is one), one adds the
              first odd number, namely, three, there will be constituted four,
              which is a squared number since twice two is four. If now to this
              second square there is added the second odd number, namely, five,
              one obtains nine, which is the square of three, since three times
              three is nine. Then if to this third square there is added the
              third odd number, namely, seven, one obtains sixteen, which is the
              square of four. And thus, following the ordered addition of odd
              numbers, there always arises the same form in those numbers,
              namely, a square.

              quantity: for the very distinction of the elements seemed to
              conflict with the notion that they could be infinite. But those

              Alia differentia est quantum ad habitudinem horum principiorum ad

              Another difference was as in the relation of these principles one
              to the other. For Anaxagoras said that each of these parts was a
              mixture of all the others, so that in each part of flesh there was
              bone and vice versa and the same for the other parts. He came to
              this opinion because he saw that anything came from anything; and,
              hence, since he believed that whatever comes to be from something
              is in it, he concluded that everything is in everything. And from
              this he seems to assert that at some time all things were
              commingled and nothing was distinct from anything else. Just as
              this flesh and this bone are commingled (which is proved by the
              generation of one from the other) so is everything else
              commingled. Therefore at one time all things were together. For it
              is necessary to posit a principle of separation not only in one
              single thing but in all things simultaneously. He proved this
              thus: Whatever comes to be from something other was previously
              commingled with it and is produced by being separated from it; but
              all things are produced, though not all at the same time;
              therefore, there must be some one principle generating not only
              each thing but all things. This one principle he called
              “intellect,” which alone has the capacity to separate and bring
              together because it is itself uncommingled.

              separation must have a principle; hence, he concluded, at some
              time all things were together and the motion by which things were
              separated one from the other began in time, and did not previously
              exist. Thus Anaxagoras laid down one principle as producing

              335. Then [230] he outlines four points of agreement among the
              early philosophers in regard to the infinite. The first of which
              is that all posited the infinite as a principle, and this
              “reasonably” i.e., for the following reason: If the infinite
              exists, it is impossible for It to be in vain, i.e., that it lack
              some definite standing among the beings of reality. But it can
              have no power other than that of a principle. For all things in
              the world are either principles, or derived from principles. But
              it is not fitting for the infinite to have a principle, because
              what has a principle has an end. Hence it follows that the
              infinite is a principle. Note, however, that in this reasoning,
              “principle” and “end” are both used equivocally; for that which is
              derived from a principle has a principle of
              <u>origin</u>
              whereas it is to have a principle and end of its
              <u>quantity</u>
              or size which is incompatible with infinite.

              Secundum autem quod attribuebant infinito est, quod sit ingenitum

              enim quod fit, necesse est quod accipiat finem, sicut et habet

            <td>
              The second point of agreement is that they denied coming into
              existence and ceasing to exist to the infinite. This follows from
              the fact that it is a principle. For whatever is produced must
              have an ending just as it has a principle; and likewise any
              process of corruption has an end. But “end” and “infinite” are
              incompatible; hence the infinite can neither be generated nor
              corrupted. Hence it is clear that the infinite has no principle,
              but that the infinite is the principle of everything else.

              infinite; for whatever is immortal or incorruptible they called
              divine. This was the doctrine of Anaximander and a number of the
              ancient natural philosophers.

                The last fact (that what is outside is infinite) leads people to
                suppose that body also is infinite, and that there is an
                infinite number of worlds. Why should there be body in one part
                of the void rather than in another? Grant only that mass is

                But the problem of the infinite is difficult: many
                contradictions result whether we suppose it to exist or not to
                exist. If it exists, we have still to ask how it exists; as a
                substance or as the essential attribute of some entity? Or in
                neither way, yet none the less is there something which is
                infinite or some things which are infinitely many? The problem,
                however, which specially belongs to the physicist is to
                investigate whether there is a sensible magnitude which is
                infinite.

                Now it is impossible that the infinite should be a thing which
                is itself infinite, separable from sensible objects. If the
                infinite is neither a magnitude nor an aggregate, but is itself
                a substance and not an attribute, it will be indivisible; for
                the divisible must be either a magnitude or an aggregate. But if
                indivisible, then not infinite, except in the sense (1) in which
                the voice is 'invisible'. But this is not the sense in which it
                is used by those who say that the infinite exists, nor that in
                which we are investigating it, namely as (2) 'that which cannot
                be gone through'. But if the infinite exists as an attribute, it
                would not be, qua infinite an element in substances, any more
                than the invisible would be an element of speech, though the
                voice is invisible.

                It is plain, too, that the infinite cannot be an actual thing
                and a substance and principle. For any part of it that is taken
                will be infinite, if it has parts: for 'to be infinite' and 'the
                infinite' are the same, if it is a substance and not predicated
                of a subject. Hence it will be either indivisible or divisible
                into infinites. But the same thing cannot be many infinites.
                (Yet just as part of air is air, so a part of the infinite would
                be infinite, if it is supposed to be a substance and principle.)
                Therefore the infinite must be without parts and indivisible.
                But this cannot be true of what is infinite in full completion:
                for it must be a definite quantity. Suppose then that infinity
                belongs to substance as an attribute. But, if so, it cannot, as
                we have said, be described as a principle, but rather that of
                which it is an attribute—the air or the even number. Thus the
                view of those who speak after the manner of the Pythagoreans is
                absurd. With the same breath they treat the infinite as
                substance, and divide it into parts. This discussion, however,
                involves the more general question whether the infinite can be
                present in mathematical objects and things which are
                intelligible and do not have extension, as well as among
                sensible objects. Our inquiry (as physicists) is limited to its
                special subject-matter, the objects of sense, and we have to ask
                whether there is or is not among them a body which is infinite
                in the direction of increase.

              infinite at all; hence the infinite exists.

              always included by something else, because we observe that every
              finite reaches into something else. Let a body be pointed out; if
              it be infinite, then the infinite exists; if it be finite, it must
              be terminated at something else, and this latter, if it in turn be
              finite, at something else. We must either proceed thus to infinity
              or come to a body that is infinite. In either case, the infinite
              exists. Hence there can be no end to bodies, if every finite body
              is always included by some other.

              341. The fifth reason is taken from the apprehension of the
              intellect or of the imagination. Hence, he says that that which
              chiefly constitutes the common difficulty which induces men to
              posit the infinite is that the intellect never is exhausted but
              can always add something to any given finite amount. Now the
              earlier philosophers supposed that things corresponded to the
              intellect’s or senses’ apprehension of them; hence because they
              said that whatever appeared to be is true, as stated in
              <i>Metaphysics</i> IV (l.11), they believed that even in reality
              there exists an infinite. Hence number seems to be infinite,
              because the intellect can always create a new number, simply by
              adding unity to a given number. For the same reason mathematical
              magnitudes, which exist in the imagination, seem to be infinite,
              because, given any definite magnitude, we can imagine a greater.
              And for the same reason there seems to be an infinite space beyond
              the heavens, because we can imagine certain dimensions existing
              beyond the heavens to infinity.

              infinitum, totum secundum se consideratum est uniforme: non est
              ergo assignare rationem quare magis in una parte illud spatium sit

              Now if there be infinite space beyond the heavens, it seems that
              there is an infinite body and even infinite worlds. This for two
              reasons. The first is that if the totality of space be considered
              infinite, that totality will be uniform; hence, there is no reason
              why that space should be devoid of body in one part rather than in
              another, Therefore, if there is found in one part of that space
              the bodily magnitude of this world, then there should be found in
              each part of that space some bodily magnitude comparable to that
              of this world. Thus body must be infinite in the same way as space
              or there must even exist infinite worlds, as Democritus supposed.
              Another reason proving the same point is that if there be infinite
              space, it is either empty or full. If it is full, we have our
              point that there is infinite body; but if it is empty, then since
              the empty is a place not filled with a body but capable of being
              so filled, it follows that if space is infinite, there is infinite
              place capable of being filled with body. Thus there must be
              infinite body, because in perpetual matters, there is no
              difference between what can be and what is. Hence, if infinite
              place can be filled with body, it must be admitted that it is
              filled with infinite body. Therefore, it seems necessary to say
              that there is infinite body.

              whether the infinite exists or not. For, on the one hand, many
              impossibilities follow upon holding that it does not; those, for
              example, listed in 337 ff. On the other hand, there are also
              difficulties attendant upon holding that the infinite does exist,
              as will be clear subsequently (no. 345 ff). There is doubt also as
              to its manner of existence. Does it exist as a substance does, or
              as an accident belonging essentially to some nature? Of if neither
              as a substance nor as an essential accident, but as an accident
              nevertheless, is there some infinite continuum and are there
              things infinite in number? Now it very much pertains to the
              philosopher of nature to discuss whether there exists such a thing
              as an infinite sensible magnitude, for a sensible magnitude is a
              natural magnitude.

              For “invisible” is said in three ways: either as denoting 1) what
              of its very nature 13 not apt to be seen, for example, a sound
              which is not in the genus of visible things; or 2) what is
              difficult to see, as what is seen in the dark or from a distance;
              3) what is apt to be seen but is not, as something in total
              darkness. Correspondingly, what of its very nature is not apt to
              be passed over is called “infinite” (for the infinite is the same
              as that which cannot be passed over)—and this is because it
              belongs to the genus of intraversable things, as are indivisibles,
              such as a point and a form; this is the way that a sound was
              called invisible. In a second way, infinity is ascribed to what
              could be passed over but its passage is impossible for us; thus,
              we say that the depth of the sea is infinite; or if it could be
              passed through, it would be with difficulty, as if we should say
              that a trip to India is infinite. Both of these belong to that
              which is “difficultly traversable.” In a third way, infinity is
              ascribed to what is passable but there is no passage to its
              terminus; for example, a line without an end or any other such
              quantity without limits; this is the proper cense of the word
              “infinite.”

              Circa primum ponit tres rationes. Circa quarum primam dicit quod
              impossibile est infinitum esse separatum a sensibilibus, ita quod
              ipsum infinitum sit aliquid per se existens, sicut Platonici
              posuerunt. Quia si ponitur infinitum esse aliquid separatum, aut
              habet aliquam quantitatem (scilicet continuam quae est magnitudo,
              aut discretam quae est multitudo), aut non. Si est substantia sine
              accidente quod est magnitudo vel multitudo, oportet quod infinitum
              sit indivisibile: quia omne divisibile vel est numerus vel
              magnitudo. Si autem aliquid est indivisibile, non erit infinitum
              nisi primo modo, scilicet prout dicitur aliquid infinitum quod non
              est aptum natum transiri, sicut dicitur vox invisibilis: sed hoc
              est praeter intentionem praesentis quaestionis, qua quaerimus de
              infinito, et praeter intentionem eorum qui posuerunt infinitum;
              non enim intenderunt ponere infinitum sicut indivisibile, sed
              sicut intransibile, idest quod natum est transiri et non habet
              transitum.

              With respect to the first he lays down three reasons. As to the
              first of these he says that it is impossible for the infinite to
              be separated from sensible things, in such a way that the infinite
              should be something existing of itself, as the Platonists laid
              down. For if the infinite is laid down as something separated,
              either it has a certain quantity (namely, continuous, which is
              size, or discrete, which is number), or not. If it is a substance
              without either the accident of size or that of number, then the
              infinite must be indivisible—since whatever is divisible is either
              number or size. But if something is indivisible, it will not be
              infinite except in the first way, namely, as something is called
              “infinite” which is not by nature susceptible to being passed
              through, in the same way that a sound is said to be “invisible”
              [as not being by nature susceptible to being seen], but this is
              not what is intended in the present inquiry concerning the
              infinite, nor by those who laid down the infinite. For they did
              not intend to lay down the infinite as something indivisible, but
              as something that could not be passed through, i.e., as being
              susceptible to such, but with the passage having no completion.

              If, however, the infinite should not only be a substance, but also

              principle of existing things will not be infinite as such the

              speech is invisible, although such a thing is an accident of

              346. The second reason [235] is as follows. A passion is less
              separable and able to exist of itself than a subject. But the
              infinite is a passion of size and number—which cannot be separated
              and exist of themselves, as is proved in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>
              [XI, l.10]. Therefore neither can this be so of the infinite.

              If indeed it is divisible, every one of its parts will have to be

              if it is a substance, and is not predicated of any subject as an
              accident, then that which is infinite and the nature of the
              infinite, i.e., the essence and notion of the infinite, will have
              to be the same. For that which is white and the nature of white
              are not the same, but that which is man, and the nature of man,
              are. Whence it will be necessary that the infinite, if it be a
              substance, be either indivisible, or divided into parts which are
              infinite—which is impossible, since it is impossible to compose
              some same thing out of many infinities, as this would involve one
              infinite’s being terminated by another infinite.

              For just as every part of air is air, so too every part of the
              infinite will be infinite, if the infinite is a substance and a
              principle. For if it is a principle, the infinite has to be a
              simple substance, not composed out of differing parts, as in the
              case of man whose every part is not man. Since, therefore, it is
              impossible for every part of some infinite to be infinite, the
              infinite must then be unable to be reduced to parts, and
              indivisible. But what is indivisible cannot be infinite in
              act—since whatever is infinite in act is quantified, and
              everything quantified is divisible. It follows, therefore, that if
              there be any infinite in act, it is not after the manner of
              substance, but has the reason of the accident which is quantity.
              And if this be infinite, it will not be a principle, but that to
              which the infinite occurs, whether it be some sensible substance,
              such as air; or some intelligible substance, such as “even,” as
              the Pythagoreans laid down.

                If, on the other hand, we investigate the question more in
                accordance with principles appropriate to physics, we are led as
                follows to the same result. The infinite body must be either (1)
                compound, or (2) simple; yet neither alternative is possible.
                (1) Compound the infinite body will not be, if the elements are
                finite in number. For they must be more than one, and the
                contraries must always balance, and no one of them can be
                infinite. If one of the bodies falls in any degree short of the
                other in potency—suppose fire is finite in amount while air is
                infinite and a given quantity of fire exceeds in power the same
                amount of air in any ratio provided it is numerically
                definite—the infinite body will obviously prevail over and
                annihilate the finite body. On the other hand, it is impossible
                that each should be infinite. 'Body' is what has extension in
                all directions and the infinite is what is boundlessly extended,
                so that the infinite body would be extended in all directions ad
                infinitum. Nor (2) can the infinite body be one and simple,
                whether it is, as some hold, a thing over and above the elements
                (from which they generate the elements) or is not thus
                qualified. (a) We must consider the former alternative; for
                there are some people who make this the infinite, and not air or
                water, in order that the other elements may not be annihilated
                by the element which is infinite. They have contrariety with
                each other—air is cold, water moist, fire hot; if one were
                infinite, the others by now would have ceased to be. As it is,
                they say, the infinite is different from them and is their
                source. It is impossible, however, that there should be such a
                body; not because it is infinite on that point a general proof
                can be given which applies equally to all, air, water, or
                anything else—but simply because there is, as a matter of fact,
                no such sensible body, alongside the so-called elements.
                Everything can be resolved into the elements of which it is
                composed. Hence the body in question would have been present in
                our world here, alongside air and fire and earth and water: but
                nothing of the kind is observed. (b) Nor can fire or any other
                of the elements be infinite. For generally, and apart from the
                question of how any of them could be infinite, the All, even if
                it were limited, cannot either be or become one of them, as
                Heraclitus says that at some time all things become fire. (The
                same argument applies also to the one which the physicists
                suppose to exist alongside the elements: for everything changes
                from contrary to contrary, e.g. from hot to cold).

              350. He gives therefore [237] two logical reasons. In the first of
              these it is shown that there is no infinite body. For the
              definition of body is that it is determined by a surface, just as
              the definition of a line is that its terms are points. But no body
              determined by a surface is infinite. Therefore, no body is
              infinite, whether it be sensible, i.e., a natural body, or
              intelligible, i.e., a mathematical body. (The word “rational” [or
              dialectical] should be here expounded as “logical” indeed, logic
              is called “rational philosophy.”)

              through by counting. But every number and whatever has a number is
              countable. Therefore, every such thing can be passed over. If,

              common premises. For they do not conclude of necessity: in effect,
              whoever posits an infinite body would not concede that it would of
              its very nature be terminated by a surface, except perhaps
              potentially; although this is probable and well-known. Similarly,
              whoever would posit an infinite multitude would not admit it to be
              a number or that it has a number. For number adds to multitude the
              notion of measure, because a number is “multitude measured by
              unity,” as is said in
              <i>Metaphysics</i> X. For this reason number is considered to be a
              species of discrete quantity, but multitude is not; it is, rather,
              a transcendental.

              In connection with these reasons one must consider that since

              essence from that of the four elements, and the common opinion of
              his time was that it was of the same nature as the four elements,
              he therefore proceeds in these reasonings as though there were no
              other sensible body outside of the four elements. This is in
              keeping with his custom, since he always, before proving that
              which is his own belief, proceeds from what is supposed by the
              common opinion of others. Hence, after he proved in
              <i>De Caelo</i> I (l.4) that the heavens are of another nature
              from the elements, he repeats, for the sake of the certitude of
              the truth, the consideration of the infinite, showing
              unqualifiedly that no sensible body is infinite.

              so, the composition could not endure—for the strongest would

              will equal the fire in energy; and yet air multiplied a hundred
              times is multiplied according to a finite number and is exceeded
              by the power of the whole infinite amount of air. Hence, it is

              energy of infinite air: thus the infinite will excel and corrupt

              infinite, he now proves that neither can a simple body, nor one of
              the elements, nor any medium among the elements(taking vapor as a
              medium between air and water) be infinite. For some posited this
              last as a principle stating other things to be generated from it.
              And they said that this was something infinite, but not air or
              water or any of the other elements; because the other elements
              would be corrupted by whichever one was supposed as infinite. For
              the elements have contrariety one to the other since air is humid,
              water cold, fire hot and earth dry. Hence if one of them were
              infinite, it would destroy the others, since one contrary is
              disposed to be corrupted by another. And that is why they said
              that something other than the elements was infinite, from which,
              as from a principle, the elements arose.

              357. He further shows by a general argument that none of the
              elements can be infinite. For if any of the elements were
              infinite, it would be impossible for the whole universe to be
              anything but that element. It would likewise be necessary that all
              the other elements be changed into it, or to have already been
              changed into it, due to the excess of power of the infinite over
              other things, as Heraclitus says that at some future time all
              things will be converted into fire because of the excelling power
              of fire. And the same reason holds good for one of the elements
              and for come other body that some natural philosophers create
              besides the elements. For it is necessary that this other body
              have contrariety toward the elements, since other things are laid
              down as being generated from it, and change does not take place
              except from one contrary to another, as in the case of going from
              hot to cold, as shown above (I, l.10). This middle body would
              therefore in this way destroy, by reason of its contrariety, the
              other elements.

                Suppose (a) that the infinite sensible body is homogeneous. Then
                each part will be either immovable or always being carried
                along. Yet neither is possible. For why downwards rather than
                upwards or in any other direction? I mean, e.g, if you take a
                clod, where will it be moved or where will it be at rest? For ex
                hypothesi the place of the body akin to it is infinite. Will it
                occupy the whole place, then? And how? What then will be the
                nature of its rest and of its movement, or where will they be?
                It will either be at home everywhere—then it will not be moved;
                or it will be moved everywhere—then it will not come to rest.
                But if (b) the All has dissimilar parts, the proper places of
                the parts will be dissimilar also, and the body of the All will
                have no unity except that of contact. Then, further, the parts
                will be either finite or infinite in variety of kind. (i) Finite
                they cannot be, for if the All is to be infinite, some of them
                would have to be infinite, while the others were not, e.g. fire
                or water will be infinite. But, as we have seen before, such an
                element would destroy what is contrary to it. (This indeed is
                the reason why none of the physicists made fire or earth the one
                infinite body, but either water or air or what is intermediate
                between them, because the abode of each of the two was plainly
                determinate, while the others have an ambiguous place between up
                and down.) But (ii) if the parts are infinite in number and
                simple, their proper places too will be infinite in number, and
                the same will be true of the elements themselves. If that is
                impossible, and the places are finite, the whole too must be
                finite; for the place and the body cannot but fit each other.
                Neither is the whole place larger than what can be filled by the
                body (and then the body would no longer be infinite), nor is the
                body larger than the place; for either there would be an empty
                space or a body whose nature it is to be nowhere.

                own nature. But this is not true: a thing could be somewhere by
                compulsion, and not where it is its nature to be. Even if it is
                true as true can be that the whole is not moved (for what is

                Another difficulty emerges at the same time. Any part of the
                infinite body ought to remain at rest. Just as the infinite
                remains at rest in itself because it fixes itself, so too any

                In general, the view that there is an infinite body is plainly
                incompatible with the doctrine that there is necessarily a
                proper place for each kind of body, if every sensible body has
                either weight or lightness, and if a body has a natural
                locomotion towards the centre if it is heavy, and upwards if it
                is light. This would need to be true of the infinite also. But
                neither character can belong to it: it cannot be either as a
                whole, nor can it be half the one and half the other. For how
                should you divide it? or how can the infinite have the one part
                up and the other down, or an extremity and a centre?

              He proves that this body would be either entirely mobile or
              entirely at rest by the fact that no reason can be given for its
              being moved either up or down or in any direction whatsoever. He
              manifesto this by an example: for let us suppose that the entire
              infinite body which is similar throughout is earth. Then it will
              be impossible to say where any clod of earth should move or be at
              rest, because each part of infinite place would be occupied by
              some body related to it, i.e., of the same species. Can it be said
              that one clod of earth would be moved so as to occupy successively
              all the infinite places, as the sun is moved so as to be in each
              part of the zodiacal circle? And how could one clod of earth pass
              through all the parts of infinite place? Now nothing is moved
              toward the impossible: if therefore it is impossible for a clod of
              earth to be moved so as to occupy all the infinite places, in
              which place will it rest and in which will it be in motion? it

              362. Because someone might not consider this impossible [i.e., an
              infinite body of dissimilar parts], he adds another reason against
              this, saying that if the infinite whole is composed of unlike
              parts, these parts will be either of a finite number of species or
              of an infinite number. It will not be the first, because it then
              follows that if the whole is infinite, then some of the parts will
              be finite and some infinite; otherwise we would be able to get an
              infinite composed all of finites. On this assumption it follows
              that those which are infinite will corrupt the others, on account
              of contrariety, as was said in previous reasoning (nos. 354, 356).
              For this reason, no one of the early philosophers who posited one
              infinite principle, posited it to be fire or earth, which are
              extremes; rather they posited water or air or some medium between
              them, because the places of the former were evident, i.e., above
              and below, but it is not the same with the others, for earth is
              below in respect of them and fire above.

              body with place; for no place is greater than the body it
              contains, nor can a body be infinite if its place is not infinite,
              nor can in any way a body be greater than its place. This is so
              because if the place is greater than the body, there will be some
              empty place; if the body is greater than its place, then some part
              of the body is in no place.

              and says that Anaxagoras claimed that the infinite is at rest but
              gave an invalid reason for its rest. For he said that the infinite
              bears up, i.e., sustains itself since it exists in itself and not
              in something else, for nothing contains it. And thus it could not

              365. Secondly [24R] he disproves this statement with two reasons.
              The first of which is that Anaxagoras so assigned his reason for
              the rest of the infinite as to suppose that wherever a thing is,
              that is its natural place, for the only reason he gave for saying
              that the infinite is at rest, is that it exists in itself. But it
              is not true that where a thing is, there it is always naturally
              disposed to be, because some things are somewhere by force and not
              by nature.

              Quamvis igitur hoc maxime verum sit, quod totum infinitum non

              sed tamen dicendum erat quare non est aptum natum moveri. Non enim

              Now although it is true that an infinite whole is not moved,
              because it is sustained and remains in itself and for that reason
              is immobile, yet a reason should be given why it is not naturally
              disposed to be moved. one cannot evade this simply by saying that
              the infinite is not moved, since by the same reasoning there is
              nothing to prevent any other body from not being moved while it
              might be naturally disposed to be moved. Because oven if earth
              were infinite, just as now it will not be carried further when it
              is in the center, so even then no part in the center would move
              further: but this would not be because it had no other natural
              place except the center where it could be sustained but because it
              does not have a natural aptitude to be moved from the center. If,
              therefore, this is the case with earth, that the reason why it
              rests at the center is not that it is infinite but that it has
              gravity which accounts for its remaining in the center; similarly,
              in the case of any other infinite, the reason why it rests should
              be given, and this is not simply because it is infinite or that it
              supports itself.

              it is clearly impossible to say that there is an actually infinite
              body and that there is some place for each body, if every sensible
              body is either heavy or light, as the ancients said who posited
              the infinite. Because if the body is heavy, it will be naturally
              carried to the center; if it is light, it will be carried upward.
              If, therefore, there be an infinite sensible body, there must be
              in it an “up” and a center. But it is impossible that the infinite
              body should sustain in itself either of these, i.e., either an
              “up” or a center, or even that it sustain both according to
              different centers. For how could the infinite be divided so that
              one part would be “up” and another “down” or how can there be in
              the infinite a boundary or a center? Therefore there is no

              impossible that there be an infinite place because every body is
              in a place, it follows that there can be no infinite body. That an
              infinite place is impossible be proves thus: To be in place and to
              be in some place are convertible, just as to be man and to be some
              man or to be quantity and to be some quantity. Therefore, just as
              it is impossible that there be infinite quantity, because then it
              would follow that some quantity is infinite, e.g., two cubits or
              three cubits, which is impossible, so infinite place is
              impossible, because it would follow that some place is infinite
              (either up or down or some other place), which is impossible—since
              each of these implies a definite term as was said (in 368).

                But the phrase 'potential existence' is ambiguous. When we speak
                of the potential existence of a statue we mean that there will
                be an actual statue. It is not so with the infinite. There will
                not be an actual infinite. The word 'is' has many senses, and we
                say that the infinite 'is' in the sense in which we say 'it is
                day' or 'it is the games', because one thing after another is
                always coming into existence. For of these things too the
                distinction between potential and actual existence holds. We say
                that there are Olympic games, both in the sense that they may
                occur and that they are actually occurring.

                is always being taken after another, and each thing that is
                taken is always finite, but always different. Again, 'being' has
                more than one sense, so that we must not regard the infinite as
                a 'this', such as a man or a horse, but must suppose it to exist
                in the sense in which we speak of the day or the games as
                existing things whose being has not come to them like that of a
                substance, but consists in a process of coming to be or passing

                In a way the infinite by addition is the same thing as the
                infinite by division. In a finite magnitude, the infinite by
                addition comes about in a way inverse to that of the other. For
                in proportion as we see division going on, in the same
                proportion we see addition being made to what is already marked
                off. For if we take a determinate part of a finite magnitude and
                add another part determined by the same ratio (not taking in the
                same amount of the original whole), and so on, we shall not
                traverse the given magnitude. But if we increase the ratio of
                the part, so as always to take in the same amount, we shall
                traverse the magnitude, for every finite magnitude is exhausted
                by means of any determinate quantity however small. The
                infinite, then, exists in no other way, but in this way it does
                exist, potentially and by reduction. It exists fully in the
                sense in which we say 'it is day' or 'it is the games'; and
                potentially as matter exists, not independently as what is
                finite does. By addition then, also, there is potentially an
                infinite, namely, what we have described as being in a sense the
                same as the infinite in respect of division. For it will always
                be possible to take something ab extra.

              (ll.8.9) it is manifest that there is no infinite body in act. It
              is also clear from what has been said (l.7) that if the infinite
              absolutely does not exist, many impossibilities arise. One is that
              time will have a beginning and an end, considered impossible by
              those holding for the eternity of the world. Another is that it
              would follow that a magnitude would not be always divisible into
              further magnitudes, but eventually one would arrive through
              division of magnitudes at certain things which are not magnitudes.
              But every magnitude is divisible. Likewise, it would follow that
              number could not increase to infinity. Since therefore, according
              to what has been said (ll.7-9) neither seems to occur, i.e.,)
              either an infinite in act or no infinite at all, it must be said
              that the infinite somehow is and somehow is not.

              potency. And he says that something is said to be in act and
              something is said to be in potency. Now the infinite is said to
              come about either by addition, as in numbers, or by subtraction,
              as in magnitudes. Now it has been shown that magnitude is not
              infinite in act; hence in magnitudes an infinite through addition
              is not found, but there is found in them an infinite through
              division. For it is easy to destroy the opinion that posits lines
              as indivisibles, or according to another letter, it is easy “to
              divide indivisible lines,” i.e., to show that lines held
              indivisible by some, are divisible. Now the infinite, whether in
              addition or division, is spoken of to the extent of the ability
              [or potency] to add or divide. It therefore follows that the
              infinite is as a being in potency.

              373. Then [256] he shows how the infinite exists in potency. For
              something is found to be in potency in two ways. In one way, in
              the sense that the whole can be reduced to act, as it is possible
              for this bronze to be a statue, because at some time it will be a
              statue. But the infinite in potency is not so meant as that which
              later will be entirely in act. In another way, something is said
              to be in potency in such a way that later it will be in act, not,
              indeed, all at once, but part after part. For there are many ways
              in which a thing is said to be: 1) because the whole exists at the
              same time, as in the case of a man or a house; or 2) because one
              part of it always comes to be after another part, in the way that
              a day is said to exist and a competition exists.

              It is in this latter way that the infinite is said to be at once

              Olympic games, i.e., the festive contests held on Mt. Olympus, are
              said to be and to continue as long as the contests are scheduled
              and as long as the schedule is being carried out. For as long as
              those games lasted, one part of the schedule was taking place at
              the time and another was to take place later.

              375. Secondly [252] he shows what is common to all infinites,
              saying in all of them it is universally found that the infinite
              consists in always taking one thing followed by another according
              to some certain succession, in such away that the whole of
              whatever is taken, be finite. Hence one must not suppose the
              infinite to be some whole existing all at once, as a substance
              that can be pointed out, e.g., a man or a house. Rather the
              infinite must be taken as in the case of successive things, such
              as a day or a tournament, whose existence is not that of a perfect
              substance actually existing as a complete whole all at once. Now,
              in generation and corruption, even though the process continue to
              infinity, whatever is taken in act is finite. For in the whole
              course of generation, even should it proceed to infinity, both all
              the men existing at a given time are finite in number, and this
              finite amount must be taken as other and other, accordingly as men
              succeed one another in time.

              For example, from a line of one cubit we may take one half, and
              from the remainder one-half again. We can proceed in this process
              to infinity. For the same proportion will be maintained in
              subtracting, but not the same amount of what is subtracted. The
              half of the half is less, according to quantity, than the half of
              the whole. But if we were to take away always the same amount, the
              proportion taken away would be continually growing. For example,
              if from a quantity of ten cubits, we take away one cubit, the
              ratio of the part removed to the original is one-tenth. If we take
              from the remainder another inch, the ratio between the part
              removed and that which remains will be in a greater proportion
              [i.e., one-ninth]. For one cubit is less exceeded by 9 than by 10.
              Just as, by preserving the same proportion throughout, the
              quantity subtracted is continually smaller, so, by taking away the
              same amount each time, the proportion gets continually larger. If,
              therefore, by so subtracting from some finite magnitude, we
              continually increase the proportion by taking away the same
              amount, the original magnitude will be exhausted. For example, if
              from a line of 10 cubits we always subtract one cubit. This will
              happen because every finite thing will be exhausted by continually
              removing the same finite amount.

              division, there will exist some given finite quantity which will
              never be gone through. Take two magnitudes each of 10 cubits, and
              a third one of 20 cubits. If what I subtract to infinity from one
              magnitude of 10 cubits, always taking a half, is added to the
              other, which is also of 10 cubits, I shall never reach, by adding
              to infinity, the measure of the quantity of 20 cubits, since as
              much as remains in the quantity being divided will be lacking from
              the given measure in the quantity being added to.

              Dicit ergo primo quod ex quo appositio in infinitum non facit
              transcendere omnem determinatam quantitatem, non est possibile

              videmus, ponunt quod est quoddam infinitum, cuius substantia est
              aer vel aliquid aliud huiusmodi. Si ergo non est possibile esse
              corpus sensibile actu infinitum, ut ostensum est, sequitur quod
              non sit potentia in natura ad appositionem transcendentem omnem

              He says therefore first [256] that since addition to infinity
              never actually transcends every determined quantity, it is not
              possible, even in potency, to transcend every determined quantity
              by addition. For if there were in nature potency for addition
              transcending every quantity, it would follow that something
              actually infinite exists; such an infinite would be an accident of
              some nature, in the same way that the natural philosophers posit,
              outside the world we see, some sort of infinite, whose substance
              is air or something similar. But if, as was shown (ll.8,9), no
              infinite sensible body exists in act, it follows that there is in
              nature no potency to transcend every magnitude by addition, but
              only a potency to the infinite addition which is in contrast to
              [and derived from] division, as was said above (no. 379).

              381. Then [257] he confirms what he has said by a dictum of Plato,
              saying that because the infinite resulting from the addition of
              magnitudes is the reverse of division, Plato therefore posited two
              infinites: “the large,” which pertains to addition, and “the
              small,” which pertains to division—for the finite seems to excel
              both by addition unto increase, and by division unto decrease or
              towards nothing. Yet although Plato makes two infinites, he does
              not use them. For in number, which he posited to be the substance
              of all things, there is no infinite by division since there is
              among them something smallest, which is unity; nor is there
              according to him an infinite according by addition, since he said
              that the species of number vary only up to ten and then a return
              is made to unity when we count eleven, twelve, and so on.

                This is indicated by the fact that rings also that have no bezel
                are described as 'endless', because it is always possible to
                take a part which is outside a given part. The description
                depends on a certain similarity, but it is not true in the full
                sense of the word. This condition alone is not sufficient: it is
                necessary also that the next part which is taken should never be
                the same. In the circle, the latter condition is not satisfied:
                it is only the adjacent part from which the new part is

                what has been already taken.

                for it is from this they get the dignity they ascribe to the
                infinite—its containing all things and holding the all in
                itself—from its having a certain similarity to the whole. It is
                in fact the matter of the completeness which belongs to size,
                and what is potentially a whole, though not in the full sense.
                It is divisible both in the direction of reduction and of the
                inverse addition. It is a whole and limited; not, however, in
                virtue of its own nature, but in virtue of what is other than
                it. It does not contain, but, in so far as it is infinite, is
                contained. Consequently, also, it is unknowable, qua infinite;

              He shows therefore first by an example that the infinite is “that
              beyond which there is always something.” For some people say that
              a ring is infinite since, because it has a circular direction, one
              can always take part after part. But this is to speak analogously
              and not properly, because to be infinite requires this, namely,
              that beyond whatever part is taken there be some other part, in
              such a way, nevertheless, that one never take again a part taken
              previously. But in a circle this does not happen, because the part
              which is counted after another happens to be different from that
              immediately before it, but not from all the parts previously
              counted, because one part can be counted any number of times, as
              is evident in a circular motion. Therefore, if rings are called
              infinite according to this analogy, it follows that that which is
              truly infinite is something which always has something beyond, if
              one were to measure its quantity. For it is impossible to measure
              the quantity of the infinite; but if someone should desire to
              reckon it, he would take part after part to infinity, as said
              above.

              385. Then [260] he proves that the definition of the earlier
              philosophers is since “that outside of which there is nothing” is
              a definition of the perfect and a whole thing. Here is his proof.
              Every whole is defined as “that to which nothing to lacking”—as we
              speak of a whole man, or of a whole box, if they lack nothing
              which they ought to have. And just as we speak thus in regard to
              some individual whole, as in the case of this or that particular,
              so too this notion holds in regard to what is truly and perfectly
              whole, namely, that outside of which there is absolutely nothing.
              But when something is lacking through the absence of something
              intrinsic, then such a thing is not a whole.

              So it is evident that this is the definition of a whole: “a whole
              is that nothing of which is outside of it.” But a whole thing and
              a perfect thing are either entirely the same or of a proximate
              nature. He says this, because “whole” is not found in simple
              things which have no parts; in which things, nevertheless, we use
              the word “perfect.” This shows that the perfect is “that which has
              nothing of itself outside of it.” But nothing that lacks an end is
              perfect, because the end is the perfection of each thing. For the
              end is the term of that of which it is the end. Nothing infinite,
              therefore, and unterminated, is perfect. Hence the definition of
              the perfect as that, namely, which has nothing of itself outside
              itself, does not apply to the infinite.

              386. Then [261] he draws a conclusion from the foregoing. Since
              the definition of a “whole” does not apply to the infinite, it is
              clear that the position of Parmenides is better than that of
              Melissus. For Melissus said that the whole universe was infinite.
              Parmenides said the whole is terminated by what is “striving
              equally from the middle,” by which he designated the body of the
              universe as spherical. For in a spherical figure, lines from the
              center to the term, i.e., the circumference, are drawn according
              to equality, as though “striving equally” with each other. And it
              is rightly stated that the whole universe is finite, for to be a
              whole and to be infinite are not reciprocally connected, i.e., not
              continuous as thread follows thread in spinning. For there was a
              proverb that things which follow one upon the other should be said
              to be continuous as thread following thread.

              He says therefore first that because some thought that whole and
              infinite were mutually connected, they consequently took it as a
              “dignity” [axium], i.e., something self-evident, that the infinite
              contains all things and that it has all things in itself. This was
              due to the fact that the infinite has a likeness to a whole, as
              what is in potency has a likeness to act. For the infinite,
              inasmuch as it is in potency, is as matter in respect to the
              perfection of magnitude, and it is as a whole in potency, not as a
              whole in act. This is proved by the fact that the infinite is
              based on the possibility of dividing things into what is smaller
              and of making, by a contrasting division, continual additions, as
              was said above (l.10). Consequently, the infinite in itself,
              according to its proper nature, is a whole in potency only; and it
              is something imperfect, comparable to matter not having
              perfection.

              the infinite, as such, is unknown, because it is as matter without
              species, i.e., form, and matter is not known except through form.
              The other conclusion, which has the same source, is that the
              infinite has more the notion of a part than that of a whole, since
              matter is compared to the whole as a part. And it is not a
              surprise that the infinite conducts itself as a part, inasmuch as

                It is natural too to suppose that in number there is a limit in
                the direction of the minimum, and that in the other direction
                every assigned number is surpassed. In magnitude, on the
                contrary, every assigned magnitude is surpassed in the direction
                of smallness, while in the other direction there is no infinite
                magnitude. The reason is that what is one is indivisible
                whatever it may be, e.g. a man is one man, not many. Number on
                the other hand is a plurality of 'ones' and a certain quantity
                of them. Hence number must stop at the indivisible: for 'two'
                and 'three' are merely derivative terms, and so with each of the

                But in the direction of largeness it is always possible to think
                of a larger number: for the number of times a magnitude can be
                bisected is infinite. Hence this infinite is potential, never
                actual: the number of parts that can be taken always surpasses
                any assigned number. But this number is not separable from the
                process of bisection, and its infinity is not a permanent
                actuality but consists in a process of coming to be, like time
                and the number of time.

                With magnitudes the contrary holds. What is continuous is
                divided ad infinitum, but there is no infinite in the direction
                of increase. For the size which it can potentially be, it can

                of increase, in the sense of the untraversable. In point of fact
                they do not need the infinite and do not use it. They postulate
                only that the finite straight line may be produced as far as

                the largest quantity another magnitude of any size you like.
                Hence, for the purposes of proof, it will make no difference to

              391. It was said above (no. 379) that addition to infinity in
              magnitudes takes place in such a way that the resulting magnitude
              does not become greater than any given magnitude. But division to
              infinity in magnitudes results in reaching a quantity that is
              smaller than any pre-assigned quantity, as was expounded above
              (no. 379). However, he states [264] that this occurs reasonably,
              for since the infinite is like matter it is contained within just
              as matter is, while that which contains is the species and form.
              Now it is clear from what was said in Book II (l.5) that the whole
              is like form and the parts are like matter. Since, therefore, the
              division of a magnitude proceeds from the whole to the parts, it
              is reasonable that no limit be found there which is not
              transcended through infinite division. But the process of addition
              goes from the parts to the whole, which is like a form that
              contains and terminates; hence it is reasonable that there be some
              definite quantity which infinite addition does not exceed.

              392. Then [267] he explains infinity in numbers by comparison to
              magnitudes. For it was said that in number there is a smallest
              terminus below which division does not go; but there is no maximum
              limit which it cannot exceed, because it is possible through
              addition to exceed any given number. The opposite however takes
              place in magnitudes, as was said (no. 391). The reason why is
              because every unity, inasmuch as it is a unity, is indivisible, as
              indivisible man is one man and not many men. Now every number can
              be resolved into unity, as is evident from the nature of number.
              For number signifies that there are more things than one, and any
              plurality exceeding one to a greater or lesser degree constitutes
              a definite species of number. Hence, since unity pertains to the
              notion of number and indivisibility pertains to the notion of
              unity, It follows that the division of number should halt at an
              indivisible terminus.

              reason that magnitude is divided to infinity. For it is plain that
              division causes multitude; hence the more magnitude is divided the
              greater is the multitude that results, and upon the infinite
              division of magnitudes there follows the infinite addition of
              numbers. Therefore just as infinite division of magnitude is not
              in act but in potency, and exceeds every determinate quantity in

              the notion of measure. And this number can grow to infinity, just
              as magnitude is divisible to infinity. But the multitude which
              arises from formal division cannot grow to infinity. For the
              species of things are determined, just as there is a determined
              quantity of the universe. That is why he says that the number
              which grows to infinity is not separated from the division of the
              continuum. Nor is this number infinite in the sense of something
              permanent. Rather it is as something always in a state of
              becoming, inasmuch as, to any given number, additions may be
              successively made, as is evident in the case of time and the
              number of time. For the number of time increases successively by
              the addition of day to day but not all days existed at once.

              For although a continuum be divided to infinity, as was said (nos.
              393,394), the size cannot grow indefinitely even potentially. For
              as great as a thing is in potency, so great can it be in act. If,
              therefore, it were in the potency of nature that a magnitude grow
              to infinity, it would follow that there would actually be some
              infinite sensible magnitude—which is false, as stated (ll.8.9).
              The consequence is, therefore, that addition of magnitudes cannot
              go on to infinity so as to exceed every pre-determined quantity;
              for otherwise there would be something greater than the heavens.

              prime matter there is a potency only to determined quantity. It Is
              plain also from the foregoing why number does not have to be as
              great in act as it is potentially, as is said here of magnitude:
              for addition occurs in number as a consequence of the division of
              the continuum, by which one passes from a whole to what is in
              potency to number. Hence one need not arrive at some act
              terminating the potency. But the addition of magnitudes arrives at

              namely, that potency to addition in magnitude is in one and the
              same magnitude but the potency to addition in numbers is in
              various numbers inasmuch as to any number something can be added.
              But this reason has little value because just as addition produces
              varying species of number, so also varying species of measure, as,
              for example, “two cubits long” and “three cubits long” are called
              species of quantity. Moreover, whatever is added to a higher
              number is added to the lower. Accordingly, there is in one and the
              same number, e.g., two or three, a potency to infinite addition.

              the mathematicians, who use the infinite, as, for example, when

              need for their demonstrations the infinite in act, nor do they use

              their needs, so as to be able to subtract from it so much as they
              wish. For their purpose it is enough that there exist some maximum

              above (l. 10), but that was in act, as things are that are finite

              401. Then [272] he solves the five reasons cited above (l.7) as
              proving that the infinite exists. And first he solves the one
              based on the fact of generation. For it concluded that if
              generation does not cease, then the infinite must be. Now this
              argument concludes truly insofar as the infinite is in a potency
              that is successively reduced to act. But it is not necessary that
              there be some sensible body which is infinite in act, in order to
              account for generation not ceasing, as the earlier philosophers
              supposed when they said that generation continues to infinity,
              supposing it to take place by extracting from some body, with the
              consequence that the process could not be infinite unless that
              body were infinite. But this is not necessary: for even supposing
              the whole of sensible body as finite, generation can endure ad
              infinitum by the fact that the corruption of one thing is the
              generation of another.

              402. Then [273] he solves the argument based on the principle of
              contact, as though it were necessary for every finite body to
              touch some other body and so on to infinity. But he solves this by
              saying that it is one thing to be “touched” and another to be
              “terminated”, because to be “touched” and “enclosed” are said in
              respect to something else, for whatever touches, touches something
              else. To be “terminated,” however, is said absolutely and does not
              imply a relationship to something else, because a thing is made
              finite in itself by its own terminations. For it is incidental to
              the finite that it be touching something. Nevertheless, neither is
              it necessary that everything touched by something should touch
              something else and that this go on to infinity. Hence it is
              evident that this argument does not conclude anything of
              necessity.

              the imagination, which latter the ancients did not distinguish
              from the intellect. This argument above (l.7) concluded that there
              was outside the universe an infinite space, and consequently a
              place and a body. But it is incorrect to “trust to thought,” i.e.,
              believe that whatever is apprehended by the imagination or
              intellect is true, as some of the ancients thought, whose opinion
              is refuted in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV. For if I apprehend a thing as
              smaller or larger than it is, it does not thereby follow that
              there is such an abundance or defect in the object itself but only
              in the apprehension of the intellect or imagination. For one might
              understand some man to be a multiple of himself, i.e., two or
              three times larger than he really if, or any other amount to
              infinity, yet there will not be because of this a corresponding
              multiplication of him outside the intellect or outside a definite
              quantity or magnitude.

              in such a manner. Then [275] he solves the difficulty based on
              time and motion. And he says that time and motion are not infinite
              in act, because nothing of time is actual but the “now,” and
              nothing of motion is actual except a kind of indivisible. But the
              intellect apprehends a continuity in time and in motion by
