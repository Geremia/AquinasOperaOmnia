          <td>Quaestio est de verbo. Et primo quaeritur utrum verbum proprie dicatur in divinis.
          <td><b>Difficulties</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et videtur quod non.
          <td>It seems that there cannot be, for
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Est enim duplex verbum, scilicet interius et exterius. Exterius autem de Deo proprie dici non potest, cum sit corporale et transiens; similiter nec verbum interius, quod Damascenus definiens, dicit, in II libro: sermo interius dispositus est motus animae in excogitativo fiens, sine aliqua enuntiatione. In Deo autem non potest poni nec motus nec cogitatio, quae discursu quodam perficitur. Ergo videtur quod verbum nullo modo proprie dicatur in divinis.
          <td>1. There are two kinds of words: exterior and interior. An exterior word cannot be predicated properly of God since it is material and passing. Nor can an interior word be predicated of God, for Damascene defines it as follows: “Speech that is internally expressed is a motion of the soul, produced in the process of thinking, and not orally enunciated.” Now, motion or a process of thinking cannot be said to exist in God. Hence, it seems that there cannot be a word, properly speaking, in Him.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus in XV de Trinit. probat, quod verbum quoddam est ipsius mentis, ex hoc quod etiam eius aliquod os esse dicitur, ut patet Matth., XV, 11: quae procedunt de ore, haec coinquinant hominem; quod de ore cordis intelligendum esse ostenditur ex his quae sequuntur: quae autem procedunt de ore, de corde exeunt. Sed os non dicitur nisi metaphorice in spiritualibus rebus. Ergo nec verbum.
          <td>2. Augustine proves that some word belongs to the mind, because something is also said to be the mouth of the mind, as is evident in the Gospel according to St. Matthew (15:18): “But the things which proceed out of the mouth... these defile a man.” That this means the mouth of the heart is clear from what follows: “But the things which proceed out of the mouth, come forth from the heart” (15:18). Now, a mouth cannot be predicated of spiritual things except metaphorically. Hence, neither can a word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, verbum ostenditur esse medium inter creatorem et creaturas, ex hoc quod Ioan. I, 3, dicitur: omnia per ipsum facta sunt; et ex hoc ipso probat Augustinus, quod verbum non est creatura. Ergo eadem ratione potest probari quod verbum non sit creator; ergo verbum nihil ponit quod sit in Deo.
          <td>3. That the Word is a medium between the creator and creatures is shown from St. John (1:3) where we read: “All things were made by him.” From this passage, Augustine proves that the Word is not a creature. Using the same proof, we can show that the Word is not the creator. Consequently, the Word affirms nothing which is in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, medium aequaliter distat ab extremis. Si igitur verbum medium est inter patrem dicentem et creaturam quae dicitur, oportet quod verbum per essentiam distinguatur a patre, cum per essentiam a creaturis distinguatur. Sed in divinis non est aliquid per essentiam distinctum. Ergo verbum non proprie ponitur in Deo.
          <td>4. A medium is equidistant from extremes. Now, if the Word is the medium between the Father who utters and the creature which is uttered, the Word should be essentially distinct from the Father, since He is essentially distinct from creatures. But there is nothing in the divine Persons which is distinguished by the divine essence. Hence, a word, properly speaking, cannot be in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quidquid non convenit filio nisi secundum quod est incarnatus, hoc non proprie dicitur in divinis; sicut esse hominem, vel ambulare, aut aliquid huiusmodi. Sed ratio verbi non convenit filio nisi secundum quod est incarnatus, quia ratio verbi est ex hoc quod manifestat dicentem; filius autem non manifestat patrem nisi secundum quod est incarnatus, sicut nec verbum nostrum manifestat intellectum nostrum nisi secundum quod est voci unitum. Ergo verbum non dicitur proprie in divinis.
          <td>5. Whatever belongs to the Son in so far as He is incarnate is not properly predicated of God, as, for example, to be man, to walk, or anything of this sort. But being the Word belongs to the Son only in so far as He is incarnate, because it is the nature of a word to manifest the one who is speaking. The Son, however, manifests the Father only in so far as the Son is incarnate, just as our words manifest our understanding only in so far as they are expressed vocally. Hence, a word, properly speaking, does not exist in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, si verbum proprie esset in divinis, idem esset verbum quod fuit ab aeterno apud patrem, et quod est ex tempore incarnatum, sicut dicimus quod est idem filius. Sed hoc, ut videtur, dici non potest; quia verbum incarnatum comparatur verbo vocis, verbum autem apud patrem existens, verbo mentis, ut patet per Augustinum in Lib. de Trinit.: non est autem idem verbum cum voce prolatum, et verbum in corde existens. Ergo non videtur quod verbum quod ab aeterno dicitur apud patrem fuisse, proprie ad naturam divinam pertineat.
          <td>6. If the Word, properly speaking, existed in God, the Word existing eternally in the Father and that which was made Incarnate in time would be the same—just as we say that it is the same Son. But it seems that we cannot say this, because the Incarnate Word is compared to a word vocally expressed; the Word existing in the Father, however, is compared to a mental word. This is clear from what Augustine has written. Now, the word that is vocally expressed is not the same as that existing in the heart. Therefore, it does not seem that the Word which is said to have existed eternally in the Father properly pertains to the divine nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, quanto effectus est posterior, tanto magis habet rationem signi, sicut vinum est causa finalis dolii, et ulterius circuli, qui appenditur ad dolium designandum; unde circulus maxime habet rationem signi. Sed verbum quod est in voce, est effectus postremus ab intellectu progrediens. Ergo ei magis convenit ratio signi quam conceptui mentis; et similiter etiam ratio verbi, quod a manifestatione imponitur. Omne autem quod per prius est in corporalibus quam in spiritualibus, non proprie dicitur de Deo. Ergo verbum non proprie dicitur de ipso.
          <td>7. The later in a series an effect occurs, the more does it have the nature of a sign. For example, wine is the final cause of a wine jar, and, more remotely, of the circular tag which is attached to the jar as a marker; for this reason, the tag is more truly a sign than the jar is. Now, a word that is vocally expressed is the last effect of the procession from the intellect. Consequently, the nature of a sign belongs to the vocal word more than to the mental concept, and, similarly, the nature of a word belongs more to the external expression from the fact that it manifests something. Now, whatever exists in its primary sense in material things and not in spiritual things is not properly predicated of God. Therefore, a word cannot be properly predicated of God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, unumquodque nomen illud praecipue significat a quo imponitur. Sed hoc nomen verbum imponitur vel a verberatione aeris, vel a boatu, secundum quod verbum nihil est aliud quam verum boans. Ergo hoc est quod praecipue significatur nomine verbi. Sed hoc nullo modo convenit Deo nisi metaphorice. Ergo verbum non proprie dicitur in divinis.
          <td>8. Every noun especially signifies that from which it has been derived. But <i>verbum</i> (word) is derived either from <i>verberatio aeris</i> (a disturbing of the air) or from <i>boatus</i> (shout), so that <i>verbum</i> means simply <i>verum boans</i> (shouting what is true). Hence, this is what is especially signified by the noun <i>verbum.</i> Now, this cannot be said to be in God except metaphorically. Therefore, a word, properly speaking, is not in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, verbum alicuius dicentis videtur esse similitudo rei dictae in dicente. Sed pater intelligens se, non intelligit se per similitudinem, sed per essentiam. Ergo videtur quod ex hoc quod intuetur se, non generet aliquod verbum sui. Sed nihil est aliud dicere summo spiritui quam cogitando intueri, ut Anselmus dicit. Ergo verbum non proprie dicitur in divinis.
          <td>9. The word that one says seems to be a likeness of the thing spoken, existing in the speaker. But when the Father knows Himself, He knows Himself not by means of a likeness, but by means of His essence. Consequently, it seems that by intuiting Himself the Father does not generate any word of Himself. “Now, with reference to the Highest Spirit, <i>to speak</i> means simply to intuit in thought,” as Anselm says. Hence, a word, properly speaking, does not exist in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, omne quod dicitur de Deo ad similitudinem creaturae, non dicitur de eo proprie, sed metaphorice. Sed verbum in divinis dicitur ad similitudinem verbi quod est in nobis, ut Augustinus dicit. Ergo videtur quod metaphorice, et non proprie, in divinis dicatur.
          <td>10. Whenever anything resembling a creature is predicated of God, it is not predicated of Him properly, but only metaphorically. Now, as Augustine says, the Word in God resembles the word which is in us. Hence, it seems that a word can be predicated of God metaphorically, but not properly.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Basilius dicit, quod Deus dicitur verbum, secundum quod eo omnia proferuntur; sapientia, quo omnia cognoscuntur; lux, quo omnia manifestantur. Sed proferre non proprie dicitur in Deo, quia prolatio ad vocem pertinet. Ergo verbum non proprie dicitur in divinis.
          <td>11. Basil says that God is called the Word because all things are uttered by Him, and that He is called the wisdom by which all things are known, and the light by which all things are made manifest. However, to utter is not properly predicated of God, because uttering pertains to the voice. Consequently, word is not predicated of God in its proper sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, sicut se habet verbum vocis ad verbum incarnatum, ita verbum mentis ad verbum aeternum, ut per Augustinum patet. Sed verbum vocis non dicitur de verbo incarnato nisi metaphorice. Ergo nec verbum interius dicitur de verbo aeterno nisi metaphorice.
          <td>12. The vocal word is related to the Incarnate Word as the mental word is related to the eternal Word. This is clear from Augustine.” The vocal word, however, is predicated only metaphorically of the Word Incarnate. Hence, the interior word is also predicated only metaphorically of the eternal Word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Sed contra.
          <td><b>To the Contrary</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Augustinus dicit in IX de Trinitate: verbum quod insinuare intendimus, cum amore notitia est. Sed notitia et amor proprie dicuntur in divinis. Ergo et verbum.
          <td>1. Augustine says: “The Word which we are trying to make you understand is knowledge with love.” Now, knowledge and love are predicated of God in their proper sense. Hence, so is the Word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Augustinus in XV de Trinitate dicit: verbum quod foris sonat, signum est verbi quod intus lucet, cui magis verbi competit nomen: nam illud quod profertur carnis ore, vox verbi est; verbumque et ipsum dicitur propter illud a quo, ut foris appareret, assumptum est. Ex quo patet quod nomen verbi magis proprie dicitur de verbo spirituali quam de corporali. Sed omne illud quod magis proprie invenitur in spiritualibus quam in corporalibus, propriissime Deo competit. Ergo verbum propriissime in Deo dicitur.
          <td>2. Augustine says: “The word which is heard exteriorly is a sign of the word shining within; and to this latter the name <i>word</i> more properly belongs. For the vocalization of the word by a physical mouth is merely the voice of the word; and it also is called a word because of that from which it has been taken in order that the interior word might itself appear externally. It is clear from this that the term <i>word</i> belongs more properly to the spiritual than to the material word. Now, whatever is found more properly in spiritual things than in material things most properly belongs to God. Therefore, word is predicated of God in its most proper sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, Richardus de sancto Victore dicit quod verbum est manifestativum sensus alicuius sapientis. Sed filius verissime manifestat sensum patris. Ergo nomen verbi propriissime in Deo dicitur.
          <td>3. Richard of St. Victor says that a word manifests the meaning of one who is wise. But the Son manifests the meaning of the Father in the truest way possible. Hence, word is predicated of God in the most proper sense.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, verbum, secundum Augustinum in XV de Trinit., nihil est aliud quam cogitatio formata. Sed divina consideratio nunquam est formabilis, sed semper formata, quia semper est in suo actu. Ergo propriissime dicitur verbum in divinis.
          <td>4. According to Augustine, the word is “thought, fully formed.” Now, God’s contemplation is never capable of formation, but is always fully formed, since it is always in act. Consequently, a word, in the most proper sense, is predicated of God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, inter modos unius, illud quod est simplicissimum, primo et maxime proprie dicitur unum. Ergo et similiter in verbo, quod est maxime simplex, propriissime dicitur verbum. Sed verbum quod est in Deo, est simplicissimum. Ergo propriissime dicitur verbum.
          <td>51. Among the types of oneness, that which is most simple is called one primarily and most properly. The same is true of a word—that which is most simple is called a word in the most proper sense. Now, the Word that is in God is most simple; hence, it is most properly called a word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Praeterea, secundum grammaticos, haec pars orationis quae verbum dicitur, ideo sibi commune nomen appropriat, quia est perfectio totius orationis, quasi praecipua pars ipsius; et quia per verbum manifestantur aliae partes orationis, secundum quod in verbo intelligitur nomen. Sed verbum divinum est perfectissimum inter omnes res, et est etiam manifestativum rerum. Ergo propriissime verbum dicitur.
          <td>6. According to grammarians, the part of speech called the verb receives this general name <i>verbum</i> as its own because it is a perfection of the entire sentence, and is, as it were, the most important part of it. Moreover, other parts of the sentence are expressed by the verb, since the noun is understood in it. Now, the divine Word <i>(Verbum) is</i> the most perfect of all things and expresses all things. Therefore, it is called a word in the most proper sense.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Dicendum, quod nomina imponuntur a nobis secundum quod cognitionem de rebus accipimus. Et quia ea quae sunt posteriora in natura, sunt ut plurimum prius nota nobis, inde est quod frequenter secundum nominis impositionem, aliquod nomen prius in aliquo duorum invenitur in quorum altero per nomen significata res prius existit; sicut patet de nominibus quae dicuntur de Deo et creaturis, ut ens, bonum, et huiusmodi, quae prius fuerunt creaturis imposita, et ex his ad divinam praedicationem translata, quamvis esse et bonum per prius inveniatur in Deo.
          <td>We give names to things according to the manner in which we receive our knowledge from things. Hence, since those things which come after others in the order of nature are usually the ones that we know first, it frequently happens that, in applying names to things, we first use a name of one of two things when the reality it signifies primarily exists in the second. We have a clear example of this in the names that are used of both God and creatures. <i>Being, good,</i> and words of this sort are first applied to creatures, and then transferred from creatures to God, even though the act of existence and the good arc found primarily in God.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo, quia verbum exterius, cum sit sensibile, est magis notum nobis quam interius secundum nominis impositionem, per prius vocale verbum dicitur verbum quam verbum interius, quamvis verbum interius naturaliter sit prius, utpote exterioris causa et efficiens et finalis.
          <td>Consequently, since the exterior word is sensible, it is more known to us than the interior word; hence, according to the application of the term, the vocal word is meant before the interior word, even though the interior word is naturally prior, being the efficient and final cause of the exterior.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Finalis quidem, quia verbum vocale ad hoc a nobis exprimitur, ut interius verbum manifestetur: unde oportet quod verbum interius sit illud quod significatur per exterius verbum. Verbum autem quod exterius profertur, significat id quod intellectum est, non ipsum intelligere, neque hoc intellectum qui est habitus vel potentia, nisi quatenus et haec intellecta sunt: unde verbum interius est ipsum interius intellectum. Efficiens autem, quia verbum prolatum exterius, cum sit significativum ad placitum, eius principium est voluntas, sicut et ceterorum artificiatorum; et ideo, sicut aliorum artificiatorum praeexistit in mente artificis imago quaedam exterioris artificii, ita in mente proferentis verbum exterius, praeexistit quoddam exemplar exterioris verbi.
          <td>It is the final cause, indeed, because we use the exterior word to manifest the interior. Hence, the interior word is that which is expressed by the exterior. Moreover, the exterior word signifies that which is understood, not the act of understanding, nor the habit or faculty, as the objects of understanding, unless the habit and the faculty are themselves the things that are understood. Consequently, the interior word is what is understood interiorly. Again, the interior word is the efficient cause of the word spoken exteriorly, for, since the meaning of a word is arbitrary, its principle is the will—just as the will is the principle of other products. Moreover, just as there preexists in the mind of a craftsman a certain image of his external work, so also does there pre-exist in the mind of one who pronounces an exterior word a certain archetype of it.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et ideo, sicut in artifice tria consideramus, scilicet finem artificii, et exemplar ipsius, et ipsum artificium iam productum, ita et in loquente triplex verbum invenitur: scilicet id quod per intellectum concipitur, ad quod significandum verbum exterius profertur: et hoc est verbum cordis sine voce prolatum; item exemplar exterioris verbi, et hoc dicitur verbum interius quod habet imaginem vocis; et verbum exterius expressum, quod dicitur verbum vocis. Et sicut in artifice praecedit intentio finis, et deinde sequitur excogitatio formae artificiati, et ultimo artificiatum in esse producitur; ita verbum cordis in loquente est prius verbo quod habet imaginem vocis, et postremum est verbum vocis.
          <td>Consequently, just as we consider three things in the case of a craftsman, namely, the purpose of his work, its model, and the work now produced, so also do we find a threefold word in one who is speaking. There is the word conceived by the intellect, which, in turn, is signified by an exterior vocal word. The former is called <i>the word of the heart,</i> uttered but not vocalized. Then there is that upon which the exterior word is modeled; and this is called <i>the interior word</i> which has an image of the vocal word. Finally, there is the word expressed exteriorly, and this is called <i>the vocal word. Now,</i> just as a craftsman first intends his end, then thinks out the form of his product, and finally brings it into existence, so also, in one who is speaking, the word of the heart comes first, then the word which has an image of the oral word, and, finally, he utters the vocal word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Verbum igitur vocis, quia corporaliter expletur, de Deo non potest dici nisi metaphorice: prout scilicet ipsae, creaturae, a Deo productae verbum eius dicuntur, aut motus ipsarum, inquantum designant intellectum divinum, sicut effectus causam. Unde, eadem ratione, nec verbum quod habet imaginem vocis, poterit dici de Deo proprie, sed metaphorice tantum; ut sic dicantur verbum Dei ideae rerum faciendarum. Sed verbum cordis, quod nihil est aliud quam id quod actu consideratur per intellectum, proprie de Deo dicitur, quia est omnino remotum a materialitate et corporeitate et omni defectu; et huiusmodi proprie dicuntur de Deo, sicut scientia et scitum, intelligere et intellectum.
          <td>Now, because the vocal word is expressed by means of a body, such a word cannot be predicated of God except metaphorically, that is, only in the sense in which creatures or their motions, being produced by God, are said to be His word inasmuch as they are signs of the divine intellect as effects are signs of their cause. For the same reason, the word which has an image of the vocal word cannot be properly predicated of God, but only metaphorically. Consequently, His ideas of things to be made are called the Word of God only metaphorically. But the word of the heart—that which is actually considered by the intellect—is predicated properly of God, because it is entirely free of matter, corporeity, and all defects; and such things are properly predicated of God, for example, knowledge and the known, understanding and the understood.

          <td><b>Answers to Difficulties</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod cum verbum interius sit id quod intellectum est, nec hoc sit in nobis nisi secundum quod actu intelligimus, verbum interius semper requirit intellectum in actu suo, qui est intelligere. Ipse autem actus intellectus motus dicitur, non quidem imperfecti, ut describitur in III Phys.; sed motus perfecti, qui est operatio ut dicitur in III de anima; et ideo Damascenus dixit, verbum interius esse motum mentis, ut tamen accipiatur motus pro eo ad quod motus terminatur, id est operatio pro operato, sicut intelligere pro intellecto.<br>
          Nec hoc requiritur ad rationem verbi quod actus intellectus, qui terminatur ad verbum interius, fiat cum aliquo discursu, quem videtur cogitatio importare; sed sufficit qualitercumque aliquid actu intelligatur. Quia tamen apud nos ut frequentius per discursum interius aliquid dicimus, propter hoc Damascenus et Anselmus definientes verbum, utuntur cogitatione loco considerationis.
          <td>1. Since the interior word is that which is understood and is within us only in so far as we actually understand, it always demands that the intellect be in its act, which is to understand. Now, the act of understanding is called a motion, not a motion of what is imperfect, such as is described in the <i>Physics</i> , but a motion of what is perfect-an operation, as is described in <i>The Soul.</i> It is in this sense that Damascene spoke of the interior word as a motion of the mind, because motion is taken for that in which the motion terminates; that is, operation is taken for the term of the operation, just as the act of understanding is taken for the understood.<br>
          Moreover, the notion of the mental word does not require that the act of the intellect which terminates in a mental word take place by means of some reasoning process which thinking seems to involve. It is enough that something is actually understood—no matter how this takes place. But because <i>we</i> usually speak interiorly by means of a reasoning process, Damascene and Anselm in defining a word use <i>thinking</i> instead of <i>consideration.</i>

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod argumentum Augustini non procedit a simili, sed a minori; minus enim videtur quod in corde os dici debeat quam verbum; et ideo ratio non procedit.
          <td>2. Augustine’s argument is not from a parallel but from the lesser to the greater. For, if one can speak of the heart as having a mouth, he can with greater verisimilitude speak of it as containing a word. Hence, the argument proves nothing.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod medium potest accipi dupliciter. Uno modo inter duo extrema motus: sicut pallidum est medium inter album et nigrum in motu denigrationis vel dealbationis. Alio modo inter agens et patiens: sicut instrumentum artificis est medium inter ipsum et artificiatum; et similiter omne illud quo agit; et hoc modo filius est medium inter patrem creantem et creaturam factam per verbum; non autem inter Deum creantem et creaturam, quia ipsum verbum etiam est Deus creans; unde sicut verbum non est creatura, ita non est pater.<br>
          Et tamen etiam praeter hoc ratio non sequeretur. Dicimus enim, quod Deus creat per sapientiam suam essentialiter dictam, ut sic sapientia sua medium dici possit inter Deum et creaturam; et tamen ipsa sapientia est Deus.<br>
          Augustinus autem non per hoc probat verbum non esse creaturam, quia est medium, sed quia est universalis creaturae causa. In quolibet enim motu fit reductio ad aliquod primum, quod non movetur secundum motum illum, sicut alterabilia omnia reducuntur in primum alterans non alteratum; et ita etiam illud in quod reducuntur creata omnia, oportet esse non creatum.
          <td>3. A medium can be understood in two ways. First, it can be understood as being a medium between the two terms of a motion, as pale is a medium between white and black in a process of blackening or whitening. Second, it can be understood as existing between what is active and what is passive, as the instrument of the artist is a medium between the artist and his work. In fact, anything by which the artist acts is a medium in this sense. It is in this second sense, too, that the Son is a medium between the creating Father and the creature created through the Word. The Son, however, is not a medium between God creating and the creature created, for the Word is also God creating. Hence, just as the Son is not a creature, so also He is not the Father.<br>
          There is still another reason why the conclusion does not follow. We say that God creates by means of His wisdom predicated essentially; hence, His wisdom can be called a medium between God and creature. Yet, this very wisdom is God.<br>
          In the argument cited, moreover, Augustine is proving that the Word is not a creature, not because He is a medium, but because He is the universal cause of creatures. Now, every motion is reduced to some first mover which is itself unmoved at least relatively to the motion in question, just as all things which undergo qualitative change must be reduced to some first thing which causes this change but is itself not changed in this way. Similarly, that to which all created beings are reduced must itself be uncreated.

          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod medium quod accipitur inter terminos motus, aliquando accipitur secundum aequidistantiam terminorum, aliquando autem non. Sed medium quod est inter agens et patiens, si sit quidem medium, ut instrumentum, quandoque est propinquius primo agenti, quandoque propinquius ultimo patienti; et quandoque se habet secundum aequidistantiam ad utrumque; sicut patet in agente cuius actio ad patiens pervenit pluribus instrumentis. Sed medium quod est forma qua agens agit, semper est propinquius agenti, quia est in ipso secundum veritatem rei, non autem in patiente nisi secundum sui similitudinem. Et hoc modo verbum dicitur esse medium inter patrem et creaturam. Unde non oportet quod aequaliter distet a patre et creatura.
          <td>4. A medium understood as existing between the two terms of a motion is sometimes taken as existing equidistant from each term, but at other times it is not taken in this sense. For a medium that exists between what is active and what is passive—if, indeed, it is a medium, as an instrument—is sometimes closer to the first active thing, sometimes closer to the last passive thing, although it may at other times stand equidistant from each. This becomes clear if we consider the action of an agent which finally terminates in what is passive by means of several instruments: the medium which is the form by which the agent acts is always closer to the agent because it is really in the agent, whereas only its likeness is in the patient. Now, it is in this manner that the Word is said to be a medium between the Father and the creature. Consequently, the Word does not necessarily stand equidistant between the Father and the creature.

Similiter etiam per verbum incarnatum pater omnibus manifestatus est; sed verbum ab aeterno genitum eum manifestavit sibi ipsi; et ideo non convenit sibi nomen verbi secundum hoc tantum quod incarnatus est.
          <td>5. It is true that we manifest something to another only by means of a word that is vocally expressed. Yet one can manifest something to oneself by means of the word of the heart; and, since this manifestation takes place before the other manifestation, the interior word is said to be the Principal word. Similarly, the Father is revealed to all by means of the Word Incarnate, but the eternally generated Word has manifested Him to Himself. Consequently, the name word does not belong to the Son merely in so far as He is incarnate.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod verbum incarnatum habet aliquid simile cum verbo vocis, et aliquid dissimile. Hoc quidem simile est in utroque, ratione cuius unum alteri comparatur: quod sicut vox manifestat verbum interius, ita per carnem manifestatum est verbum aeternum. Sed quantum ad hoc est dissimile: quod ipsa caro assumpta a verbo aeterno, non dicitur verbum, sed ipsa vox quae assumitur ad manifestationem verbi interioris, dicitur verbum; et ideo verbum vocis est aliud a verbo cordis; sed verbum incarnatum est idem quod verbum aeternum, sicut et verbum significatum per vocem, est idem quod verbum cordis.
          <td>6. The Incarnate Word in some respects resembles, and, in other respects, does not resemble the vocal word. They have this in common as a basis for comparison: a vocal word manifests the interior word as flesh manifested the eternal Word. They differ, however, in the following respect: the flesh assumed by the eternal Word is not said to be a word, whereas the vocal word used to manifest an interior word is said to be a word. Consequently, the vocal word is something other than the interior word, but the Incarnate Word is the same as the eternal Word, just as the word signified by the vocal word is the same as the word within the heart.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod ratio signi per prius convenit effectui quam causae, quando causa est effectui causa essendi, non autem significandi, sicut in exemplo proposito accidit. Sed quando effectus habet a causa non solum quod sit, sed etiam quod significet, tunc, sicut causa est prius quam effectus in essendo, ita in significando; et ideo verbum interius per prius habet rationem significationis et manifestationis quam verbum exterius; quia verbum exterius non instituitur ad significandum nisi per interius verbum.
          <td>7. The nature of a sign belongs more properly to in effect than to a cause when the-cause brings about the existence of the effect but not its meaning, as is the case in the example given. But when the effect has derived from its cause, not only its existence, but also its meaning, then this cause is prior to the effect both in existence and in meaning. Hence, signification and manifestation belong more properly to the interior than to the exterior word, for whatever meaning the exterior word has been adopted to convey is due to the interior word.

Ex parte autem rei nomen dicitur ab illo imponi per quod completur ratio rei quam nomen significat; et hoc est differentia specifica illius rei. Et hoc est quod principaliter significatur per nomen. Sed quia differentiae essentiales sunt nobis ignotae, quandoque utimur accidentibus vel effectibus loco earum, ut VIII Metaph. dicitur; et secundum hoc nominamus rem; et sic illud quod loco differentiae essentialis sumitur, est a quo imponitur nomen ex parte imponentis, sicut lapis imponitur ab effectu, qui est laedere pedem. Et hoc non oportet esse principaliter significatum per nomen, sed illud loco cuius hoc ponitur. Similiter dico, quod nomen verbi imponitur a verberatione vel a boatu ex parte imponentis, non ex parte rei.
          <td>8. A name is derived from two sources: from the one who uses the word or from the thing to which it has been applied. A word is said to be derived from a thing in so far as it signifies that by which the notion of the thing is completed, that is, the thing’s specific difference; and this is what a word principally signifies. But, since we do not know essential differences, sometimes, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , we use accidents or effects in their place, and name a thing accordingly. Hence, in so far as something other than the essential difference of a thing is used as the source of a word, the word is said to be derived from the one who uses it. An example of this is the word <i>lapis</i> (stone) which is derived from its effect, <i>laedere pedem</i> (to bruise the foot). Now, this effect should not be taken as that which the word principally signifies, but merely as that which takes the place of what is signified. Similarly, <i>verbum</i> (word) is derived from <i>verberatio</i> (a disturbing) or from <i>boatus</i> (shout) because of those who use it—not because of the thing it signifies.

          <td>9. As far as the nature of a word is concerned, it makes no difference whether a thing is understood by means of a likeness or by means of its essence; for it is evident that the exterior word signifies whatever can be understood—whether it be understood by means of its essence or by means of a likeness. Hence, whatever is understood, whether it has been caused by a likeness or by its essence, can be called an interior word.

Quaedam vero sunt nomina quorum res significatae Deo non conveniunt, sed aliquid simile illis rebus; et huiusmodi dicuntur metaphorice de Deo, sicut dicimus Deum leonem vel ambulantem. Dico ergo, quod verbum in divinis dicitur ad similitudinem nostri verbi, ratione impositionis nominis, non propter ordinem rei; unde non oportet quod metaphorice dicatur.
          <td>10. Some of the things predicated both of God and creatures exist in God before they exist in creatures, even though their names were applied to creatures first. These predicates, such as <i>goodness, wisdom,</i> and the like, are used of God in their proper sense. Other names signifying other things cannot be used of God in their proper sense, but things similar to these things can be found in God. These things, therefore, are predicated metaphorically of Him, as when we say that God is a lion or that God walks. Hence, when the term <i>word is</i> applied to the divine Word from our word, this indicates merely the order in the use of the name, not the order between the two realities. Consequently, Word is not used metaphorically of God.

          <td>1. Vocal expression pertains to the nature of a word only with respect to that from which the word was taken by the one who employed this noun, not with respect to the thing itself. Consequently, even though vocal expression is predicated metaphorically of God, it does not follow that a word is in Him only metaphorically. For example, Damascene says that the word Θεος (God) comes from αθιεν, which means to burn; but, although <i>burning is</i> predicated metaphorically of God, <i>God</i> is not.

          <td>12. The Incarnate Word is compared with the vocal word merely because of a certain resemblance, as is clear from what has been said. Hence, the Incarnate Word can be said to be a vocal word only metaphorically. But the eternal Word is compared with the word of the heart, according to the true nature of the interior word. Hence, each is called a word in the proper sense.

In utraque autem definitione nihil ponitur nisi essentialiter dictum. Ergo verbum essentialiter dicitur.
          <td>2. As we read in the <i>Metaphysics</i> , a word signifies a definition. But, according to Augustine, the word is “knowledge with love;” and according to Anselm: “When the highest spirit is said to speak, this means that He is intuiting by thinking. Now, nothing but essential attributes are placed in these definitions. Hence, word is predicated essentially.

          <td>3. Whatever is said is a word. But, as Anselm writes, the Father utters not only Himself but also the Son and the Holy Spirit. Hence, word is common to all three Persons, and, therefore, is predicated essentially.

          <td>Praeterea, quilibet dicens habet verbum quod dicit, ut Augustinus dicit VII de Trinit.

Ergo cuilibet eorum respondet verbum. Sed nihil est commune tribus nisi essentia. Ergo verbum essentialiter dicitur in divinis.
          <td>4. As Augustine says, whoever speaks possesses the word he speaks. But, as Anselm points out: “Just as the Father knows, and the Son knows, and the Holy Spirit knows, and yet there are not three knowers but one, so also the Father speaks, and the Son speaks, and the Holy Spirit speaks, and yet there are not three speakers but one.” Hence, <i>word</i> can be used of any one of them. Now, nothing is common to the three persons but the essence. Hence, word is predicated essentially of God.

          <td>5. With respect to our intellect, there is no difference between speaking and understanding. Now, the divine Word is understood as resembling the word in the intellect. Hence, when we say that God speaks, we mean simply that He understands. Consequently, His Word is simply that which He understands. Now, what God understands is predicated of Him essentially. Hence, His Word should be similarly predicated.

Quaestio autem ista in superficie videtur esse planissima, propter hoc quod verbum originem quamdam importat secundum quam in divinis personae distinguuntur. Sed, interius considerata, difficilior invenitur, eo quod in divinis invenimus quaedam quae originem important non secundum rem, sed secundum rationem tantum; sicut hoc nomen operatio, quae proculdubio importat aliquid procedens ab operante: et tamen iste processus non est nisi secundum rationem tantum; unde operatio in divinis non personaliter, sed essentialiter dicitur, quia in Deo non differt essentia, virtus et operatio. Unde non statim fit evidens, utrum hoc nomen verbum processum realem importet, sicut hoc nomen filius; vel rationis tantum, sicut hoc nomen operatio; et ita utrum personaliter vel essentialiter dicatur.
          <td>The word that is predicated metaphorically of God, namely, a creature, which is called His word because it manifests Him, undoubtedly pertains to the entire Trinity. The object of our present inquiry, however, is the word in so far as it is predicated properly of God. Viewed superficially, the question seems to be very simple to solve, because the Word implies a certain origin according to which the divine Persons can be distinguished. Considered more profoundly, however, the question is more difficult, since we find in God certain things that imply origin, not in reality, but only according to our manner of thinking. For example, <i>operation</i> undoubtedly implies something proceeding from the one who operates, yet that procession is only according to our manner of thinking. Consequently, operation is predicated essentially of God, not personally, because God’s power and operations do not differ from His essence. Hence, it is not immediately evident whether <i>the Word</i> implies a real procession—as <i>son</i> does—or whether it implies merely a procession according to our way of thinking—as <i>operation</i> does, and so whether the Word is an essential or a personal predicate.

          <td>Unde, ad huius notitiam, sciendum est, quod verbum intellectus nostri, secundum cuius similitudinem loqui possumus de verbo divino, est id ad quod operatio intellectus nostri terminatur, quod est ipsum intellectum, quod dicitur conceptio intellectus; sive sit conceptio significabilis per vocem incomplexam, ut accidit quando intellectus format quidditates rerum; sive per vocem complexam, quod accidit quando intellectus componit et dividit. Omne autem intellectum in nobis est aliquid realiter progrediens ab altero; vel sicut progrediuntur a principiis conceptiones conclusionum, vel sicut conceptiones quidditatum rerum posteriorum a quidditatibus priorum; vel saltem sicut conceptio actualis progreditur ab habituali cognitione. Et hoc universaliter verum est de omni quod a nobis intelligitur, sive per essentiam intelligatur, sive per similitudinem. Ipsa enim conceptio est effectus actus intelligendi; unde etiam quando mens intelligit seipsam, eius conceptio non est ipsa mens, sed aliquid expressum a notitia mentis. Ita ergo verbum intellectus in nobis duo habet de sua ratione; scilicet quod est intellectum, et quod est ab alio expressum.
          <td>For the clarification of this matter, it should be noted that our intellectual word, which enables us to speak about the divine Word by a kind of resemblance, is that at which our intellectual operation terminates. This is the object of understanding, which is called the conception of the’intellect—whether the conception can be signified by a simple expression, as is true when the intellect forms the quiddities of things, or whether it can be signified only by a complex expression, as is true when the intellect composes and divides. Now, for us every object of understanding really proceeds from something else. For example, conceptions of conclusions proceed from principles, conceptions of the quiddities of later things proceed from quiddities of things prior, or at least an actual conception proceeds from habitual knowledge. Now, this is universally true of whatever we understand, whether it be understood by its essence or by its likeness; for conception itself is an effect of the act of understanding. Consequently, when the mind understands itself, its conception is not the mind but something expressed by the mind’s act of knowledge. Hence, two things pertain to the nature of our intellectual word: it is understood, and it is expressed by an agent distinct from itself.

Sed hoc non erit secundum propriam verbi acceptionem, quia si aliquid eorum quae sunt de ratione alicuius auferatur, iam non erit propria acceptio. Unde verbum si proprie accipiatur in divinis, non dicitur nisi personaliter; si autem accipiatur communiter, poterit etiam dici essentialiter. Sed tamen, quia nominibus utendum ut plures, secundum philosophum, usus maxime est aemulandus in significationibus nominum; et quia omnes sancti communiter utuntur nomine verbi, prout personaliter dicitur, ideo hoc magis dicendum est, quod personaliter dicatur.
          <td>Therefore, if word is predicated of God because of its resemblance to both of these characteristics, then the name of word implies a real procession—and not merely because of our manner of thinking. On the other hand, if it is predicated of God merely because of its resemblance to one of these characteristics, namely, that it is understood, then word as applied to God does not imply a real procession but one only according to our manner of thinking, such as <i>the understood</i> implies. This, however, would not be taking word in its proper meaning, because it is not taken in its proper meaning if something belonging to its nature is entirely left out. Consequently, if <i>word</i> is taken in its proper meaning when used of God, it can be predicated of Him only personally. However, if it is taken in a broad sense, it can also be predicated essentially. Since, however, we should use words as most people use them, as the Philosopher says,” usage should be followed very carefully when it comes to the meanings of words. Moreover, since all the saints commonly use word as a personal predication, this is even a stronger reason for saying that it is predicated personally.

          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod verbum de ratione sui non solum habet manifestationem, sed realem processum unius ab alio. Et quia essentia non realiter progreditur a seipsa, quamvis manifestet seipsam, non potest essentia verbum dici, nisi ratione identitatis essentiae ad personam; sicut etiam dicitur pater vel filius.
          <td>1. The nature of a word includes not only the property of making something manifest but also a real procession of one thing from another. Now, although the divine essence manifests itself, the essence does not come from itself in a real procession. Hence, it cannot be called a word unless it is called this because it is identical with that Person, as, for the same reason, the essence is called the Father or the Son.

          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod notitia quae ponitur in definitione verbi est intelligenda notitia expressa ab alio, quae est in nobis notitia actualis. Quamvis autem sapientia vel notitia essentialiter dicatur in divinis, tamen sapientia genita non dicitur nisi personaliter. Similiter etiam quod Anselmus dicit, quod dicere est cogitando intueri, est intelligendum, si proprie dicere accipiatur de intuitu cogitationis, secundum quod per ipsum aliquid progreditur, scilicet cogitatum ipsum.
          <td>2. The knowledge that is included in the definition of a word should be understood as knowledge uttered by another. In us, this is actual knowledge. Now, although knowledge or wisdom is predicated essentially of God, generated wisdom is predicated only personally. Similarly, Anselm’s statement, “ <i>Speak</i> signifies intuiting by thinking,” can be understood if <i>speak</i> be taken, in its proper sense, in its relation to intellectual intuition. In this sense, we can say that something proceeds through speech, namely, <i>the understood.</i>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod conceptio intellectus est media inter intellectum et rem intellectam, quia ea mediante operatio intellectus pertingit ad rem. Et ideo conceptio intellectus non solum est id quod intellectum est, sed etiam id quo res intelligitur; ut sic id quod intelligitur, possit dici et res ipsa, et conceptio intellectus; et similiter id quod dicitur, potest dici et res quae dicitur per verbum, et verbum ipsum; ut etiam in verbo exteriori patet; quia et ipsum nomen dicitur, et res significata per nomen dicitur ipso nomine. Dico igitur, quod pater dicitur, non sicut verbum, sed sicut res dicta per verbum; et similiter spiritus sanctus, quia filius manifestat totam Trinitatem; unde pater dicit verbo uno suo omnes tres personas.
          <td>3. The intellectual conception is a medium between the intellect and the thing known, because through its mediation the intellectual operation attains the thing. Hence, the intellectual conception is not only <i>that which is</i> understood but also <i>that by which</i> the thing is understood. Consequently, that which is understood can be said to be both the thing itself as well as an intellectual conception. Similarly, that which is spoken interiorly can be said to be both the thing expressed by the word and the word itself, as is also true of the exterior word, because both the word and the thing the word signifies are expressed when the word is spoken. I assert, therefore, that the Father is spoken, not as a word, but as a thing spoken by the Word. The same is true of the Holy Spirit, because the Son manifests the entire Trinity. Consequently, by uttering His own one Word, the Father utters all three Persons.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod in hoc videtur contrariari Anselmus sibi ipsi. Dicit enim, quod verbum non dicitur nisi personaliter, et convenit soli filio; sed dicere convenit tribus personis; dicere autem nihil est aliud quam ex se emittere verbum. Similiter etiam verbo Anselmi contrariatur verbum Augustini in VII de Trinitate, ubi dicit, quod non singulus in Trinitate est dicens, sed pater verbo suo; unde, sicut verbum proprie dictum non dicitur nisi personaliter in divinis, et convenit soli filio, ita et dicere et soli patri convenit. Sed Anselmus accepit dicere communiter pro intelligere, et verbum proprie; et potuisset facere e converso si ei placuisset.
          <td>4. Here Anselm seems to contradict himself, for he says that <i>Word</i> is predicated only personally and belongs only to the Son, while to <i>speak</i> belongs to all three Persons. To speak, however, means nothing else but to send forth a word from oneself. Augustine’s statement also seems to contradict Anselm’s, for he saysl3that not each of the Persons in the Trinity speaks, but only the Father speaks by means of His Word. Consequently, just as the Word, properly speaking, is predicated only personally of God and belongs only to the Son, so also speech belongs only to the Father. Anselm, however, is taking to <i>speak</i> in its general meaning of to understand, and <i>word</i> in its proper sense. If he wished, he could have taken these words the other way around.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod in nobis dicere non solum significat intelligere, sed intelligere cum hoc quod est ex se exprimere aliquam conceptionem; nec aliter possumus intelligere, nisi huiusmodi conceptionem exprimendo; et ideo omne intelligere in nobis, proprie loquendo, est dicere. Sed Deus potest intelligere sine hoc quod aliquid ex ipso procedat secundum rem, quia in eo idem est intelligens et intellectum et intelligere: quod in nobis non accidit; et ideo non omne intelligere in Deo, proprie loquendo, dicitur dicere.
          <td>5. As used of <i>us, speaking</i> signifies not merely understanding but understanding plus the expression from within oneself of some conception; and we cannot understand in any way other than by forming a conception of this sort. Therefore, properly speaking, every act of understanding is, in our case, an act of uttering. God, however, can understand without something really proceeding from Him, because in Him the one understanding, the understood, and intellection itself are all identical. This is not true of us, however. Consequently, properly speaking, no~ all understanding in God is said to be uttering.

          <td>6. just as the Word is said to be the Father’s knowledge only in the sense that it is knowledge generated by the Father, so also it is called the operative power of the Father because it is a power proceeding from Him. Now, a power that proceeds is predicated personally, and an operative power proceeding from the Father is predicated in this manner.

          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod dupliciter aliquid potest procedere ab altero: uno modo sicut actio ab agente, vel operatio ab operante; alio sicut operatum ab operante. Processus ergo operationis ab operante non distinguit rem per se existentem ab alia re per se existente, sed distinguit perfectionem a perfecto, quia operatio est perfectio operantis. Sed processus operati distinguit unam rem ab alia. In divinis autem non potest esse secundum rem distinctio perfectionis a perfectibili. Inveniuntur tamen in Deo res ab invicem distinctae, scilicet tres personae; et ideo processus qui significatur in divinis ut operationis ab operante, non est nisi rationis tantum; sed processus qui significatur ut rei a principio, potest in Deo realiter inveniri.<br>
          Haec autem est differentia inter intellectum et voluntatem: quod operatio voluntatis terminatur ad res, in quibus est bonum et malum; sed operatio intellectus terminatur in mente, in qua est verum et falsum, ut dicitur in VI Metaphysic. Et ideo voluntas non habet aliquid progrediens a seipsa, quod in ea sit nisi per modum operationis; sed intellectus habet in seipso aliquid progrediens ab eo, non solum per modum operationis, sed etiam per modum rei operatae. Et ideo verbum significatur ut res procedens, sed amor ut operatio procedens; unde amor non ita se habet ad hoc ut dicatur personaliter, sicut verbum.
          <td>7. One thing may proceed from another thing in two ways; First, it may proceed from it as action proceeds from an agent or as an operation proceeds from one operating. Second, it may proceed as a term of an operation from one operating. Now, the procession of an operation from the one operating does not distinguish a thing that is substantially existing from another substantially existing thing; it merely distinguishes a perfection from what is perfected, because an operation is a perfection of the one operating. On the other hand, the procession of the term of an operation distinguishes one thing from another. Now, in God the distinction between a perfection and what is perfected cannot be a real distinction. There are, however, distinct things in God, namely, the three Persons. Hence, a procession signified as existing in God as an operation from the one operating is a procession merely according to our manner of thinking. But a procession signified as that of a thing proceeding from a principle can really be found in God.<br>
          Moreover, there is this difference between the intellect and the will: an operation of the will terminates in things, in which good and evil are found; but an operation of the intellect terminates in the mind, in which the true and the false are found, as is said in the <i>Metaphysics.</i> Consequently, the will does not have anything proceeding from it except in the manner of an operation. The intellect, however, has something in itself that proceeds from it, not only in the manner of an operation, but also in the manner of a thing that is the term of an operation. Consequently, the word is signified as a thing that proceeds, but love, as an operation that proceeds. Hence, love is not such as to be predicated personally in the same way in which word is.

          <td>1. Basil says: “The Holy Spirit is related to the Son in the same way in which the Son is related to the Father; and, for this reason, the Son is the word of God, and the Spirit is the word of the Son.”’ Therefore, the Holy Spirit can be called a word.

          <td>2. In the Epistle to the Hebrews (1:3) the following is said of the Son: “Who being the brightness of his glory, and the figure of his substance, and upholding all things by the word of his power...” Hence, the Son has a word proceeding from Himself by which He upholds all things. But in God no one proceeds from the Son except the Holy Spirit. Therefore, the Holy Spirit can be called the Word.

          <td>4. The Gloss on “upholding all things by the word of his power” (Hebrews 1:3) says that <i>word</i> should be taken as meaning a <i>command.</i> But a command is classified as a sign of the will. Therefore, since the Holy Spirit proceeds from the will, it seems that He can be called Word.

We are not now concerned with image, but that our use of <i>word</i> is reasonable enough will appear from. the following.

Proximum ergo manifestans est in intellectu: sed remotum potest esse etiam extra eum; et ideo nomen verbi proprie dicitur de eo quod procedit ab intellectu. Quod vero ab intellectu non procedit, non potest dici verbum nisi metaphorice, inquantum, scilicet, est aliquo modo manifestans. Dico ergo, quod in divinis solus filius procedit per viam intellectus, quia procedit ab uno; spiritus enim sanctus, qui procedit a duobus, procedit per viam voluntatis; et ideo spiritus sanctus non potest dici verbum nisi metaphorice, secundum quod omne manifestans verbum dicitur.

          <td><i>Word</i> implies a making manifest, and manifestation is found essentially only in the intellect. If something outside the intellect is said to “manifest” this is true only to the extent that something of it remains in the intellect. Hence, what proximately manifests is within the intellect, even though what remotely manifests can be outside of it. Consequently, <i>word</i> is used properly of that which proceeds from the intellect. Of that which does not proceed from the intellect it can be used only metaphorically; that is, it can be used of such a thing only in so far as it manifests in some way or other. I say, therefore, that in God only the Son proceeds from the intellect, because He proceeds from one Person; the Holy Spirit, who proceeds from two Persons, proceeds from the will. Consequently, the Holy Spirit can be called Word only metaphorically, that is, only in so far as whatever manifests can be called a word. The quotation from Basil should be understood in this sense.

Knowledge belongs to the notion of word since it implies, as it were, the very essence of word; but love belongs to the notion of word, not as something pertaining to its essence, but as something that accompanies a word.

Ergo verbum personaliter dictum in divinis, quo pater dicit seipsum, non est verbum quo dicuntur creaturae.
          <td>4. Every word is related as an archetype or image to that which is uttered by it. When a word causes a thing, as happens in the practical intellect, then that word is an archetype. When, however, a thing causes a word, as happens in our speculative intellect, then that word is an image. Now, in God there cannot be the word of a creature that is the image of a creature. Hence, the word of creatures that is in God must be an archetype of creatures. But the divine archetype of creatures is an idea. Therefore, the divine word of creatures is simply an idea. An idea, however, is predicated of God, not personally, but essentially. Consequently, the Word which is predicated personally of God, and by which the Father utters Himself, is not the word by which creatures are uttered.-

We find both types of processions in ourselves, although not in the same respect.

          <td>Moreover, in both types of procession the difference between procession from God and procession from us is similar. For a human son, proceeding in the manner of nature from a human father, receives only a part of his father’s substance, not all of it; but the Son of God, proceeding in the manner of nature from the Father, receives all of His Father’s nature in such a way that both the Father and the Son have absolutely one and the same numerical nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Et similis differentia invenitur in processu qui est per viam intellectus. Verbum enim quod in nobis exprimitur per actualem considerationem, quasi exortum ex aliqua priorum consideratione, vel saltem cognitione habituali, non totum in se recipit quod est in eo a quo oritur: non enim quidquid habituali cognitione tenemus, hoc totum exprimit intellectus in unius verbi conceptione, sed aliquid eius. Similiter in consideratione unius conclusionis non exprimitur omne id quod erat virtutis in principiis. Sed in Deo, ad hoc quod verbum eius perfectum sit, oportet quod verbum eius exprimat quidquid continetur in eo ex quo exoritur; et praecipue cum Deus omnia uno intuitu videat, non divisim. Sic igitur oportet quod quidquid in scientia patris continetur, totum hoc per unum ipsius verbum exprimatur, et hoc modo quo in scientia continetur, ut sit verbum verum suo principio correspondens. Per scientiam autem suam pater scit se, et cognoscendo se omnia alia cognoscit, unde et verbum ipsius exprimit ipsum patrem principaliter, et consequenter omnia alia quae cognoscit pater cognoscendo seipsum. Et sic filius ex hoc ipso quod est verbum perfecte exprimens patrem, exprimit omnem creaturam. Et hic ordo ostenditur in verbis Anselmi, qui dicit, quod dicendo se, dixit omnem creaturam.
          <td>This difference is also found with respect to the intellectual processions. The word expressed in us by actual consideration and arising, as it were, from a consideration of a thing known previously, or at least from habitual knowledge, does not receive into itself the whole of that from which it had its origin. For, in the conception of one word, the intellect expresses not all but only part of what it possesses in its habitual knowledge. Similarly, what is contained in one conclusion does not express all that was contained virtually in its principle. However, for the divine Word to be perfect, it must express whatever is contained in that from which it had its origin, especially since God sees all things, not in many intuitions, but in one. Consequently, whatever is contained in the Father’s knowledge is necessarily and entirely expressed by His only Word and in the very same manner in which all things are contained in His knowledge. In this way it is a true word, whose intellectual content corresponds to that of its principle. Through His knowledge, moreover, the Father knows Himself, and, by knowing Himself, He knows all other things. Hence, His Word chiefly expresses the Father and, as a result, all other things which the Father knows by knowing Himself. Therefore, because the Son is a word that perfectly expresses the Father, the Son expresses all creatures. This sequence is outlined by the words of Anselm, who said’ that by uttering Himself the Father uttered all creatures.

        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod cum dicitur: pater dicit se; in hac dictione includitur etiam omnis creatura; inquantum, scilicet, pater scientia sua continet omnem creaturam velut exemplar creaturae totius.
          <td>1. When we say that the Father utters Himself we signify that in this utterance every creature is included, since the Father’s knowledge contains all creatures, being, as it were, their archetype.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod Anselmus accipit stricte nomen similitudinis, sicut et Dionysius, in IX cap. de divinis nominibus ubi dicit, quod in aeque ordinatis ad invicem, recipimus similitudinis reciprocationem; ut scilicet unum dicatur alteri simile, et e converso. Sed in his quae se habent per modum causae et causati, non invenitur, proprie loquendo, reciprocatio similitudinis: dicimus enim quod imago Herculis similatur Herculi sed non e converso. Unde, quia verbum divinum non est factum ad imitationem creaturae, ut verbum nostrum, sed potius e converso; ideo Anselmus vult quod verbum non sit similitudo creaturae, sed e converso.<br>
          Si autem largo modo similitudinem accipiamus, sic possumus dicere, quod verbum est similitudo creaturae, non quasi imago eius, sed sicut exemplar; sicut etiam Augustinus dicit, ideas esse rerum similitudines.<br>
          Nec tamen sequitur quod in verbo non sit summa veritas, quia est immutabile, creaturis existentibus mutabilibus: quia non exigitur ad veritatem verbi similitudo ad rem quae per verbum dicitur, secundum conformitatem naturae, sed secundum repraesentationem, ut in quaestione de scientia Dei dictum est.
          <td>2. Anselm is taking <i>likeness</i> in its strict sense, as Dionysius does when he says that, when things are ordered equally to each other, we receive a mutual likeness; that is, one thing can be said to be similar to the other and the other similar to it. But, properly speaking, no such mutual likeness is found between a cause and its effect. We say that a picture of Hercules resembles Hercules, but not that Hercules resembles the picture. Hence, since the divine Word is not, like our word, made in the likeness of a creature, but rather the opposite is true, Anselm means to say simply that the Word is not a likeness of creatures but creatures are a likeness of the Word.<br>
          However, if <i>likeness</i> is taken in its broader meaning, then we can say that the Word is a likeness of creatures, not, however, in the sense that it is an image of creatures, but in the sense that it is their archetype. Taking the term in this meaning, Augustine calls ideas likenesses of things.<br>
          Finally, it does not follow that the highest truth is not in the Word merely from the fact that the Word remains unchanged while existing creatures change; for the truth of a word does not demand that it be a likeness with the same nature as that of the thing declared by the word; it is enough if it is a true representation of the thing, as we have pointed out previously.

          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod dispositio creaturarum non dicitur verbum, proprie loquendo, nisi secundum quod est ab altero progrediens, quae est dispositio genita; et dicitur personaliter, sicut et sapientia genita, quamvis dispositio simpliciter sumpta, essentialiter dicatur.
          <td>3. The divine plan for creatures is called a word, properly speaking, only if this plan proceeds from another—and is therefore a begotten plan. This, however, like begotten wisdom, is a personal predication. Taken simply, the divine plan is an essential predication.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod verbum differt ab idea: idea enim nominat formam exemplarem absolute; sed verbum creaturae in Deo nominat formam exemplarem ab alio deductam; et ideo idea in Deo ad essentiam pertinet. Sed verbum ad personam.
          <td>4. A word differs from an idea, for the latter means an exemplary cause and nothing else, but the word in God of a creature means an exemplary form that is drawn from something else. Hence, a divine idea pertains to the essence, but a word, to a person.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quintum dicendum, quod quamvis Deus maxime distet a creatura, considerata proprietate naturae, tamen Deus est creaturae exemplar; non autem una creatura est exemplar alterius; et ideo per verbum quo exprimitur Deus, exprimitur omnis creatura, non autem idea qua exprimitur una creatura, exprimitur alia. Ex quo etiam apparet alia differentia inter verbum et ideam: quia idea directe respicit creaturam, et ideo plurium creaturarum sunt plures ideae, sed verbum respicit directe Deum, qui primo per verbum exprimitur, et ex consequenti creaturas. Et quia creaturae secundum quod in Deo sunt, unum sunt, ideo creaturarum omnium est unum verbum.
          <td>5. Even though the greatest possible distance separates God from a creature because of what is proper to each, God is the model in whose likeness creatures are created. There is no creature that is a model for another creature. Hence, in that Word by which God is expressed every creature is expressed; but the idea by which one creature is expressed does not express another. Thus, this is another difference between the Word and an idea. The reason for this is that an idea is directly related to a creature; hence, for many creatures there are many ideas. On the other hand, the Word is directly related to God, whom the Word expresses first, and then, as a consequence, expresses creatures. Because all creatures are one as they exist in God there is only one Word for all of them.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad sextum dicendum, quod cum dicit Augustinus, quod filius eo dicitur verbum quo imago, intelligit quantum ad proprietatem personalem filii, quae est eadem secundum rem, sive secundum eam dicatur filius, sive verbum, sive imago. Sed quantum ad modum significandi non est eadem ratio trium nominum praedictorum: verbum enim non solum importat rationem originis et imitationis, sed etiam manifestationis; et hoc modo verbum est aliquo modo creaturae, inquantum scilicet per verbum creatura manifestatur.
          <td>6. When Augustine says that the Son “is called a Word for the same reason that He is called an Image,” he is referring to the distinguishing personal characteristic of the Son, which remains the same whether He is called, because of it, the Son, the Word, or the Image of the Father. But in the manner of signifying, these three predicates are not of the same type, for <i>word</i> implies not only the notion of origin and imitation but also that of manifestation. Consequently, the Word is, in a fashion, the word of creatures, because creatures are manifested by means of the Word.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad septimum dicendum, quod verbum est alicuius multipliciter: uno modo ut dicentis, et sic procedit ab eo cuius est verbum; alio modo ut manifestati per verbum, et sic non oportet quod procedat ab eo cuius est, nisi quando scientia ex qua procedit verbum, est causata a rebus; quod in Deo non accidit; et ideo ratio non sequitur.
          <td>7. A word can belong to something in different ways. First, it can belong to one who is speaking. Taken in this sense, it proceeds from him whose word it is. Second, it can belong to that which is made manifest by the word. In this sense, the word does not necessarily proceed from that whose word it is, unless the knowledge from which the word proceeds has been caused by things. However, this is not true of God’s knowledge. Hence, the conclusion does not follow.

Ergo verbum non importat respectum ad creaturam.
          <td>7. All relatives are relative in being or in predication. Now, the Word is not related to creatures in being, because then it would depend on creatures. Nor is it related to them merely in predication, because then it would have to be related to creatures in one of the grammatical cases. And since in this type of relation one thing is usually referred to another by means of the genitive case, we would have to say: “The Word is of creatures.” This statement, however, Anselm denies.’ Therefore, the Word does not imply any relation to creatures.

          <td>3. Any name implying a relation to creatures cannot be understood unless the actual or potential existence of creatures is also understood, because, if one understands one of two relatives, he also understands the other. But, even if some creature is not understood as existing now or in the future, the divine Word, by which the Father utters Himself, is understood. Therefore, the Word does not imply any relation to creatures.

          <td>4. The relation of God to creatures can be only that of a cause to an effect. But, as Dionysius says, any name that implies an effect in creatures is common to the entire Trinity. However, <i>Word</i> is not this kind of a name. Hence, it does not imply any relation to creatures.

          <td>5. God is not understood as having a relation to creatures unless it be by His wisdom, goodness, and power. But these attributes are predicated of the Word merely by appropriation; and since <i>Word</i> is not merely an appropriated but a proper name, it seems that <i>Word</i> does not imply a relation to creatures.

Otherwise, the relative would have two essences, since the essence of a relative lies simply in its being related to another. Now, the Word is predicated as relative to the Father; therefore, it is not predicated as relative to creatures.

Sed relatio verbi ad creaturam non est nisi superpositionis; relatio autem verbi ad patrem est quasi suppositionis, non propter inaequalitatem dignitatis, sed propter principii auctoritatem. Ergo verbum quod importat relationem ad patrem, non importat relationem ad creaturam, nisi aequivoce sumatur.
          <td>9. If the same word is applied to specifically different things, it is used of them equivocally, as <i>dog is</i> used of hounds and fish. Now, superiority and inferiority are specifically different types of relations. If, therefore, one word implies both relations, then that word is used equivocally. But the relation of the Word to creatures is simply one of superiority, and the relation of the Word to the Father is, in a way, one of inferiority—not because of any unequal dignity, but because of the authority which a principle has. Hence, the Word which implies a relation to the Father does not imply a relation to creatures, unless it is taken equivocally.

          <td>2. Explaining the words of the Psalmist, “God has spoken once” (Psalms 61:12), the Gloss says: “‘Once, that is, God has eternally begotten the Word in which He disposes all things.” Now, disposition implies a relation to the things disposed. Therefore, Word is predicated relatively.

Now, the Word, by its very name, adds the notion of making manifest. But there can be no manifestation other than that in which the Father is manifested through creatures—a manifestation, as it were, to the exterior. Therefore, the Word implies a relation to creatures.

Dionysius says that God is praised as being a word or principle of intelligibility because “He is the giver of wisdom and reason.” From this it is clear that the Word as predicated of God implies the notion of cause.

          <td>Consequently, since all creatures depend on God but He does not depend on them, there are real relations in creatures, referring them to God. The opposite relations in God to creatures, however, are merely conceptual relations; but, because names are signs of concepts, certain names we use for God imply a relation to creatures, even though, as we have said, this relation is merely conceptual. The only real relations in God are those by which the divine persons are distinguished from each other.

Et hanc diversitatem invenimus in nominibus relativis de Deo dictis, et quae ab aeterno et quae ex tempore de Deo dicuntur. Hoc enim nomen pater, quod ab aeterno de Deo dicitur, et similiter hoc nomen dominus, quod dicitur de eo ex tempore, imponuntur ad significandum ipsos respectus; sed hoc nomen creator, quod de Deo ex tempore dicitur, imponitur ad significandum actionem divinam, quam consequitur respectus quidam; similiter etiam hoc nomen verbum, imponitur ad significandum aliquid absolutum cum aliquo respectu adiuncto; est enim verbum idem quod sapientia genita, ut Augustinus dicit.
          <td>Among relative terms, we find that some are used to signify the relations themselves, for example, the word <i>likeness.</i> Others are used to signify something upon which a relation follows. For example, <i>knowledge is</i> used to signify a certain quality upon which a particular relation follows. We find this difference also in the relative names used of God, both in the names used of Him as from all eternity, as well as in those used of Him as from the beginning of time. For <i>Father is</i> used of Him as from all eternity, and <i>Lord</i> as from the beginning of time; and each of these words is used to signify the relations themselves. But <i>Creator,</i> used of God as from the beginning of time, is employed to signify a divine action upon which a certain relation follows. The same is true of <i>Word;</i> it is used to signify something absolute to which something relative is joined; for, as Augustine says, the Word is simply “begotten Wisdom.”

Ita etiam et hoc nomen verbum habet respectum et ad dicentem, et ad id quod per verbum dicitur; ad quod quidem potest dici dupliciter. Uno modo secundum convertentiam nominis; et sic verbum dicitur ad dictum. Alio modo ad rem cui convenit ratio dicti. Et quia pater principaliter dicit se, generando verbum suum, et ex consequenti dicit creaturas: ideo principaliter, et quasi per se, verbum refertur ad patrem; sed ex consequenti, et quasi per accidens, refertur ad creaturam; accidit enim verbo ut per ipsum creatura dicatur.
          <td>This, however, does not prevent Word from being a personal predication, because God begetting or God begotten is, like Father, predicated personally. It may happen, however, that an absolute thing is able to have a relation to many other things. This is why a name that is used to signify something absolute upon which a relation follows can be spoken of as being relative to many things, and it is in this manner that <i>knowledge</i> is used. Inasmuch as it is knowledge, it is relative to what is known, but inasmuch as it is a particular accident or form, it is related to the knower. In the same way, word is related to the one who utters it and to that which is uttered by the word. In the latter relation, it can be taken in two ways: first, according as the two are interchangeable, and in this sense we speak of a word as being related to what is spoken; second, according as the word is related to a thing to which the character of being uttered belongs. And since the Father principally utters Himself by begetting His Word, and, as a consequence of this, utters creatures, the Word is principally, and, as it were, essentially referred to the Father, but consequently, and, as it were, accidentally, to creatures; for it is only accidental to the Word that creatures are uttered through it.

A habitual relation is one that does not require the actual existence of a creature.

Now, the Word implies an intellectual procession. Hence, the argument proves nothing.

It is rather a relation merely according to predication. Moreover, there is no reason why this relation should not be expressed by some grammatical case; for I can say that He is the Word of creatures in the sense that the Word is about creatures, although not from them. It is this last sense that Anselm denies. Besides, even if the Word were not referred to creatures by means of some grammatical case, it would be enough if it is referred to them in any manner whatsoever; for example, if it were referred to them by a preposition joined with some case. Then one would say that the Word “is for creatures,” that is, for constituting them.

Now, this certainly could not happen unless the manner of the causes’ existence were more sublime than the things predicated of their effects. And we find this to be true of all equivocal efficient causes.

But, if it refers to the truth of predication, then the opposite is true. For man is more truly predicated of a thing which is in its own nature than it is of a thing as it is in the Word.

          <td>2. According to Augustine: “The Son is the Father’s art, filled with the ideas of living things.” But, as Augustine says elsewhere: “Even if nothing comes into being because of an idea, it is rightly called an idea.” Hence, the Word is also related to those things which will not be or have not been made.

          <td>3. The Word would not be perfect unless it contained in itself all that is contained in the knowledge of Him who utters it. But the knowledge of the Father, who utters the Word, includes those things which never will be and never were. Therefore, these things also are contained in the Word.

Uno modo sicut id quod verbum cognoscit, vel quod in verbo cognosci potest, et sic in verbo est etiam illud quod nec est, nec erit, nec factum est, quia hoc cognoscit verbum sicut et pater; et in verbo etiam cognosci potest sicut et in patre. Alio modo dicitur aliquid esse in verbo sicut id quod per verbum dicitur. Omne autem quod aliquo verbo dicitur, ordinatur quodammodo ad executionem, quia verbo instigamus alios ad agendum, et ordinamus aliquos ad exequendum id quod mente concepimus; unde etiam dicere Dei, disponere ipsius est, ut patet per Glossam super illud Psalm. LXI, 12: semel locutus est Deus, et cetera. Unde, sicut Deus non disponit nisi quae sunt, vel erunt, vel fuerunt, ita nec dicit; unde verbum est horum tantum, sicut per ipsum dictorum. Scientia autem et ars et idea, vel ratio, non important ordinem ad aliquam executionem, et ideo non est simile de eis et de verbo.
          <td>A thing can be in the Word in two ways. First, it can be in the Word as what the Word knows, or what can be known in the Word. It is in this latter way that those things exist in the Word that do not exist, have not existed, and will not exist; for the Word knows these things just as the Father does, and they can be known in the Word just as they can be known in the Father. Second, a thing is said to be in the Word as something spoken through the Word. Now, whatever is spoken by a word is in some way directed to be carried out, because it is by means of words that we incite others to action and arrange for them to carry out our ideas. This is why God’s utterance is called His arrangement, as the Gloss says, commenting on the words of the Psalmist (Psalms 61:12): “God has spoken once...” Hence, just as God does not dispose things unless they are, will be, or have been, so also He does not utter such things. Consequently, the Word is related to these things only, namely, the things that are actually uttered. But knowledge, art, and idea (in other words, intelligible representation) do not imply a relation to execution. Hence, no parallel exists between them and the Word.

Sed ex hoc quod causat res per modum bonitatis, sequitur quod omnia sunt bona. Ergo ex hoc quod causat res per modum vitae, sequetur quod omnia sint viva: quod falsum est; ergo et primum.
          <td>1. The Word causes things in so far as they exist in it. Therefore, if the things within the Word are life, the Word causes them through its life. Now, from the fact that the Word causes things through its goodness, all things are good. Hence, if it causes things through its life, all things would be living. This is false, and, consequently, the initial proposition is false.

          <td>Praeterea, res sunt in verbo sicut artificiata apud artificem. Sed artificiata in artifice non sunt vita: nec enim ipsius artificis vita sunt, qui vivebat etiam antequam artificiata in ipso essent; neque artificiatorum, quae vita carent. Ergo nec creaturae in verbo sunt vita.
          <td>2. Things exist in the Word as works exist in an artist. But as they are in an artist works are not life. They are not the life of the artist, who lived even before they existed in him, nor do they have any life themselves, for they are lifeless. Therefore, creatures in the Word are not life, either.

Sed verbum non dicitur de spiritu sancto, sed de filio tantum, ut patet ex dictis. Ergo nec convenienter dicitur quod res in verbo sit vita.
          <td>3. In Scripture, the causing of life is appropriated to the Holy Spirit rather than to the Word. This is clear from John (6:64): “It is the spirit that quickens,” as well as from other passages. Now, as is clear from what we said previously, only the Son, and not the Holy Spirit, is called the Word. Consequently, it is not consistent to say that things existing in the Word are life.

          <td>2. According to the Philosopher, the motion of the heavens is said to be “a kind of life for all naturally existing things.” But the Word has a greater influence on creatures than the motion of the heavens has on nature. Therefore, as they exist in the Word, things should be called life.

          <td>As they exist in the Word, things can be considered in two ways: in their relation to the Word and in their relation to things exist in their own natures. In both ways, the likeness of a creature in the Word is life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Illud enim proprie vivere dicimus quod in seipso habet principium motus vel operationis cuiuscumque. Ex hoc enim primo sunt dicta aliqua vivere, quia visa sunt in seipsis habere aliquid ea movens secundum quemcumque motum. Et hinc processit nomen vitae ad omnia quae in seipsis habent operationis propriae principium; unde et ex hoc quod aliqua intelligunt vel sentiunt vel volunt, vivere dicuntur, non solum ex hoc quod secundum locum moventur, vel secundum augmentum. Illud ergo esse quod habet res prout est movens seipsam ad operationem aliquam, proprie dicitur vita rei, quia vivere viventis est esse, ut in II de anima dicitur. In nobis autem nulla operatio ad quam nos movemus, est esse nostrum; unde intelligere nostrum non est vita nostra, proprie loquendo, nisi secundum quod vivere accipitur pro opere, quod est signum vitae; et similiter nec similitudo intellecta in nobis est vita nostra. Sed intelligere verbi est suum esse, et similiter similitudo ipsius; unde similitudo creaturae in verbo, est vita eius.
          <td>Now, we say that something lives in the proper sense if it has a principle of motion or of any activity whatsoever within it, for the primary reason why things are said to be alive is that they seem to have something within them moving them in some kind of motion. For this reason the word <i>life</i> is used of all things which have in them the principle of their own activity. Consequently, because certain things understand, feel, or will, they are said to be living—not merely because they move from place to place or because they increase in quantity. Hence, that act of existence which a thing has in so far as it moves itself to perform a certain action is properly called the life of the thing, because “the life of a living being is its act of existence,” as is said in <i>The Soul</i> . In our case, however, no action that we move ourselves to perform is our act of existence. Hence, properly speaking, to understand is not our life, unless to <i>live</i> is taken to mean the end-term of an operation; but this is merely a sign of life. Similarly, a likeness as conceived within us is not our life. On the other hand, he intellection of the Word is His act of existence, and so is the likeness of things He possesses. Therefore, a likeness of a creature existing in the Word is also His life.

          <td>Similiter etiam similitudo creaturae est quodammodo ipsa creatura, per modum illum quo dicitur, quod anima quodammodo est omnia.

Et ita similitudo creaturae in verbo est quodammodo creaturae vita.
          <td>Similarly, this likeness of the creature is, in a way, the creature itself—that is, in the same way that the soul is said to be, in some fashion, all things. Consequently, because the likeness of a creature existing within the Word in some way produces the creature and moves it as it exists in its own nature, the creature, in a sense, moves itself, and brings itself into being; that is, in view of the fact that it is brought into being, and is moved by its likeness existing in the Word. Thus the likeness of a creature in the Word is, in a certain sense, the very life of the creature itself.

          <td><b>Answers to Difficulties</b>
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod hoc quod creatura in verbo existens dicitur vita, non pertinet ad rationem propriam creaturae, sed ad modum quo est in verbo. Unde, cum non sit eodem modo in seipsa, non sequitur quod in seipsa vivat, quamvis in verbo sit vita; sicut non est in seipsa immaterialis, quamvis in verbo sit immaterialis. Sed bonitas, entitas, et huiusmodi, pertinent ad propriam rationem creaturae; et ideo, sicut secundum quod sunt in verbo, sunt bona, ita etiam secundum quod sunt in propria natura.
          <td>1. That a creature existing in the Word is called life does not pertain to the creature’s own nature, but to its manner of existence in the Word. Since it does not exist in this manner in itself, it does not follow that it fives in itself, even though it is life in the Word—any more than it follows that the thing is immaterial in itself because it is immaterial in the Word. On the other hand, goodness, being, and other things of this sort belong to the creature’s own nature. Hence, just as creatures good when existing in the Word, so also are they good when existing in their own nature.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad secundum dicendum, quod similitudines rerum in artifice non possunt proprie dici vita, quia non sunt ipsum esse artificis viventis, nec etiam ipsa eius operatio, sicut in Deo accidit; et tamen Augustinus dicit, quod arca in mente artificis vivit; sed hoc est secundum quod in mente artificis habet esse intelligibile, quod ad genus vitae pertinet
          <td>2. The likeness of things in an artist cannot be called life in the strict sense, because they are neither the very act of existence of the living artist nor the artist’s operation, as is true of God. It is true, however, as Augustine says, that “a cabinet existing in the mind of a cabinetmaker is living;” but this is because as it exists in his mind it possesses an intelligible act of existence, which belongs to the category of life.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad tertium dicendum, quod vita spiritui sancto attribuitur secundum hoc quod Deus dicitur vita rerum, prout ipse est in rebus omnibus movens eas, ut sic modo quodam omnes res a principio intrinseco motae videantur; sed vita appropriatur verbo secundum quod res sunt in Deo, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>3. Life is attributed to the Holy Spirit according as God is said to be the life of things, namely, as He is in all things and moves all things, with the result that all things seem to be moved, in some way, by an intrinsic principle. But life is appropriated to the Word according as things are in God. This is clear from what has been said.
        <tr valign="top" style="text-align:justify">
          <td>Ad quartum dicendum, quod similitudines rerum in verbo, sicut sunt rebus causa existendi, ita sunt rebus causa cognoscendi; inquantum scilicet imprimuntur intellectualibus mentibus, ut sic res cognoscere possint; et ideo, sicut dicuntur vita prout sunt principia existendi, ita dicuntur lux prout sunt principia cognoscendi.
          <td>4. just as the likenesses of things in the Word cause existence in things, so also they cause knowledge in things—that is, in so far as they are received into intelligences, thus causing them to be able to know things. Hence, just as these likenesses are called life because they are principles of existing, so are they also called light because they are principles of knowing.
