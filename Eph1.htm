    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Often, St. Thomas&#8217; citations of Scripture contain minor variations from the Clementine edition of the Vulgate. For\
 instance, he inserts here &#8220;so am I&#8221; after &#8220;They are ministers of Christ.&#8221; At other times his understanding of a Latin\
 word or phrase is different from the meaning which the Douay-Rheims translation of the Vulgate conveys. In both\
 these cases an asterisk (*) is placed immediately after the number of the verse; only significant variations will be\
 mentioned in the notes. The &#8220;seed of Abraham&#8221; in 2 Cor. 11:22 is taken by Aquinas as a reference to St. Paul&#8217;s faith\
 since &#8220;the men of faith are the real sons of Abraham.&#8221; (Gal. 3:7; also Gen. 15:6; Rom. 4:3,16). This provides the\
 three correlations:<\/p>\
<p style="text-align: center">Israelites&#8212;Paul&#8217;s Jewish origin<\/p>\
<p style="text-align: center">Seed of Abraham&#8212;Paul&#8217;s religious faith<\/p>\

<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote3 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas did not hesitate to apply several, or all, of the four metaphysical causes in his Scripture commentaries.\
 In the Prologues to these commentaries he usually discusses the author (efficient cause), while the final cause is more\
 often designated as the &#8220;subject matter,&#8221; the &#8220;intention of the author,&#8221; or the &#8220;utility&#8221; of the book or letter; cf.\
 Prologues to the Psalms (Viv&egrave;s Ed., t. 18, p. 228), to the Lamentations and Jeremiah (<i>ibid., <\/i>t. 19, pp. 66-67, 199);\
 they also appear in his introduction to the Pauline Corpus and many of Paul&#8217;s individual letters (Romans, Colossians,\
 Philippians, etc.). He also applies them in a commentary proper; for example, cf. his comments on Ephesians 1, Lect.\
 1; 2, Lects. 2 &amp; 5. On the development of this method, cf. Smalley, op. <i>cit., pp. <\/i>99, 116-17, 296-97; Spicq, op. cit.,\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Glossator in question is Peter Lombard (c. 1100-1160 A.D.), whose glosses on the Psalms and Pauline letters\
 superseded those of the <i>Glossa Ordinaria. <\/i>A gloss would offer some ancient text, in the present instance an Old or\
 New Testament book, accompanied by marginal and interlinear explanatory notes-usually quotations from the\
 Fathers of the Church. On the mysteries surrounding the <i>Glossa Ordinaria, <\/i>falsely attributed to Walafraid Strabo,\
 cf. Smalley, op. cit., pp. 55-66. 269.  When Aquinas refers to &#8220;the Gloss&#8221; he normally means Lombard&#8217;s <i>Collectanea\
 in Epistolis S. Pauli<\/i>, P.L. 191-92; thus of the thirteen references in his lectures on Ephesians to the Gloss all can be\
 located in Lombard and only five in the <i>Glossa Ordinaria<\/i>, from which Lombard probably lifted them. The statement\
 cited here is one of the five, it reads: &#8220;The Ephesians are Asians; having received the word of truth, they remained\
 steadfast in faith. The Apostle praises them, writing from a prison in Rome through Tychius, a deacon.&#8221; P.L. 114,\
 col. 587; 192, col. 169.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote5 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Ephesus, as a Greek city, owed its origin to the colonizing Ionians. It was an important port of Ancient Greece and\
 under Roman rule became part of the province of Asia. Although oriental influences were increasing, Asia Minor\
 was still predominantly Greek in language and culture when St. Paul travelled its roads. St. Thomas&#8217; use of &#8220;pars\
 Graeciae&#8221; need not, then, connote political ties. Latin classical authors often referred to Lower Italy, inhabited by\
 Greeks, as &#8220;Major Graecia,&#8221; and it may be in this more cultural sense that Aquinas thought of Asia Minor as &#8220;Part\
 of Greece.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote6 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>It is commonly held today that St. Paul is the author of this Letter, but this authorship need not imply that he wrote\
 every word of it. In his day dictation left more initiative to the scribes than that method does today. He probably\
 wrote or dictated it during his Roman imprisonment, sometime between 61 and 63 A.D. Few modern scholars,\
 however, maintain that it was addressed only to the Ephesian community. The &#8220;at Ephesus&#8221; of v.1 is missing from\
 the best Greek manuscripts. It seems that this was a circular letter&#8212;hence its more impersonal tone as compared with\
 other Pauline letters&#8212;intended for the Christian communities in Asia. Or, as P. Benoit, O.P., conjectures in his &#8220;les\
 Epitres de la captivit&eacute;&#8221; Bible de Jerusalem (Paris: Ed. du Cerf, 1949), p. 73, it may have been intended for all the\
 communities made up of recent converts from paganism. The &#8220;at Ephesus&#8221; was added later either because of the\
 connection between Eph. 6:21-22 and 2 Tim. 4:12, or because it was found among the papers of the Ephesian\
 Church.<\/p>\

 by the English &#8220;habit.&#8221; For him virtue, or &#8220;bonus habitus,&#8221; is a spiritually creative power which is the exact opposite\

  var WPFootnote10 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Appropriation occurs when an attribute which really belongs to the Divine Nature, and so is common to all Three\
 Persons, is attributed to one of the Persons. We do this because the divine activities by which God creates and\
 redeems us&#8212;his 11 ad extra&#8221; actions&#8212;are more easily grasped by us than the activity of his own inner life. Thus\
 we take events which the whole Trinity accomplished and attribute them to one or another Person in order to better\
 understand his personal properties, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 39, 7 and 8. For example, creation is attributed to the Father, truth to\
 the Son, and love as it effects our sanctification (grace and peace) to the Holy Spirit.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote11 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas was dimly aware of the Hebrew usage regarding verb tenses and its influence on New Testament\
 constructions, cf. Spicq, <i>op. cit.<\/i>, col. 706-07. His observation on the certainty of human salvation in Christ is\
 characteristic of Paul&#8217;s thought. In the final stages of his thought, represented in the Captivity Letters, the Apostle\
 views the temporal dimensions of our Christian existence in the light of the mystery of Christ already unifying the\
 world of men and the cosmic forces in his glorified existence. Cf. L. Cerfaux, <i>Christ in the Theology of St. Paul<\/i>\
 (New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1959), pp. 419-38, 532,-34; and D. M. Stanley, S.J., <i>Christ&#8217;s Resurrection in Pauline\
 Soteriology<\/i> (Rome: Institutum Biblicum, 1961), pp. 216-17.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote12 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The Augustine referred to is, of course, St. Augustine, the Bishop of Hippo and Doctor of the Church (354-430\
 A.D.). The work St. Thomas had in mind is most likely <i>De Trinitate <\/i>1, 8, n. 17 (P.L. 42, 831). When we see God\
 &#8220;face to face&#8221; (1 Cor. 13:12), &#8220;this contemplation is promised to us as the end of all our labors and the eternal\
 fullness of our joys... Contemplation is indeed the reward of faith, and our hearts are purified by faith in preparation\
 for this reward.&#8221; Translation of S. McKenna, C.SS.R. <i>Saint Augustine, The Trinity <\/i>(F.C. 1963), pp. 23-25. This idea\
 is expanded in the final two chapters of Book 22 of <i>The City of God. <\/i>The supernatural virtue of charity is the\
 &#8220;effective form&#8221; (<i>S.T.<\/i> II-II, 23, 8 ad 1) of all the other virtuous acts, and thus formally sanctifies us because it directs\
 us to God as he is in himself <i>(ibid., <\/i>23, 6c). The acts of any other virtue are holy only insofar as they share in this\
 Godward impulse of charity <i>(ibid., <\/i>23, 7 &amp; 8).<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote13 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Note that the six blessings developed in this lecture are offered to all mankind; this does not mean that they are\
 accepted by everyone. At the beginning of Lecture 5 Aquinas refers back to them as &#8220;the blessings offered generally\
 to all the faithful.&#8221; In the Second Lecture he opts for a less involved exegesis of vv. 3-7; however, his theological\
 reflections on these blessings remain valid. Many contemporary exegetes maintain that vv. 3-14 enumerate six\
 blessings given men by God, cf. K. Sullivan, R.S.C.J., <i>The Captivity Epistles <\/i>(Collegeville: The Liturgical Press,\
 1960), pp. 54-56.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote14 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Peter&#8217;s actions are not the cause of God&#8217;s willing him glory but they are <i>a <\/i>cause of his attaining glory. They are\
 a cause only because God has willed them to be such; as St. Thomas expresses it: &#8220;There can be no merit on the part\
 of man before God except on the presupposition that God has ordained it&#8221; (<i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 114, 1c). No one insists more\
 strongly than Aquinas on the sinner&#8217;s absolute dependence on God to justify him (<i>ibid., <\/i>113); but he equally insists\
 that God&#8217;s justifying word effects what it says. God&#8217;s love&#8212;unlike created love&#8212;presupposes no goodness but\
 rather creates that goodness (<i>ibid., <\/i>110, 1c). For a similar presentation in a scriptural perspective, cf. H. Kung,\
 &#8220;Justification and Sanctification in the New Testament,&#8221; in <i>Christianity Divided <\/i>(New York: Sheed &amp; Ward, 1962),\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>One created effect, i.e., a creature, existing prior to another may be the cause of this other existing also. If so, the\
 priority may be either of nature or of time depending on whether one views the succession of causes from the\
 evolutive perspective of the imperfect beings preceding the more perfect&#8212;which is temporal priority&#8212;or, from the\
 teleological perspective of nature intending the more perfect beings which the imperfect then strive to\
 attain&#8212;priority of nature; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 77, 4c; 85, 3 ad 1. For an enlightening presentation of these priorities, cf. B.\
 Lonergan, S.J., <i>Insight: A Study of Human Understanding <\/i>(New York: Philosophical Library, 1958); on a temporal\
 priority cf. the schemes of recurrence in emergent probability, pp. 115-28; on natural priority cf. the upward directed\
 dynamism of proportionate being, pp. 444-58, 665. Temporal succession does not affect God&#8217;s creative will-act\
 which is eternal and comprehends all times &#8220;tota simul&#8221;; cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 10, 1-4. For a further discussion of the freedom\
 in the divine creative and predestining will-acts cf. <i>ibid., <\/i>I, 19, 5; 23, 5.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote16 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>This views the relation of hands to the human mind in a teleological perspective. It is interesting to note that St.\
 Thomas saw in the coordination of the human mind and human hands the radical power for a limitless technology,\
 cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 76, 5 ad 4; 91, 3 ad 2. If the cause of the entire created universe was itself created it would perforce be\
 simply a part of this <i>created <\/i>universe and so push the investigation back a step further. Note that Aquinas conceived\
 the spiritual creation as included in this created universe, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 50, 1c; 61, 3 &amp; 4.<\/p>\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Pelagianism, one of the important heresies of the fifth and sixth centuries, owed its origin chiefly to Pelagius (c.\
 360-420 A.D.), who spread the teaching-some of which he learned from Rufinus&#8212;that human nature had not been\
 corrupted by original sin, and that man was not dependent on divine grace for his meritorious actions. In the present\
 context &#8220;ratio&#8221; is sometimes translated as &#8220;motive.&#8221; When St. Thomas asserts that &#8220;the reason for predestination is\
 the will of God alone&#8221; he is speaking in terms of the divine causality in itself (&#8220;ex parte volentis&#8221;). When seen in the\
 perspective of man (&#8220;ex parte voliti&#8221;) grace, as St. Thomas mentioned several lines above, is the reason of\

 respectively. The former is given to individuals for the utility of the whole Christian community, e.g., the grace of\
 prophecy; the latter effects the individual&#8217;s own personal sanctification, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I-II, 111, 1c; <i>S.C.G.<\/i> III, 154;<i> Comm.\

 God could be appeased only by terrible suffering on man~s part. The truly Christian notion of satisfaction was\
 spelled out by St. Thomas: &#8220;He properly satisfies for an offense who presents the offended party with something this\
 party loves just as much, or more, than he hates the offense.&#8221; <i>S.T.<\/i>, III, 48, 2c. Thus it is the <i>love <\/i>with which Christ\
 offered <i>himself <\/i>that made the passion a truly redeeming sacrifice (<i>ibid., <\/i>48, 3 &amp; 4).<\/p>\

 things in Christ. But he took it to mean the restoration of all things into their original, purely spiritual state. This\

<p style="text-align: justify">Not all the doctors agreed, however, on the listing of the First Hierarchy. St. John Chrysostom (c. 344-407 A.D.),\
 Patriarch of Constantinople and Doctor of the Church, put Powers in the place of Thrones, cf. C.V. Heris, O.P., <i>le\
 Gouvernement divin<\/i>, Vol. 1 (Paris: Ed. de Cerf, 1959) pp. 277-83. The Gregory here referred to is Pope St. Gregory\
 the Great (540-604 A.D.). He treats of the heavenly hierarchies in his <i>Homilia 34 in Evangelia, <\/i>P.L. 76, 1250-51.\
 During the Middle Ages, Dionysius was thought to be the Areopagite mentioned in Acts 17:34; this accounts for the\
 great authority his writings enjoyed. It is now established that he probably lived in Syria during the first half of the\
 fifth century. A Christian platonist and disciple of Proclus, his writings were translated into Latin by Scotus Erigena\
 around 858 A.D. St. Thomas took him as a primary witness to the immediate post-apostolic Church. He commented\
 on his <i>De Divinis Nominibus <\/i>and some have counted over 1,700 explicit references to Dionysius in Aquinas&#8217;\
 writings. Fortunately, this thorough acquaintance with Greek Oriental theology influenced Thomas&#8217; own thought\
 profoundly. Dionysius lists the angelic ranks in his <i>De Coelestia Hierarchia, <\/i>Ch. 77. (P.G. 3, 205 ff.).<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote35 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>Cf. his commentary on Colossians, Ch. 1, Lect. 4. This reference to his coming lectures on Colossians leads\
 Raphael Cai,O.P., to conclude that these lectures were given later on in the same scholastic year; cf. Cal&#8217;s Preface\
 to his edition of the Piana edition of Aquinas&#8217; lectures on the Pauline corpus (Rome: Marietti, 1953) Vol. 1, p. viii.<\/p>\

    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>These three types of causes are summed up in St. Thomas&#8217; <i>Commentary on the Metaphysics of Aristotle <\/i>(translated\
 by J. P. Rowan, Chicago: Henry Regnery Co., 1961, Vol. 2, p. 476, n. 1207): &#8220;Now we find three grades of causes\
 in the world. First, there is a cause which is incorruptible and immutable, namely, the divine cause; second, beneath\
 this there are causes which are incorruptible but mutable, namely, the celestial bodies; and third, beneath this there\
 are those causes which are corruptible and mutable. Therefore causes in this third grade are particular causes and\
 are determined to proper effects of the same kind; for example, fire generates fire, man generates man, and plants\
 generate plants.&#8221; In the present lecture St. Thomas refers to the third category as &#8220;determinatio ad speciales effectus&#8221;\
 which I have translated as &#8220;individual causes.&#8221; The celestial bodies are universal causes insofar as their causality\
 extends to all terrestrial alteration, generation and corruption (cf. Appendix on Thomas&#8217; cosmology). God&#8217;s causality\
 is most universal since its proper effect is existence itself: &#8220;Whatever exists, and in whatever way it exists, comes\
 properly under the causality and direction of that (first) cause.&#8221; (Rowan&#8217;s translation of the <i>Meta., ibid., <\/i>n. 1209).\
 I have translated &#8220;rationes rerum&#8221; by &#8220;intelligible patterns of things&#8221; or &#8220;of reality&#8221; since this would embrace formal,\
 efficient and final causality, as well as mirror closely the fluidity of Aquinas&#8217; usage of &#8220;rationes rerum.&#8221;<\/p>\

 so that it is connatural. to the spirits from the first instant of their existence, cf. <i>S.T.<\/i> I, 55, 2c; 106, 1-4. (This, of\
 course, applies only to knowledge connatural to angelic intelligences; regarding certain types of supernatural\
 knowledge, cf. Ch. 3, Lect. 3 below). St. Thomas often refers to the whole of spiritual creation as angelic or as\
 composed of angels; this must not be confused with the rank of Angels in the Lower Hierarchy.<\/p>\

 chemical name, revealing its chemical form or intelligible proportion, for what common experience designates as\
 water. For an analysis of the cognitive processes involved, and Aquinas&#8217; terminology, cf. B. Lonergan, &#8220;The Concept\
 of <i>Verbum <\/i>in the Writings of St. Thomas Aquinas,&#8221; T.S., September 1946, pp. 349-92, especially pp. 349-72.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote40 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The concept of the Church as the &#8220;fullness&#8221; or <i>pleroma <\/i>of Christ is an important one for Paul. The sanctifying\
 power of Divinity is &#8220;concentrated&#8221; in the risen body of Christ (cf. Cerfaux, <i>op..cit., pp. <\/i>426-29). But the Church\
 is also the body of Christ: &#8220;This &#8216;fullness&#8217; which is present in Christ is less static than dynamic;&#8217; it is directed towards\
 the sanctification of Christians through him... And so we can say that Christ is the sanctifying fullness of Christians.\
 In keeping with this formula, but taking <i>pleroma <\/i>in the passive and concrete sense to mean the entirety of those who\
 receive life and sanctification from Christ, Paul writes that the Church is the body of Christ, his <i>pleroma, <\/i>that is to\
 say, the sphere in which is exercised the power of life and sanctification of him who &#8216;fulfills&#8217; holiness completely\
 in all (Eph. 1:23).&#8221; L. Cerfaux, <i>The Church in the Theology of St. Paul <\/i>(New York: Herder &amp; Herder, 1959), pp.\
 322-23. The intimate union between the risen body of Christ and the Church (cf. S.T. 111, 8, 2) is certainly stressed\
 by St. Thomas when he uses the relationship of soul and body to enunciate analogously the relation between Christ\
 and the Church, his <i>pleroma.<\/i><\/p>\

      Although St. Paul did not initiate the Ephesians into the faith, the
      Apostle is justly praised for having strengthened them in it. Of the
      Church at Ephesus he rightfully can claim:
      <span style="font-weight: bold">I have strengthened its pillars</span> —I
      who am an Israelite in nationality, a Christian in religion, an Apostle in
      dignity.

      Everyone who proclaims saving wisdom, like Paul, must be an Israelite in

      in his function’s authority.

              fortify him against becoming spiritless; similarly, Paul has
              strengthened the Ephesians not to fear unreasonably. In this
              connection, Psalm 89 (21-22) says of David: “I have found David my

                >I have strengthened its pillars</span
              >, namely, the Church’s faithful at Ephesus. They are referred to
              as pillars since they must be straightforward, upright, and
              strong—straightfoward through faith, upright through hope, and
              strong because of charity. I say straightforward through faith
              because faith reveals the straight and true way to arrive at the
              fatherland; it is symbolized by the pillar of cloud in Exodus 13
              (21): “And the Lord went before them to show the way by day in a
              pillar of a cloud.” Faith, similar to clouds, is opaque with its
              mysteries, dissolves when it gives way to vision, and moistens by
              arousing devotion. [The faithful are] upright through hope, for
              hope points heavenwards; it is symbolized by the column of smoke
              in Judges 20 (40): “The signal rose from the city as a pillar of
              smoke.” Hope, like smoke from fire, springs from charity, ascends
              upward, and finally vanishes in glory. [The faithful must be]
              strong through charity, “for love is strong as death” (Cant. 8:6);
              hence, it is symbolized by a pillar of fire capable of consuming
              everything, as in Wisdom 18 (3): “Therefore, [they received] a
              burning pillar of fire for a guide on the unknown journey.” As
              fire makes the surroundings visible, puts metals to the test, and
              destroys what can burn, so charity enlightens human actions,
              examines one’s motives, and exterminates all vices.

      They were not initiated into the faith by the Apostle Paul but he did
      strengthen them in it. Even before he had met them, they had been
      converted, as can be gathered from Acts 19 (1): “It happened that, while
      Appollo was at Corinth, Paul passed through the upper country and came to
      Ephesus, where he found certain disciples.” Once they were converted and
      fortified by the Apostle, they were steadfast in the faith, not succumbing
      to false doctrine. Thus, they were entitled to encouragement rather than
      reprimand; and Paul’s letter has a tone of reassurance and not of rebuke.
      He wrote them from the city of Rome through the deacon, Tychicus.”</a

    for soul and for body. For then the body will be spiritual: “It is sown a

    <span style="font-weight: bold">in heavenly places</span>, that is, in

    But when the primary effect [i.e., the perfection of the Universe] is
    arrived at, no further reason can be given for that effect except the divine
    will. For instance, God wills that men should have hands that they might be
    of service to his mind;
    <a href="javascript:WPShow('WPFootnote16',%20WPFootnote16%20)"
      ><img

    and [he wills] man to possess a mind since he wills him to be a man; and he
    wills man to exist for the sake of the perfection of the Universe. Now since
    this is what is primarily effected in creation, no further reason for the
    Universe can be assigned within the domain of creatures themselves; [it
    lies] rather within the domain of the Creator, which is the Divine Will.

            the power of the giver,

            offered by someone in power, as a king or prince, and is presented
            by a solemn messenger, for example, by his son.

            our Father from whom every good comes: “Every good giving and every
            perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights”
            (Jam. 1:17). And the Lord Jesus Christ without whom no blessings are
            given. That is why nearly all the [liturgical] prayers are concluded

            It must be through contact with fire that something starts to burn
            since nothing obtains a share in some reality except through
            whatever is that reality by its very nature. Hence the adoption of
            sons has to occur through the natural son. For this reason the
            Apostle adds
            <span style="font-weight: bold">through Jesus Christ</span>, which
            is the third characteristic touched on in this blessing, namely, the
            mediator who draws all to himself. “God sent his Son, made of a
            woman, made under the law, that he might redeem them who were under
            the law, that we might receive the adoption of sons” (Gal. 4:4-5).
            This is accomplished
            <span style="font-weight: bold">unto himself</span>, that is,
            inasmuch as we are conformed to him and become servants in the
            Spirit. “See what love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we
            should be called the sons of God; and so we are,” after which comes:
            “We know that when he shall appear we shall be like him” (1 Jn.
            3:1-2).

            Here it should be noted that the likeness of the predestined to the
            Son of God is twofold. One is imperfect, it is [the likeness]
            through grace. It is called imperfect, firstly, becatise it only
            concerns the reformation of the soul. Regarding this Ephesians 4
            (23-24) states: “Be renewed in the spirit of your mind, and put on
            the new man, who according to God is created in justice and holiness
            of truth.” Secondly, even with the soul it retains some
            imperfection, “for we know in part” (1 Cor. 13:9). However, the
            second likeness, which will be in glory, will be perfect; both as
            regards the body—“He will transform our lowly body to be like his
            glorious body.” (Phil. 3:21)—and in regard to the soul—“when the
            perfect comes, the imperfect shall pass away” (1 Cor. 13:10).

            God which will exist in the fatherland. In reference to this
            adoption Romans 8 (23) asserts: “Even we ourselves groan within

            Divine predestination is neither necessitated on God’s part nor due
            to those who are predestined; it is rather
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >according to the purpose of his will</span

            to us, for it springs from pure love. Predestination, according to
            [how man] conceives it, presupposes election, and election love. A
            twofold cause of this immense blessing is designated here. One is
            the efficient cause— which is the simple will of God—
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >according to the purpose of his will</span
            >. “Therefore, he has mercy on whomever he wills; and whomever he
            wills he hardens” (Rom. 9:18). “Of his own will he has given us
            birth by the word of truth (Jam. 1:18).

            specifies the final cause which is that we may praise and know the
            goodness of God. Once again this eminent blessing is recommended
            inasmuch as the homage [it results in] is in accord with itself. For
            the [efficient] cause of divine predestination is simply the will of
            God, while the end is a knowledge of his goodness.

            Whence it should be realized that Gods will in no way has a cause
            but is the first cause of everything else. Nevertheless, a certain
            motive can be assigned to it in two ways. On the part of the one
            willing, the motive for the divine will is his own goodness which is
            the object of the divine will, moving it to act. Hence, the reason
            for everything that God wills is his own goodness: “Yahweh has made
            everything for his own purpose” (Prov. 16:4). On the side of what is
            willed, however, some created existent can be a motive for the
            divine will; for example, when he wills to crown Peter because he
            has fought well (cf. 2 Tim. 4:7-8). But this latter is not the cause
            of [God’s] willing; rather it is a cause of it happening the way it
            did.

            In this perspective, neither can predestination find any reason on
            the part of the creature but only on the part of God. For there are
            two effects of predestination, grace and glory. Within the realm of
            what is willed [by God], grace can be identified as a reason for the
            effects which are oriented towards glory. For example, God crowned
            Peter because he fought well, and he did this because he was
            strengthened in grace. But no reason for the grace, as a primary
            effect, can be found on the part of man himself which would also be
            the reason for predestination. This would be to assert that the
            source of good works was in man by himself and not by grace. Such
            was the heretical teaching of the Pelagians who held that the source
            of good works exists within ourselves. Thus it is evident that the
            reason for predestination is the will of God alone, on account of
            which the Apostle says
            <span style="font-weight: bold"

            To understand how God creates everything and wills it because of his
            own goodness, it should be realized that someone can work for an end
            in two ways. [A person may act] either in order to attain an end, as
            the sick take medicine to regain their health; or [he may act] out
            of a love of spreading the end, as a doctor will work to communicate
            health to others. But God needs absolutely nothing external to
            himself, according to Psalm 16 (2): “Yahweh, you are my Lord; you
            are my Good; there is none above you. [Vul: you have no need of my
            goods].” Therefore, when it is said that God wills and performs
            everything on account of his own goodness, this should not be
            understood as though he acted in order to confer goodness on himself
            but rather to communicate goodness to others.

            This divine goodness is properly communicated to rational creatures

            for his own praise and glory, according to Isaiah 43 (7): “Everyone
            called by my name, whom I have created for my glory, whom I have
            formed and made” so that he may know what goodness is, and in this

            for he gives it without any preceding merits when men are unworthy
            of it. “God proves his love for us in that while we were yet sinners

      (Lk. 24:46-47).

              Hence he first asserts: We are predestined unto the adoption of
              sons, for the praise of the glory of his grace—that grace, I say,
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >in which he hath graced us in his beloved Son</span
              >. In this respect, it should be noted that to be loved by someone
              is identical to being pleasing to him. For he is pleasing to ine
              whom I love. Now, since God loved us from eternity—he chose us
              before the foundation of the world in love, as has been said
              (1:4)—how has he made us pleasing to himself in time? A reply is
              that those whom he loves eternally in himself, he renders pleasing
              [to himself] in time according as they exist in their own natures.
              The former [his love] is from eternity and is not created, the
              latter happens in time and is said to come into being. Hence the
              Apostle says that
              <span style="font-weight: bold">he hath graced us</span>, that is,
              made us pleasing that we should be worthy of his love. “See what
              love the Father has bestowed upon us, that we should be called the
              sons of God; ans so we are” (1 Jn. 3:1).

              Notice how persons can be loved for the sake of others, or for
              their own sake. For when I love someone very much, I love him and
              whatever belongs to him. We are loved by God, not for what we are
              in ourselves, but in him who by himself is beloved of the Father.
              Thus the Apostle adds
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in his beloved Son</span>
              on account of whom he loves us and to the degree that we are like
              him. For love is based on similarity: “Every beast loves its like:
              so also every man his neighbor” (Sir. 13:15). By his own nature,
              the Son is similar to the Father, he is beloved before all else
              and essentially. Hence he is naturally, and in a most excellent
              way, loved by the Father. We, on the other hand, are sons through
              adoption to the degree that we are conformed to his Son; in this
              way we enjoy a certain participation in the divine love. “The
              Father loves the Son, and has given all things into his hand. He
              who believes in the Son has life everlasting” (Jn. 3:35-36). “He
              has transferred us into the kingdom of the Son he loves” (Col. 1:
              13).

              On the part of Christ he writes of two ways through which Christ
              has made us pleasing [to God]. For within us there exists two
              antagonisms to the divine good pleasure, the stains of sin and the
              punishing injuries [sin inflicts]. justice is as opposed to sin as
              life is to death, so that through sin, having departed from our
              likeness to God, we cease being pleasing to God. But through
              Christ he has made us pleasing. First, indeed, by abolishing the
              punishment; and in reference to this he says that in Christ
              <span style="font-weight: bold">we have redemption</span>
              from the slavery of sin. “You know that you were not redeemed with
              corruptible things, as gold or silver, from the vain manner of
              life handed down from your fathers: but with the precious blood of
              Christ, as of a lamb unspotted and undefiled” (1 Pet. 1:18-19).

              liberati sumus, quia moriendo pro nobis satisfecit Deo patri, et
              sic abolita est noxa culpae. Unde dicit
              <i>in remissionem peccatorum</i>. Io. I, 29:
              <i>ecce agnus Dei, ecce qui tollit peccata mundi</i>. Lc. ult. 46:

              Secondly, we are said to be redeemed because through Christ we are
              freed from a slavery in which we were caught as a result of sin
              without ourselves being capable of fully making satisfaction. By
              dying for us, Christ has satisfied the Father and thus the penalty
              of sin was abolished.

              In this regard it should be known that the customary procedure of
              the Apostle, when speaking of a difficult subject, is to explain
              what went before by what immediately follows. This is not verbal
              proliferation but an exposition; and this is the method the
              Apostle uses here. Retaining the same import of the words, we may
              divide it differently from the beginning (v. 3) into three

              First, he treats of election, for there are two types of election,
              one involving a present justification and another an eternal
              predestination. Concerning the first John 6 (71) states: “Have not
              I chosen you twelve? And one of you is a devil?” But this is not
              what the Apostle refers to since it did not occur
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >before the foundation of the world</span
              >. So he immediately clarifies what he means, that it is the
              second type, eternal predestination. Thus he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Who hath predestinated us</span
              >... (v. 5). As he said
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in Christ</span>
              (v. 3) to signify that we are assimilated and conformed to Christ
              in proportion as we are [God’s] adopted children, so he adds
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >unto the adoption of children through Jesus Christ</span
              >. What he means by
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in charity</span>
              he explains when he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >In whom we have redemption through his blood</span
              >. As though he affirmed: We have, etc.

      Whence the rashness—not to say error—of those who dare equate the grace
      and glory of some saints with that of the Apostles. For this passage
      openly asserts that the Apostles are more fully graced than the other
      saints, except for Christ and his Virgin Mother. However, should it be
      claimed that other saints were able to merit as much as the Apostles
      merited, and consequently would have as much grace, it must be said that
      this would be a good argument if grace was given according to merits—but
      if that were the case, “grace is no more grace” (Rom. 11:6).

    1:22)—and of his own absolute inability to live up to the prescriptions of
    the written Law. Thus men, no longer trusting in their own wisdom and power,
    would not consider Christ’s advent as unimportant. Weak, and to a certain
    extent ignorant, they would eagerly desire the Christ.

    reconciles heavenly and earthly realities: “Making peace through the blood

            Greater dignity was preordained by God to some saints, and hence he
            infused grace more abundantly into them. For example, he imparted a
            unique grace to Christ as man when he assumed [the humanity] into
            the unity of the [Second] Person. He endowed with special graces in
            both her body and soul, the glorious Virgin Mary whom he chose to be
            his mother. Similarly, those God called to a unique dignity, the
            Apostles, were gifted with a corresponding favor of grace. Thus the
            Apostle states in Romans 8 (23): “ourselves also, who have the first
            fruits of the Spirit.” And a Gloss comments: “their share is first

            God’s grace has superabounded in the Apostles, [enriching them] with
            all wisdom. For the Apostles are set over the Church to be her
            pastors: “And I will give you pastors according to my own heart: and
            they shall feed you with knowledge and doctrine” (Jer. 3:15). Two
            qualities should characterize pastors: a profound knowledge of
            divine truths and an assiduous fulfillment of religious actions.
            They must teach those trusted to them the true faith; this requires
            that wisdom which consists in a knowledge of the divine, concerning
            which he remarks
            <span style="font-weight: bold">in all wisdom</span>. “For I will
            give you a mouth and wisdom, which all your adversaries shall not be
            able to resist and gainsay” (Lk. 21:15). They also need
            <span style="font-weight: bold">prudence</span>
            to guide their subjects in external and temporal affairs: “Be
            therefore prudent as serpents and simple as doves” (Mt. 10:16). Thus
            the special blessing of wisdom given to the Apostles is clearly
            expressed.

            like; rather, it concerns Christ alone. “I decided not to know any
            thing among you, but Jesus Christ, and him crucified” (1 Cor. 2:2).

            Now the mystery of the Incarnation has God’s will as its cause since
            he willed to become incarnate on account of his intense love for
            men: “For God so loved the world, as to give his only begotten Son”
            (Jn. 3:16). Yet God’s will is more hidden than anything else: “No
            one knows what pertains to God, but the Spirit of God” (1 Cor.
            2:11). So, the cause of the Incarnation was concealed from everyone
            except those to whom God revealed it through the Holy Spirit, as the
            Apostle mentions: “God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For
            the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God” (1 Cor.
            2:10). Hence he affirms
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >that he might make known the mystery</span
            >
            which is a sacred secret—a secret because it is
            <span style="font-weight: bold">of his will</span>. “I thank you,
            Father, Lord of heaven and earth, for hiding these things from the
            wise and clever and revealing them to little children” (Mt. 11:25).
            “The mystery, hidden from ages and generations, and now made
            manifest to his saints, to whom God would make known the riches of
            the glory of this mystery.” (Col. 1:26-27).

            He then explains something about this mystery (vv. 9-10). His

            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >that he might make known unto us the mystery of his will</span
            >, which mystery is

              >to re-establish all things in Christ</span
            >, that is, through Christ. All, namely, that are in heaven and on
            earth. This re-establishment in Christ must be
            <span style="font-weight: bold"
              >in the dispensation of the fulness of times</span

            which, in turn, is
            <span style="font-weight: bold">according to his good pleasure</span

            cause, the temporal fitness [of its appearance], and its purpose.

            briefly sums up the cause. Although whatever pleases God is good,
            goodness is preeminently (<i>antonomostice</i>) suited to God’s
            pleasure in this [effecting of the Incarnation] because through it
            we are led to perfectly enjoy goodness. As Psalm 146 (11) declares:
            “Yahweh is pleased with those who fear him, who rely on his
            strength”; and Romans 12 (2): “that you may prove what is the good

              Nonetheless, three sins must be avoided. First, is superstition;
              for any religion which is shallow and immoral is superstition. The
              forbidden sin of superstition would be incurred when the casting
              of lots is performed in league with the devil. For instance,
              Ezechiel 21 (26) relates how: “the king of Babylon stood in the
              highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling
              arrows: he consulted the idols and looked at the liver.” The
              shuffling of the arrows is related to sortilege, and the
              questioning of idols belongs to superstition. Sortilege, moreover,
              is condemmed there (Ez. 21) among sins pertaining to superstition.

              Secondly, the sin of tempting God must be shunned. As long as a
              man can discover and accomplish by himself what he ought to do, he
              tempts God if he resorts to lots, or any other such method, to
              ascertain what he should do. Only when unavoidably threatened by
              situations where one is powerless by himself can a man licitly
              resort to [extraordinary ways of] questioning God concerning what
              he must do. “But as we know not what to do, we can only turn our
              eyes to you” (2 Par. 20:12). Vanity is the third sin. It is
              committed if we inquire into futile matters not pertaining to us;
              for example, contingent events in the future. “It is not for you
              to know the times or moments, which the Father hath put in his own
              power” (Ac. 1:7).

              Consultatory lots are used when someone doubts what he should do
              and consults God by casting lots. Jonas 1 (7) recounts how, when
              the great storm came upon them at sea, they cast lots to seek
              information from God that they might know for whose sin the
              tempest had occurred. This method is licit, especially in
              necessities and in the elections of secular rulers. Hence, men
              will make small wax balls called “bussuli,” of which some contain
              slips of paper and others none. Whoever draws a “bussulus” with
              the paper inside has a voice in the election. This was done also,
              previous to the Holy Spirit’s coming, in spiritual elections,
              evidenced in the choice of Mathias by lot (Ac. 1:26). Now that the
              Holy Spirit has come, however, it is no longer lawful in these
              elections since making. use of them would be an insult to the Holy
              Spirit. It must be believed, after all, that the Holy Spirit will
              provide his Church with good pastors. After the Holy Spirit’s
              advent, therefore, when the Apostles chose the seven deacons (cf.
              Ac. 6), they did not cast lots. Thus, this method is not lawful in
              any ecclesiastical election.

      and perhaps this is a better rendering. For a pledge differs from the
      object in place of which it is given, and it must be returned once he who
      has received the pledge obtains the object due him. An earnest, however,
      does not differ from the object in place of which it is given, nor is it
      returned since it is a partial payment of the price itself, which is not
      to be withdrawn but completed. God communicates charity to us as a pledge,
      through the Holy Spirit who is the spirit of truth and love. Hence, this
      is nothing else than an individual and imperfect participation in the
      divine charity and love; it must not be withdrawn but brought to
      perfection. More fittingly, therefore, it is referred to as an earnest
      rather than as a pledge.

              The Apostle mentions the threefold recommendation of this preached
              word. It is, first of all, true;
              <span style="font-weight: bold">a word of truth</span>. Indeed, it
              could be nothing else since its source is Christ concerning whom
              John 17 (17) states: “Your word is truth.” And James 1 (18): “For
              of his own will he has begotten us by the word of truth.”
              Secondly, it is a proclamation of good news. Hence he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">the gospel</span>: it announces
              the highest good and eternal life. “Word of faith” is preeminently
              (<i>antonomastice</i>) applicable to the Gospel as the
              communication of the highest good. “How beautiful upon the
              mountains are the feet of him who brings good news and preaches
              salvation... Go up on a high mountain, lady-messenger of Sion (Is.
              52:7; 40:9). This refers to future goods. The present goods are
              what describe and recommend [Christian preaching] in the third
              place, for it saves. Thus he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">of your salvation</span>; if
              believed in, it gives salvation. “I am not ashamed of the gospel.
              For it is the power of God unto salvation to all who believe”
              (Rom. 1:16). “Now I make known unto you, brothers, the gospel
              which I preached to you, which also you have received and wherein
              you stand, by which also you are saved” (1 Cor. 15:1).

              He is a sign inasmuch as through him charity is infused into our
              hearts, thereby distinguishing us from those who are not the
              children of God. Relating to this be says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">you were signed</span>, set apart
              from Satan’s fold. “Grieve not the holy Spirit of God; whereby you
              are sealed unto the day of redemption” (Eph. 4:30). Just as men
              brand a mark on their own herds to differentiate them from others,
              so the Lord willed to seal his own flock, his people, with a
              spiritual sign. The Lord had the Jews as his own people in the Old
              Testament. “And you, my flocks, the flocks of my pastures are men”
              (Ez. 34:31). “And we are the people of his pasture and the sheep
              of his hand” (Ps. 95:7). This flock was fed on the earthly
              pastures of material teachings and temporal goods: “If you be
              willing and obedient, you shall eat the good things of the land”
              (Is. 1:19). The Lord, therefore, differentiated and set them apart
              from others by means of the bodily sign of circumcision. “And my
              covenant shall be in your flesh” (Gen. 17:13); before this it
              says, “You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, that it
              may be for a sign of the covenant between me and you” (Gen.
              17:11).

              In the New Testament the flock he had is the Christian people:
              “You have returned to the shepherd and guardian of your souls” (1
              Pet. 2:25). “My sheep hear my voice; and I know them; and they
              follow me” (Jn. 10:27). This flock is fed on the pastures of
              spiritual doctrine and spiritual favors; hence the Lord
              differentiated it from others by a spiritual sign. This is the
              Holy Spirit through whom those who are of Christ are distinguished
              from the others who do not belong to him. But since the Holy
              Spirit is love, he is given to someone when that person is made a
              lover of God and neighbor. “God’s love has been poured into our
              hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been given to us” (Rom.
              5:5). Therefore, the distinctive sign is charity which comes from
              the Holy Spirit: “By this shall all men know that you are my
              disciples, if you have love one for another” (Jn. 13:35). The Holy
              Spirit is he by whom we are signed.

              The Spirit is described as a promise for three reasons. First, he
              is promised to those who believe: “I will put a new spirit within
              you... And I will give you a new spirit” (Ez. 36:26, 37:6).
              Secondly, he is given with a certain promise, by the very fact
              that he is given to us we become the children of God. For through
              the Holy Spirit we are made one with Christ: “Anyone who does not
              have the Spirit of God, does not belong to him” (Rom. 8:9). As a
              result of being made adopted children of God, we have the promise
              of an eternal inheritance since “if sons, heirs also” (Rom. 8:17).

              est spiritus promissionis, et ipsemet est signum promissionis

              Thirdly, he is termed a pledge inasmuch as he makes us certain of
              the promised inheritance. Adopting us into the children of God,
              the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of promise who also is the seal of
              the promise yet to be attained.

              Nevertheless, it can also be called a pledge. For through the Holy
              Spirit God grants us a variety of gifts. Some of these will remain
              in the fatherland, as charity which “never comes to an end” (1
              Cor. 13:8); while others will not last on account of their
              imperfection, such as faith and hope “which shall be done away”
              with (<i>ibid.</i>, v. 10). Hence, the Spirit is called an earnest
              in reference to what will remain, and a pledge with respect to
              what will be done away with.

              nation, a purchased people” (1 Pet. 2:9) “which he has purchased
              with his own blood” (Ac. 20:28).

              Christ acquired this people, not because they never were his, but
              because they previously belonged to him and yet, by sinning, had
              sold themselves into a diabolical slavery which oppressed them. So
              it does not simply state that he acquired them but adds

              to say: You are not strictly a new acquisition; you are
              re-purchased from the slavery of the devil through his blood. “You
              were not redeemed with corruptible things as gold or silver, from
              the vain manner of life handed down from your fathers, but with
              the precious blood of Christ” (1 Pet. 1:18-19). Christ purchased
              us, therefore, through a redemption; not that this added anything
              to God since he needs none of our goods. “If you are rigtheous,
              what do you give him [God], or what does he receive of thy hand?”
              (Job 35:7). The purpose for which Christ acquired us is unto the
              praise of his glory, that God himself be praised since “everyone
              who is called by my name, I have created him for my glory” (Is.
              43:7).

              There were two good things which he heard about them. One was
              their faith by which they were properly orientated toward God;
              regarding this he remarked:
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >Wherefore, I also, hearing of your faith that is in the Lord
                Jesus</span
              >. Indeed, faith makes God dwell in man: “That Christ may dwell by
              faith in your hearts” (Eph. 3:17). Again, it purifies hearts:
              “purifying their hearts by faith” (Ac. 15:9). Moreover, it
              justifies without recourse to the Law: “for we account a man to be
              justified by faith, without the works of the law” (Rom. 3:28). The
              second good is love by which they are properly orientated toward
              their neighbor; in reference to this he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">and of your love</span>
              consisting in works of charity. This love is a spirittial sign
              that a man is a disciple of Christ: “A new commandment I give you:
              that you love one another, as I have loved you, so also you must
              love one another. By this shall all men know that you are my
              disciples, if you have love one for another” (Jn. 13:34-35). This
              <span style="font-weight: bold">love</span>, I say,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">is towards all the saints</span>.
              For everyone whom we love with charity, we ought to love either
              because they are holy or in order that they become holy. “While we
              have time, let us work good to all men, but especially to those
              who are of the household of the faith” (Gal. 6:10).

              It must be acknowledged, at this point, that our Lord Jesus Christ
              is both God and man. Insofar as be is man, be is related to God,
              since he is composed of body and soul, both of which, being
              creatures, are necessarily related to God. But according as he is
              God, he is related to the Father. “I ascend to my Father and to
              your Father, to my God and to your God” (Jn. 20:17). Likewise, as
              God he is the glory of the Father: “who, being the brightness of
              his glory, and the figure of his substance” (Heb. 1:3). He is also
              our glory because he himself is life eternal: “We are in his true
              Son, Jesus Christ. This is the true God and eternal life” (1 Jn.
              5:20). Therefore, he states
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >the God of our Lord Jesus Christ</span

              and charity. These they already possessed, as is evident. Then
              there are other special gifts; be prays that they receive these.
              First is the gift of wisdom when be says the spirit of wisdom whom
              no one can bestow except God: “Who ever knew your counsel, unless
              you had given wisdom, and sent thy Holy Spirit from above” (Wis.
              9:17). The second gift prayed for is that of understanding which
              consists in the revelation of spiritual mysteries that God alone
              can give: “There is a God in heaven who reveals mysteries” (Dan.
              2:28).

              To the gift of wisdom belongs the knowledge of divine realities.
              Hence, to ask for the gift of wisdom is to ask that they enjoy a
              knowledge of God. He begs for this in saying
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in the knowledge of him</span>, as
              if to say: I ask that, through the spirit of wisdom, you may have
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >the eyes of your heart enlightened in</span
              >
              a clearer
              <span style="font-weight: bold">knowledge of</span>
              God. “Look at me, answer me, Yahweh my God! Enlighten my eyes;
              turn away the sleep of death” (Ps. 12:4). This is the opposite of
              those whose eyes are enlightened only with respect to temporal
              reality when it is more necessary and more glorious to know God.
              “Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom... and let not the rich
              man glory in his riches: but let anyone who boasts glory in this,
              that he understands and knows me” (Jer. 9:23-24).

              Three aspects pertain to the gift of understanding, one of which
              has reference to the present life, and two to the future. Hope,
              which is necessary for salvation, belongs to the present
              condition: “for we are saved by hope” (Rom. 8:24). Concerning this
              he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">that you may know what</span>,
              that is, how great

              meaning the virtue of hope and what an immense reality it is
              concerned with. This [hope] is of the utmost importance because it
              concerns the greatest realities: “He hath given us a new birth to
              a living hope, by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead”
              (1 Pet. 1:3). It is also the strongest of the virtues: “that we
              who have fled for refuge may have strong encouragement to hold
              fast to the hope set before us. This we have as a sure and firm
              anchor of the soul, which enters [the sanctuary] behind the veil”

              Yet, since what we hope for concerns the future life, the other
              two aspects [of the gift of understanding] pertain to the future.
              One, the essential reward, is common to all the just; regarding
              which he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the
                saints</span
              >. Here he writes down four characteristics of those gifts. First,
              they are most abundant, which he implies in
              <span style="font-weight: bold">riches</span>. “He who obeys me
              will dwell secure, and be at ease without fear of evil” (Prov.
              1:33); “Glory and wealth shall be in his house” (Ps. 112:3);
              “Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and prosperity”
              (Prov. 8:18). Secondly, they have the greatest clarity, regarding
              which he says <span style="font-weight: bold">of glory</span>,
              “Glory, honor and peace to everyone who does good” (Rom. 2:10).
              Thirdly, they are the most enduring, in reference to which he
              states <span style="font-weight: bold">of his inheritance</span>,
              for what is hereditary is possessed permanently. “His goods will
              be established” (Ecclus. 31:11); “Yahweh, you have portioned my
              cup of smooth wine; you have cast my lot. The lines have fallen on
              rich land for me; the Most High has marked out my estate.” (Ps.
              16:5). Fourthly, he indicates that they will be most profound, as
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in the saints</span>. “The
              sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared with the
              glory to come that shall be revealed in us” (Rom. 8:18); “for this
              slight momentary affliction is preparing for us an incomparable
              eternal weight of glory” (2 Cor. 4:17).

              in reference to the future glory pertains especially to the
              Apostles. Hence he asks
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >that you may know... what is the exceeding greatness of his
                power towards us</span
              >, the Apostles. He seems to say: Although he bestows the riches
              of his glory abundantly on all the saints, he grants them in an
              exceedingly great measure to the Apostles. For the greatness of a
              power is gauged by what it does. Hence, the more the divine power
              accomplishes in someone, the more is that divine power revealed
              there—even though it is one and undivided in itself. Therefore,
              since a greater effect of the divine power is present in the
              Apostles, the greatness of this power will reside in them.

      Dionysius, [starting from the highest] and going down, places the
      Dominions as first in the Middle Hierarchy, the Virtues second, and the
      Powers third. In the first rank of the Lower Hierarchy he puts the
      Principalities, second are the Archangels and third are the Angels. This
      listing of the ranks is in accord with the present text where the Apostle

      Therefore, the governance of reality in relation to God pertains to the
      First Hierarchy. On this account, the ranks of that hierarchy are named
      with reference to God. The Seraphim are so called because they are burning
      with love and through it are united to God. The Cherubim are, as it were,
      radiant inasmuch as they possess a supereminent knowledge of divine
      mysteries. The Thrones are so termed inasmuch as in them God carries out
      his judgments. Of these three ranks the Apostle makes no mention here.

            The divine activity in Christ is the form and exemplar of the divine
            activity in us. In reference to this he states

            mightily act in us. “We await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who
            will transfigure our wretched body to be like his glorious body by
            the power which enables him to subject all things to himself” (Phil.
            3:20-21). In Scripture we frequently read that we will be exalted in
            the likeness of Christ’s exaltation. For example, Romans 8 (17):
            “...provided we suffer with him, so as also to be glorified with
            him.” Or the Apocalypse 3 (21): “He who conquers I will grant him to

            <span style="font-weight: bold">Setting him on his right hand</span>
            refers to the second [element in Christ’s exaltation]. This height
            of glory can be viewed in three perspectives: in its relation to
            God, to material creatures, and to spiritual creatures. Considered
            in relation to God, he is seated at his right hand; this is not to
            be thought of as a bodily organ—“God is a Spirit” (Jn. 4:24)—but as
            a metaphorical way of speaking. The right hand is taken as a nobler
            and stronger part of man; so when we say that Christ Jesus is seated
            at the right hand of God, it should be understood that according to
            his humanity he partakes of the Father’s choicest blessings, and
            according to his divinity it is understood as equality with the
            Father. “Yahweh spoke to my lord: Take the throne at my right” (Ps.
            109: 1); and the last chapter of Mark (16:19): “And the Lord Jesus,
            after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat on the
            right hand of God.”

            Since everything that happens among creatures occurs with the
            assistance of the angels, the three angelic hierarchies are
            distinguished according to the threefold way of conceiving the
            structure of reality. To one it belongs to grasp the intelligible
            patterns of things in the very summit of reality, God; it pertains
            to another to grasp the intelligible patterns of reality in the
            universal causes; while still another [understands these patterns]
            in the individual causes. For the higher the angelic minds are, the
            more do they receive divine illumination with greater universality.

            To the Middle Hierarchy belongs the governance of things in relation
            to the universal causes. Hence the ranks of this hierarchy have
            names associated with power since the universal causes are present
            in the lower and individual things by their energy and power. Three
            tasks pertain to these powers which govern universally. First, some
            must give direction by their commands; secondly, others must dispose
            of any impediments to the fulfillment [of those commands]; thirdly,
            some must arrange how others will carry out the commands. Of these,
            the first belongs to the
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Dominions</span>
            who, as Dionysius remarks, are free from any subordination; nor are
            they sent out on external [missions] but they give orders to those
            who are sent. The second pertains to the
            <span style="font-weight: bold">Virtues</span>
            who facilitate the execution of the commands. The third belongs to
            the

            who carry out the commands.

              of Christ. What we trample under foot is certainly subjected to
              us. Regarding this power the last chapter of Matthew (28:18)
              states: “All power is given to me in heaven and in earth.” “For in
              subjecting all things to him, he left nothing not subjected to

              In another acceptation it is a metaphorical way of speaking. By
              the feet the lowest part of the body is understood, and by the
              head the highest. Although the humanity and divinity should not be
              thought of as parts of Christ, nonetheless the divinity is
              preeminent in Christ and may be understood as his head—“The head
              of Christ is God” (1 Cor. 11-3). The humanity is lower and may be
              taken as the feet—“Let us worship at his footstool” (Ps. 132:7).
              The meaning [of this passage] is then that the Father has not only
              subjected all of creation to Christ as he is God, to whom
              everything is subject from eternity, but also to his humanity.

              error on his part. He claimed that everything subjected to Christ,
              who is true salvation, must share in salvation. He concluded that
              the demons and damned will be saved at some time since they are
              subjected under Christ’s feet. But this is contrary to the Lord’s
              pronouncement: “Depart from me, you cursed, into everlasting fire,
              which was prepared for the devil and his angels”; and he concludes
              at the end of the chapter, “And these shall go into everlasting
              punishment” (Mt. 25:41, 46).

              It must be held, therefore, that he subjects everything under his
              feet. Some do so willingly, as to their Saviour. For example, the
              just who fulfill God’s will in the present life, and are subjected
              to him that they may satisfy their desire and will, awaiting for
              what Proverbs 10 (24) says of the good: “To the just their desire
              shall be given.” Others, however, are subjected to him
              unwillingly, as to their judge, that Christ may accomplish his own
              will in their regard. These are the wicked to whom those words in
              Luke 19 (27) are applicable: “But as for those my enemies, who
              would not have me reign over them, bring them here and kill them

              angels in the fatherland. On account of certain general reasons,
              Christ is even the head of the angels—“who is the head of all
              principality and power” (Col. 2:10)—whereas Christ is spiritually
              the head of mankind for special reasons. For the head has a
              threefold relationship with the other members. First, it has a
              preeminent position; secondly, its powers are diffused [throughout
              the body] since all the senses in the members are derived from it;
              thirdly, it is of the same nature [as the other members].

              Thus, Christ is head of the Angels in regard to previninence and
              the diffusion [of his power]. Even in his humanity Christ
              surpasses the angels: “Being made so much better than the angels
              as he hath inherited a more excellent name than they” (Heb. 1:4).
              Moreover, even as man, Christ enlightens and influences them;
              Dionysius proves this from the words of Isaias 63 (1): “Who is
              this that comes from Edom, with dyed garments from Bosra?,”
              claiming that these words are those of the highest angels. The
              response which follows: “It is I, announcing justice mighty to
              save,” he says are the words of Christ who immediately answers
              them. From this it should be understood that Christ not only
              illumines the lower but also the higher angels.

              is head of men only. “You have wounded my heart, my sister,”

              feet, mouth, and the like it could be replied that they are to
              serve the soul’s variety of activities. [The soul] itself is the
              cause and principle of these [members], and what they are, the
              soul is virtually. For the body is made for the soul, and not the
              other way around. From this perspective, the natural body is a
              certain fullness of the soul; unless the members exist with an
              integral body, the soul cannot exercise fully its activities.
