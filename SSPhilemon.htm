                        Ostendit sapiens tria circa dominum et servum, scilicet
                        quid requiratur ex parte servi; item qualis debet esse
                        affectus domini ad servum; item qualis usus servi. Ex
                        parte servi requiritur fidelitas, in qua est bonum
                        servi, quia et quod est et omnia sua debet dare domino.
                        Matth. XXIV, 45: <i>fidelis servus et prudens</i>, et
                        cetera. Et dicit <i>si est fidelis</i>, quia fidelitas
                        apud paucos est. Prov. c. XX, 6:
                        <i>virum fidelem quis inveniet?</i> Talis ergo servus
                        debet haberi a domino, sicut amicus in affectu. Unde
                        dicit <i>sit tibi sicut anima tua</i>. Hoc enim est
                        proprium amicorum, ut eorum anima una sit in nolendo et
                        volendo. Act. IV, 32:
                        <i>multitudinis credentium erat cor unum et anima una</i
                        >. In quo datur intelligi, quod est quidam consensus
                        inter dominum et servum, quia servus fidelis transit in
                        amicum. Usus eius est, ut tractetur ut frater; nam
                        frater est, et quantum ad generationem naturae, quia
                        eodem auctore. Iob XXXI, 13:
                        <i>si contempsi subire iudicium cum servo meo</i>. Mal.
                        II, 10:
                        <i
                          >numquid non unus pater omnium nostrum? Numquid non

                        The wise man shows three things concerning master and
                        slave, namely, what is required on the side of the
                        servant; what ought to be the feeling of the master
                        towards the servant; and what is the use of the servant.
                        From the servant fidelity is asked, for in this he is a
                        good servant, because what he is and all that he has he
                        ought to give to the master. Matthew 24-45: ‘Who, do you
                        think, is the faithful and prudent servant...’ And he
                        says, ‘if he is faithful’, because fidelity is found in
                        few. Proverbs 20:6: ‘But who shall find a faithful man?’
                        The master ought to feel towards his servant as a
                        friend, hence it is said, ‘as his own soul’. For this is
                        proper to friends, that they are of one mind in what
                        they will and what they do not will. Acts 4.32: ‘Now the
                        multitude of the believers were of one heart and one
                        soul.’ By which we are given to understand that there is
                        a consensus of master and servant, when the faithful
                        servant becomes a friend. As for his use, he should be
                        treated like a brother, for he is a brother, both with
                        respect to generation of nature, because they have the
                        same author —Job 31.13: ‘If I have despised to abide
                        judgement with my man-servant’; Malachi 2:10: ‘Have we
                        not all one father? Did not one God created us?’ —and
                        with respect to the generation of grace, which is the
                        same for both. Galatians 3:27: ‘For all you who have
                        been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. There is
                        neither Jew nor Greek; there is neither slave nor
                        freeman; there is neither male nor female. For you are
                        all one in Christ Jesus.’ Matthew 23:8: ‘And all you are
                        brothers.’

                        For as it was shown above how spiritual prelates should
                        relate to their subjects, so here he shows how temporal
                        masters should relate to their temporal servants, and
                        how the faithful servant to his master.

                        Matthew 5:10: ‘Blessed are they who suffer persecution
                        for justice’ sake...’ 2 Peter 4:15: ‘Let none of you
                        suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or a slanderer, or as
                        one coveting what belongs to others. But if he suffers
                        as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him
                        glorify God under this name.’ Acts 5.41: ‘So they
                        departed from the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they had
                        been counted worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of
                        Jesus.’

                        Stating the matter of his giving thanks and of his
                        prayer, he shows what he asks when he prays for them.
                        The matter of this was the needs and goods of Philemon,
                        namely, both charity and faith. For without charity
                        nothing avails and through it all things are had. 1
                        Corinthians 13:1: ‘If I should speak with the tongues of
                        men and of angels, but do not have charity, I have
                        become as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal.’ Again,
                        without faith no one can love God, because he does not
                        truly know God. He makes no mention of hope, because it
                        is midway between and is understood in the others. But
                        in whom should they have faith and charity?
                        <i>in our Lord Jesus</i>. 1 Corinthians 16:22: ‘If any
                        man does not love the Lord Jesus Christ, let him be
                        anathema.’ This is necessary, because from Christ more
                        sweetly comes love for the members; because he who does
                        not love the members, does not love the head. 1 John
                        4.20: ‘For how can he who does not love his brother,
                        whom he sees, love God, whom he does not see?’

                        Vel fides consistit in divinitate principaliter, prout

                        <i>And towards all the saints</i>... Faith is based on
                        doctrine insofar as it is manifested through Christ,
                        ‘because no one has seen God’, John 31.18; and, ‘You
                        believe in God, believe also in me,’ John 14.1. We have
                        Christ, therefore, through faith.
                        <i>Towards all the saints</i>
                        can be understood in two ways. In one way, because from
                        the faith they have in Christ proceed the prayers made
                        for the saints. Or, faith consists principally in the
                        divinity as it is announced by Christ, and not only by
                        Christ, but also by the saints. Matthew 28:19: ‘Go
                        therefore and make disciples of all nations...’
                        Therefore we ought to believe not only what was said by
                        Christ but also what was said by the saints. Hebrews

                        not having any new faith, like heretics. 1 Corinthians

                        proceeding from faith. 1 Timothy 6.17: ‘Charge the rich

                        the world many works which are good for men, and yet are
                        not good for God, because they do not come about
                        rightly. Proverbs 14:12: ‘There is a way which seems
                        just to a man: but in the end it leads to death.’
                        Ecclesiastes 8:10: ‘I saw the wicked buried: who also
                        when they were yet living were in the holy place, and
                        were praised in the city as men of just works.’ But this
                        is manifested through correct faith, when reward comes
                        from God, who only rewards the righteous. Therefore he
                        says <i>made evident in full knowledge</i>, that is,
                        that this might be made evident, that you might know
                        every good. Or that
                        <i>all the good that is in you</i>
                        might become known, which is the fruit of divinity.

                        There are two things on account of which one ought to
                        plead. Because of old age. 1 Timothy 1: ‘Do not reproach
                        an old man, but ask him as a father.’ Again, because of
                        the honourableness of virtue, for where we are not
                        deficient, we are equals. Sirach 32:1, ‘Have they made
                        you ruler? Be not lifted up: be among them as one of
                        them.’ Therefore he says,
                        <i>since you are such as you are</i>, as Paul,
                        <i>an old man</i>, as if to say, if you were a boy, I
                        would demand this of you, but you too are old. You are
                        of the same stage of life as I. Not that they are such
                        and so much simply speaking, but in a way similar, which
                        he says out of his humility. Romans 12:10: ‘anticipating
                        one another with honour’. Origen said that it is rare to
                        find a useful teacher in the Church who is not old,
                        thinking of Peter and Paul.

                          10 I plead with you for my own son, whom I have
                          begotten in prison, for Onesimus. 11 He once was
                          useless to you, but now is useful both to me and to
                          you. 12 I am sending him back to you, and do you
                          welcome him as though he were my very heart. 13 I had
                          wanted to keep him here with me that in your stead he
                          might wait on me in my imprisonment for the Gospel; 14
                          but I did not want to do anything without your
                          counsel, in order that your kindness might not be as
                          it were of necessity, but voluntary. 15 Perhaps,
                          indeed, he departed from you for a short while so that
                          you might receive him for ever, 16 no longer as a
                          slave, but instead of a slave as a brother most dear,
                          especially to me, and how much more to you, both in
                          the flesh and in the Lord! 17 If therefore you does
                          count me as a partner, welcome him as you would me. 18
                          And if he did you any injury or owes anything, charge
                          it to me. 19 I, Paul, write it with my own hand: I
                          will repay it — not to say to you that you owe me your
                          very self. 20 Yes, indeed, brother! May I too make use
                          of you in the Lord! Console my heart in the Lord! 21
                          Trusting in your compliance, I am writing to you,
                          knowing that you wilt do even beyond what I say. 22 At
                          the same time make ready a lodging for me too, for I
                          hope that through your prayers I shall be restored to
                          you. 23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus,
                          Mark, Aristarchus, Demas and Luke, my fellow workers
                          send you greetings. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
                          be with your spirit. Amen.

                        Dicit ergo: vere sum exaudiendus, quia petitio continet
                        honestatem et pietatem pro meo filio Onesimo, de quo est
                        praesens mea sollicitudo. Et acquirens filium tempore
                        defectus, magis eum diligit, ut senex filios in
                        senectute genitos. Gen. XXXVII, 3:
                        <i
                          >Israel autem diligebat Ioseph super omnes filios

                        moribus. Si enim in peccato perseverasset, non fuisset
                        dignus venia. Et nota quod minus dicit, et plus
                        significat. Docet enim Tullius, quod quis factum suum
                        debet attenuare quantum potest. Sic apostolus leviter de
                        culpa huius loquitur, dicens <i>inutilis</i>, id est,
                        nocivus in subtrahendo res tuas, <i>nunc autem</i>,
                        conversus a malo ad statum virtutis, <i>utilis</i> est
                        ad servitium Dei et hominum. II Tim. II, 21:
                        <i
                          >si quis ergo emundaverit se ab istis, erit vas in
                          honorem sanctificatum</i
                        >. Prov. XXV, 4:
                        <i
                          >aufer rubiginem de argento, et egredietur vas
                          purissimum</i

                      <td>
                        Therefore he says,
                        <i
                          >I plead with you for my own son, whom I have begotten
                          in prison, for Onesimus</i
                        >, who is his present concern. And acquiring a son in
                        default of time, he loves him more, as an old man loves
                        sons born to him in his old age. Genesis 37:3: ‘Now
                        Israel loved Joseph above all his sons, because he had
                        him in his old age.’ This one [Onesimus] was given birth
                        in chains. Second, there is the change in status. For if
                        he had persevered in sin, he would not be worthy of
                        leniency. Note that Paul says little and means much. For
                        as Cicero taught, one ought to make little of one’s own
                        deed as much as possible. Thus the Apostle speaks
                        lightly of his offence, saying,
                        <i>He once was useless to you</i>, that is, harmful in
                        taking away your possession, but now, converted from
                        evil to the state of virtue, he is useful for the
                        service of God and man. 2 Timothy 2:21: ‘If anyone,
                        therefore, has cleansed himself from these, he will be a
                        vessel for honourable use...’ Proverbs 25:4: ‘Take away
                        the rust from silver, and there shall come forth a most
                        pure vessel.’

                        request. First, he makes it, then he answers a question:
                        <i>I had wanted to keep him here.</i>
                        And so he says,

                          >and do you welcome him as though he were my very

                        which is, I send him back to you. On the contrary,
                        Deuteronomy 23.15: ‘Thou shalt not deliver to his master
                        the servant that is fled to you.’ I reply that is true
                        when the master seeks him in order to put him to death.
                        Therefore, he says, I did not want to do anything...’
                        Philippians 1-7: ‘I have the right to feel so about you,
                        because I have you in my heart, all of you, alike in my

                        Et respondet quaestioni, quia posset dicere: si est
                        utilis tibi, quare non retines eum usque ad mortem? Ideo
                        dicit, quae est causa mittendi eum. Primo autem ostendit

                        proposito, ibi
                        <i>sine consilio autem tuo</i>. Dicit ergo Philemoni,
                        qui licet esset magnus, tamen apostolo solitus erat
                        ministrare. Matth. XX, 26:
                        <i
                          >quicumque voluerit inter vos maior fieri, sit vester
                          minister</i
                        >. Unde ex hac fiducia proposuit eum tenere, ut loco
                        eius sibi ministraret. Unde dicit
                        <i>quem ego volueram mecum detinere, ut pro te</i>, et
                        cetera. Quod erat maxime necessarium, quando erat in
                        vinculis propter Christum. Est enim providendum quando
                        quis patitur pro domino suo. Ratio autem quare destitit
                        est quia noluit uti re aliena, ignorante domino. Unde
                        dicit <i>sine consilio</i>, etc., quasi dicat: si
                        retinuissem eum, iam placeret tibi non valenti resistere
                        et esset quaedam coactio. Sed sic nolui, imo magis volui
                        quod voluntarie fieret. Ex. XXV, 2:

                          >non ex tristitia, aut ex necessitate, hilarem enim

                        if he is useful to you, why do you not keep him unto
                        death? And he gives the reason for sending him back.
                        First, he considers why he might keep him; second, why
                        he rejects that idea:
                        <i
                          >but I did not want to do anything without your
                          counsel.</i
                        >
                        Therefore, he says to Philemon who, although he is a
                        great man, is accustomed to minister to the Apostle.
                        Matthew 10:26: ‘On the contrary, whoever wishes to
                        become great among you shall be your servant.’ Out of
                        this confidence he proposed to keep him, so that in
                        place of Philemon he might minister to him.
                        <i
                          >I had wanted to keep him here with me that in your
                          stead he might wait on me in my imprisonment for the
                          Gospel.</i
                        >
                        This was something especially needed since he was in
                        chains for the sake of Christ, for one is provided for
                        when he suffers for his master. The reason he rejected
                        the idea was that he did not want to use another’s
                        property without the owner’s knowledge. Hence,
                        <i>but I did not want to do anything</i>... As if he
                        said: if I should keep him, it would please you who do
                        not wish to resist but it would be a kind of force. But
                        I did not want that, indeed I wanted it to come about
                        voluntarily. Exodus 25.2: ‘Of every man who offers of
                        his own accord, you shall take them,’ that is, the first
                        fruits. 2 Corinthians 9:7: ‘Let each one give according
                        as he has determined in his heart, not grudgingly or
                        from compulsion, for “God loves a cheerful giver.”’

                        Then when he says,

                        ought to receive him kindly, first, on the side of God,
                        second, on the side of the Apostle:
                        <i>If therefore you count me as a partner</i>...; third,
                        on the part of Philemon himself:
                        <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>... On the side of
                        God, because the providence of God often permits what is
                        evil to come about, in order that good might follow from
                        it, as is clear from the sale of Joseph, that he might
                        free Egypt and the family of his father. Genesis 45-5:
                        ‘For God sent me before you into Egypt for your
                        preservation.’ He says Perhaps because the judgements of
                        God are incomprehensible, Romans 11:33. And he says
                        <i>instead of a slave</i>, that is, in place of a slave.
                        Matthew 23.8: ‘For one is your master and all are your

                        movetur ex charitate, scilicet ex amore secundum carnis
                        originem, et ex amore spirituali. Ex parte autem

                        This can be expounded in two ways. First, as referring
                        to the first origin of the divine creation, and thus he
                        is a brother. Deuteronomy 32:6: ‘Is not he your father,
                        that hath possessed you, and made you, and created you?’
                        Malachi 2:10: ‘Have we not all one father? Did not one
                        God created us?’ Again, by trust in God. Or it might
                        rather be for the good of Philemon, because he is close
                        to him in the flesh, since that is how he is his slave,
                        because whatever he is bodily belongs to Philemon. Hence
                        one is moved by charity for two reasons, by love which
                        has its origin in the flesh, or by spiritual love. On
                        the part of the Apostle, he first declares his
                        friendship, under which aegis he wants Philemon to take
                        Onesimus back; second, he offers to pay any damages;
                        third he shows the function of receiving. Second,
                        <i>If, therefore, you</i>... Third,
                        <i>Yes, indeed, brother!</i>

                        gaudiis. Nam frui est uti fructu, et sicut est uti ad
                        utile, sic frui ad fructum. Importat autem fructus
                        dulcedinem. Cant. II, v. 3:
                        <i>et fructus eius dulcis gutturi meo</i>. Item finem,
                        quia ultimum de arbore est fructus. Et ideo proprie est
                        habere aliquid ut delectabile et finale. Et inde est
                        quod dicit Augustinus
                        <i
                          >fruimur cognitis, in quibus voluntas delectatur
                          propter dulcedinem</i
                        >. Item frui est alicui inhaerere propter se. Aliquando
                        ergo accipiuntur frui et uti communiter, prout important
                        delectationem absque contrario. Eccli. c. VIII, 10:
                        <i>fruere magnatis sine querela</i>. Dicit ergo: sic
                        fruar, quia in nullo mihi contrarius es. Etsi in hoc
                        mihi satisfacies, nihil erit in corde meo de te, quod
                        contristet me, et sic delectabis me. Si autem accipitur
                        frui prout finale quid est, sic non est fruendum homine,
                        sed solo Deo. Contra quod est illud Sap. cap. II, 6:
                        <i
                          >fruamur bonis quae sunt, et utamur creatura tamquam
                          in iuventute celeriter</i
                        >, et cetera. Unde iste addit <i>in domino</i>, id est,
                        fruar te in delectatione Dei, gaudens de bono divino in
                        te, quia eius actus est dilectio, et fruitio effectus,

                        <i>in hoc refice viscera mea</i>. Reficitur enim homo
                        spiritualiter, quando satisfit desideriis animae suae.

                        it, you will fill my wishes with joy. For to make use is
                        to use the fruit and thus it is to use for the useful,
                        as I enjoy fruit. It implies the sweetness of the fruit;
                        Song of Songs 2:3: ‘And his fruit was sweet to my
                        palate.’ And the end, because the ultimate produce of
                        the tree is its fruit. Therefore, to enjoy is properly
                        to have something which is pleasant and final. Hence
                        Augustine says that we enjoy thinking of things in which
                        the will delights because of their sweetness. Again, to
                        enjoy is to adhere to something for its own sake.
                        Sometimes ‘enjoy’ and,use’ are taken commonly as
                        implying enjoyment without the contrary. Sirach 8:10:
                        ‘and to serve great men without blame’. Therefore he
                        says, <i>May I too make use of you</i>, because you are
                        against me in nothing. And if in this you please me,
                        there will be nothing in my heart concerning you that
                        saddens me, and thus you will delight me. But if we take
                        enjoyment as something final, then one does not enjoy
                        man, but God alone. Contrary to this seems to be Wisdom
                        2:6: ‘Come therefore, and let us enjoy the good things
                        that are present: and let us speedily use the creatures
                        as in youth.’ Hence he adds <i>in the Lord</i>, that is,
                        May I, too, make use of you in the delight of God,
                        rejoicing in the divine good that is in you, because his
                        action is love, and the enjoyment of its effect, namely,
                        charity. That is why he adds <i>console my heart</i>. A
                        man is consoled spiritually when the desires of his
                        heart are fulfilled. As if he said: fulfil the deepest
                        desires of my heart. And not with respect to evil, but
                        in the Lord, and thus the fulfilment of desire is good.

                        Then when he says
                        <i>Trusting in your compliance</i>, he provides a reason
                        on the side of Philemon, and a commendation of his
                        obedience. First he shows how he is confident in his
                        obeying; second he adds to it something similar.
                        Therefore he says,
                        <i>Trusting in your compliance.</i>
                        2 Corinthians 7:16: ‘I rejoice that in all things I can
                        have confidence in you.’ 1 Sam 15:22: ‘For obedience is
                        better than sacrifices.’ But he writes more cautiously
                        because a man listens more closely to one he expects to
                        see again than if he despairs. Therefore he says,
                        <i>At the same time make ready a lodging for me too.</i>
                        For it was his custom when he was in Colossae to stay in
                        his home. Chrysostom asks what we are to make of this
                        remark in which a poor man commands a rich man by letter
                        from across the expanse of the earth to prepare a
                        lodging for him. What would have to be prepared for one
                        content with bread and cheap victuals? It should be said
                        that it was not for the sake of the preparation of
                        lodging that he says this, but to insinuate familiarity
                        and love; in this way he will be prompt to obey. The
                        Apostle therefore does not say this on account of
                        external trappings but out of his devotion.

                        mensuram. Sic Isaac magnus propheta fuit deceptus in
                        Iacob. Unde non est mirum de apostolo, si nesciret.

                        Against this is the fact that he never returned to them
                        but died in Rome, therefore his hope was dashed. I reply
                        that the hope of the just is of two kinds, the chief of
                        which is for his own good, and this is never dashed;
                        another secondary hope is the proof of others, and this
                        is sometimes dashed, because their merits are contrary,
                        as the just man is sometimes not heeded by others. But
                        was he deceived in his trust? It should be said that God
                        alone knows the future; that is not for human knowledge,
                        except the prophetic. And no prophet knows all the
                        future events that concern himself. Only Christ did,
                        because he did not have the Holy Spirit in a limited
                        way. Thus Isaac the great prophet was deceived in Jacob.
                        So it is not to be wondered at in an apostle if he does
                        not know.

                        Demas. How can this be, since he said in 2. Timothy 3:8,
                        ‘For Demas has deserted me, loving this world’? How,
                        then, can he use his name?

                        It might be said that he returned to him, but this does
                        not seem to be the case, because this letter was written
                        after that to Timothy and here he says,
                        <i>I hope that through your prayers</i>, and there he
                        foretells his death, saying, ‘The time of my deliverance
                        is at hand.’ Therefore it should be said that Paul was
                        in Rome for nearly nine years, and this letter was
                        written at the beginning, whereas the second letter to
                        Timothy was written at the end of his life and then
                        Demas weary of imprisonment deserted him. The letters of
                        Paul are not arranged chronologically, because the
                        letters to the Corinthians were written before the
                        letter to the Romans, and this before the last letter to
                        Timothy. That is placed first because of its matter,
                        which is worthier. His own greeting here is the same one
                        that ends the second letter to Timothy. Thanks be to
                        God, amen.
