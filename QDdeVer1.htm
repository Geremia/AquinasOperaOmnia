              Augustinus in Lib. Solil. dicit, quod verum est id quod est. Sed

              1. Augustine says: “The true is that which is.” But that which is,
              is simply being. The true, therefore, means exactly the same as
              being.

              Respondens dicebat quod sunt idem secundum supposita, sed ratione
              differunt. Contra, ratio cuiuslibet rei est id quod significatur
              per suam definitionem. Sed id quod est, assignatur ab Augustino,
              ut definitio veri, quibusdam aliis definitionibus reprobatis. Cum
              ergo secundum id quod est, conveniant verum et ens, videtur quod

              2. It was said in reply that the true and being are the same
              materially but differ formally.—On the contrary the nature of a
              thing is signified by its definition; and the definition of the
              true, according to Augustine, is ”that which is.” He rejects all
              other definitions. Now, since the true and being are materially
              the same, it seems that they are also formally the same.

              Praeterea, quaecumque differunt ratione, ita se habent quod unum
              illorum potest intelligi sine altero: unde Boetius in libro de
              hebdomadibus dicit, quod potest intelligi Deus esse, si separetur
              per intellectum paulisper bonitas eius. Ens autem nullo modo
              potest intelligi si separetur verum: quia per hoc intelligitur
              quod verum est. Ergo verum et ens non differunt ratione.

              3. Things which differ conceptually are so related to each other
              that one of them can be understood without the other. For this
              reason, Boethius says that the existence of God can be understood
              if for a moment we mentally separate His goodness from His
              existence. Being, however can in no way be understood apart from
              the true, for being is known only in so far as it is true.
              Therefore, the true and being do not differ conceptually.

              dispositio totaliter corrumpens, alias sequeretur: est verum, ergo
              est non ens; sicut sequitur: est homo mortuus, ergo non est

              albus. Similiter non est dispositio contrahens, vel specificans:

              4. If the true is not the same as being, it must be a state of
              being. But it cannot be a state of being. It is not a state that
              entirely corrupts—otherwise, this would follow: “It is true.
              Therefore, it is non-being”—as it follows when we say: “This man
              is dead. Therefore, this is not a man.”<br />
              Similarly, the true is not a state that limits. If it were, one
              could not say: “It is true. Therefore it is.” For one cannot say
              that a thing is white simply because it has white teeth. Finally,
              the true is not a state which contracts or specifies being, for it
              is convertible with being. It follows, therefore, that the true
              and being are entirely the same.

              5. Things in the same state are the same. But the true and being
              are in the same state. Therefore, they are the same. For Aristotle
              writes: “The state of a thing in its act of existence is the same
              as its state in truth.” Therefore, the true and being are entirely
              the same.

              6. Thing not the same differ in some respect. But the true and
              being differ in no respect. They do not differ essentially, for
              every being is true by its very essence. And they do not differ in
              any other ways, for they must belong to some common genus.
              Therefore, they are entirely the same.

              quam ens: quod patet per philosophum, IV Metaphys., ubi dicit
              quod: verum definientes dicimus quod dicimus esse quod est; aut
              non esse quod non est; et sic verum includit ens et non ens. Ergo

              7. If they were not entirely the same, the true would add
              something to being. But the true adds nothing to being, even
              though it has greater extension than being. This is borne out by
              the statement of the Philosopher that we define the true as: “That
              which affirms the existence of what is, and denies the existence
              of what is not.” Consequently, the true includes both being and
              non-being; since it does not add anything to being, it seems to be
              entirely the same as being.

              1. Useless repetition of the same thing is meaningless; so, if the
              true were the same as being, it would be meaningless to say:
              “Being is true.” This, however, is hardly correct. Therefore, they
              are not the same.

              2. Being and the good are convertible. The true and the good,

              fornication, are true but not good. The true, therefore, and being
              are not interchangeable. And so they are not the same.

              3. In all creatures, as Boethius has pointed out, “to be is other
              than that which is.” Now, the true signifies the existence of
              things. Consequently, in creatures it is different from that which
              is. But that which is, is the same as being. Therefore, in
              creatures the true is different from being.

              4. Things related as before and after must differ. But the true
              and being are related in the aforesaid manner; for, as is said in
              <i>The Causes</i>: “The first of all created things is the act of
              existence.” In a study of this work, a commentator writes as
              follows: “Everything else is predicated as a specification of
              being.” Consequently, everything else comes after being.
              Therefore, the true and being are not the same.

              Praeterea, quae communiter dicuntur de causa et causatis, magis
              sunt unum in causa quam in causatis, et praecipue in Deo quam in
              creaturis. Sed in Deo ista quatuor, ens, unum, verum et bonum, hoc
              modo appropriantur: ut ens ad essentiam pertineat, unum ad
              personam patris, verum ad personam filii, bonum ad personam
              spiritus sancti. Personae autem divinae non solum ratione, sed
              etiam re distinguuntur; unde de invicem non praedicantur. Ergo
              multo fortius in creaturis praedicta quatuor debent amplius quam

              5. What are predicated of a cause and of the effects of the cause
              are more united in the cause than in its effects—and more so in
              God than in creatures. But in God four predicates—being, the one,
              the true, and the good—are appropriated as follows: being, to the
              essence; the one, to the Father; the true, to the Son; and the
              good, to the Holy Spirit. Since the divine Persons are really and
              not merely conceptually distinct, these notions cannot be
              predicated of each other; if really distinct when verified of the
              divine Persons, the four notions in question are much more so when
              verified of creatures.

              knowledge will become involved in an infinite regress, and science
              and our knowledge of things will perish.

              Now, as Avicenna says, that which the intellect first conceives
              as, in a way, the most evident, and to which it reduces all its
              concepts, is being. Consequently, all the other conceptions of the
              intellect are had by additions to being. But nothing can be added
              to being as though it were something not included in being—in the
              way that a difference is added to a genus or an accident to a
              subject—for every reality is essentially a being. The Philosopher
              has shown this by proving that being cannot be a genus. Yet, in
              this sense, some predicates may be said to add to being inasmuch
              as they express a mode of being not expressed by the term
              <i>being.</i>
              This happens in two ways.

              speak when we speak of different levels of existence, and

              simply expresses a special manner of existing, namely, as a being

              Second. some are said to add to being because the mode they
              express is one that is common, and consequent upon every being.
              This mode can be taken in two ways: first, in so far as it follows
              upon every being considered absolutely; second, in so far as it
              follows upon every being considered in relation to another. In the
              first, the term is used in two ways, because it expresses
              something in the being either affirmatively or negatively. We can,
              however, find nothing that can be predicated of every being
              affirmatively and, at the same time, absolutely, with the
              exception of its essence by which the being is said to be. To
              express this, the term
              <i>thing</i>
              is used; for, according to Avicenna, ”thing differs from being
              because being gets its name from to-be, but thing expresses the
              quiddity or essence of the being.” There is, however, a negation
              consequent upon every being considered absolutely: its
              undividedness, and this is expressed by
              <i>one.</i>
              For the
              <i>one</i>
              is simply undivided being.

              If the mode of being is taken in the second way—according to the
              relation of one being to another—we find a twofold use. The first
              is based on the distinction of one being from another, and this
              distinctness is expressed by the word
              <i>something,</i>
              which implies, as it were,
              <i>some other thing.</i>
              For, just as a being is said to be
              <i>one</i>
              in so far as it is without division in itself, so it is said to be
              <i>something</i>
              in so far as it is divided from others. The second division is
              based on the correspondence one being has with another. This is
              possible only if there is something which is such that it agrees
              with every being. Such a being is the soul, which, as is said in
              <i>The Soul,</i>
              “in some way is all things.” The soul, however, has both knowing
              and appetitive powers.
              <i>Good</i>
              expresses the correspondence of being to the appetitive power,
              for, and so we note in the
              <i>Ethics,</i>
              the good is “that which all desire.”
              <i>True</i>
              expresses the correspondence of being to the knowing power, for
              all knowing is produced by an assimilation of the knower to the
              thing known, so that assimilation is said to be the cause of
              knowledge. Similarly, the sense of sight knows a color by being
              informed with a species of the color.

              The first reference of being to the intellect, therefore, consists

              fulfilled the formal constituent of the true, and this is what
              <i>the true</i>
              adds to being, namely, the conformity or equation of thing and
              intellect. As we said, the knowledge of a thing is a consequence
              of this conformity; therefore, it is an effect of truth, even

              Consequently, truth or the true has been defined in three ways.
              First of all, it is defined according to that which precedes truth
              and is the basis of truth. This is why Augustine writes: “The true
              is that which is”; and Avicenna: “The truth of each thing is a
              property of the act of being which has been established for it.”
              Still others say: “The true is the undividedness of the act of
              existence from that which is.” Truth is also defined in another
              way—according to that in which its intelligible determination is
              formally completed. Thus, Isaac writes: “Truth is the conformity
              of thing and intellect”; and Anselm: “Truth is a rectitude
              perceptible only by the mind.” This rectitude, of course, is said
              to be based on some conformity. The Philosopher says that in
              defining truth we say that truth is had when one affirms that “to
              be which is, and that not to be which is not.”

            <td>
              The third way of defining truth is according to the effect
              following upon it. Thus, Hilary says that the true is that which
              manifests and proclaims existence. And Augustine says: “Truth is
              that by which that which is, is shown”; and also: “Truth is that
              according to which we, judge about inferior things.”

              1. That definition of Augustine is given for the true as it has
              its foundation in reality and not as its formal nature is given
              complete expression by conformity of thing and intellect. An
              alternative answer would be that in the statement, “The true is
              that which is,” the word
              <i>is</i>
              is not here understood as referring to the act of existing, but
              rather as the mark of the intellectual act of judging, signifying,
              that is, the affirmation of a proposition. The meaning would then
              be this: “The true is that which is—it is had when the existence
              of what is, is affirmed.” If this is its meaning, then Augustine’s
              definition agrees with that of the Philosopher mentioned above.

              3. “Something can be understood without another” can be taken in
              two ways. It can mean that something can be known while another
              remains unknown. Taken in this way, it is true that things which
              differ conceptually are such that one can be understood without
              the other. But there is another way that a thing can be understood
              without another: when it is known even though the other does not
              exist. Taken in this sense, being cannot be known without the
              true, for it cannot be known unless it agrees with or conforms to
              intellect. It is not necessary, however, that everyone who
              understands the formal notion of being should also understand the
              formal notion of the true—just as not everyone who understands
              being understands the agent intellect, even though nothing can be
              known without the agent intellect.

              should not be understood as belonging to the genus of quality. It
              implies, rather, a certain order; for those which are the cause of
              the existence of other things are themselves beings most
              completely, and those which are the cause of the truth of other
              things are themselves true most completely. It is for this reason
              that the Philosopher concludes that the rank of a thing in its
              existence corresponds to its rank in truth, so that when one finds
              that which is most fully being, he finds there also that which is
              most fully true. But this does not mean that being and the true
              are the same in concept. It means simply that in the degree in
              which a thing has being, in that degree it is capable of being
              proportioned to intellect. Consequently, the true is dependent
              upon the formal character of being.

              7. The true does not have a wider extension than being. Being is,
              in some way, predicated of non-being in so far as non-being is
              apprehended by the intellect. For, as the Philosopher says, the
              negation or the privation of being may, in a sense, be called
              being. Avicenna supports this by pointing out that one can form
              propositions only of beings, for that about which a proposition is
              formed must be apprehended by the intellect. Consequently, it is
              clear that everything true is being in some way.

              5. This argument has three flaws. First, although the Persons are
              really distinct, the things appropriated to each Person are only
              conceptually, and not really, distinct. Secondly, although the
              Persons are really distinct from each other, they are not really
              distinct from the essence; so, truth appropriated to the Person of
              the Son is not distinct from the act of existence He possesses
              through the divine essence. Thirdly, although being, the true, the
              one, and the good are more united in God than they are in created
              things, it does not follow from the fact that they are
              conceptually distinct in God that they are really distinct in
              created beings. This line of argument is valid only when it is
              applied to things which are not by their very nature one in
              reality, as wisdom and power, which, although one in God, are
              distinct in creatures. But being, the true, the one, and the good
              are such that by their very nature they are one in reality.
              Therefore, no matter where they are found, they are really one.
              Their unity in God, however, is more perfect than their unity in
              creatures.

              truth is found principally in the soul, truth will not be the
              essence of a thing but merely its likeness or species; and the
              true will be the species of a being existing outside the soul. But
              the species of a thing existing in the soul is not predicated of a
              thing outside the soul and is not convertible with it; for, if
              this were so, the true could not be converted with being—which is
              false.

              4. If truth is principally in the intellect, anything which
              pertains to the intellect should be included in the definition of
              truth. Augustine, however, sharply criticizes such definitions,
              as, for example, “The true is that which is as it is seen.” For,
              according to this definition, something would not be true if it
              were not seen. This is clearly false of rocks hidden deep in the
              earth. Augustine similarly criticizes the following definition:
              “The true is that which is as it appears to the knower, provided
              he is willing and able to know.” For, according to this
              definition, something would not be true unless the knower wished
              and were able to know. The same criticism can be leveled against
              other definitions that include any reference to intellect. Truth,
              therefore, is not principally in the intellect.

              When a predicate is used primarily and secondarily of many things,
              it is not necessary that that which is the cause of the others
              receive the primary predication of the common term, but rather
              that in which the meaning of the common term is first fully

              animae, secundum, scilicet, quod res quae est extra animam, movet
              intellectum, et res intellecta movet appetitum, et appetitus
              tendit ad hoc ut perveniat ad rem a qua motus incepit. Et quia
              bonum, sicut dictum est, dicit ordinem entis ad appetitum, verum
              autem dicit ordinem ad intellectum; inde est quod philosophus
              dicit VI Metaphys., quod bonum et malum sunt in rebus, verum autem
              et falsum sunt in mente. Res autem non dicitur vera nisi secundum
              quod est intellectui adaequata; unde per posterius invenitur verum
              in rebus, per prius autem in intellectu.

              Now, the fulfillment of any motion is found in the term of the
              motion; and, since the term of the motion of a cognitive power is,
              the soul, the known must be in the knower after the manner of the
              knower. But the motion of an appetitive power terminates in
              things. For this reason the Philosopher speaks of a sort of circle
              formed by the acts of the soul: for a thing outside the soul moves
              the intellect, and the thing known moves the appetite, which tends
              to reach the things from which the motion originally started.
              Since good, as mentioned previously, expresses a relation to
              appetite, and true, a relation to the intellect, the Philosopher
              says that good and evil are in things, but true and false are in
              the mind. A thing is not called true, however, unless it conforms
              to an intellect. The true, therefore, is found secondarily in
              things and primarily in intellect.

              Note, however, that a thing is referred differently to the
              practical intellect than it is to the speculative intellect. Sine
              the practical intellect causes things, it is a measure of what it
              causes. But, since the speculative intellect is receptive in
              regard to things, it is, in a certain sense, moved by things and
              consequently measured by them. It is clear, therefore, that, as is
              said in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>, natural things from which our intellect gets
              its scientific knowledge measure our intellect. Yet these things
              are themselves measured by the divine intellect, in which are all
              created things—just as all works of art find their origin in the
              intellect of an artist. The divine intellect, therefore, measures
              and is not measured; a natural thing both measures and is
              measured; but our intellect is measured, and measures only
              artifacts, not natural things.

              1. As is clear from the discussion, true is predicated primarily
              of a true intellect and secondarily of a thing conformed with
              intellect. True taken in either sense, however, is interchangeable
              with being, but in different ways. Used of things, it can be
              interchanged with being through a judgment asserting merely
              material identity, for every being is conformed with the divine
              intellect and can be conformed with a human intellect. The
              converse of this is also true.<br />
              But if
              <i>true</i>

              but as expressing conformity. For every true act of understanding
              is referred to a being, and every being corresponds to a true act
              of understanding.

              4. Augustine is speaking of a thing’s being seen by the human
              intellect. Truth, of course, does not depend on this, for many
              things exist that are not known by our intellects. There is
              nothing, however, that the divine intellect does not actually
              know, and nothing that the human intellect does not know
              potentially, for the agent intellect is said to be that “by which
              we make all things knowable,” and the possible intellect, as that
              “by which we become all things.” For this reason, one can place in
              the definition of a true thing its actually being seen by the
              divine intellect, but not its being seen by a human intellect,
              except potentially, as is clear from our earlier discussion.

              Just as the true is found primarily in the intellect rather than
              in things, so also is it found primarily in an act of the
              intellect joining and separating, rather than in an act by which
              it forms the quiddities of things. For the nature of the true
              consists in a conformity of thing and intellect. Nothing becomes
              conformed with itself, but conformity requires distinct terms.
              Consequently, the nature of truth is first found in the intellect
              when the intellect begins to possess something proper to itself,
              not possessed by the thing outside the soul, yet corresponding to
              it, so that between the two—intellect and thing—a conformity may
              be found. In forming the quiddities of things, the intellect
              merely has a likeness of a thing existing outside the soul, as a
              sense has a likeness when it receives the species of a sensible
              thing. But when the intellect begins to judge about the thing it
              has apprehended, then its judgment is something proper to
              itself—not something found outside in the thing. And the judgment
              is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality.
              Moreover, the intellect judges about the thing it has apprehended
              at the moment when it says that something is or is not. This is
              the role of “the intellect composing and dividing.”

              For these reasons, the Philosopher says that composition and
              division are in the intellect, and not in things. Moreover, this
              is why truth is found primarily in the joining and separating by
              the intellect, and only secondarily in its formation of the
              quiddities of things or definitions, for a definition is called
              true or false because of a true or false combination. For it may
              happen that a definition will be applied to something to which it
              does not belong, as when the definition of a circle is assigned to
              a triangle. Sometimes, too, the parts of a definition cannot be
              reconciled, as happens when one defines a thing as “an animal
              entirely without the power of sensing.” The judgment implied in
              such a definition—“some animal is incapable of sensing”—is false.
              Consequently, a definition is said to be true or false only
              because of its relation to a judgment, as a thing is said to be
              true because of its relation to intellect.

              From our discussion, then, it is clear that the true is
              predicated, first of all, of joining and separating by the
              intellect; second, of the definitions of things in so far as they
              imply a true or a false judgment. Third, the true may be

              words in the same way as it can be predicated of the ideas which

              2. But it was said that truth is used in two ways. In one, it
              means the entity of a thing, as when Augustine says: “The true is
              that which is.” If truth be understood in this sense, then there
              should be as many truths as there are essences of things. In the
              second way in which truth is used, it signifies truth as it is
              expressed in the intellect. Consequently, Hilary writes: “The true
              affirms existence.” But since nothing can manifest anything to the
              intellect except in virtue of the first divine truth, all truths
              are, in some sense, one, inasmuch as they all move the
              intellect—just as colors are one in moving the sense of sight,
              since they all move it because of one thing: light.<br />
              On the contrary, however, time, the measure of all temporal
              things, is numerically one; and if truth is related to true things
              as time is related to temporal things, the truth of all true
              things must also be numerically one. It will not be sufficient for
              all truths to be one in their action of moving the intellect or to
              be one in their exemplary cause.

              Praeterea, Anselmus in Lib. de veritate sic argumentatur: si

              secundum varietates verorum. Sed veritates non variantur per
              variationem rerum verarum, quia destructis rebus veris vel rectis
              adhuc remanet veritas et rectitudo, secundum quam sunt vera vel
              recta. Ergo est una tantum veritas. Minorem probat ex hoc quia,
              destructo signo, adhuc remanet rectitudo significationis, quia
              rectum est ut significetur hoc quod illud signum significabat; et

              3. Anselm argues as follows: If there are as many truths as there
              are true things, then truths should change as true things change.
              But truths do not change with the changes of true things, for,
              even when true and correct things are destroyed, the truth and
              correctness by which they are true or correct remain. There is,
              therefore, only one truth. He proves the minor from this: When a
              sign is destroyed, the correctness of the signification remains,
              for it remains correct that the sign should signify that which it
              did signify. For the same reason, rectitude or truth remains even
              when a true or correct thing has been destroyed.

              for truth certainly cannot be said to be less than the human mind.
              If this were so, it would be within the competence of the mind to
              pass judgment on truth. This, of course, is false, for the mind
              does not judge truth but judges according to the truth, like a
              magistrate who does not pass judgment upon the law but, as
              Augustine himself says, judges according to the law. Similarly,
              the mind of man cannot be said to be equal to truth, for it judges
              everything according to truth. It does not judge everything
              according to itself. Truth, therefore, must be God Alone, and so

              7. Augustine offers another proof in the same place: “There is no

              false, and, as a result, the two cannot be distinguished. To
              mention only one example: all that we sense through the body. Even
              when these objects are not present to the senses, we experience
              their images as though they were present, as when we are asleep or
              become delirious.” Truth, however, has no resemblance to what is
              false. Therefore, truth is not perceived by a sense.<br />
              One could similarly argue that every created thing has some
              similarity to what is false in so far as it has some defect.
              Nothing created, therefore, is truth, and so there is only one
              truth.

              plures similitudines. Ergo plurium verorum plures veritates.

              1. Augustine writes: “As likeness is the form of like things, so
              truth is the form of true things.” But for many like things there
              are many likenesses. Therefore, for many true things there are
              many truths.

              2. Just as every created truth is derived from the uncreated truth
              as its model, and has its truth from it, so all intelligible light
              is derived from the first uncreated light as from its exemplary
              cause, and from it possesses its power of making things known. But
              we say that there are many intelligible lights, as is clear from
              the writings of Dionysius. Therefore, following this analogy, it
              seems we must likewise simply concede that there are many truths.

              From our previous discussion it is clear that truth is properly
              found in the human or divine intellect, as health is found in an
              animal. In things, however, truth is found because of some
              relation to intellect—just as health is said to be in things other
              than animals in so far as they bring about or preserve animal
              health. Truth, therefore, is properly and primarily in the divine
              intellect. In the human intellect, it exists properly but
              secondarily, for it exists there only because of a relation to
              either one of the two truths just mentioned.

              In his gloss on these words of Psalm 11 (v. 2), “Truths are
              decayed from among the children of men,” Augustine writes” that
              the truth of the divine intellect is one, and from it are drawn
              the many truths that are in the human intellect—“just as from one
              man’s face many likenesses are reflected in a mirror.” Now, there
              are many truths in things, just as there are many entities of
              things. But truth predicated of things because of their relation
              to the human intellect is, as it were, accidental to those things;
              for, supposing that the human intellect did not or could not
              exist, things would still remain essentially the same. But truth
              predicated of things because of their relation to the divine
              intellect is inseparably attendant on them, for they cannot exist
              except by reason of the divine intellect which keeps bringing them
              into being. Again, truth is primarily in a thing because of its
              relation to the divine intellect, not to the human intellect,
              because it is related to the divine intellect as to its cause, but
              to the human intellect as to its effect in the sense that the
              latter receives its knowledge from things. For this reason, a
              thing is said to be true principally because of its order to the
              truth of the divine intellect rather than because of its relation
              to the truth of a human intellect.

              the measured. It is clear, therefore, that Anselm is referring to
              that truth which is only the measure of all true things. There is
              only one such truth numerically, just as there is only one time—as
              the second argument concludes. However, the truth in the human
              intellect or in things themselves is not related to things as an
              extrinsic or common measure is related to those it measures. It is
              related as a measured thing is related to a measure, for such is
              the relation of truth in a human intellect to things, and it must,
              as a consequence, vary as things vary. Or, it is related as an
              intrinsic measure to the thing itself, as is the case with the
              truth that is in things themselves. Intrinsic measures must be

              Anselmus enim in Monologion, de veritate enuntiabilium loquens

              beginning or end, it cannot be circumscribed by a beginning or
              end.”’ But every truth is understood either to have or not to have
              a beginning or end. Therefore, no truth is circumscribed by a
              beginning or end, and, since anything like this is eternal, every
              truth is eternal.

              truth is; for, if truth is not, the fact that truth is not is

              4. The Philosopher’s proof that matter is eternal (which is false)
              rests on the fact that matter remains after its corruption and
              exists prior to its generation, since, if it corrupts, it corrupts
              into something, and if it is generated, it is generated out of
              something. But that from which something is generated and that
              into which it corrupts is matter. The same would be true of truth
              if it were said to undergo corruption or generation: it would
              exist before its generation and after its corruption. If it were
              generated, it would be changed from non-being to being, and if it
              corrupted, it would change from being to non-being. However, when
              truth did not exist, it would have been true that it did not
              exist—which could not be unless there was truth. Therefore, truth

              will always be past. Consequently, a proposition about the future
              is true since something is future, and a proposition about the
              past is true since something is past. Therefore, the truth of a
              future proposition always was, as the truth of a proposition
              concerning the past always will be. Hence, not only the first
              truth is eternal, but also many other truths are eternal.

              8. For a proposition to be true, it is not necessary that
              something be actually stated. It is sufficient that something
              exist about which a proposition can be formed. But, even before
              the world existed, there was something, even apart from God, about
              which a proposition could be formed. Hence, before the world
              existed, the truth of propositions existed, and, since what
              existed before the world is eternal, the truth of propositions is
              eternal. The minor is proved thus: The world is made from nothing,
              that is, after nothing. Hence, before the world was, there was its
              non-existence. But a true proposition is formed not only about
              that which is, but also about that which is not; for, just as what
              is, is truly stated to be, so that which is not is truly stated
              not to be—as is clearly shown in
              <i>Interpretation.</i>
              Hence, before the world existed, there was that from which a true
              proposition could be formed.

              veritas rei, sed etiam veritas intellectus, vel enuntiationis,
              quae intellectum significat, a veritate prima denominetur.

              As mentioned previously, truth means a proportion and
              commensuration. Hence, something is said to be true just as
              something is said to be commensurate. A body, however, is measured
              both by an intrinsic measure, such as a line, surface, or depth,
              and by an extrinsic measure, such as happens when a located body
              is measured by place, or when motion is measured by time, or a
              piece of cloth by an elbow length. Similarly, a thing can receive
              the name true in two ways: by its inherent truth or by an
              extrinsic truth. In this latter way, all things receive the name
              true from the first truth; and since truth in the intellect is
              measured by things themselves, it follows that not only the truth
              of things, but also the truth of the intellect or of a proposition
              signifying what is understood, gets its name from the first truth.

              In this commensuration or conformity of intellect and thing it is
              not necessary that each of the two actually exist. Our intellect
              can be in conformity with things that, although not existing now,
              will exist in the future. Otherwise, it would not be true to say
              that “the Anti-Christ will be born.” Hence, a proposition is said
              to be true because of the truth that is in the intellect alone
              even when the thing stated does not exist. Similarly, the divine
              intellect can be in conformity with things that did not exist
              eternally but were created in time; thus, those in time can be
              said to be true from eternity because of the eternal truth.

              If we take truth, therefore, as meaning the inherent truth of true
              created things—the truth we find in things and in a created
              intellect—then truth is not eternal whether it be that of things
              or that of propositions; for neither the things themselves nor the
              intellect in which these truths inhere exists from all eternity.
              On the other hand, if we take it to mean the truth of true created

              This first truth must be one for all things. For in our intellect
              truth is multiplied in only two ways: first, by the multiplicity
              of the things known, for this results in a multiplicity of
              conceptions upon which there follows a multiplicity of truths in
              our soul; second, by the multiplicity of our ways of knowing, for
              even though Socrates’ running is one thing, the soul understands
              time along with it by joining and separating—as it is said in
              <i>The Soul</i>. Consequently, the soul knows his running as
              present, as past, and as future—each in a different way.
              Accordingly, it forms separate conceptions in which separate
              truths are found. In divine knowledge, however, neither of these
              two kinds of diversity can be found. For God does not have
              separate acts of knowing for separate things, but by one act He
              knows all, since He knows all by a single principle, that is, by
              His essence, as Dionysius points out, and He does not direct His
              act of knowing toward things one by one. Similarly, too, His own
              act of knowing does not involve time, since it is measured by
              eternity, which abstracts from all time inasmuch as it embraces
              all. It remains, therefore, that there are not many truths from
              eternity, but one alone.

              significatur vere aliquid esse futurum. Unde per hoc apparet quod

              1. As Anselm explains his meaning in another place, he said that
              the truth of statements is not circumscribed by a beginning or
              end, “not because the statement itself has no beginning but
              because no time can be conceived at which the statement could
              exist. and truth be absent from it.” The statement referred to
              here is one discussed previously, namely, one by which it is truly
              signified that something will take place in the future. Hence, it
              is quite clear that Anselm did not want to imply that either the
              truth inherent in a created thing or a proposition itself is
              without a beginning and end. Be held simply that the first truth
              by which a proposition is said to be true by a sort of extrinsic
              measure is without beginning or end.

              2. Outside the mind we find two things: the thing itself, and its
              privations and negations. These two are not related to truth in
              the same way, for they do not have the same relation to intellect.
              Because of the species it possesses, the thing itself is
              proportioned to the divine intellect as a product of art is to
              art. Because of the same species, moreover, the thing is able to
              conform our intellect to it, in so far as its likeness, being
              received into the soul, causes the thing itself to be known. But
              non-being, considered outside the soul, has nothing by which it
              can be proportioned to the divine intellect or cause itself to be
              known in our intellects. Hence, if non-being is in conformity with
              any intellect, it is not because of itself but because of the
              intellect which forms within itself the notion of non-being.<br />
              Anything existing positively outside the soul has something in
              itself by which it can be called true; but this is not the case
              with the nonexistence of a thing: whatever truth is attributed to
              it comes from the intellect. When it is said, therefore, “It is
              true that truth does not exist,” the truth here signified has no
              reality except in the intellect, since it is about a non-being.
              Hence, from the fact that the truth in a thing is destroyed
              nothing follows except that there is a truth which is in the
              intellect. And so it is clear that from this argument we can
              conclude only that the truth which is in the intellect is eternal.
              This truth must, of course, be in an eternal intellect, and it is
              the first truth. Consequently, from the argument given only the
              first truth is shown to be eternal.

              existing, just as it can be conceived that no creature exists. For
              the intellect can conceive itself as not existing and not
              understanding, even though it can never conceive without existing
              or understanding. It is not necessary, however, that, in its act
              of understanding, the intellect understand everything that it has
              in its act of understanding, because it does not always reflect
              upon itself. Hence, there is no contradiction if it understands
              created truth as not existing, even though, without it, it cannot
              understand.

              10. As is clear from our previous discussion, intellect is in
              conformity not only with things actually existing but also with
              those not actually existing—especially the divine intellect to
              which the past and the future are the same. Hence, although things
              did not exist from eternity in their own proper nature, the divine
              intellect was conformed with things in their proper nature even
              though they would come into being in time. In this way, from
              eternity, God had true knowledge of things, even in their proper
              natures, although the truths of things did not exist from
              eternity.

              human justice, then it is said to be perpetual in the way in which
              natural things are said to be perpetual. For example, we say that
              fire always moves upwards, unless impeded, because of its natural
              inclination. Now, because a virtue is, as Cicero says, “a habit
              resembling a nature and in harmony with reason,” in so far as the
              nature of the virtue goes, it has an unfailing inclination to its
              act, even though this is sometimes impeded. Hence, in the Digest
              one reads that justice is: “the constant and perpetual will to
              give each one his due.” However, the truth which is a part of
              justice is found in the testimony of legal trials. But we are not
              now discussing that kind of truth.

              13. The statement that a universal is perpetual and incorruptible
              is explained by Avicenna in two ways. First, a universal is said
              to be incorruptible and perpetual because, according to those who
              hold the eternity of the world, particulars had no beginning and
              will have no end. For, according to the philosophers, generation
              is for the purpose of conserving the perpetual existence of the
              species—since it cannot be preserved by the individual. Second, a
              universal is said to be perpetual in so far as it does not cease
              of itself but accidentally—because of the corruption of the
              individual.

              quod est per accidens; magis enim dicimus ignem sursum ferri, et

              remotionis, per hoc scilicet quod removentur ab eo illa quae nata
              sunt contrariam dispositionem inducere. Unde si per accidens

              incorruptionis, sed quia non conveniunt ei secundum se
              dispositiones materiales, quae sunt causa corruptionis in
              individuis; unde universale in rebus particularibus existens

              14. A thing is predicated of another essentially in two ways.
              First, it is done positively, as when we say of fire that it is
              carried upwards. A thing gets its name from this kind of essential
              predicate rather than from an accidental predicate; for we say
              rather that fire is carried upwards and belongs to the class of
              things carried upwards than that it belongs to the class of those
              that are carried downwards, even though it may happen,
              accidentally, that fire is carried downwards—as would evidently be
              the case of red-hot iron.<br />
              The second type of essential predication is by “removal”—when
              there is removed from a thing those things which bring on a
              contrary disposition. If one of those things should happen to be
              present, the contrary disposition will be predicated absolutely.
              For example, unity is predicated essentially of first matter, not
              by positing some unifying form, but by removing diversifying
              forms. Hence, when forms occur which differentiate matter, we say,
              without qualification, that there are several matters rather than
              that there is only one. Such is the case in the difficulty; for a
              universal is said to be incorruptible, not because it possesses
              some form giving it incorruptibility, but because those material
              qualities which cause corruption in individuals do not belong to
              it as a universal. Hence, a universal existing in particular
              things is said, without qualification, to be corrupted in this or
              that individual.

              ratione tantum; quod quidem quadrupliciter contingit, ut ex dictis
              philosophi et Avicennae sumi potest.<br />
              Uno modo, ut quando aliquid ad seipsum refertur, ut cum dicitur
              idem eidem idem; si enim haec relatio aliquid in rerum natura
              poneret additum ei quod dicitur idem, esset in infinitum procedere
              in relationibus, quia ipsa relatio per quam aliqua res diceretur
              eadem, esset eadem sibi per aliquam relationem, et sic in
              infinitum. Secundo, quando ipsa relatio ad aliquid refertur. Non
              enim potest dici quod paternitas referatur ad subiectum suum per
              aliquam relationem mediam, quia illa etiam relatio media indigeret
              alia media relatione, et sic in infinitum. Unde illa relatio quae
              significatur in comparatione paternitatis ad subiectum, non est in
              rerum natura, sed in ratione tantum. Tertio, quando unum
              relativorum pendet ab altero, et non e converso, sicut scientia
              dependet a scibili, et non e converso; unde relatio scientiae ad
              scibile est aliquid in rerum natura, non autem relatio scibilis ad
              scientiam, sed in ratione tantum. Quarto, quando ens comparatur ad
              non ens; ut cum dicimus, quod nos sumus priores his qui sunt
              futuri post nos; alias sequeretur quod possent esse infinitae
              relationes in eodem, si generatio in infinitum protenderetur in
              futurum.<br />
              Ex duobus igitur ultimis apparet quod relatio illa prioritatis
              nihil ponit in rerum natura, sed in intellectu tantum; tum quia
              Deus non dependet a creaturis, tum quia talis prioritas dicit
              comparationem entis ad non ens. Unde ex hoc non sequitur quod sit
              aliqua veritas aeterna, nisi in intellectu divino, qui solus est
              aeternus; et haec est veritas prima.

              15. All genera as such, with the exception of relation, posit
              something in reality. For example, quantity by its very nature
              posits something. But relation, alone, because of what it is, does
              not posit anything in reality, for what it predicates is not
              <i>something</i>
              but
              <i>to something.</i>
              Hence, there are certain relations which posit nothing in reality,
              but only in reason. This occurs in four ways, as can be seen in
              the writings of the Philosopher and Avicenna.<br />
              First, there occurs a relation merely in reason when a thing is
              referred to itself; for example, when we say that a thing is
              identical with itself. If this relation posited something in
              reality in addition to the thing which is declared to be identical
              with itself, we should have an infinite process in relations; for
              the very relation by which something is said to be identical with
              itself would also be identical with itself through an added
              relation, and so on to infinity. Second, a relation existing only
              in reason occurs when the relation itself is referred to
              something. For example, one cannot say that paternity is referred
              to its subject by some intermediate relation; for that mediate
              relation would need another intermediate relation, and so on to
              infinity. Consequently, the relation signified when paternity is
              compared to its subject is not real but only rational. Third, a
              relation existing in reason alone occurs when one of the related
              things depends on the other and not conversely. For example,
              knowledge depends on the thing known but not the other way about.
              Hence, the relation of knowledge to a thing known is something
              real, but the relation of the thing known to knowledge is merely
              rational. Fourth, a rational relation occurs when a being is
              compared with a non-being. For example, we say that we are prior
              to those who are to come after us. If this were a real relation,
              it would follow (if future generations were infinite) that there
              could be an infinite number of relations in the same thing.<br />
              From the last two types it is clear that that relation of priority
              posits nothing in reality but only in the intellect, because God
              does not depend on creatures and because such a priority is a
              relation of being to non-being. From this argument, therefore, it
              does not follow that there is an eternal truth except in the
              divine intellect, which alone is eternal. This is the first truth.

              naturally prior to knowledge—the relation of the thing known to
              knowledge is not a real relation.

              be, by one act of knowing, even if they have different truths
              considered in themselves. Hence, He knows with only one act of
              knowing all the various propositions about the persons even to a
              greater degree. Consequently, there is only one truth for these,
              also.

              truth of Signification, which we discussed earlier. Hence, the

              when a thing changes. But when a thing has been changed, the truth
              of the proposition remains. Therefore, the truth of a proposition
              is immutable. Proof of the minor: Truth according to Anselm is “a
              certain correctness—inasmuch as the thing fulfills that which it
              receives in the divine mind. But the fact that the proposition,
              “Socrates is sitting,” signifies the sitting of Socrates comes
              from the divine mind, and this proposition will signify his
              sitting even when Socrates does not sit. Therefore, even when
              Socrates does not sit, truth remains in that proposition.
              Consequently, the truth of the proposition is not changed, even if
              the thing be changed.

              which it has received in the divine mind. But each thing likewise
              fulfills that which it has been ordained in the divine mind to
              have. Therefore, the truth of each and every thing is immutable.

              never changed. For example, when colors are changed, we do not say

              of colors is made. Now, truth remains in a thing, no matter what

              the same thing is the cause of the truth of these three
              propositions: “Socrates sits,” “Socrates will sit,” and “Socrates
              sat”—namely, the sitting of Socrates. Therefore, the truth of each
              is the same. Now, if one of these three propositions is true, one
              of the other two must always be true; for, if at some time it is

              A thing is said to be changed in two ways. First, because it is
              the subject of a change, as when we say that a body is changeable.
              In this meaning, no form is said to be changeable. Consequently, a
              form is said to be something steadfast in an unchanging essence;
              since truth consists in a form, the present question is not
              whether truth is mutable in this sense. Second, a thing is said to
              be changed because something else changes according to it, as when
              we say that whiteness is changed because a body is changed in its
              whiteness. It is in this sense that we ask whether or not truth is
              changeable.

              To clarify this point, we should note that the thing according to
              which there is a change is sometimes said to be changed and
              sometimes not. For, when it is inhering in a thing which is
              affected in its respect, then it is said to be changed itself—as
              whiteness or quantity is said to be changed when something is
              changed in their respect because they succeed each other in a
              subject. When, however, that according to which the change occurs
              is extrinsic, the thing itself is not changed but remains
              unaffected throughout the whole change. For example, a place is
              not said to be moved when a thing moves with respect to it. For
              this reason, it is said in the Physics that place is “the
              unchangeable boundary of the container,” because local motion does
              not mean a succession of loci in regard to one located body, but a
              succession of many located bodies in one place.

              Now, there are two ways in which inhering forms are said to be

              forms are said to be changed in one way and special forms in
              another. After a change, a special form does not remain the same
              either according to its act of existing or according to its
              intelligible character. For example, when a qualitative change has
              been made, whiteness does not remain at all. But, after a change
              has been made, a general form retains the same intelligible
              character, though not the same act of existing. For example, after
              a change from white to black has taken place, color, according to
              the general character of color, remains unchanged; but the same
              species of color does not remain.

              mutationem, secundum eam intellectui divino conformatur, qui eam
              ita cognoscit ut est secundum quamcumque dispositionem.

              Consequently, if the truth of a thing is considered according to
              its reference to the divine intellect, then, indeed, the truth of
              a changeable thing is changed into another truth, but not into
              falsity. For truth is a most general form because the true and
              being are interchangeable. Hence, just as, even after any change
              has been made, a thing nevertheless remains a being, although it
              is other as a result of the other form by which it has existence;
              so, also, a thing always remains true—but by another truth; for,
              no matter what form or what privation it acquires through the
              change, it is conformed in that respect to the divine intellect,
              which knows it as it is, whatever may be its state.

              If, however, the truth of a thing is considered in its reference

              change from truth into falsity, sometimes from one truth to
              another. For truth is “an equation of thing and intellect”; and,
              if equal amounts are taken from things that are equal, these
              things remain equal, although the equality is not the same. Hence,
              when intellect and thing are similarly changed, truth remains; but
              it is another truth. For example, when Socrates sits, what is
              understood is that Socrates is sitting. Afterwards, when he does
              not sit, what is understood is that he is not sitting. But, if
              something is taken from one of two equal things, and nothing from
              the other, or if unequal amounts are taken from each, then
              inequality must result; and this corresponds to falsity, just as
              equality corresponds to truth.

              Consequently, if an intellect is true, and it is not changed when
              a thing is changed, or vice versa, or if each is changed but not
              similarly, falsity results, and there will be a change from truth
              to falsity. For example, if, when Socrates is white, he is
              understood to be white, the intellect is true. If, however, the
              intellect later understands him to be black, although Socrates
              still is white; or if, conversely, he is still understood to be
              white, although he has turned black; or if, when he has turned
              pale, he is understood to be reddish—then there will be falsity in

              2.Since the intellect reflects upon itself and knows itself as it
              knows other things (as said in
              <i>The Soul</i>), the things belonging to the intellect as regards
              the intelligible character of truth can be considered in two ways.
              First, in so far as they are things; in this way, truth is
              predicated of them in the same way in which it is predicated of
              other things. Consequently, as a thing is said to be true because
              it fulfills what was assigned to it in the divine mind by
              retaining its own nature, so a proposition is also said to be true
              by retaining its own nature, which was also allotted to it in the
              divine mind; and this cannot be taken from it as long as the
              proposition itself remains. Second, these may be considered in
              their reference to things that are known. In this way, a
              proposition is said to be true when it is proportioned to a thing.
              This kind of truth is changed, as has been said.

              4. As long as a thing remains, no change can take place in it
              concerning its essentials. For example, it is essential to a
              proposition that it signify that which it has been made to
              signify. Consequently, it does not follow that the truth of a
              thing is in no way changeable, but only that it is unchangeable
              with respect to the essentials of the thing while the thing
              remains. Nevertheless, in those cases in which a change occurs
              through corruption of a thing, but only with respect to its
              accidentals, this accidental change can take place even though the
              thing remains. In this way, a change can take place in the truth
              of a thing in regard to its accidentals.

              from such equality does not involve its having the character of a
              source, whether it be considered from the standpoint of the
              essence or from that of the intellect, since both in this case are
              one and the same. For, just as in God the knower and the thing
              known are the same, so also in Him the truth of the thing and that
              of intellect are the same, without any connotation of origin.

              But if the truth of the divine intellect be considered in its
              conformity to created things, the same truth will still remain;
              for God knows Himself and other things through the same means.
              However, there is added to the concept of truth the note of origin
              with respect to creatures, to which the divine intellect is
              compared as a measure and cause. Moreover, in theological matters
              every name which does not imply the notion of origin or of being
              from a principle is predicated essentially. And even if the name
              implies the notion of origin of creatures, it still is also
              predicated essentially. Consequently, if truth is taken properly
              in whatever pertains to God, it is predicated essentially; yet it
              is appropriated to the person of the Son, as are also art and all
              else pertaining to intellect.

              Truth is taken metaphorically or figuratively in divine matters
              when we take it according to that formal character by which truth
              is found in created things. For in these, truth is said to exist
              inasmuch as a created thing imitates its source, the divine
              intellect. Similarly, when truth is applied to God and is said to
              be the highest possible imitation of its principle, this is
              attributed to the Son. Taken in this way, truth properly belongs
              to the Son and is predicated personally; and this, too, is what
              Augustine says.

              2. When equality is referred to divine things it sometimes implies
              a relation that indicates a distinction of Persons—as when we say
              that the Father and the Son are equal. In this respect a real
              distinction is understood in the word
              <i>equality.</i>
              Sometimes, however, a real distinction is not understood in the
              word
              <i>equality,</i>
              but merely a rational distinction, as when we say that the divine
              wisdom and the divine goodness are equal. Hence, equality does not
              necessarily imply a distinction of persons. Such also is the
              distinction implied in the word
              <i>truth,</i>

              reason of the truth of the sign or concept, and this is from God.
              Its truth as a thing, however, is not from God.—On the contrary,
              besides the first truth, there is not only the truth of the sign

              thing not from God, and our proposition that not every truth other

              proposition to the truth of what is said, which in turn expresses
              the truth of the thing. Consequently, the truth mentioned consists
              in this: that that act is joined to that subject. But the truth of
              what is said would not arise from the conjunction of such an act
              with a subject unless the conjunction of the act, which has the
              deformity, were understood. Therefore, the truth of the thing
              regards not only the very essence of an act but also its
              deformity. But an act considered as having a deformity is by no
              means from God. Not all truth of things, therefore, is from God.

              respect. Such a restricted truth is not from God.—On the contrary,

              As is clear from what has been said among created things truth is
              found both in things and in intellect. In the intellect it is
              found according to the conformity which the intellect has with the
              things whose notions it has. In things it is found according as
              they imitate the divine intellect, which is their measure—as art
              is the measure of all products of art—and also in another way,
              according as they can by their very nature bring about a true
              apprehension of themselves in the human intellect, which, as is
              said in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>, is measured by things. By its form a thing
              existing outside the soul imitates the art of the divine
              intellect; and, by the same form, it is such that it can bring
              about a true apprehension in the human intellect. Through this
              form, moreover, each and every thing has its act of existing.
              Consequently, the truth of existing things includes their entity
              in its intelligible character, adding to this a relation of
              conformity to the human or divine intellect. But negations or
              privations existing outside the soul do not have any form by which
              they can imitate the model of divine art or introduce a knowledge
              of themselves into the human intellect. The fact that they are
              conformed to intellect is due to the intellect, which apprehends
              their intelligible notes.

              It is clear, therefore, that when a stone and blindness are said
              to be true, truth is not related to both in the same way; for
              truth predicated of the stone includes in its notion the entity of
              the stone, adding a reference to intellect, which is also caused
              by the thing itself since it has something by which it can be
              referred to intellect. As predicated of blindness, however, truth
              does not include in itself that privation which is blindness, but
              only the relation of blindness to intellect. This relation,
              moreover, is not supported by anything in the blindness itself,

              Hence, it is clear that the truth found in created things can
              include nothing more than the entity of a thing and conformity of
              the thing to intellect or conformity of intellect to things or to
              the privations of things. All this is entirely from God, because
              both the very form of a thing, through which it is conformed, is
              from God, and the truth itself in so far as it is the good of the
              intellect, as is said in the
              <i>Ethics</i>; for the good of any thing whatsoever consists in
              its perfect operation. But since the perfect operation of the
              intellect consists in its knowing the true, that is its good in
              the sense just mentioned. Hence, since every good and every form
              is from God, one must say, without any qualification, that every
              truth is from God.

              1. The argument—“Every true thing is from God. But to fornicate is

              evident from our discussion above,* when we say that fornicating
              is true, we do not imply that the defect involved in the act of
              fornication is included in the notion of truth. True predicates
              merely the conformity of that act to an intellect. Hence, one
              cannot conclude that fornicating is from God, but merely that its
              truth is from God.

              4. The good, the due, the right, and all other things of this sort
              are related in one way to the divine permission, and in another,
              to other manifestations of the divine will. In the latter, there
              is a reference to the object of the will act, as well as to the
              will act itself. For example, when God commands that parents be
              honored, both the honor to be given parents and the act of
              commanding are goods. But in a divine permission there is a
              reference only to the subjective act of permitting, and not to the
              object of the permission. Hence, it is right that God should
              permit deformities, but it does not follow from this that the
              deformity itself has some rectitude.

              Truth is both in intellect and in sense, but not in the same way.
              It is in intellect as a consequence of the act of the intellect
              and as known by the intellect. Truth follows the operation of the
              intellect inasmuch as it belongs to the intellect to judge about a
              thing as it is. And truth is known by the intellect in view of the
              fact that the intellect reflects upon its own act—not merely as
              knowing its own act, but as knowing the proportion of its act to
              the thing. Now, this proportion cannot be known without knowing
              the nature of the act; and the nature of the act cannot be known
              without knowing the nature of the active principle, that is, the
              intellect itself, to whose nature it belongs to be conformed to
              things. Consequently, it is because the intellect reflects upon
              itself that it knows truth.

              The reason for this is that the most perfect beings, such as, for
              example, intellectual substances, return to their essence with a
              complete return: knowing something external to themselves, in a
              certain sense they go outside of themselves; but by knowing that
              they know, they are already beginning to return to themselves,
              because the act of cognition mediates between the knower and the
              thing known. That return is completed inasmuch as they know their
              own essences. Hence, it is said in
              <i>The Causes</i>: “A being which is such as to know its own
              essence returns to it by a complete return.”

              tamen completur eius reditio, quia sensus non cognoscit essentiam
              suam. Cuius hanc rationem Avicenna assignat, quia sensus nihil
              cognoscit nisi per organum corporale. Non est autem possibile ut
              organum corporale medium cadat inter potentiam sensitivam et

              Since sense is closer to an intellectual substance than other
              things are, it begins to return to its essence; it not only knows
              the sensible, but it also knows that it senses. Its return,
              however, is not complete, since it does not know its own essence.
              Avicenna” has given the reason for this by pointing out that the
              sense knows nothing except through a bodily organ, and a bodily
              organ cannot be a medium between a sensing power and itself. But
              powers without any ability to sense cannot return to themselves in
              any way, for they do not know that they are acting. For example,
              fire does not know that it is heating.

              something else. If because it is similar, all things loudly

              3. The good, like the true, is interchangeable with being. But the
              interchangeability of the good and being does not stand in the way
              of a thing’s being evil. Therefore, the fact that the true is
              interchangeable with being does not stand in the way of a thing’s
              being false.

              Praeterea, Anselmus dicit in libro de veritate quod duplex est
              propositionis veritas; una quia significat quod accepit
              significare, sicut haec propositio: Socrates sedet; significat
              Socratem sedere, sive Socrates sedeat, sive non sedeat; alia,
              quando significat illud ad quod facta est; est enim ad hoc facta
              ut significet esse, quando est; et secundum hoc proprie dicitur
              enuntiatio vera. Ergo, eadem ratione, quaelibet res dicetur vera,
              quando implet hoc ad quod est; falsa autem quando non implet. Sed
              omnis res quae deficit a fine suo, non implet illud propter quod
              est. Cum ergo multae res sint tales, videtur quod multae sint
              falsae.

              4. Anselm says that there are two kinds of truth in propositions.
              “The first type occurs when the proposition has the meaning which
              was given to it.” For example, this proposition, “Socrates sits,”
              means that Socrates is sitting, whether he is actually sitting or
              not. “The second type of truth occurs when the proposition
              signifies that for which it was formed”—and it has been formed to
              signify that something is when it is. In this respect, a
              proposition is properly said to be true. In the same way, a thing
              may be called true when it fulfills its purpose, and false when it
              does not do so. But everything which falls short of its end does
              not fulfill its purpose; and, since there are many things of this
              sort, it seems that many things are false.

              Just as truth consists in an equation of thing and intellect, so
              falsity consists in an inequality between them. Now, as was said,
              a thing is related to divine and human intellects. In regard to
              everything that is positively predicated of things or found in
              them, it is related to the divine in one way as the measured to
              its measure; for all such things come from the divine intellect’s
              art. A thing is related in another way to the divine intellect: as
              a thing known is related to the knower. In this way even negations
              and defects are equated to the divine intellect, since God knows
              all these even though He does not cause them. It is clear, then,
              that a thing is conformed to the divine intellect in whatever way
              it exists, under any for in whatsoever or even under a privation
              or a defect. Consequently, it is clear that everything is true in
              its relation to the divine intellect. Hence, Anselm says: “There
              is, then, truth in the essence of all things which are, for they
              are what they are in the highest truth.” Therefore, in its
              relation to the divine intellect, nothing can be false.

              In its relation to a human intellect, however, an inequality of
              thing with intellect, caused in some way by the thing, is
              occasionally found; for a thing makes itself known in the soul by
              its exterior appearance, since our cognition takes its beginning
              from sense, whose direct object is sensible qualities. For this
              reason it is said in
              <i>The Soul</i>: “Accidents greatly contribute to our knowledge of
              the quiddity.” Consequently, when there are manifested in any
              object sensible qualities indicating a nature which does not
              actually underlie them, that thing is said to be false. Hence, the
              Philosopher says that those things are called false “which are
              such as to seem to be what they are not, or of a kind which they
              are not.” For example, that is called “false” gold which has in
              its external appearance the color and other accidents of genuine
              gold, whereas the nature of gold does not interiorly underlie
              them. But a thing is not to be the cause of falsity in the soul in
              the sense that it necessarily causes falsity; for truth and
              falsity exist principally in the soul’s judgment; and the soul,
              inasmuch as it judges about things, is not acted upon by things,
              but rather, in a sense, acts upon them. Hence, a thing is not said
              to be false because it always of itself causes a false
              apprehension, but rather because its natural appearance is likely
              to cause a false apprehension.

              2. Properly speaking, the true cannot be a differentia of being,
              for being does not have any differentia, as is proved in the
              <i>Metaphysics.</i>
              But in some sense the true, as well as the good, is related to
              being in the manner of a differentia, since it expresses something
              about being which is not expressed by the noun
              <i>being;</i>
              and in this sense the meaning of being is indeterminate with
              respect to the meaning of the true. Consequently, the meaning of
              the true is compared to the notion of being somewhat as a
              differentia is compared to its genus.

              5. As is clear from what has been said, something outside the soul
              is said to be false if it is naturally such as to give a false
              impression of itself. But what is nothing is not capable of making
              any impression, since it does not move a knowing power. What is
              said to be false, therefore, must be a being; and since every
              being, in so far as it is a being, is true, falsity must exist in
              things and be based upon some truth. For this reason Augustine
              says” that a tragedian representing true persons in dramas would
              not be false without being a true tragedian. Similarly, a painting
              of a horse would not be a false horse were it not a true picture.
              It does not follow, however, that contradictories are true,
              because the affirmation and the negation in expressing the true
              and the false do not refer to the same reality.

              6. A thing is said to be false in so far as, by its nature, it is
              likely to deceive. When I say
              <i>deceive,</i>
              however, I mean an action that brings on some defect; for nothing
              can act except to the extent that it is being, and every defect is
              non-being. Moreover, everything has some likeness to the true to
              the extent that it is a being; and in so far as it does not exist
              it departs from this likeness. Consequently, this
              <i>deceiving</i>
              as implying action arises from likeness; but the defect it implies
              (and in which the intelligible character of falsity formally
              consists) arises from unlikeness. Hence, Augustine says that
              falsity arises from unlikeness.

              1. The soul is not so constituted as to be deceived by any
              likeness whatsoever, but only by a considerable resemblance which
              makes it difficult to discover the unlikeness. Hence, the soul is
              deceived by similarities, more or less great, according to the
              varying degrees of its acuteness in discovering unlikenesses. A
              thing, however, should not be said to be absolutely false because
              it leads into error, however much it may do that, but only because
              it is such as to deceive many or highly intelligent men. Now,
              although creatures bear some resemblance to God in themselves, so
              great is the dissimilarity between the two that only because of
              great stupidity could it happen that a mind would be deceived by
              such similarity. Hence, from the similarity and dissimilarity
              between creatures and God, it does not follow that all creatures
              should be called false.

              2. Some have thought that God is a body; and, since He is the
              unity by which all things are one, they consequently thought that
              body was unity itself, because of its likeness to unity.
              Therefore, a body is called a false unity for this reason, that it
              has led or could lead some into the error of believing it to be
              unity.

              3. There are two kinds of perfection, first and second. First
              perfection is the form of each thing, and that by which it has its
              act of existing. Nothing is without it while it continues in
              existence. Second perfection is operation, which is the end of a
              thing or the means by which a thing reaches its end; and a thing
              is sometimes deprived of this perfection. The note of truth in
              things results from first perfection; for it is because a thing
              has a form that it imitates the art of the divine intellect and
              produces knowledge of itself in the soul. But the note of goodness
              in things results from its second perfection, for this goodness
              arises from the end. Consequently, evil, but not falsity, is found
              in things absolutely.

              its concept is true. And since a proposition is a sign of what is
              understood, truth is its end. But this is not the case with other
              things, and so there is no similarity.

              way imitate the true.” Now, a sense has at times a likeness of
              certain things other than they are in reality. For example, when
              the eye is pressed, one thing is sometimes seen as two.
              Consequently, there is falsity in sense.

              proper sensibles, but only with regard to common sensibles.—On the
              contrary, whenever something is apprehended about a thing other
              than it is, the apprehension is false. Now, when a white body is
              seen through a green glass, the sense apprehends it other than it
              is, for it sees it as green and judges accordingly—unless a higher
              judgment is present, detecting the falsity. Therefore, sense is
              deceived even with regard to proper sensibles.

              Our knowledge, taking its start from things, proceeds in this
              order. First, it begins in sense; second, it is completed in the
              intellect. As a consequence, sense is found to be in some way an
              intermediary between the intellect and things; for with reference
              to things, it is, as it were, an intellect, and with reference to
              intellect, it is, as it were, a thing. Hence, truth or falsity is
              said to be in sense in two respects. The first is in the relation
              of sense to intellect. In this respect, the sense is said to be
              true or false as a thing is, namely, in so far as it causes a true
              or false judgment in the intellect. The second respect is in the
              relation of sense to things. In this, truth and falsity are said
              to be in sense as they are said to be in the intellect, namely, in
              so far as the sense judges that what is, is or is not.

              Hence, if we speak of a sense in the first meaning, in a way there
              is falsity in sense, and in a way there is not. For sense, in
              itself, is a thing; and it also passes judgment on other things.
              If, in its relation to the intellect, it is considered as a thing,
              then there is no falsity in sense; for a sense reveals its state
              to the intellect exactly as it is affected. Hence, Augustine says,
              in the passage referred to: “The senses can report to the mind
              only how they are affected.” On the other hand, if sense is
              considered in its relation to the intellect as representing some
              other thing, it may be called false in view of the fact that it
              sometimes represents a thing to the intellect other than it
              actually is. For, in that case, as we said about things, it is
              such as to cause a false judgment in the intellect—but not
              necessarily, since the intellect judges on what is presented by
              sense just as it judges about things. Thus, in its relation to the
              intellect, sense always produces a true judgment in the intellect
              with respect to its own condition, but not always with respect to
              the condition of things.

              If sense is considered in its relation to things, however, then
              there are truth and falsity in sense in the manner in which these
              are in the intellect. For truth and falsity are found primarily
              and principally in the judgment of the intellect as it associates
              and dissociates, and in the formation of quiddities, only in their
              relation to the judgment following upon this formation. Hence,
              truth and falsity are properly said to be in sense inasmuch as it
              judges about sensible objects, but inasmuch as it apprehends a
              sensible object, there is not properly truth or falsity, except in
              the relation of this apprehension to the judgment, in so far as a
              judgment of this or that sort naturally follows upon a particular

              The judgment of sense about certain things—for example, proper
              sensibles—takes place spontaneously. About other things, however,
              it takes place by means of a certain comparison, made in man by
              the cogitative power, a sense power, whose place in animals is
              taken by a spontaneous estimation. This sensitive power judges
              about common sensibles and accidental sensibles. However, the
              spontaneous action of a thing always takes place in one way,
              unless by accident it is impeded intrinsically by some defect or
              extrinsically by some impediment. Consequently, the judgment of
              sense about proper sensibles is always true unless there is an
              impediment in the organ or in the medium; but its judgment about
              common or accidental sensibles is sometimes wrong. Thus, it is
              clear how there can be falsity in the judgment of sense.

              As regards the apprehension of the senses, it must be noted that
              there is one type of apprehensive power, for example, a proper
              sense, which apprehends a sensible species in the presence of a
              sensible thing; but there is also a second type, the imagination,
              for example, which apprehends a sensible species when the thing is
              absent. So, even though the sense always apprehends a thing as it
              is, unless there is an impediment in the organ or in the medium,
              the imagination usually apprehends a thing as it is not, since it
              apprehends it as present though it is absent. Consequently, the
              Philosopher says: “Imagination, not sense, is the master of
              falsity.”

              Quia intellectus habet duas operationes: scilicet unam qua format

              1. The intellect has two operations. By one it forms quiddities,
              and, as the Philosopher says,’ the false is not in this. By the
              other it joins and separates, and the false is not in this either,
              as is clear from Augustine’s saying: “No one has intellectual
              knowledge of false things. Consequently, falsity is not in the
              intellect.

              Responsio. Dicendum, quod nomen intellectus sumitur ex hoc quod
              intima rei cognoscit; est enim intelligere quasi intus legere:
              sensus enim et imaginatio sola accidentia exteriora cognoscunt;
              solus autem intellectus ad interiora et essentiam rei pertingit.
              Sed ulterius intellectus ex essentiis rerum apprehensis
              diversimode negotiatur ratiocinando et inquirendo. Nomen ergo

              The name intellect arises from the intellect’s ability to know the
              most profound elements of a thing; for to understand
              (<i>intelligere</i>) means to read what is inside a thing (<i
                >intus legere</i
              >). Sense and imagination know only external accidents, but the
              intellect alone penetrates to the interior and to the essence of a
              thing. But even beyond this, the intellect, having perceived
              essences, operates in different ways by reasoning and inquiring.
              Hence, intellect can be taken in two senses.

              autem duplex modus falsitatis tangitur in V Metaph. Similiter nec

              First, it can be taken merely according to its relation to that
              from which it first received its name. We are said to understand,
              properly speaking, when we apprehend the quiddity of things or
              when we understand those truths that are immediately known by the
              intellect, once it knows the quiddities of things. For example,
              first principles are immediately known when we know their terms,
              and for this reason intellect or understanding is called.”a habit
              of principles.” The proper object of the intellect, however, is
              the quiddity of a thing. Hence, just as the sensing of proper
              sensibles is always true, so the intellect is always true in
              knowing what a thing is, as is said in
              <i>The Soul</i>. By accident, however, falsity can occur in this
              knowing of quiddities, if the intellect falsely joins and
              separates. This happens in two ways: when it attributes the
              definition of one thing to another, as would happen were it to
              conceive that “mortal rational animal” were the definition of an
              ass; or when it joins together parts of definitions that cannot be
              joined, as would happen were it to conceive that “irrational,
              immortal animal” were the definition of an ass. For it is false to
              say that some irrational animal is immortal. So it is clear that a
              definition cannot be false except to the extent that it implies a
              false affirmation. (This twofold mode of falsity is touched upon
              in the <i>Metaphysics</i>. Similarly, the intellect is not
              deceived in any way with respect to first principles. It is plain,
              then, that if intellect is taken in the first sense—according to
              that action from which it receives the name intellect—falsity is
              not in the intellect.
