              1 When Jesus had spoken these words, he went forth with his
              disciples across the Kidron valley [brook], where there was a
              garden, which he and his disciples entered. 2 Now Judas, who
              betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with
              his disciples. 3 So Judas, procuring a band of soldiers and some
              officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees, went there with
              lanterns and torches and weapons. 4 Then Jesus, knowing all that
              was to befall him, came forward and said to them, "Whom do you
              seek?" 5 They answered him, "Jesus of Nazareth. "Jesus said to
              them, I am he." Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 6
              When he said to them, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the
              ground. 7 Again he asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said,
              "Jesus of Nazareth." 8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he;
              so, if you seek me, let these men go." 9 This was to fulfill the
              word which he had spoken, "Of those whom you gave me I lost not
              one."

            2271 Before his passion, as we saw above, our Lord prepared his
            disciples in many ways: teaching them by his example, comforting
            them with his words, and aiding them by his prayers. Now the
            Evangelist begins the history of the passion: first, he sets forth
            the mystery of the passion; secondly, the glory of the resurrection

            Christ's passion was effected partly by the Jews, and partly by the
            Gentiles. Thus, he first describes what Christ suffered from the
            Jews; secondly, what he suffered from the Gentiles (19:1). He does
            three things regarding the first: he shows how our Lord was betrayed
            by a disciple; secondly, how he was brought before the high priests
            (v 13); and thirdly, how he was accused before Pilate (v 28).

            In regard to Christ's betrayal, the Evangelist mentions three
            things: first, the place; secondly, the procedure; and thirdly, the
            willingness of Christ to submit to the betrayal (v 4). The place of
            the betrayal was shown to be appropriate in three ways: because it
            was outside the city; it was private and enclosed; and it was known
            to the traitor.

            2272 The place of the betrayal was some distance from the city, and
            so Judas could more easily do what he intended. The Evangelist says,
            <b>When Jesus had spoken these words,</b> the words we have read
            above. But since what Christ said belonged to his prayer, it would
            seem more appropriate for the Evangelist to say, "When Jesus had
            prayed." The Evangelist put it the way he did to show that Christ
            did not pray because of any need of his own, since he was the one
            who, as man, prayed, and who, as God, heard the prayer. Rather,
            Christ prayed in order to teach us. Thus this prayer is described as
            "spoken words."

            <b>He went forth with his disciples,</b> but not immediately after
            this prayer, as Augustine notes.
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>
            Other things happened, omitted by this Evangelist, but mentioned by
            the others. For example, there was an argument among the disciples
            about who was to be regarded as the greatest (Lk 22:24); before
            setting out he said to Peter: "Satan demanded to have you, that he
            might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith
            may not fail" (Lk 22:31); again, the disciples recited a hymn with
            the Lord, as Matthew (26:30) and Mark (14:26) report. And so we
            should not think that they went out immediately after the words of
            the previous chapter, but that Christ said these things before they
            went out.

            2274 He went forth
            <b>across the Kidron brook.</b> Matthew and Mark say that they went
            to the Mount of Olives, and then to a garden called Gethsemane.
            There is no conflict here, because all of them are referring to the
            same place, for the Kidron brook is at the foot of the Mount of
            Olives, where there was a garden called Gethsemane. In Greek, Kidron
            is genitive plural; and so in effect he is saying a brook "of
            cedars." Perhaps there were many cedar trees planted there.

            It is fitting for this mystery that he cross a brook, because the
            brook indicates his passion: "He will drink from the brook by the
            way; therefore he will lift up his head" (Ps 110:7). Again, it is
            fitting that he cross the Kidron brook for Kidron is interpreted to
            mean an overshadowing, and by his passion Christ removed the shadow
            of sin and of the law, and stretching out his arms on the cross, he
            protected us under the shadow of his arms: "Hide me in the shadow of
            your wings" (Ps 17:8).

            sin of our first parent which had been committed in a garden (for
            paradise means a garden of delights). It was also suitable because
            by his passion he is leading us into another garden and paradise to

            bring his disciples there after supper and teach them the deeper
            meaning of the feasts, things that others were not ready to hear.

            teach his disciples these sublime matters in the mountains or in
            private gardens, seeking places free from disturbance so they would
            not be distracted: "I will allure her, and bring her into the

            deliver him without disturbing the people. Consequently, he wanted
            to come to him privately and at night, because during the day Christ
            was always busy teaching the people. Yet even at night it was
            possible that he be hindered by a quickly gathering crowd, or by the
            darkness in which Christ could be spirited away or escape from their
            hands. So against the crowd, he armed himself with weapons, and
            against the darkness he brought lanterns and torches. And because
            some of the crowd might resist, he took a band of soldiers, not from
            the Jews, but from the governor. In this way, no one would dare to
            resist because they would see the marks of legitimate authority.
            Further, some Jews might resist out of zeal for the law, especially
            because Christ was being taken by Gentiles. For this reason Judas
            took some servants or
            <b>officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees:</b>
            "He has run against God with his head held high" [Job 15:26]; "Have
            you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?" (Lk 22:52)

            undergo betrayal: first, by voluntarily offering himself; secondly,
            by stopping one of the disciples who was resisting (v 10). In regard
            to the first, the Evangelist does two things: first, he tells how
            Christ identified himself to show his power; secondly, to show his
            patience (v 7). In regard to the first he does three things: first,

            <b>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward</b>;
            "Jesus knew that his hour had come" (13:1). The Evangelist mentions
            this for two reasons: first, so that it does not appear that the
            question he is asking comes from his ignorance; and secondly, so
            that it does not seem that he is offering himself unintentionally
            and without knowing that they have come to kill him. He knew
            everything that would happen to him.

            could be expected that they might not recognize the face of Christ
            because of the darkness. But this darkness would not explain why
            they did not know Christ from his voice, especially those who were
            quite familiar with him. By saying, <b>I am he</b>, Christ shows
            that he was not recognized even by Judas who was with them and on

            Christ's divinity. <b>Judas... was standing with them</b>, that is,

            2282 Now we see the effect of his revealing himself:
            <b>they drew back and fell to the ground.</b>
            As Gregory says, sometimes we read that the saints fall to the
            ground: "The king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and did homage
            to Daniel" (Dan 2:46); "When I saw it, I fell upon my face" (Ez
            1:28).
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>
            We also read that the evil fall: "Your men shall fall by the sword"
            (Is 3:25). Yet there is a difference. It is said that the evil fall
            backward: "Eli fell over backward from his seat" (1 Sam 4:18); while
            the saints fall on their face. The reason for this is given in
            Proverbs (4:18): "The path of the righteous is like the light of
            dawn.... The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not
            know over what they stumble." Now those who fall backward do not see
            where they fall. And so those who are evil are said to fall backward
            because they fall over things that are invisible. Those who fall
            forward see where they are falling. Thus the saints, who willingly
            cast themselves down with respect to visible things, so they can be
            raised up to invisible things, are said to fall on their face
            because they humble themselves.

            According to Chrysostom, there are two reasons why Christ asks them
            a second time whom they were seeking.
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
            First, to teach the faithful that he was captured because he willed
            it: "He was offered because it was his own will" [Is 53:7]; he had
            already shown his power because when his enemies came against him,
            they fell backward to the ground before him. Secondly, he wanted, as
            far as he could, to give the Jews a reason to be converted, having
            seen this miracle of his power: "What more was there to do for my
            vineyard, that I have not done it?" (Is 5:4). And when they were not
            converted by the revelation of his power, he voluntarily offered
            himself to be taken by them. When
            <b
              >Again he asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of
              Nazareth,</b

            he again identified himself and answered,
            <b>I told you that I am he</b>. It is obvious from this that they
            were so blind that they could not recognize him.

            2285 On the contrary. When our Lord said that none was lost, he was
            referring to the soul. How can the Evangelist adapt this to refer to
            the loss of the body? We may answer, according to Chrysostom, that
            our Lord was speaking (17:12) of the loss of both the soul and the
            body.
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
            And if he spoke only of the soul we could say that here the
            Evangelist extends it to the loss of the body. Or, we could say,
            with Augustine, that we must understand these words to refer here
            also to the loss of the soul.

            2286 The Evangelist has shown how ready Christ was to suffer his
            betrayal since he willingly offered himself. He now shows this same
            readiness because Christ forbade a disciple to resist. First, he
            mentions the resistance of the disciple; secondly, his being
            restrained (v 11). In regard to the first he does two things: first,
            he shows the zeal of the disciple in striking the servant; secondly,
            we see the name of the servant.

            Sed hic incidit duplex quaestio; quia cum dominus mandaverit
            discipulis, Matth. X, 10, quod nec etiam duas tunicas haberent,
            quomodo Petrus habebat etiam gladium? Respondeo. Dicendum quod illud
            praeceptum dedit eis Christus quando misit eos ad praedicandum, et
            durabile erat usque ad tempus passionis: unde Christus in passione
            revocavit ipsum; Lc. XXII, 35:
            <i

            2288 Two questions can be asked about this. Since the Lord had
            commanded his disciples not to have even two tunics (Mt 10:10), why
            was it that Peter had a sword? I answer that Christ gave them this
            command when he sent them out to preach, and it was to be in effect
            until his passion. But when his passion drew near, Christ revoked
            it: "When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you
            lack anything?" (Lk 22:35). And then (in v 36): "But now, let him
            who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no
            sword sell his mantle and buy one." Because of this permission Peter
            understood that he was allowed to carry a sword.

            How could he get a sword so quickly, since our Lord had spoken these
            words such a short time before? According to Chrysostom, Peter
            obtained the sword earlier, when he heard that the Jews were
            planning to deliver Christ over to the chief priests to be
            crucified.

            2289 The second question is why Peter struck the servant of the high

            One could answer that they were forbidden to resist someone in order
            to defend themselves, but this did not apply to defending the Lord.
            Or, one could say that they had not yet been strengthened by a power
            coming from above: "Stay in the city, until you are clothed with
            power from on high" (Lk 24:49). And for this reason they were not
            yet so perfect that they could not resist evil entirely.

            It is Luke (22:51) who adds that our Lord healed the ear. This is
            appropriate for a mystery: for the servant stands for the Jewish
            people, who were oppressed by the chief priests: "You eat the fat"
            (Ez 34:3). Peter, the head of the apostles, takes away this
            servant's sense of hearing, because he heard the words of the law in
            a defective way, in a carnal way. But our Lord gave him back a new
            sense of hearing: "As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me" (Ps
            18:44). With this in mind the servant is fittingly named Malchus,
            which means "king," because through Christ we have become kings by
            having a new life: "You... have made them a kingdom and priests to
            our God, and they shall reign on earth" (Rev 5:10).

            providence: "Who has resisted him and has had peace?" [Job 9:4]. The
            passion is called a cup, a drinking vessel, because the charity of
            the one suffering gave it a certain sweetness, but in its own nature
            it was bitter. It was like a healing medicine which, because it
            gives hope of being cured, acquires a certain sweetness, although it
            has a bitter taste: "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on

              12 So the band of soldiers and their captain and the officers of
              the Jews seized Jesus and bound him. 13 First they led him to
              Annas; for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high
              priest that year. 14 It was Caiaphas who had given counsel to the
              Jews that it was expedient that one man should die for the people.
              15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. As
              this disciple was known to the high priest, he entered the court
              of the high priest along with Jesus, 16 while Peter stood outside
              at the door. So the other disciple, who was known to the high
              priest, went out and spoke to the maid who kept the door, and
              brought Peter in. 17 The maid who kept the door said to Peter,
              "Are not you also one of this man's disciples?" He said, "I am
              not." 18 Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire,
              because it was cold, and they were standing and warming
              themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming
              himself. 19 The high priest then questioned Jesus about his
              disciples and his teaching. 20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken
              openly to the world; I have always taught in synagogues and in the
              temple, where all Jews come together, I have said nothing
              secretly. 21 Why do you ask me? Ask those who have heard me, what

            presented before Annas; secondly, how he was questioned by Annas (v

            2296 Two reasons can be given why Jesus was first brought to Annas.
            This could have been done by the order of Caiaphas, the high priest
            that year. Caiaphas did this because he would have had more of an
            excuse for condemning Jesus if Annas had already condemned him. The
            other reason was that they were nearer to the house of Annas, which
            was on their way. They were fearful that if the people became
            aroused Jesus might be taken away from them, and so they made
            straight for the house of Annas.

            Then Caiaphas is described as
            <b>high priest that year.</b> We should remember that according to
            the law the high priest was to hold his office for life, and when he
            died to be succeeded by his son. But as the envy and the ambition of
            the leaders increased, not only did the son not succeed the father,
            but the office itself was not held for more than a year; and even
            then it was bought with money, as Josephus says. And so it is not

            (in 11:50). The Evangelist recalls this to prevent the hearts of the
            faithful from faltering. He shows that even by the prophecy of the
            enemy Christ was captured and killed, not because he was weak and
            lacked power, but for the salvation of the people, that is, so the
            entire nation would not perish. For the testimony of one's adversary
            is very effective; and truth is of such a nature that even its enemy

            2308 The circumstances and incitement of his denial was the question
            of the maid who kept the door:
            <b
              >The maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are not you also one of
              this man's disciples?</b
            >
            She says
            <b>you also</b>
            because she knew that John was a disciple of Christ, but she did not
            mention this to him because of their friendliness. This incident
            shows how weak Peter was at that time, for he was incited to deny
            Christ under feeble circumstances. How weak these circumstances were
            is shown, first of all, from the person who asked him: for it was
            not an armed soldier or an imposing high priest, but a woman, and a
            door keeper at that. Secondly, from the very form of the question:
            she did not say, "Are you a disciple of that traitor?" but rather,
            <b>Are not you also one of this man's disciples?</b>
            This seemed to indicate a certain sympathy. We can learn from this
            that "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their
            power by the breath of his mouth" [Ps 33:6], because this same
            person who denied Christ at the questioning of a maid servant
            afterwards professed and preached the name of Christ before the
            chief priests (Acts 4:8).

            2309 Now comes Peter's denial, when he says,
            <b>He said, I am not</b>. We should note, according to Augustine,
            that Christ is denied not only by those who say that he is not the
            Christ, but also by those who deny that they are Christians.
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
            For Peter at this time did nothing other than deny that he was a
            Christian. Our Lord permitted Peter to deny him because he wanted
            the very one who was to be the head of the entire Church to be all
            the more compassionate to the weak and sinners, having experienced
            in himself his own weakness in the face of sin: "For we have not a
            high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but one
            who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without
            sinning" (Heb 4:15). This is true of Christ, and it can also be said
            of Peter, with his sins.

            Some say that Peter's denial did not come from fear, but from love:
            for he wanted to always be with Christ and to follow him all the
            time. But he knew that if he admitted he was a disciple of Christ,
            he would have been separated from him and expelled. But this does
            not agree with our Lord's words: for Peter did not deny Christ
            because he feared to be separated from him, but because he was not
            willing to lay down his life for Christ. Before, when Peter said, "I
            will lay down my life for you," Jesus answered, "Will you lay down
            your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not
            crow, till you have denied me three times" (13:37).

            the fire because of the cold, which sometimes occurs in March during
            the early spring. Peter was not attentive to the Psalm: "Be holy
            with the holy, persevere with those who persevere" [Ps 18:26]. Even
            the very time of the year corresponded to his heart, in which

            answered in three ways. First, what Christ said to the twelve
            disciples was not considered to be spoken in secret. Secondly, he

              Jesus with his hand, saying, "Is that how you answer the high
              priest?" 23 Jesus answered him, "If I have spoken wrongly, bear
              witness to the wrong; but if I have spoken rightly, why do you
              strike me?" 24 Annas then sent him bound to Caiaphas the high
              priest. 25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. They
              said to him, "Are not you also one of his disciples?" He denied it
              and said, "I am not." 26 One of the servants of the high priest, a
              kinsman of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, "Did I not
              see you in the garden with him?" 27 Peter again denied it; and at
              once the cock crowed.

            that Annas was a high priest, and that Jesus had not yet been sent
            to Caiaphas. This is why Luke mentions two high priests: "in the
            high‑priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas" (Lk 3:2). Two high priests
            are mentioned because they alternated as high priests, but that year

            being sought, and the chief priests had sent their officers to
            arrest him (7:32), they themselves were captivated by the words of

            Responsio. Dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod dicta et praecepta
            sacrae Scripturae ex factis sanctorum interpretari possunt et
            intelliguntur, cum idem spiritus sanctus qui inspiravit prophetis et
            aliis sacrae Scripturae auctoribus, moverit sanctos ad opus. Nam,
            sicut II Petr. I, 21 dicitur,
            <i>spiritu sancto inspirati locuti sunt sancti Dei homines</i>; ita
            Rom. VIII, 14, dicitur:
            <i>qui spiritu Dei aguntur, hi sunt filii Dei</i>. Sic sacra
            Scriptura intelligenda est secundum quod Christus et alii sancti
            servaverunt. Christus autem non praebuit isti aliam maxillam: nec
            Paulus, Act. XVI, 22 ss. Unde non est intelligendum quod Christus
            mandasset quod praeberent maxillam aliam corporalem ad litteram ei
            qui percutit unam; sed hoc debet intelligi quantum ad praeparationem
            animi, quod si necesse fuerit, ita debet esse dispositus ut non
            turbetur animo contra percutientem, sed paratus sit simile et etiam
            amplius sustinere. Et hoc dominus servavit, qui corpus suum praebuit
            occisioni. Sic ergo excusatio domini utilis fuit ad nostram
            instructionem.

            I say to this, with Augustine, that the statements and commands
            found in sacred scripture can be interpreted and understood from the
            actions of the saints, since it is the same Holy Spirit who inspired
            the prophets and the other sacred authors and who inspires the
            actions of the saints. As we read: "Moved by the Holy Spirit holy
            men of God spoke" (2 Pet 1:21); and "For all who are led by the
            Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom 8:14). Thus, sacred scripture
            should be understood according to the way Christ and other holy
            persons followed it. Now, Christ did not turn his other cheek here;
            and Paul did not do so either (Acts 16:22). Accordingly, we should
            not think that Christ has commanded us to actually turn our physical
            cheek to one who has struck the other. We should understand it to
            mean that we should be ready to do this if it turned out to be
            necessary to do so. That is, our attitude should be such that we
            would not be inwardly stirred up against the one striking us, but be
            ready or disposed to endure the same or even more. This is how out
            Lord observed it, for he offered his body to be killed.

            2325 The circumstance of Peter's second denial was his staying with

            Chrysostom says that although Christ was on his way to Caiaphas,
            Peter still remained with the officers [by the fire]. Peter had
            become so preoccupied with his sin after his denial that he, who
            before was so ardent, now seemed not to care what happened to
            Christ: "No man repents of his wickedness, saying, 'What have I
            done?'" (Jer 8:6). For Chrysostom,
            <b>Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself,</b>
            although Christ had already left, unmindful of the saying: "Blessed
            is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked" (Ps 1:1).

            But this interpretation is not acceptable because it would follow
            that Peter's second and third denials were made in the absence of
            Christ. This is contrary to Luke (22:61), who says that after the
            third denial of Peter, our Lord turned and looked at him. For this
            reason Augustine explains it another way and says that the
            Evangelist is giving a general view in his own way to show the
            connection and order of the denials. The Evangelist had said above
            that "the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it
            was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves; Peter also
            was with them, standing and warming himself" (v 18). The Evangelist
            then interposes the examination of Christ by the high priest (v

            denials, using practically the same words as before, "Now Simon
            Peter was standing and warming himself" (v 25), that is, referring
            to the time before Christ was sent to Caiaphas.

            2326 Then the Evangelist mentions the next two denials of Peter (v
            25). Two things are stated about each: the circumstance of the
            denial, that is, the question, and the denial itself. There are two
            questions about the literal meaning. When Matthew speaks of the
            second denial, he says, "And when he went out to the porch, another
            maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, 'This man was with
            Jesus of Nazareth.' And again he denied it with an oath" (Mt
            26:71‑2). There seems to be two disagreements here. John says that
            Peter denied Christ by the fire (v 25), and Matthew says this
            happened as Peter was going out to the porch. Again, in Matthew,
            Peter is questioned by another maid, but John has him questioned by
            others, that is, a number of others, for he says,
            <b>They said to him, Are not you also one of his disciples?</b>
            (v 25). Luke also says that Christ was questioned by one person,
            "And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted,
            saying, 'Certainly this man also was with him'" (Lk 22:59). [This is
            the third denial in Luke, and his second denial is also instigated
            by one person, Lk 22:58].

            ancilla, iterum interrogaverunt eum, ut dicit Matthaeus. Vel unus

            We should say to these points that after Peter first denied Christ,
            he then got up and as he was going out to the porch another maid
            questioned him. Or, this maid told others that Peter was one of
            them, as Matthew says (Mt 26:71). Thus Peter denied Christ a second
            time. After this Peter returned so as to avoid seeming to be a
            follower of Christ and sat with the others. As he was sitting there,
            bystanders, who had heard it from the maid, questioned him again, as
            Matthew says (Mt 26:73). Or, one of the servants asked first, as
            John has here (v 26) and then other bystanders joined in. This was
            Peter's third denial.

            was asked by several persons, while John has it asked by one. For it
            is possible that this man, being more certain, asked first, and that
            incited the others to ask also. Those who were standing about said
            many things about this matter, and one Evangelist speaks of one of
            these, and another of something else. This happened because their
            main intention was not to note these details, but to show the
            statement Peter made and to show that what our Lord had said to
            Peter came true. Accordingly, all agree on what Peter said: "What
            the Lord speaks, that will I speak" (Num 24:13).

              not be defiled, but might eat the passover.</b
            >
            Here we see, first, their useless superstition, because they would
            not go into the praetorium. Secondly, we see the deference Pilate
            paid them, since he went out to meet them. A problem arises about
            the first point: that they would not enter the praetorium so as not
            to be defiled. The other Evangelists say that Christ was seized in
            the evening, on the day of the supper; and this would be the
            passover meal: "I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with
            you" (Lk 22:15). And then in the morning of the next day he was
            brought to the praetorium. Why then do we read
            <b>so that they might eat the passover</b>, since it was the day
            after the passover? Some of the modem Greeks say that we are now on
            the fourteenth lunar day of the month, and that Christ was crucified
            on the day the Jews celebrated the passover, but that Christ
            anticipated the passover by one day, since he knew he would be
            killed on the day of the Jewish passover. Thus, he celebrated the
            passover on the thirteenth lunar day, in the evening. And since the
            law commanded that the Jews should not have leavened bread from the
            fourteenth day of the first month to the twenty‑first day, they say
            that Christ consecrated leavened bread.

            2332 This is not acceptable for two reasons. First, the Old
            Testament has no instance where anyone was permitted to anticipate
            the celebration of the passover. But if one was prevented, he could
            postpone it to the next month: "If any man of you or of your
            descendants is unclean... he shall still keep the passover to the
            Lord. In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they
            shall keep it "(Num 9:10). And since Christ never omitted any
            observance of the law, it is not true to say that he anticipated the
            passover. Secondly, Mark (14:12) states explicitly that Christ came
            on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the
            passover lamb; and Matthew says that "on the first day of Unleavened
            Bread the disciples came to Jesus saying, 'Where will you have us
            prepare for you to eat the passover?'" (Mt 26:17). So, we should not
            say that Christ anticipated the passover.

            the passover on the proper day, that is, the fourteenth day, in the

            not observe it on the proper day, but on the day following, the
            fifteenth. Thus the sense is:
            <b>so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover</b>
            which they had neglected the day before.

            <b>What accusation do you bring against this man?</b>
            Their reply was,

            about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil"

            2339 Pilate said,

            Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, 'Do you wish
            to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before
            me?'" (Acts 25:9). Or, this could be said as a taunting remark: for
            they had already examined and condemned Christ, and Pilate wanted
            those who had condemned Christ as an evildoer to pass the sentence,
            because "It was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one
            before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had
            opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against
            him" (Acts 25:16). So the meaning is then: You want my judgment, but

            mortis non erat eis servatum. Iudaei autem ex sua malitia non erant
            contenti si Christum lapidarent; sed volebant eum morte turpissima
            condemnare, ut dicitur Sap. II, v. 20. Et ideo nunc dicunt
            <i>non licet nobis interficere quemquam</i>, scilicet morte crucis.
            Vel dicendum, quod Stephanus fuit lapidatus in magistratus
            mutatione: et tunc multa illicita usurpantur, quae non fierent in
            processu temporis.

            2341 There is another question: How then could they have stoned
            Stephen (Acts 7:58)? Chrysostom answers this by saying that the
            Romans allowed the Jews to make use of their own laws, and because
            the punishment of stoning was part of their law, the Romans allowed
            them to do this.
            <a href="John18.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a>
            But in the law death on the cross was abhorred: "A hanged [on a
            tree] man is accursed by God" (Deut 21:23). And so they did not use
            this kind of death. The Jews, in their malice, were not satisfied
            just to stone Christ, they wanted to condemn him to the most
            disgraceful of deaths, as we see from Wisdom (2:20). Thus they now
            say,
            <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</b>
            meaning the death on the cross. Or, one could say that Stephen was
            stoned during a change of governors, when many laws were violated.

            Gentiles that he would be crucified and killed, but that he would be
            handed over to them by the Jews. So, in order that this be

              bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my

              this, he went out to the Jews again, and told them, "I find no
              crime in him. 39 But you have a custom that I should release one
              man for you at the Passover; will you have me release for you the

            as one proceeding cautiously, did not immediately agree with the
            accusation of the high priest, "You shall not follow a multitude to
            do evil; nor shall you bear witness in a suit, turning aside after a
            multitude, so as to pervert justice" (Ex 23:2). Rather,
            <b>Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus</b>
            aside, because he had serious doubts about him. So he called Christ
            over to examine the case more closely and to allow Christ to answer
            in more peace and away from the shouts of the Jews: "I searched out
            the cause of him whom I did not know" (Job 29:16).

            There are two reasons why someone asks a question. Sometimes it is
            to find out something that the questioner does not know; as when a
            student questions his teacher. Sometimes one asks a question about
            things he already knows in order to learn what answer will be given;
            as when a teacher questions his student. Now our Lord knew both what
            he asked about, and what answer would be given, and thus he was not
            asking out of ignorance, "All are open and laid bear to the eyes of
            him with whom we have to do" (Heb 4:13). Rather, he asked so that we
            might know what the Jews and Gentiles thought, and at the same time
            be taught about that kingdom.

            <b>Pilate answered, Am I a Jew?</b> Why did he answer this way?
            Because our Lord had asked him whether he said this on his own.
            Pilate showed by this that it was not his concern to inquire if
            Christ was the King of the Jews; it was rather the affair of the
            Jews, whose King he said he was. By giving this answer Pilate showed
            that it was others who had told him that Christ was the King of the
            Jews. Accordingly he says,
            <b
              >Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to
              me</b
            >, by bringing this charge against you. He says,
            <b>your own nation</b>, because, considering his human nature,
            Christ was born a Jew: "For I hear many whispering. Terror is on
            every side. 'Denounce him! Let us denounce him!' say all my familiar
            friends" (Jer 20:10); "A man's enemies are the men of his own house"
            (Mic 7:6). And we read <b>chief priests</b>, because the greater
            their power the greater their crime: "And in this faithlessness the
            hand of the officials and chief men has been foremost" (Ezra 9:2);
            "I will go to the great, and will speak to them; for they know the
            way of the Lord, the law of their God. But they all alike had broken
            the yoke, they had burst the bonds" (Jer 5:5). If they have handed
            you over to me, <b>What have you done?</b> It's unbelievable that
            they would have handed you over to me except for some serious
            matter.

            2350 The false idea of Christ's kingdom is rejected by his saying,
            <b>My kingdom is not of this world.</b>
            The Manicheans misunderstood this, and said that there were two gods
            and two kingdoms; there was a good god, who had his kingdom in a
            region of light, and an evil god, who had his kingdom in a region of
            darkness, and this darkness was this world, because all material
            things, they said, were darkness. The meaning would then be,
            <b>My kingdom is not of this world,</b>
            that is, God, the Father, who is good, and I, do not have our
            kingdom in this region of darkness.

            ministros, scilicet Angelos, qui potuissent eum eripere de manibus

            2353 In regard to the first, note that one who has an earthly
            kingdom, whether by right or by force, needs associates and
            ministers to keep him in power: the reason being that he is powerful
            through his ministers, not all by himself: "There was a long war
            between the house of Saul and the house of David; and David grew
            stronger and stronger, while the house of Saul became weaker and
            weaker" (2 Sam 3:1). But the heavenly king, because he is powerful
            by himself, gives power to his servants; and consequently he does
            not need ministers for his kingdom. And thus Christ says that his
            kingdom is not of this world, because
            <b
              >if my kingdom were of this world, my ministers would fight, that
              I might not be handed over to the Jews.</b
            >
            When Peter started to fight for Christ (18:10), he forgot that he
            was not of this world. Still, our Lord did have some ministers, the
            angels, who could have rescued him from the hands of the Jews, but
            he chose not to be rescued: "Do you think that I cannot appeal to my
            Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of
            angels?" (Mt 26:53).

            In one way by Augustine, so that the kingdom of Christ is his
            faithful, as was said above. Thus, Christ reigns over his faithful;
            and he came into the world to gather his faithful to himself and
            establish a kingdom: "A nobleman went into a far country to receive
            a kingdom" [Lk 19:12]. The meaning then is this:
            <b>For this I was born</b>, that is, for this purpose I was born in
            the flesh. He explains this saying,
            <b>and for this I have come into the world,</b>
            by physical birth ‑ for this is the way he came into the world, "God
            sent his Son into the world" [Gal 4:4] ‑
            <b>to bear witness to the truth,</b>
            that is, to myself, who am the truth, "Even if I do bear witness to
            myself, my testimony is true" (8:14). And to the extent that I
            manifest myself, the Truth, to that extent I establish my kingdom.
            For this cannot be done without manifesting the truth, which can
            only be done fittingly by me, who am the light: "The only Son, who
            is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known" (1:18); "It
            was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by
            those who heard him, while God also bore witness by signs and
            wonders and various miracles and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit"

            <b>for this I was born</b>, that is, born from the Father, by an
            eternal birth; just as I am God from God, so I am king from king: "I
            was appointed king" [Ps 2:6], and then follows, "Today I have
            begotten you" [v 7]. Then when he adds
            <b>and for this I have come into the world,</b>
            it is not to explain the previous words, but to refer to his birth
            in time. It is like saying: Although I am an eternal king, yet I
            have come into the world for this,

            2361 Now he shows over whom he reigns. Before (10:11), he said that
            he was a shepherd and those under him were sheep; that is the same
            as what he is saying here, that he is a king and his subjects are
            the kingdom. This is so because a king is to his subjects as a
            shepherd to his sheep; and just as a shepherd feeds his sheep ‑
            "Should not shepherds feed the sheep?" (Ez 34:2) ‑ so a king
            supports his subjects. He said in particular, "My sheep hear my
            voice" (10:27); accordingly, he also says here,
            <b>every one who is of the truth hears my voice,</b>
            not just outwardly, but with an interior belief and love, and
            carrying this out in action: "Every one who has heard and learned
            from the Father comes to me" (6:45). But why does a person hear my

            2364 Now the Evangelist tells us the effect of Christ's answer. We
            can see from this that Pilate abandoned his idea that Christ had an
            earthly kingdom, and now thought of Christ as a king in the sense of
            one who teaches the truth. He desired to learn this truth and to
            become a member of this kingdom and so he said,
            <b>What is truth?</b>
            He was not asking for a definition of truth, but wanted to know that
            truth by whose power he could become a member of this kingdom. This
            indicates that truth was not known by the world and had vanished
            from almost everyone, as long as they remained unbelievers: "Truth
            has fallen in the public squares, and uprightness cannot enter" (Is
            59:14); "Truth has decayed in the children of men" [Ps 12:1]. But
            Pilate did not wait for Christ's answer.

            Veritas enim de sui ratione importat commensurationem rei ad

            By its nature truth implies a conformity between a reality and the
            intellect. The intellect is related in two ways to reality. An
            intellect can be related to things as a measure of these things;
            that would be the intellect which is the cause of these things.
            Another intellect is measured by things, this would be an intellect
            whose knowledge is caused by these things. Now truth is not in the
            divine intellect because the intellect is conformed to things, but
            because things are conformed to the divine intellect. While truth is
            in our intellect because it understands things, conforms to them, as
            they are. And so uncreated truth and the divine intellect is a truth
            which is not measured or made, but a truth which measures and makes
            two kinds of truth: one is in the things themselves, insofar as it
            makes them so they are in conformity with what they are in the
            divine intellect; and it makes the other truth in our souls, and
            this is a measured truth, not a measuring truth. Therefore, the
            uncreated truth of the divine intellect is appropriated, especially
            referred, to the Son, who is the very concept of the divine
            intellect and the Word of God. For truth is a consequence of the
            intellect's concept.

        Chrysostom-(This is NOT what Chrysostom says in In Ioannem hom,
        83.3.452) Chrysostom says that the whole feast was called the Passover
        and that Christ died on the high day of the Feast, on which day the
        Passover was customarily/formerly celebrated.) This should probably be
        looked at by a better Latinist.
