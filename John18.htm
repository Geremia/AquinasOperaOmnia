"Jesus said to them, I am he." Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them. 6 When he said to them, "I am he," they drew back and fell to the ground. 7 Again he asked them, "Whom do you seek?" And they said, "Jesus of Nazareth." 8 Jesus answered, "I told you that I am he; so, if you seek me, let these men go." 9 This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken, "Of those whom you gave me I lost not one." <a href="John18.htm#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" id="_ftnref1">[1]</a>

          <td>Supra, ante passionem, dominus praeparavit discipulos suos, multipliciter informando exemplis, confortando verbis, et promovendo suffragiis; hic Evangelista accedit ad narrandum eius passionem, et primo proponit mysterium passionis; secundo gloriam resurrectionis, XX cap. ibi <i>una autem sabbati</i> et cetera.
          <td>2271 Before his passion, as we saw above, our Lord prepared his disciples in many ways: teaching them by his example, comforting them with his words, and aiding them by his prayers. Now the Evangelist begins the history of the passion: first, he sets forth the mystery of the passion; secondly, the glory of the resurrection (20:1).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Passio autem Christi partim completa est per Iudaeos, partim per gentiles. Primo ergo describit passionem Christi quantum ad ea quae passus est per Iudaeos; secundo quantum ad ea quae passus est per gentiles, XIX cap., ibi <i>tunc apprehendit Pilatus</i> et cetera. Circa primum tria facit. Primo ostendit quomodo a discipulo dominus traditur; secundo quomodo a ministris principibus praesentatur, ibi <i>cohors ergo, et tribunus, et ministri Iudaeorum comprehenderunt Iesum</i>; tertio quomodo a principibus apud praesidem accusatur, ibi <i>adducunt ergo Iesum</i> et cetera.
          <td>Christ's passion was effected partly by the Jews, and partly by the Gentiles. Thus, he first describes what Christ suffered from the Jews; secondly, what he suffered from the Gentiles (19:1). He does three things regarding the first: he shows how our Lord was betrayed by a disciple; secondly, how he was brought before the high priests (v 13); and thirdly, how he was accused before Pilate (v 28).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa proditionem discipuli tria tangit Evangelista. Primo quidem locum; secundo apparatum, ibi <i>Iudas ergo cum accepisset cohortem (...) venit illuc cum lanternis</i> etc.; tertio promptum Christi affectum ad proditionem sustinendam, ibi <i>Iesus itaque sciens omnia quae ventura erant super eum, processit</i> et cetera. Locus autem ostenditur proditioni congruus ex tribus: quia a civitate remotus, in se occultus et conclusus, et proditori notus.
          <td>In regard to Christ's betrayal, the Evangelist mentions three things: first, the place; secondly, the procedure; and thirdly, the willingness of Christ to submit to the betrayal (v 4). The place of the betrayal was shown to be appropriate in three ways: because it was outside the city; it was private and enclosed; and it was known to the traitor.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Remotus quidem erat a civitate, unde facilius Iudas poterat facere quod intendebat: unde dicit <i>haec cum dixisset</i>, scilicet quae supra dicta sunt. Sed cum ea quae dixit, pertinerent ad Christi orationem, convenientius dixisset Evangelista: haec cum orasset. Sed hoc fecit Evangelista ut ostendat hanc orationem non propter sui necessitatem fecisse, quia ipse erat qui orabat ut homo, et exaudiebat ut Deus: sed hoc propter nostram instructionem. Unde erat quasi quaedam dictio.
          <td>2272 The place of the betrayal was some distance from the city, and so Judas could more easily do what he intended. The Evangelist says, <b>When Jesus had spoken these words,</b> the words we have read above. But since what Christ said belonged to his prayer, it would seem more appropriate for the Evangelist to say, "When Jesus had prayed." The Evangelist put it the way he did to show that Christ did not pray because of any need of his own, since he was the one who, as man, prayed, and who, as God, heard the prayer. Rather, Christ prayed in order to teach us. Thus this prayer is described as "spoken words."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><i>Egressus est cum discipulis suis</i>, non quidem continuo, secundum Augustinum, post eius orationem, cum alia quaedam intervenerint narrata ab aliis Evangelistis, ab isto autem praetermissa, scilicet quod facta fuit contentio inter discipulos quis eorum videretur esse maior, Lc. XXII, 24. Interim etiam dixit Iesus Petro: <i>ecce Satanas expetivit vos ut cribraret sicut triticum. Ego autem rogavi pro te, ut non deficiat fides tua</i>: ut Lucas narrat ibid. 31. Dixerunt etiam discipuli hymnum cum domino, ut narrant Matthaeus et Marcus. Sic ergo non est intelligendum, quod cum hoc dixisset, statim egrederetur: sed quia non ante egressus est quam dixisset.
          <td>
            2273 <b>He went forth with his disciples,</b> but not immediately after this prayer, as Augustine notes. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a> Other things happened, omitted by this Evangelist, but mentioned by the others. For example, there was an argument among the disciples about who was to be regarded as the greatest (Lk 22:24); before setting out he said to Peter: "Satan demanded to have you, that he might sift you like wheat, but I have prayed for you that your faith may not fail" (Lk 22:31); again, the disciples recited a hymn with the Lord, as Matthew (26:30) and Mark (14:26) report. And so we should not think that they went out immediately after the words of the previous chapter, but that Christ said these things before they went out.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td><i>Egressus est</i>, inquam, <i>trans torrentem Cedron</i>. Sed Matthaeus et Marcus dicunt, quod exierunt in montem oliveti, et tunc venit cum illis in villam quae dicitur Gethsemani. In quo nulla est contrarietas, quod idem locus est quem Ioannes commemorat et Matthaeus: torrens enim Cedron est ad radices montis oliveti, ubi etiam est villa quae dicitur Gethsemani. Cedron autem in Graeco est genitivus pluralis; quasi dicat: trans torrentem cedrorum. Forte erant ibi multae cedri plantae.
          <td>2274 He went forth <b>across the Kidron brook.</b> Matthew and Mark say that they went to the Mount of Olives, and then to a garden called Gethsemane. There is no conflict here, because all of them are referring to the same place, for the Kidron brook is at the foot of the Mount of Olives, where there was a garden called Gethsemane. In Greek, Kidron is genitive plural; and so in effect he is saying a brook "of cedars." Perhaps there were many cedar trees planted there.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Convenit autem mysterio quod torrentem transivit, quia per eum eius passio designatur; Ps. CIX, 7: <i>de torrente in via bibet, propterea exaltavit caput</i>. Convenit etiam quod trans torrentem Cedron. Cedron enim interpretatur obumbratio, et Christus sua passione abstulit umbram peccati et legis, et expansis manibus in cruce protexit nos sub umbra manus suae; Ps. XVI, 9: <i>sub umbra alarum tuarum protege me</i>.
          <td>It is fitting for this mystery that he cross a brook, because the brook indicates his passion: "He will drink from the brook by the way; therefore he will lift up his head" (Ps 110:7). Again, it is fitting that he cross the Kidron brook for Kidron is interpreted to mean an overshadowing, and by his passion Christ removed the shadow of sin and of the law, and stretching out his arms on the cross, he protected us under the shadow of his arms: "Hide me in the shadow of your wings" (Ps 17:8).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Erat autem congruus locus proditioni: unde dicit <i>ubi erat hortus, in quem introivit ipse, et discipuli eius</i>. Et hoc convenienter, quia ipse satisfaciebat pro peccato primi hominis in horto commisso. Paradisus enim hortus deliciarum interpretatur. Item quia per passionem nos in hortum et Paradisum coronandos introducit; Lc. XXIII, 43: <i>hodie mecum eris in Paradiso</i>.
          <td>2275 The place was especially suitable for the betrayal. He says, <b>there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.</b> This was especially suitable because Christ was satisfying for the sin of our first parent which had been committed in a garden (for paradise means a garden of delights). It was also suitable because by his passion he is leading us into another garden and paradise to receive a crown: "Today you will be with me in Paradise" (Lk 23:43).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Erat etiam congruus locus, quia proditori notus; unde dicit <i>sciebat autem Iudas, qui tradebat eum, locum</i>; et huius ratio est, <i>quia frequenter Iesus venerat illuc cum discipulis suis</i>, inter quos Iudas fuerat sicut lupus inter oves; supra VI, 71: <i>nonne ego vos duodecim elegi, et ex vobis unus Diabolus est?</i> Lupus ovina pelle contectus, et inter oves alto patrisfamilias consilio toleratus, didicit ubi ad tempus exiguum ovium dispergeret gregem.
          <td>2276 It was also an appropriate place because it was known to the traitor, <b>now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place; for Jesus often met there with his disciples,</b> including Judas, who was like a wolf among sheep: "Did I not choose you, the twelve, and one of you is a devil?" (6:71). This wolf in sheep's clothing, who had been tolerated among the sheep according to the profound plan of the master, learned where he could scatter the small flock when the time came.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed cum Iudas diu ante exierit a coena ut proditionem compleret, quaeritur quomodo scivit quod Christus illa hora egrederetur illuc? Ad quod dicendum, secundum Chrysostomum, quod consuetudo Christi erat, et praecipue in magnis festis, post coenam discipulos seorsum ducere, et aliqua sublimia de festo docere, quae non erat fas alios audire: et ideo quia tunc erat festum praecipuum, existimavit Iudas quod post coenam illuc exisset. Fecit autem hoc ut in montibus et in hortis sublimia doceret discipulos, maxime purum a tumultibus inquirens locum, ne eorum mens impediatur; Oseae II, 14: <i>ducam eam in solitudinem, et loquar ad cor eius</i>.
          <td>
            2277 Since Judas had left the supper a while before the others, how did he know that Christ would later be in the garden? Chrysostom says that it was Christ's custom, especially at the major feasts, to bring his disciples there after supper and teach them the deeper meaning of the feasts, things that others were not ready to hear. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title="" id="_ftnref3">[3]</a> And so, because this was an important feast, Judas surmised that Christ would be going there after supper. It was Christ's custom to teach his disciples these sublime matters in the mountains or in private gardens, seeking places free from disturbance so they would not be distracted: "I will allure her, and bring her into the wilderness, and speak tenderly to her" (Hos 2:14).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur proditoris apparatus. Et nota, quod, sicut dicitur Lc. XXII, 3 ss., Iudas postquam tractaverat proditionem cum principibus, quaerebat opportunitatem quomodo sine turbarum tumultu traderet eum: et ideo voluit eum in secreto invenire, et in nocte, quia in die semper circa turbarum instructionem occupatus erat. Sed quia in nocte poterat impediri vel propter subitum concursum turbarum, vel propter tenebras, quibus posset eripi vel evadere de manibus eorum; ideo contra turbas munivit se armis, contra tenebras lanternis et facibus. Sed quia de turba aliqui poterant sibi resistere per potentiam populi, ideo contra hos accepit cohortem, non Iudaeorum, sed militum a praeside: ut sic servato ordine legitimae potestatis, nullus ei auderet obsistere. Item aliqui ex Iudaeis zelo legis ducti, praesertim quia a gentilibus capiebatur, eis fortasse resistere voluissent: et ideo accepit etiam <i>a pontificibus et Pharisaeis ministros, et venit illuc</i>. Iob XV, 26: <i>cucurrit adversus Deum erecto collo</i>; Lc. XXII, 52: <i>tamquam ad latronem existis cum gladiis et fustibus</i>.
          <td>2278 Now the Evangelist shows the procedure of the traitor. Notice, as we see from Luke (22:4), that after Judas had agreed with the chief priests to betray Christ, he looked for an opportunity to deliver him without disturbing the people. Consequently, he wanted to come to him privately and at night, because during the day Christ was always busy teaching the people. Yet even at night it was possible that he be hindered by a quickly gathering crowd, or by the darkness in which Christ could be spirited away or escape from their hands. So against the crowd, he armed himself with weapons, and against the darkness he brought lanterns and torches. And because some of the crowd might resist, he took a band of soldiers, not from the Jews, but from the governor. In this way, no one would dare to resist because they would see the marks of legitimate authority. Further, some Jews might resist out of zeal for the law, especially because Christ was being taken by Gentiles. For this reason Judas took some servants or <b>officers from the chief priests and the Pharisees:</b> "He has run against God with his head held high" [Job 15:26]; "Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs?" (Lk 22:52)
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponit Evangelista promptum Christi affectum ad proditionem voluntarie suscipiendam, dupliciter. Primo se voluntarie offerendo; secundo discipulum resistentem comprimendo, ibi <i>Simon ergo Petrus habens gladium, eduxit eum</i>. Et circa primum duo facit Evangelista. Primo narrat quod Christus ostendit se, ad ostendendum suam potentiam; secundo ad demonstrandum suam patientiam, ibi <i>iterum ergo interrogavit eos, quem quaeritis?</i> Circa primum tria facit. Primo ponit Christi interrogationem; secundo suiipsius manifestationem, ibi <i>dixit eis Iesus, ego sum</i>; tertio manifestationis effectum, ibi <i>ut ergo dixit eis, ego sum, abierunt retrorsum</i>.
          <td>2279 Now the Evangelist shows the promptness of Christ to willingly undergo betrayal: first, by voluntarily offering himself; secondly, by stopping one of the disciples who was resisting (v 10). In regard to the first, the Evangelist does two things: first, he tells how Christ identified himself to show his power; secondly, to show his patience (v 7). In regard to the first he does three things: first, he states the question Christ asked; secondly, he shows Christ identifying himself, <b>I am he</b>; thirdly, we see the effect this has (v 6).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum tria facit. Primo commendat Christi scientiam et cognitionem: <i>quia Iesus sciens omnia quae ventura erant super eum, processit</i> etc.; supra XIII, 1: <i>sciens Iesus quia venit hora eius</i> et cetera. Quod interposuit Evangelista propter duo. Primo ne videretur interrogationem quam facturus erat eis Christus, ex ignorantia fecisse; secundo ne videatur quod se ipsis invitum et propter ignorantiam obtulisset, cum venirent ad eum occidendum. Unde <i>omnia quae ventura erant super eum</i>, sciebat.
          <td>2280 He does three things regarding the first. First, he recalls Christ's knowledge: <b>Then Jesus, knowing all that was to befall him, came forward</b>; "Jesus knew that his hour had come" (13:1). The Evangelist mentions this for two reasons: first, so that it does not appear that the question he is asking comes from his ignorance; and secondly, so that it does not seem that he is offering himself unintentionally and without knowing that they have come to kill him. He knew everything that would happen to him.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ponit Christi interrogationem, qui cum ista sciret tamen <i>processit, et dixit ad eos, quem quaeritis?</i> Non ex ignorantia, ut dictum est. Tertio subdit ipsorum responsionem: quia <i>Iesum Nazarenum</i>, supple, quaerimus, non quidem ad imitandum, sed ad malignandum et occidendum. Unde supra VIII, 11: <i>quaeritis me, et in peccato vestro moriemini</i>.
          <td>Secondly, he states Christ's question, for although he knew all these things he <b>came forward and said to them, Whom do you seek?</b> But this was not because of his ignorance, as we said. Thirdly, he gives their answer, <b>Jesus of Nazareth</b>. They were seeking him not to imitate him, but to slander and kill him: "You will seek me and die in your sin" (8:21).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur suiipsius manifestatio, qua se eis capiendum exhibuit: unde dicit <i>ego sum</i>, scilicet Iesus Nazarenus quem quaeritis. Addit autem Evangelista Iudae praesentiam: ideo quia supra dixit quod Iudas ab eo exiverat. Posset autem credi quod non esset mirum, si Christus ab eis non cognosceretur facie propter tenebras; sed quod quis non cognoscatur voce, maxime a multum sibi familiari, hoc non potest tenebris ascribi. Ostendit ergo per hoc quod dicit <i>ego sum</i>, quod etiam a Iuda familiari sibi, qui stabat cum ipsis, non est cognitus: quod est maxime divinitatis Christi potentiae ostensivum. <i>Stabat ergo Iudas cum ipsis</i>; idest perseverabat in malo, ut eum osculi signo monstraret; Is. XXXIII: <i>os eius erit</i> et cetera.
          <td>2281 Now we see Jesus identifying himself and offering himself so that they can seize him. <b>I am he</b>, he says, that is, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are looking for. The Evangelist adds that Judas was also there because he had mentioned before that Judas had left them (13:31). It could be expected that they might not recognize the face of Christ because of the darkness. But this darkness would not explain why they did not know Christ from his voice, especially those who were quite familiar with him. By saying, <b>I am he</b>, Christ shows that he was not recognized even by Judas who was with them and on close terms with Christ. This in particular shows the power of Christ's divinity. <b>Judas... was standing with them</b>, that is, he continued in his evil to the point of identifying him with a kiss.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hic ponitur manifestationis effectus: quia <i>abierunt retrorsum, et ceciderunt in terram</i>. Et, ut Gregorius dicit, aliquando legitur de sanctis, quod cadunt in terram; Daniel. II, 46: <i>cecidit in faciem suam, et adoravit Danielem</i> etc.; Ez. II, 1: <i>cecidi in faciem meam</i>. De iniquis autem legitur quod cadunt; Is. III, 25: <i>pulcherrimi viri tui cadent</i>. Sed haec est differentia: quia de iniquis dicitur quod cadunt retrorsum, I Reg. c. IV, 18, <i>cecidit de sella retrorsum</i>; de sanctis autem quod cadunt in faciem suam. Cuius ratio assignatur Prov. IV, 18: <i>quia iustorum semita quasi lux splendens procedit, et crescit usque ad perfectam diem</i>. Et <i>via impiorum tenebrosa, nesciunt ubi corruant</i>. Omnis enim qui post se cadit, ibi cadit ubi non videt. Iniqui ergo, quia in invisibilibus cadunt, retrorsum cadere dicuntur: quia ibi currunt ubi quid eos tunc sequatur, modo videre non possunt. Sed qui ante se cadit, ibi cadit ubi videt: et ideo sancti qui in istis visibilibus semetipsos sponte deiiciunt, ut in invisibilibus erigantur, in faciem suam cadere dicuntur, quia timore compuncti videntes humiliantur.
          <td>
            2282 Now we see the effect of his revealing himself: <b>they drew back and fell to the ground.</b> As Gregory says, sometimes we read that the saints fall to the ground: "The king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face and did homage to Daniel" (Dan 2:46); "When I saw it, I fell upon my face" (Ez 1:28). <a href="John18.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a> We also read that the evil fall: "Your men shall fall by the sword" (Is 3:25). Yet there is a difference. It is said that the evil fall backward: "Eli fell over backward from his seat" (1 Sam 4:18); while the saints fall on their face. The reason for this is given in Proverbs (4:18): "The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn.... The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble." Now those who fall backward do not see where they fall. And so those who are evil are said to fall backward because they fall over things that are invisible. Those who fall forward see where they are falling. Thus the saints, who willingly cast themselves down with respect to visible things, so they can be raised up to invisible things, are said to fall on their face because they humble themselves.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Mystice autem, per hoc quod ceciderunt retrorsum, datur intelligi quod populus Iudaeorum, qui erat populus peculiaris, vocem Christi in praedicatione non audiens, abiit retrorsum exclusus a regno. Hic ponitur secunda interrogatio.
          <td>Mystically understood, we can say that by this falling backward we can understand that the Jewish people, who were a special people, because they did not listen to the voice of Christ in his preaching, fell backward, excluded from the kingdom.

          <td>Et primo ponit iteratam interrogationem; secundo Christi manifestationem, et tertio eius oblationem.
          <td>2283 Now we see Christ questioning them a second time. First we see his question; secondly, he identifies himself; thirdly, he offers himself to them.

V, 4: <i>quid ultra debui facere?</i> Et ideo cum statim ad ostensionem suae potentiae non fuerunt conversi, eis capiendum se sponte obtulit. Unde cum iterum <i>interrogavit eos: quem quaeritis?

          <td>
            According to Chrysostom, there are two reasons why Christ asks them a second time whom they were seeking. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a> First, to teach the faithful that he was captured because he willed it: "He was offered because it was his own will" [Is 53:7]; he had already shown his power because when his enemies came against him, they fell backward to the ground before him. Secondly, he wanted, as far as he could, to give the Jews a reason to be converted, having seen this miracle of his power: "What more was there to do for my vineyard, that I have not done it?" (Is 5:4). And when they were not converted by the revelation of his power, he voluntarily offered himself to be taken by them. When <b>Again he asked them, Whom do you seek? And they said, Jesus of Nazareth,</b> he again identified himself and answered, <b>I told you that I am he</b>. It is obvious from this that they were so blind that they could not recognize him.

In quo patet quod ipse dedit eis potestatem eum capiendi: nam sicut ex sua potentia discipulos suos servavit, ita multo magis se servare potuisset; supra X, 18: <i>nemo tollit animam meam: sed ego pono eam a meipso</i>.

It is clear from this that Christ gave them the power to capture him, for just as he saved his disciples by his own power, so, much more clearly, he could have saved himself: "No one takes it [my life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (10:18).

          <td>2284 The Evangelist shows that the officers allowed the apostles to leave not because Christ persuaded them to do so, but because of his power, when he says, <b>This was to fulfill the word which he had spoken.</b> The officers let the apostles go because they were not able to hold them, since Christ had said that <b>of those whom you gave me I lost not one</b>.

            2285 On the contrary. When our Lord said that none was lost, he was referring to the soul. How can the Evangelist adapt this to refer to the loss of the body? We may answer, according to Chrysostom, that our Lord was speaking (17:12) of the loss of both the soul and the body. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a> And if he spoke only of the soul we could say that here the Evangelist extends it to the loss of the body. Or, we could say, with Augustine, that we must understand these words to refer here also to the loss of the soul. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" id="_ftnref7">[7]</a> The reason being that the apostles did not yet believe in the way that those who do not perish believe. And so, if they had left the world then, some would have perished.

          <td>2286 The Evangelist has shown how ready Christ was to suffer his betrayal since he willingly offered himself. He now shows this same readiness because Christ forbade a disciple to resist. First, he mentions the resistance of the disciple; secondly, his being restrained (v 11). In regard to the first he does two things: first, he shows the zeal of the disciple in striking the servant; secondly, we see the name of the servant.

This was not his intention; rather, he wanted to kill him, but the strike to the servant's head missed and struck the ear. Peter aimed for the head so that he could more easily show that he was doing it out of zeal for his Lord: "I have been very jealous for the Lord" (1 Kgs 19:10).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed hic incidit duplex quaestio; quia cum dominus mandaverit discipulis, Matth. X, 10, quod nec etiam duas tunicas haberent, quomodo Petrus habebat etiam gladium? Respondeo. Dicendum quod illud praeceptum dedit eis Christus quando misit eos ad praedicandum, et durabile erat usque ad tempus passionis: unde Christus in passione revocavit ipsum; Lc. XXII, 35: <i>quando misi vos sine sacculo et pera, numquid aliquid defuit vobis?</i> Et infra: <i>sed nunc qui habet sacculum, tollat similiter et peram; et qui non habet, vendat tunicam suam, et emat gladium</i>. Ex hac concessione Petrus intellexerat quod liceret ei portare gladium.
          <td>2288 Two questions can be asked about this. Since the Lord had commanded his disciples not to have even two tunics (Mt 10:10), why was it that Peter had a sword? I answer that Christ gave them this command when he sent them out to preach, and it was to be in effect until his passion. But when his passion drew near, Christ revoked it: "When I sent you out with no purse or bag or sandals, did you lack anything?" (Lk 22:35). And then (in v 36): "But now, let him who has a purse take it, and likewise a bag. And let him who has no sword sell his mantle and buy one." Because of this permission Peter understood that he was allowed to carry a sword.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed unde tam cito potuisset gladium habere, cum praedicta verba dixisset dominus paulo ante? Dicendum, secundum Chrysostomum, quod Petrus iamdiu ante, audiens quod Iudaei Christum tradere deberent principibus sacerdotum ad crucifigendum, timens praeparaverat sibi gladium. Vel dicendum, secundum interlinearem, quod gladius accipitur hic pro cultello quem forte habuerat in mensa ad esum agni, et de coena surgens tulerat secum.
          <td>
            How could he get a sword so quickly, since our Lord had spoken these words such a short time before? According to Chrysostom, Peter obtained the sword earlier, when he heard that the Jews were planning to deliver Christ over to the chief priests to be crucified. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" id="_ftnref8">[8]</a> Or, we could say, with the Interlinear, that "sword" is used here for a knife, which he probably had at the paschal meal, and which he took along when they left. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" id="_ftnref9">[9]</a>

          <td>Secundo quaeritur, quod cum dominus dixisset eis quod non resisterent malo, Matth. V, 39, quid est, quod Petrus percussit servum principis? Ad quod dicendum, quod dominus prohibuit quod non resisterent alicui ad defendendum seipsos, non autem ad defendendum dominum. Vel dicendum, quod nondum confirmati erant virtute superveniente ex alto; Lc. ult., 49: <i>sedete in civitate, quoadusque induamini virtute ex alto</i>. Ideo non erant adhuc perfecti, ut omnino malo non resisterent.
          <td>2289 The second question is why Peter struck the servant of the high priest, since our Lord had told them not to resist evil (Mt 5:39). One could answer that they were forbidden to resist someone in order to defend themselves, but this did not apply to defending the Lord. Or, one could say that they had not yet been strengthened by a power coming from above: "Stay in the city, until you are clothed with power from on high" (Lk 24:49). And for this reason they were not yet so perfect that they could not resist evil entirely.

          <td>2290 Now the name of the servant is given. Only John mentions this name because, as stated below (v 15), John himself was known by the high priest, and so he also knew some of the priest's servants. Since John was certain of this servant's name, he gives it.

Istius ergo servi Petrus princeps apostolorum amputavit auditum: quia male audiebat verba legis, carnaliter scilicet; sed dominus restituit novum auditum; Ps. XVII, 45: <i>in auditu auris obedivit mihi</i>. Et secundum hoc congrue vocatur Malchus, idest rex, quia per Christum in novitate vitae efficimur reges; Apoc. V, 10: <i>fecisti nos Deo nostro regnum et sacerdotes, et regnabimus super terram</i>.
          <td>It is Luke (22:51) who adds that our Lord healed the ear. This is appropriate for a mystery: for the servant stands for the Jewish people, who were oppressed by the chief priests: "You eat the fat" (Ez 34:3). Peter, the head of the apostles, takes away this servant's sense of hearing, because he heard the words of the law in a defective way, in a carnal way. But our Lord gave him back a new sense of hearing: "As soon as they heard of me they obeyed me" (Ps 18:44). With this in mind the servant is fittingly named Malchus, which means "king," because through Christ we have become kings by having a new life: "You... have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on earth" (Rev 5:10).

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo, quod Petrus ita eduxit gladium, sed dominus dixit ei <i>mitte gladium tuum in vaginam</i>, quasi non esset opus defensionis, sed patientiae, nec ei licitus usus gladii materialis: Ier. XLVII, 6: <i>usquequo concideris? O mucro domini, usquequo non quiesces?</i> Mystice autem signatur per hoc, quod gladius verbi Dei mittendus erat in vaginam, idest in fidem gentilium.
          <td>2292 The Evangelist says that Peter drew his sword, and our Lord said to him, <b>Put your sword into its sheath.</b> It was like saying that it was not defense that was needed, but patience, and that he was not allowed to use a material sword: "Ah, sword of the Lord! How long till you are quiet?" (Jer 47:6). The mystical interpretation is that this signifies that the sword of God's word was to be put into its sheath, that is, into the faith of the Gentiles.

          <td>Et ratio cohibitionis ponitur cum dicit <i>calicem quem dedit mihi pater, non vis ut bibam illum?</i> Non enim resistendum his quae ex divina providentia disponuntur; Iob IX, 4: <i>quis restitit ei, et pacem habuit?</i> Dicitur autem passio calix, quia ex caritate patientis dulcedinem habet, sed ex natura sua amaritudinem; sicut et medicina sanativa, propter spem sanitatis dulcis est, sed amara propter saporem; Ps. CXIV, 13: <i>calicem salutaris accipiam, et nomen domini invocabo</i>.
          <td>2293 The reason Christ restrained Peter is given when he says, <b>Shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?</b> For one should not resist what has been arranged by divine providence: "Who has resisted him and has had peace?" [Job 9:4]. The passion is called a cup, a drinking vessel, because the charity of the one suffering gave it a certain sweetness, but in its own nature it was bitter. It was like a healing medicine which, because it gives hope of being cured, acquires a certain sweetness, although it has a bitter taste: "I will lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord" (Ps 116:13).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Hunc ergo calicem dedit ei pater, quia passionem ex sua et patris voluntate sponte suscepit; infra XIX, 11: <i>non haberes in me potestatem, nisi datum esset tibi desuper</i>.
          <td>The Father gave Christ this cup because Christ willingly underwent the passion by his own will and by the will of the Father: "You would have no power over me unless it had been given you from above" (19:11).

Perhaps they were thinking of the Psalm (71:11): "God has forsaken him; pursue and seize him, for there is none to deliver him." Again, "The breath of our mouth, Christ the Lord, is taken in our sins," that is, on account of our sins, in order to free us: "Even the captives of the mighty shall be taken" (Is 49:25).

Alia ratio ex propinquitate domus Annae quae, in via posita, propinquior erat. Et ideo timentes ne si excitaretur tumultus populi, Iesus de manibus eorum eriperetur, declinaverunt illuc.
          <td>2296 Two reasons can be given why Jesus was first brought to Annas. This could have been done by the order of Caiaphas, the high priest that year. Caiaphas did this because he would have had more of an excuse for condemning Jesus if Annas had already condemned him. The other reason was that they were nearer to the house of Annas, which was on their way. They were fearful that if the people became aroused Jesus might be taken away from them, and so they made straight for the house of Annas.

Postmodum vero invidia et ambitione principum crescente, non solum patri non succedebat filius, sed nec ultra annum pontificatus fungebatur officio, et hoc ipsum pecunia procurabat, ut Iosephus dicit. Et ideo non est mirum si in anno illius pontificatus tam nequiter acquisiti rem sic nefariam gessit.
          <td>2297 Here the high priest is described by his relationship to Caiaphas, <b>he was the father‑in‑law of Caiaphas.</b> Then Caiaphas is described as <b>high priest that year.</b> We should remember that according to the law the high priest was to hold his office for life, and when he died to be succeeded by his son. But as the envy and the ambition of the leaders increased, not only did the son not succeed the father, but the office itself was not held for more than a year; and even then it was bought with money, as Josephus says. And so it is not out of character that in the year of that high priesthood, so wickedly obtained, that the high priest acted so despicably.

The Evangelist recalls this to prevent the hearts of the faithful from faltering. He shows that even by the prophecy of the enemy Christ was captured and killed, not because he was weak and lacked power, but for the salvation of the people, that is, so the entire nation would not perish. For the testimony of one's adversary is very effective; and truth is of such a nature that even its enemy is unable not to speak it.

Those in the active life follow Christ by obedience, "My sheep hear my voice" (10:27). Those in the contemplative life follow Christ by knowledge and contemplation, "We will know and follow you" [Ps 4:3].

Apost. dicitur, quod <i>miserunt ad illos Petrum et Ioannem</i>. Et iterum: <i>Petrus et Ioannes ascenderunt in templum ad horam orationis nonam</i>.
          <td>2302 These two disciples followed Christ because they loved him more than the others did; and so they were the first to come to the tomb (20:2). And it was these two who came because they were united to each other by a stronger bond of love; and so they are frequently mentioned together in the Gospel and in the Acts, where we read that "They sent to them Peter and John" (Acts 8:14), and again that "Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer" (Acts 3:1).

Nec hoc posuit Ioannes propter sui iactantiam, sed propter humilitatem, ne hoc quod primo intravit quam Petrus cum Iesu in atrium pontificis et non Petrus, magis virtuti suae, et maioritati quam notitiae adscribatur.

          <td>2304 It was John who entered first, with Jesus, <b>as this disciple was known to the high priest... while Peter stood outside at the door.</b> Although John had been a fisherman and had been called as a young man by Christ, he was still known by the high priest, either because John's father was a servant of the high priest, or a relative. John did not mention that the high priest knew him because he was proud, but because of his humility, so that the fact that he was the first to enter, with Jesus, into the court of the high priest, ahead of Peter, would not be ascribed to his virtue and superiority rather than to his acquaintance with the high priest. Thus he says, <b>as this disciple</b>, John himself, <b>was known to the high priest</b>. Consequently, he was able to enter with Jesus into the high priest's court, where Christ had been led. <b>While Peter stood outside</b>; this was like a foreboding of his future denial: "Those who saw me, fled outside from me" [Ps 31:11].

          <td>2305 Mystically understood, John enters with Jesus because the contemplative life is one of familiarity with Jesus: "When I enter my house, I shall find rest with her [wisdom]" (Wis 8:16). Peter stands outside because the active life is busy with exterior things: "Mary sat at the Lord's feet and listened to his teaching. But Martha was distracted with much serving" (Lk 10:39).

Per quod mystice datur intelligi quod per contemplativam introducitur ad Christum activa vita: sicut enim ratio inferior dirigitur per superiorem, ita activa per contemplativam; Ps. XLII, 3: <i>emitte lucem tuam et veritatem tuam: ipsa me deduxerunt et adduxerunt in montem sanctum tuum, et in tabernacula tua</i>.

The mystical interpretation of this is that the active life is brought to Christ by the contemplative life: for just as the lower reason is directed by the higher reason, so the active life is directed by the contemplative life: "Oh send out your light and your truth; let them lead me, let them bring me to your holy hill and to your dwelling" (Ps 43:3).

Apparet autem in hoc infirmitas Petri pro tempore illo, quia ex debili occasione motus est ad negandum: et hoc ex duobus. Primo ex ipsa persona interrogante, quia non armatus miles, non admirandus pontifex, sed mulier et ancilla ostiaria interrogavit. Secundo ex forma interrogationis, quia non dicit: numquid ex discipulis es proditoris istius? Per quod videbatur magis ex compassione loqui. Unde et ex hoc percipitur quod <i>verbo domini caeli firmati sunt, et spiritu oris eius omnis virtus eorum</i>: Ps. XXXII, v. 6, quia qui ad vocem ancillae Christum negavit, postmodum nomen Christi coram principibus sacerdotum confitetur et praedicat; Act. IV, 8 ss.
          <td>2308 The circumstances and incitement of his denial was the question of the maid who kept the door: <b>The maid who kept the door said to Peter, Are not you also one of this man's disciples?</b> She says <b>you also</b> because she knew that John was a disciple of Christ, but she did not mention this to him because of their friendliness. This incident shows how weak Peter was at that time, for he was incited to deny Christ under feeble circumstances. How weak these circumstances were is shown, first of all, from the person who asked him: for it was not an armed soldier or an imposing high priest, but a woman, and a door keeper at that. Secondly, from the very form of the question: she did not say, "Are you a disciple of that traitor?" but rather, <b>Are not you also one of this man's disciples?</b> This seemed to indicate a certain sympathy. We can learn from this that "By the word of the Lord the heavens were made, and all their power by the breath of his mouth" [Ps 33:6], because this same person who denied Christ at the questioning of a maid servant afterwards professed and preached the name of Christ before the chief priests (Acts 4:8).

Nil autem aliud isto modo negavit Petrus, quam se esse Christianum. Ideo autem dominus Petrum negare permisit, quia voluit ut ipse, qui praeponendus erat toti Ecclesiae, infirmis et peccantibus magis compateretur, expertus in seipso infirmitatem peccati; Hebr. IV, 15: <i>non habemus pontificem qui non possit compati infirmitatibus nostris, tentatum per omnia absque peccato</i>: verum est de Christo, sed de Petro potest dici etiam cum peccato.
          <td>
            2309 Now comes Peter's denial, when he says, <b>He said, I am not</b>. We should note, according to Augustine, that Christ is denied not only by those who say that he is not the Christ, but also by those who deny that they are Christians. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a> For Peter at this time did nothing other than deny that he was a Christian. Our Lord permitted Peter to deny him because he wanted the very one who was to be the head of the entire Church to be all the more compassionate to the weak and sinners, having experienced in himself his own weakness in the face of sin: "For we have not a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weakness, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sinning" (Heb 4:15). This is true of Christ, and it can also be said of Peter, with his sins.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quidam tamen quamdam inanem gratiam appropriantes Petro, dicunt, quod non timore negavit, sed amore, volens semper esse cum Christo, et sequi continue; noverat enim quod si fateretur se esse de Christi discipulis, fuisset separatus a Christo, et expulsus. Sed hoc non consonat dictis domini: quia non ideo negavit quia noluit a Christo separari, sed quia noluit pro Christo animam ponere. Supra enim cum dixisset, <i>animam meam pro te ponam</i>, respondit Iesus: <i>animam tuam pro me pones? Amen, amen dico tibi: non cantabit gallus antequam ter me neges</i>.
          <td>Some say that Peter's denial did not come from fear, but from love: for he wanted to always be with Christ and to follow him all the time. But he knew that if he admitted he was a disciple of Christ, he would have been separated from him and expelled. But this does not agree with our Lord's words: for Peter did not deny Christ because he feared to be separated from him, but because he was not willing to lay down his life for Christ. Before, when Peter said, "I will lay down my life for you," Jesus answered, "Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the cock will not crow, till you have denied me three times" (13:37).

XVII, 26: <i>cum sancto sanctus eris (...) et cum perverso perverteris</i>. Ipsum etiam tempus congruit conditioni mentis eius, in qua refriguerat caritas; Matth. c. XXIV, 12: <i>refrigescet caritas multorum, quoniam abundavit iniquitas.</i>
          <td>2310 We see Peter strengthen his denial when we read, <b>Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire... Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself,</b> so he would not seem to be one of Christ's disciples. Trying not to seem a disciple, he mixed with the servants and officers standing by the fire because of the cold, which sometimes occurs in March during the early spring. Peter was not attentive to the Psalm: "Be holy with the holy, persevere with those who persevere" [Ps 18:26]. Even the very time of the year corresponded to his heart, in which charity had grown cold: "Most men's love will grow cold" (Mt 24: 12).

So, if he had not yet spoken openly to his disciples, how could he have spoken openly to the world? I answer that he had not yet spoken openly to his disciples in the sense that he had set forth for them his most profound thoughts. But he did speak openly to the world in the sense that he spoke to many, publicly.

On the contrary, Matthew (c 16) shows that Christ taught his disciples when alone with them many things without using figures. This can be answered in three ways. First, what Christ said to the twelve disciples was not considered to be spoken in secret. Secondly, he did not teach these things to them with the intention that they be kept hidden. Thirdly, our Lord is speaking here of the teaching he gave to the people, which was not given to them secretly but in public places: "I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation" (Ps 40:9); "I did not speak in secret, in a land of darkness" (Is 45:19).

          <td>Responsio. Dicendum, secundum Augustinum, quod dicta et praecepta sacrae Scripturae ex factis sanctorum interpretari possunt et intelliguntur, cum idem spiritus sanctus qui inspiravit prophetis et aliis sacrae Scripturae auctoribus, moverit sanctos ad opus. Nam, sicut II Petr. I, 21 dicitur, <i>spiritu sancto inspirati locuti sunt sancti Dei homines</i>; ita Rom. VIII, 14, dicitur: <i>qui spiritu Dei aguntur, hi sunt filii Dei</i>. Sic sacra Scriptura intelligenda est secundum quod Christus et alii sancti servaverunt. Christus autem non praebuit isti aliam maxillam: nec Paulus, Act. XVI, 22 ss. Unde non est intelligendum quod Christus mandasset quod praeberent maxillam aliam corporalem ad litteram ei qui percutit unam; sed hoc debet intelligi quantum ad praeparationem animi, quod si necesse fuerit, ita debet esse dispositus ut non turbetur animo contra percutientem, sed paratus sit simile et etiam amplius sustinere. Et hoc dominus servavit, qui corpus suum praebuit occisioni. Sic ergo excusatio domini utilis fuit ad nostram instructionem.
          <td>
            I say to this, with Augustine, that the statements and commands found in sacred scripture can be interpreted and understood from the actions of the saints, since it is the same Holy Spirit who inspired the prophets and the other sacred authors and who inspires the actions of the saints. As we read: "Moved by the Holy Spirit holy men of God spoke" (2 Pet 1:21); and "For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God" (Rom 8:14). Thus, sacred scripture should be understood according to the way Christ and other holy persons followed it. Now, Christ did not turn his other cheek here; and Paul did not do so either (Acts 16:22). Accordingly, we should not think that Christ has commanded us to actually turn our physical cheek to one who has struck the other. We should understand it to mean that we should be ready to do this if it turned out to be necessary to do so. That is, our attitude should be such that we would not be inwardly stirred up against the one striking us, but be ready or disposed to endure the same or even more. This is how out Lord observed it, for he offered his body to be killed. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" id="_ftnref13">[13]</a> So, our Lord's defense is useful for our instruction.

Peter had become so preoccupied with his sin after his denial that he, who before was so ardent, now seemed not to care what happened to Christ: "No man repents of his wickedness, saying, 'What have I done?'" (Jer 8:6). For Chrysostom, <b>Simon Peter was still standing and warming himself,</b> although Christ had already left, unmindful of the saying: "Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked" (Ps 1:1). <a href="John18.htm#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" id="_ftnref14">[14]</a>

Et ideo Augustinus aliter exponens, dicit quod Evangelista loquitur per recapitulationem more suo, ut ostendat continuationem et ordinem rei. Dixerat enim supra quod <i>stabant servi et ministri ad prunas, quia frigus erat et calefaciebant se</i>, et, <i>Petrus erat cum eis stans, et calefaciens se</i>, et postea interposuit de examinatione Christi a pontifice; et postmodum, ut continuet seriem, resumit quasi eadem verba dicens <i>erat autem Simon Petrus stans</i>, ante scilicet quam Christus mitteretur ad Caipham.
          <td>But this interpretation is not acceptable because it would follow that Peter's second and third denials were made in the absence of Christ. This is contrary to Luke (22:61), who says that after the third denial of Peter, our Lord turned and looked at him. For this reason Augustine explains it another way and says that the Evangelist is giving a general view in his own way to show the connection and order of the denials. The Evangelist had said above that "the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold, and they were standing and warming themselves; Peter also was with them, standing and warming himself" (v 18). The Evangelist then interposes the examination of Christ by the high priest (v 19‑23), and immediately returns to continue the series of Peter's denials, using practically the same words as before, "Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself" (v 25), that is, referring to the time before Christ was sent to Caiaphas.

XXVI, 71, loquens de secunda negatione dicit: <i>exeunte autem illo ianuam, vidit eum alia ancilla, et ait his qui erant ibi: et hic erat cum Iesu Nazareno. Et iterum negavit cum iuramento</i>. Et sic videtur hic duplex contrarietas. Quia Ioannes dixit Petrum negasse eo stante ad focum, Matthaeus autem eo exeunte domum. Alia contrarietas est: quia secundum Matthaeum interrogatur ab alia ancilla, secundum Ioannem ab aliis, scilicet multis, unde dicit <i>dixerunt ergo ei: numquid et tu ex discipulis eius es?</i> Item etiam secundum Lucam solum ab una interrogatur, unde Lc. c. XXII, 59, dicitur: <i>et intervallo facto quasi horae unius alius quidam affirmabat, dicens: vere et hic cum illo erat</i>.
          <td>2326 Then the Evangelist mentions the next two denials of Peter (v 25). Two things are stated about each: the circumstance of the denial, that is, the question, and the denial itself. There are two questions about the literal meaning. When Matthew speaks of the second denial, he says, "And when he went out to the porch, another maid saw him, and she said to the bystanders, 'This man was with Jesus of Nazareth.' And again he denied it with an oath" (Mt 26:71‑2). There seems to be two disagreements here. John says that Peter denied Christ by the fire (v 25), and Matthew says this happened as Peter was going out to the porch. Again, in Matthew, Peter is questioned by another maid, but John has him questioned by others, that is, a number of others, for he says, <b>They said to him, Are not you also one of his disciples?</b> (v 25). Luke also says that Christ was questioned by one person, "And after an interval of about an hour still another insisted, saying, 'Certainly this man also was with him'" (Lk 22:59). [This is the third denial in Luke, and his second denial is also instigated by one person, Lk 22:58].

          <td>We should say to these points that after Peter first denied Christ, he then got up and as he was going out to the porch another maid questioned him. Or, this maid told others that Peter was one of them, as Matthew says (Mt 26:71). Thus Peter denied Christ a second time. After this Peter returned so as to avoid seeming to be a follower of Christ and sat with the others. As he was sitting there, bystanders, who had heard it from the maid, questioned him again, as Matthew says (Mt 26:73). Or, one of the servants asked first, as John has here (v 26) and then other bystanders joined in. This was Peter's third denial.

This happened because their main intention was not to note these details, but to show the statement Peter made and to show that what our Lord had said to Peter came true. Accordingly, all agree on what Peter said: "What the Lord speaks, that will I speak" (Num 24:13).

But John says that he was led to Caiaphas.

Secondly, we see the deference Pilate paid them, since he went out to meet them. A problem arises about the first point: that they would not enter the praetorium so as not to be defiled. The other Evangelists say that Christ was seized in the evening, on the day of the supper; and this would be the passover meal: "I have earnestly desired to eat this passover with you" (Lk 22:15). And then in the morning of the next day he was brought to the praetorium. Why then do we read <b>so that they might eat the passover</b>, since it was the day after the passover? Some of the modem Greeks say that we are now on the fourteenth lunar day of the month, and that Christ was crucified on the day the Jews celebrated the passover, but that Christ anticipated the passover by one day, since he knew he would be killed on the day of the Jewish passover. Thus, he celebrated the passover on the thirteenth lunar day, in the evening. And since the law commanded that the Jews should not have leavened bread from the fourteenth day of the first month to the twenty‑first day, they say that Christ consecrated leavened bread.

XIV, 12; expresse habetur, quod Christus venit die azymorum quando necesse erat occidi Pascha; et Matthaeus dicit quod <i>primo die azymorum accesserunt discipuli ad Iesum dicentes: ubi vis paremus tibi comedere Pascha?</i> Non ergo dicendum est quod Christus praevenit Pascha.
          <td>2332 This is not acceptable for two reasons. First, the Old Testament has no instance where anyone was permitted to anticipate the celebration of the passover. But if one was prevented, he could postpone it to the next month: "If any man of you or of your descendants is unclean... he shall still keep the passover to the Lord. In the second month on the fourteenth day in the evening they shall keep it "(Num 9:10). And since Christ never omitted any observance of the law, it is not true to say that he anticipated the passover. Secondly, Mark (14:12) states explicitly that Christ came on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the passover lamb; and Matthew says that "on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus saying, 'Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the passover?'" (Mt 26:17). So, we should not say that Christ anticipated the passover.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo Chrysostomus aliter dicit scilicet quod Christus legem per omnia implens, suo tempore Pascha celebravit, scilicet quartadecima luna ad vesperam; sed Iudaei sic intenti erant ad Christi occisionem quod non celebraverunt Pascha die suo: sed in sequenti die, scilicet luna decimaquinta. Unde de hoc dicit <i>ut non contaminarentur, sed ut manducarent Pascha</i>, quod praecedenti die omiserunt.
          <td>
            2333 Accordingly, Chrysostom explains this another way. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" id="_ftnref15">[15]</a> He said that Christ fulfilled the law in all matters and did observe the passover on the proper day, that is, the fourteenth day, in the evening. But the Jews were so intent on killing Christ that they did not observe it on the proper day, but on the day following, the fifteenth. Thus the sense is: <b>so that they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover</b> which they had neglected the day before.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed nec hoc stare potest, quia Num. IX, v. 10 s., dicitur quod si quis propter impedimenta non potest celebrare Pascha decimaquarta luna primi mensis, celebrat illud non sequenti die, sed luna decimaquarta mensis secundi.
          <td>This is not acceptable either, for in Numbers (9:10) it is said that if anyone is prevented from eating the passover on the fourteenth day of the first month, he is to eat it, not on the following day, but on the fourteenth day of the second month.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo dicendum est, secundum Hieronymum et Augustinum et alios doctores Latinos, quod decimaquarta luna est principium solemnitatis; sed Pascha non dicitur solum vespera, sed totum tempus septem dierum: per quod comedebant azyma, quae debebant manducari a mundis. Unde quia Iudaei alieni iudicis praetorio immunditiam contrahebant; ideo non introierunt in praetorium <i>ut non contaminarentur, sed ut manducarent Pascha</i>, idest panes azymorum.
          <td>
            2334 Therefore we should say with Jerome, Augustine and other Latin Fathers, that the fourteenth day is the beginning of the feast; but the passover refers not just to that evening, but to the entire time of the seven days during which they ate unleavened bread, which was to be eaten by those who were clean. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn16" name="_ftnref16" id="_ftnref16">[16]</a> And because the Jews would have contracted uncleanness by entering the residence of a foreign judge, they did not enter so that <b>they might not be defiled, but might eat the passover,</b> that is, the unleavened bread.

When Pilate saw Jesus bound and brought by so may seeking his condemnation, he said, <b>What accusation do you bring against this man?</b> Their reply was, <b>If this man were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over.</b> They are saying here: We have already examined and condemned him, and are now handing him over to you to be punished. They were regarding their own judgment as sufficient for Pilate. Yet they were not speaking truly when they said he was an evildoer, for "He went about doing good and healing all that were oppressed by the devil" (Acts 10:38). They were acting like the Psalm says, "They requite me evil for good" (Ps 35:12).

Festus did the same to Paul: "But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, 'Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem, and there be tried on these charges before me?'" (Acts 25:9). Or, this could be said as a taunting remark: for they had already examined and condemned Christ, and Pilate wanted those who had condemned Christ as an evildoer to pass the sentence, because "It was not the custom of the Romans to give up any one before the accused met the accusers face to face, and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him" (Acts 25:16).

This is why they said, <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death</b>, for crimes against the state, although we can do this for some sins against the law, for this kind of judgment was reserved to them. Or, it could be said that some things are not lawful either because they are prohibited by divine law ‑ and they were not prohibited from doing this by divine law ‑ or because they are forbidden by human law ‑ and in this way it was not lawful for them to put anyone to death, for such power was now in the hands of the governor.

Sed mors crucis in lege exprobrabilis erat; Deut. XXI, 23: <i>maledictus omnis qui pependit in ligno</i>. Et ideo hoc genus mortis non erat eis servatum. Iudaei autem ex sua malitia non erant contenti si Christum lapidarent; sed volebant eum morte turpissima condemnare, ut dicitur Sap. II, v. 20. Et ideo nunc dicunt <i>non licet nobis interficere quemquam</i>, scilicet morte crucis.

            2341 There is another question: How then could they have stoned Stephen (Acts 7:58)? Chrysostom answers this by saying that the Romans allowed the Jews to make use of their own laws, and because the punishment of stoning was part of their law, the Romans allowed them to do this. <a href="John18.htm#_ftn20" name="_ftnref20" id="_ftnref20">[20]</a> But in the law death on the cross was abhorred: "A hanged [on a tree] man is accursed by God" (Deut 21:23). And so they did not use this kind of death. The Jews, in their malice, were not satisfied just to stone Christ, they wanted to condemn him to the most disgraceful of deaths, as we see from Wisdom (2:20). Thus they now say, <b>It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</b> meaning the death on the cross. Or, one could say that Stephen was stoned during a change of governors, when many laws were violated.

For Jesus had said (Mt 20:19) that it was by the Gentiles that he would be crucified and killed, but that he would be handed over to them by the Jews. So, in order that this be accomplished, the Jews were unwilling to judge and kill him themselves.

Rather, <b>Pilate entered the praetorium again and called Jesus</b> aside, because he had serious doubts about him.

By giving this answer Pilate showed that it was others who had told him that Christ was the King of the Jews. Accordingly he says, <b>Your own nation and the chief priests have handed you over to me</b>, by bringing this charge against you. He says, <b>your own nation</b>, because, considering his human nature, Christ was born a Jew: "For I hear many whispering. Terror is on every side. 'Denounce him!

But the heavenly king, because he is powerful by himself, gives power to his servants; and consequently he does not need ministers for his kingdom. And thus Christ says that his kingdom is not of this world, because <b>if my kingdom were of this world, my ministers would fight, that I might not be handed over to the Jews.</b> When Peter started to fight for Christ (18:10), he forgot that he was not of this world. Still, our Lord did have some ministers, the angels, who could have rescued him from the hands of the Jews, but he chose not to be rescued: "Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels?"

And to the extent that I manifest myself, the Truth, to that extent I establish my kingdom. For this cannot be done without manifesting the truth, which can only be done fittingly by me, who am the light: "The only Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, he has made him known" (1:18); "It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard him, while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by the gifts of the Holy Spirit" (Heb 2:3).

            By its nature truth implies a conformity between a reality and the intellect. The intellect is related in two ways to reality. An intellect can be related to things as a measure of these things; that would be the intellect which is the cause of these things. Another intellect is measured by things, this would be an intellect whose knowledge is caused by these things. Now truth is not in the divine intellect because the intellect is conformed to things, but because things are conformed to the divine intellect. While truth is in our intellect because it understands things, conforms to them, as they are. And so uncreated truth and the divine intellect is a truth which is not measured or made, but a truth which measures and makes two kinds of truth: one is in the things themselves, insofar as it makes them so they are in conformity with what they are in the divine intellect; and it makes the other truth in our souls, and this is a measured truth, not a measuring truth. Therefore, the uncreated truth of the divine intellect is appropriated, especially referred, to the Son, who is the very concept of the divine intellect and the Word of God.

I Petr. II, 22: <i>qui peccatum non fecit</i>. Et tamen si esset aliqua in eo, ego apud quem residet potestas, et praecipue iudicandi de his quae contra regem fiunt, volo eum liberare et absolvere.
          <td>Pilate heard the cries of the Jews, and thinking that he could calm them and then listen to Christ's answer to this difficult question under more tranquil conditions, <b>went out to the Jews again,</b> and declared Christ's innocence, <b>I find no crime in him</b>, that is, nothing deserving death: "He committed no sin" (1 Pet 2:22). But even if he did commit a crime, I, who have authority in these matters, and especially the authority to judge of matters against the state, I wish to free and release him.

          <td>2368 Accordingly he says, <b>But you have a custom that I should release one man for you at the Passover.</b> First, he offers to release Christ; secondly, the Evangelist gives the reply of the Jews.

          <td>Sciendum est autem, quod hanc consuetudinem introduxit Pilatus, vel alii praesides Romanorum, ob favorem populi. Et ideo secundum hanc consuetudinem volens eum dimittere, dicit <i>vultis ergo dimittam vobis regem Iudaeorum?</i> Non dicit hoc quasi invenerit eum culpabilem de regno Iudaeorum, sed ut exaggeraret ipsorum malitiam; quasi dicat: etsi sit rex Iudaeorum, quod ad vos iudicare non pertinet, sed ad me, tamen, si vultis, dimittam eum vobis.
          <td>2369 This practice was started by Pilate or some other Roman governor as a favor to the people. Wishing to free Christ using this custom Pilate said, <b>Will you have me release for you the King of the Jews?</b> He did not call him this as if this were a crime, but to heighten their malice. It was like saying: Even if he is the king of the Jews, which is not your role to judge, but mine, still, if you want me to, I will release him for you.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed ipsi Iudaei <i>clamaverunt rursum omnes dicentes: non hunc, sed Barabbam</i>. Et ut Iudaeorum malitiam ostendat, statim subdit eius, quem liberari petebant, crimen, dicens <i>erat autem Barabbas latro</i>. Is. I, 23: <i>principes tui infideles, socii furum</i>. In hoc impletur illud Ier. XII, 8: <i>facta est mihi haereditas mea quasi leo in silva</i>; Act. III, 14: <i>iustum et sanctum negastis, et petistis virum homicidam donari vobis</i>.
          <td>2370 The Jews <b>cried out again, Not this man, but Barabbas!</b> Then to indicate the malice of the Jews, the Evangelist mentions the crime committed by the one they wanted released, saying, <b>Now Barabbas was a robber</b>: "Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves" (Is 1:23). This fulfills the words of Jeremiah (12:8): "My heritage has become to me like a lion in the forest." "But you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you" (Acts 3:14).
