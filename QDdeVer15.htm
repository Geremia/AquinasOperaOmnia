                            Dicitur enim in libro de spiritu et anima: cum ab
                            inferioribus ad superiora ascendere volumus, prius
                            occurrit nobis sensus, deinde imaginatio, postea
                            ratio, postea intellectus et postea intelligentia;
                            et in summa est sapientia, quae est ipse Deus. Sed
                            imaginatio et sensus sunt diversae potentiae. Ergo
                            etiam ratio et intellectus.

                            1. In <i>Spirit and Soul</i> we read: “When we want
                            to rise from lower to higher things, first, senses
                            come to our aid; then, imagination; then, reason;
                            then, understanding; then, intelligence; and, in the
                            highest place, there is wisdom, which is God
                            Himself.” But imagination and sense are different
                            powers. Therefore, reason and understanding are,
                            too.

                                Praeterea, homo, ut dicit Gregorius, cum omni
                                creatura convenit; ratione cuius dicitur omnis
                                creatura. Sed id quo homo convenit cum plantis,
                                est quaedam potentia animae, scilicet
                                vegetativa, distincta a ratione, quae est
                                propria potentia hominis in quantum est homo; et
                                similiter id in quo convenit cum brutis,
                                scilicet sensus. Ergo pari ratione id in quo
                                convenit cum Angelis, qui sunt supra hominem,
                                scilicet intellectus, est alia potentia a
                                ratione, quae est propria humani generis, ut
                                dicit Boetius in V de consolatione.

                                2. As Gregory says, man has something in common
                                with every creature, and for this reason is man
                                called all creation. However, that by which man
                                has something in common with plants is a power
                                of the soul, the vegetative, which is distinct
                                from reason, the proper power of man, as man.
                                The same is true for the senses, by which he has
                                something in common with brute animals.
                                Therefore, with equal reason, his understanding,
                                which he has in common with angels, who are
                                above man, is a power different from reason,
                                which is proper to the human race, as Boethius
                                says.

                                    Praeterea, sicut sensuum propriorum
                                    acceptiones terminantur ad sensum communem,
                                    qui de eis iudicat; ita etiam rationis
                                    discursus terminatur ad intellectum, ut
                                    iudicium feratur de his de quibus ratio
                                    contulit: tunc enim de his quae ratio
                                    confert, homo iudicat, cum resolvendo ad
                                    principia devenitur, quorum est intellectus;
                                    ratione cuius ars iudicandi resolutoria
                                    nominatur. Ergo, sicut sensus communis est
                                    alia potentia a sensu proprio, ita et
                                    intellectus a ratione.

                                    3. just as the perceptions of the proper
                                    senses terminate at the common sense, which
                                    makes judgments concerning them, so the
                                    discourse of reason terminates at
                                    understanding, so that judgment may be made
                                    about the things which reason has compared.
                                    For man judges of the things which reason
                                    compares when by analysis he reaches
                                    principles which are the objects of
                                    understanding. For this reason the art of
                                    judging is called analytical. Therefore, as
                                    common sense is a different power from
                                    proper sense, so understanding is different
                                    from reason.

                                        sunt actus potentias diversas exigentes,
                                        ut patet in sensu proprio et communi;

                                        dicitur in libro de spiritu et anima,
                                        quidquid sensus percipit, imaginatio
                                        repraesentat, cogitatio format, ingenium

                                        servat, intelligentia comprehendit. Ergo
                                        ratio et intelligentia sunt diversae
                                        potentiae.

                                        4. To comprehend and to judge are acts
                                        requiring different powers, as is clear
                                        in proper and common sense. For common
                                        sense judges about the things which
                                        proper sense perceives. But, as is said
                                        in <i>Spirit and Soul:</i> “Whatever
                                        sense perceives, imagination represents,
                                        thought forms, genius investigates,
                                        reason judges, memory retains, and
                                        intelligence comprehends.” Therefore,
                                        reason and intelligence are different
                                        powers.

                                            compositum, ita se habet illud quod
                                            est simpliciter compositum, ad actum
                                            simplicem. Sed intellectus divinus,
                                            qui est omnibus modis simplex, non
                                            habet actum aliquem compositum, sed
                                            simplicissimum. Ergo et ratio

                                            intellectus est simplex: est enim
                                            intelligentia indivisibilium, ut
                                            dicitur in III de anima. Ergo
                                            intellectus et ratio non sunt una
                                            potentia.

                                            relates to simple act in the same
                                            way as that which is altogether
                                            simple relates to composite act. But
                                            the divine intellect, which is
                                            simple in every way, has no
                                            composite act, but only the most
                                            simple act. Therefore, our reason,
                                            which is composite, inasmuch as it
                                            compares, does not have a simple
                                            act. But the act of understanding is
                                            simple’ “for it is understanding of
                                            things indivisible,” as is said in
                                            <i>The Soul.</i> Therefore,
                                            understanding and reason are not one
                                            power.

                                                and the Philosopher, the
                                                rational soul knows itself
                                                through a likeness. “The mind,
                                                however, in which the image
                                                resides, knows itself through
                                                itself,” according to Augustine.
                                                Therefore, reason and mind, or
                                                understanding, are not the same.

                                                    greatly. For, as is said in
                                                    <i>Spirit and Soul</i>: “The

                                                    sense, likenesses of bodies
                                                    by imagination, natures of
                                                    bodies by reason, created
                                                    spirit by understanding, and
                                                    uncreated spirit by
                                                    intelligence.” But bodily
                                                    nature differs very greatly
                                                    from created spirit.
                                                    Therefore, understanding and
                                                    reason are different powers.

                          Ut enim Augustinus dicit in XIII de Trinitate, imago
                          Trinitatis est in superiori parte rationis, non autem
                          in inferiori. Sed imago Dei in anima consistit in
                          tribus potentiis. Ergo inferior ratio non pertinet ad
                          eamdem potentiam vel easdem ad quas pertinet superior;
                          et sic videntur esse diversae potentiae.

                          1. As Augustine says, the image of the Trinity is in
                          the higher part of reason, but not in the lower. But
                          the image of God in the soul is made up of the three
                          powers. Therefore, lower reason does not belong to the
                          same power or powers as higher reason. Thus, they seem
                          to be different powers.

                              totum. Sed anima non dicitur esse totum nisi
                              potentiale. Ergo et diversae partes animae sunt
                              diversae potentiae. Sed ratio superior et inferior
                              nominantur ab Augustino diversae portiones
                              rationis. Ergo sunt diversae potentiae.

                              2. Since a part is taken with relation to the
                              whole, it is in the same genus as the whole. But
                              the soul is called only a potential
                              (<i>potentialis</i>) whole. Therefore, the
                              different parts of soul are different powers
                              (<i>potentiae</i>) <i>.</i> But higher and lower
                              reason are given by Augustine as different parts
                              of reason. Therefore, they are different powers.

                                  Ergo et ratio superior et inferior sunt
                                  diversae potentiae.

                                  3. Everything eternal is necessary and
                                  everything temporal and subject to change is
                                  contingent, as appears from the Philosopher.
                                  But the Philosopher calls scientific the part
                                  of the soul which deals with necessary things,
                                  and <i>reasoning,</i> or
                                  <i>conjectural,</i> the part which deals with
                                  contingent things. Therefore, since, according
                                  to Augustine, higher reason embraces eternal
                                  things and lower reason administers temporal
                                  and perishable things, it seems that the
                                  <i>reasoning</i> is the same as lower reason
                                  and the <i>scientific</i> is the same as
                                  higher reason. But the <i>scientific</i> and
                                  <i>reasoning</i> are different powers, as the
                                  Philosopher also clearly shows. Therefore,
                                  higher and lower reason are different powers.

                                      Praeterea, sicut philosophus, ibidem

                                      oportet determinari alteras potentias

                                      aliquod genus determinatur, determinetur

                                      4. The Philosopher says that we must
                                      distinguish different powers of the soul
                                      for those things which are generically
                                      different, since every power of the soul
                                      which is limited to some genus is limited
                                      to it because of some likeness. Thus, the
                                      very diversity of objects according to
                                      genus bears witness to diversity of
                                      powers. But that which is eternal and that
                                      which is corruptible are entirely
                                      different generically, since corruptible

                          Quia ut dicit philosophus in III de anima, intellectus
                          semper rectus est. Ratio autem est eadem potentia cum
                          intellectu, ut supra habitum est. Ergo etiam ratio
                          semper recta est, ergo in ea peccatum non est.

                          1. The Philosopher says: “The understanding is always
                          correct.”, But reason is the same power as
                          understanding, as was shown earlier. Therefore, reason
                          is always correct. Therefore, there is no sin in it.

                              Praeterea, quidquid est susceptivum alicuius
                              perfectionis, si sit susceptivum defectus, non
                              poterit esse in eo nisi defectus oppositus illi
                              perfectioni: quia contrariorum idem est
                              susceptivum. Sed secundum Augustinum, XII de
                              Trinit., propria perfectio superioris rationis est
                              sapientia, inferioris autem scientia. Ergo in eis
                              aliud peccatum esse non potest nisi ignorantia et
                              stultitia.

                              2. If anything that is receptive of some
                              perfection is subject to defect, only, the defect
                              which is opposite to the perfection can exist in
                              it, since the same thing is receptive of
                              contraries. But, according to Augustine, wisdom is
                              the proper perfection of higher reason, and
                              science is the proper perfection of lower reason.
                              Therefore, stupidity and ignorance can be the only
                              sins in higher or lower reason.

                                  Praeterea, secundum Augustinum omne peccatum
                                  in voluntate est. Sed ratio est alia potentia
                                  a voluntate. Ergo in ratione peccatum non est.

                                  3. According to Augustine all sin is in the
                                  will. But reason is a different power from the
                                  will. Therefore, sin is not in reason.

                                      possunt. Sed omne peccatum hominis est
                                      rationi contrarium, malum enim hominis est
                                      contra rationem esse, ut dicit Dionysius,
                                      IV cap. de divinis Nomin. Ergo peccatum in
                                      ratione esse non potest.

                                      4. Nothing is receptive of its opposite,
                                      for opposites cannot exist together. But
                                      every sin of man is contrary to reason,
                                      for the evil of man is to be contrary to
                                      reason, as Dionysius says. Therefore, sin
                                      cannot exist in reason.

                                          materiam non se extendit. Sed ratio

                                          carnis. Ergo peccatum quod circa

                                          modo superiori rationi attribui debet,

                                          attribuitur.

                                          5. A sin which is committed in regard
                                          to a certain subject matter cannot be
                                          attributed to the power which does not
                                          extend to that matter. But higher
                                          reason has eternal things and not
                                          delights of the flesh for its subject
                                          matter. Therefore, sins concerning
                                          pleasures of the flesh ought not in
                                          any way be attributed to higher
                                          reason, even though Augustine says
                                          that consent to an act is attributed
                                          to higher reason.

                                              6. Augustine says that it is
                                              higher reason which contemplates
                                              higher things and clings to them,
                                              namely, through love. But sin does
                                              not result from this. Therefore,
                                              sin cannot exist in higher reason.

                          Ut enim dicit Augustinus in Enchiridion, tunsio
                          pectoris et oratio dominica sunt remedia contra
                          veniale deputata. Sed consensus in delectationem sine
                          consensu in opus, inter illa peccata computatur quibus
                          remedium adhibetur per pectoris contunsionem et
                          orationem dominicam; dicit enim Augustinus in XII de
                          Trinitate: nec sane cum sola cogitatione mens
                          oblectatur illicitis, non quidem decernens esse
                          facienda, tenens tamen et volvens libenter quae statim
                          ut attigerunt animum, respui debuerunt; negandum est
                          esse peccatum; sed longe minus quam si opere statuatur
                          implendum: et ideo de talibus quoque cogitationibus
                          venia petenda est, pectusque percutiendum, et
                          dicendum: dimitte nobis debita nostra, et cetera. Ergo
                          consensus in delectationem praedictus non est peccatum
                          mortale.

                          1. As Augustine says, striking the breast and [saying]
                          the Our Father are the remedies given for venial sins.
                          But consent to pleasure without consent to the deed is
                          numbered among the sins for which striking the breast
                          and [saying] the Our Father are accepted as a remedy.
                          For Augustine says: “Now, when the mind takes pleasure
                          in illicit things in thought alone, not, indeed,
                          seeing them as something to be done, but still holding
                          and gladly desiring these things which should be
                          rejected as soon as they reach the soul, this should
                          be considered to be a sin, but far less a sin than if
                          it decided to carry it out in deed. Therefore, pardon
                          should be sought for such thoughts, too, and we should
                          strike our breasts and say: ‘Forgive us our
                          trespasses.” Therefore, the above-mentioned consent in
                          pleasure is not a mortal sin.

                              to a mortal sin is mortal. But pleasure is a
                              venial sin. Therefore, consent to it is venial.

                                  Praeterea, in actu fornicationis duo invenimus
                                  propter quae malus iudicari potest: scilicet
                                  vehementiam delectationis, quae absorbet
                                  rationem; et nocumentum ex actu proveniens,
                                  scilicet incertitudo prolis, et alia huiusmodi
                                  quae consequerentur, nisi concubitus
                                  matrimonii lege ordinaretur. Non autem potest
                                  dici quod fornicatio sit peccatum mortale
                                  ratione delectationis, quia illa delectationis
                                  vehementia invenitur in actu matrimonii, qui
                                  non est peccatum. Ergo non est peccatum
                                  mortale nisi propter nocumentum quod ex actu
                                  provenit; ergo ille qui consentit in
                                  delectationem fornicationis et non in actum,
                                  non appropinquat fornicationi ex parte illa

                                  peccare mortaliter.

                                  3. In the act of fornication we find two
                                  things for which it can be judged evil: the
                                  vehemence of the pleasure, which engulfs
                                  reason, and the harm coming from the act,
                                  namely, the uncertain condition of the
                                  children and other things of this sort which
                                  would result unless marital relations were
                                  regulated by law. But it cannot be said that
                                  fornication is a mortal sin by reason of the
                                  pleasure, for that intensity of pleasure
                                  exists in the marital act [in marriage], which
                                  is not a sin. Therefore, it is a mortal sin
                                  only because of the harm which comes from the
                                  act. So, one who consents to the pleasure of
                                  fornication, but not to the act, does not
                                  approach fornication under the aspect in which
                                  it is a mortal sin. Therefore, he does not
                                  seem to sin mortally.

                                      consentit in delectationem, non peccat

                                      4. Homicide is not less a sin than
                                      fornication. But one who thinks about
                                      homicide and takes pleasure and consents
                                      to the pleasure does not sin mortally.
                                      Otherwise, all who enjoyed hearing
                                      histories of wars, and consented to this
                                      pleasure, would sin mortally. But this
                                      does not seem probable. Therefore, consent
                                      to the pleasure of fornication is not a
                                      mortal sin.

                                          almost an infinite distance apart,
                                          which is seen from the distance

                                          consent is venial. Therefore, it

                                          is added.

                                              consists in turning away from God.
                                              But to turn away from God belongs
                                              not to lower reason, but to higher
                                              reason, to which, also, it belongs
                                              to turn to God. For opposites

                                              Therefore, mortal sin cannot exist
                                              in lower reason, and so the

                                              ascribed to lower reason by
                                              Augustine is not a mortal sin.

                                                  dicit, si cupiditas nostra

                                                  7. As Augustine says: “If our
                                                  desire is moved, it is like a
                                                  woman being persuaded, but,
                                                  finally, reason manfully curbs
                                                  and represses our aroused
                                                  desire. When this happens, we
                                                  do not fall into sin. From
                                                  this, it seems, we perceive
                                                  that in the spiritual marriage
                                                  deep within us there is not
                                                  sin if the woman sins, and the
                                                  man does not. But when there
                                                  is consent to pleasure and not
                                                  to act, the woman sins, and
                                                  not the man, as Augustine
                                                  says. Therefore, consent to
                                                  the pleasure is not a mortal
                                                  sin.

                                                      Philosopher, pleasure in
                                                      good and evil follows the
                                                      activity by which it is
                                                      caused. But the exterior

                                                      consists in bodily
                                                      movement, is different
                                                      from the interior act,
                                                      namely, the thought.
                                                      Therefore, pleasure which
                                                      follows the interior act
                                                      will be different from
                                                      that which follows the
                                                      external act. But the
                                                      interior act is not of its
                                                      nature a mortal sin, as
                                                      the external act is.
                                                      Therefore, the interior
                                                      pleasure is not classified
                                                      as a mortal sin; hence,

                                                      does not seem to be a

                                                          or desire against the
                                                          law of God.” But there
                                                          is no law forbidding
                                                          consent to pleasure.
                                                          Therefore, it is not a
                                                          mortal sin.

                          deflecti a rationibus aeternis est peccatum mortale.
                          Ergo in superiori ratione non potest esse peccatum

                          1. It belongs to higher reason to cling to the eternal
                          norms of conduct. Therefore, sin can be in it only in
                          so far as it turns away from these eternal norms. But
                          to turn away from them is a mortal sin. Therefore,
                          there can be only mortal sin in higher reason.

                              mortale. Sed non videtur esse sine contemptu quod
                              aliquis deliberet aliquid esse malum et a Deo
                              puniendum, et tamen illud committere consentiat.
                              Ergo videtur quod quandocumque post deliberationem
                              superioris rationis in actum consentitur etiam
                              peccati venialis sit mortale peccatum.

                              <i>2.</i> Through contempt venial sin becomes
                              mortal. But there seems to be contempt when one
                              considers something to be evil and to be punished
                              by God and, nevertheless, consents to commit it.
                              Therefore, it seems that there is a mortal sin
                              whenever one consents to the act even of a venial
                              sin after the consideration of higher reason.

                                  videtur quod aliquid etiam sit in anima in quo
                                  non sit nisi peccatum mortale: hoc autem non
                                  est synderesis quia in ea nullum est peccatum;

                                  3. There is something in the soul, sensuality,
                                  in which there can be only venial sin, and
                                  something in which there can be venial and
                                  mortal sin, namely, lower reason. Therefore it
                                  seems that there is also something in the soul
                                  in which there can be only mortal sin. But
                                  this is not synderesis, because in that there
                                  is no sin. Therefore, this description fits
                                  higher reason.

                                      veniale, propter hoc quod peccatum veniale
                                      ex corruptione carnis oritur, quae tunc
                                      non erat. Sed ratio superior est remota a
                                      carnis corruptione. Ergo in ea peccatum
                                      veniale esse non potest.

                                      4. In angels and in man in the state of
                                      innocence there could not be venial sin,
                                      because venial sin arises from the
                                      weakening of the flesh, and this did not
                                      then exist. But higher reason is apart
                                      from the weakening of the flesh.
                                      Therefore, there can be no venial sin in
                                      it.

                                              sin itself. But consent to the act
                                              of venial sin belongs to higher

                                                          of infidelity. But it

                                                          when it compares the

                                                          sin. But, if it is by
