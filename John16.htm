                    2068 Above, our Lord had used certain considerations to
                    console his disciples over his leaving and against the
                    persecutions and tribulations that would come upon them.
                    Here he amplifies these considerations more clearly. First,
                    he explains the considerations he gave before; and secondly,
                    we see the effect of this explanation on the disciples (v
                    29).

                        duo hic explicat, ordine retrogrado. Cuius ratio est,
                        quia cum recessus suus statim immineret, nec adhuc eis
                        tribulationes superventuras praenuntiaverat, ideo primo
                        consolatus est eos de recessu. Sed quia iam ex

                        If we pay close attention to what was said in the
                        pervious two chapters, we can see that our Lord aimed at
                        consoling his disciples against two things: his own
                        leaving them, and the tribulations that would come upon
                        them. But he here explains these two things in reverse
                        order. He had consoled them first over his leaving
                        because this would take place very soon and he had not
                        yet foretold all the tribulations that would come upon
                        them. But now, since they seemed to be more troubled by
                        their own tribulations than by Christ's leaving, our
                        Lord here consoles them first of all against their
                        forthcoming trials, and then against his leaving (v 5).
                        He does three things concerning the first: first, he
                        gives his intention; secondly, he mentions the
                        tribulations they will suffer from being persecuted (v
                        2); thirdly, he tells why they will be persecuted (v 3).

                            quia spiritus sanctus est amor,

                            Quia vero ante mortem Christi discipuli spiritum
                            sanctum non acceperunt, ideo in passione Christi
                            scandalizati sunt; Matth. XXVI, 31:
                            <i

                            2069 He says: I have said that the Jews hate me and
                            you, because they do not know who sent me. I have
                            said that they are inexcusable and that you and the
                            Holy Spirit will bear witness against them. Now

                            >, that is, so you don't fall away when the
                            tribulations I have foretold come upon you. And it
                            is fitting that our Lord restrains them from falling
                            after promising the Holy Spirit, because the Holy
                            Spirit is love ‑ "God's love has been poured into
                            our hearts through the Holy Spirit which has been
                            given to us" (Rom 5:5) ‑ and the Holy Spirit
                            prevents stumbling: "Great peace have those who love
                            your law; nothing can make them stumble" (Ps
                            119:165). Now it is characteristic of friends that
                            they disregard any loss for the sake of one another,
                            as stated in Proverbs [12:26]. So, for one who is a
                            friend of God, to suffer punishment and loss is no
                            reason to fall away. Yet because the disciples had
                            not yet received the Holy Spirit before the death of
                            Christ, they did fall away during his passion: "You
                            will all fall away because of me this night" (Mt
                            26:31). But after the Holy Spirit came there was no
                            falling away.

                                    was so successful that for this reason some
                                    of the [Jewish] authorities who did believe
                                    in Christ were afraid to profess him
                                    publicly, as we read above (12:42). Christ
                                    foretold this rejection: "Blessed are you
                                    when men hate you, and when they exclude you
                                    and revile you, and cast out your name as
                                    evil, on account of the Son of man" (Lk
                                    6:22).

                                        2072 Was it an evil for the apostles to
                                        be cast out of the Jewish synagogues,
                                        since they were going to leave them in
                                        any case? The answer, according to
                                        Augustine, is that it was a trial for
                                        them, because this was our Lord's way of
                                        telling them that the Jews would not
                                        accept Christ.

                                            immediately killed by the Jews.

                                            Lord tells them that they would win
                                            so many to Christ, who would be
                                            expelled from the Jewish synagogues,
                                            that they could not all be killed,
                                            and so the Jews would try to kill
                                            the apostles so they would not

                                                    persecution from the Jews:
                                                    "I send you prophets and
                                                    wise men and scribes, some

                                                    crucify" (Mt 23:34). The
                                                    martyrs of Christ were
                                                    killed by the gentiles, and
                                                    they did not consider that
                                                    they were serving God but
                                                    only their own gods. It was
                                                    the Jews who, when they
                                                    killed those who were
                                                    preaching Christ, thought
                                                    this was a service to God.
                                                    For they had zeal for God,
                                                    but without knowledge, since
                                                    they believed that anyone
                                                    who converted to Christ was
                                                    deserting God. We read of
                                                    this killing: "For your sake
                                                    we are slain all the day
                                                    long, and accounted as sheep
                                                    for the slaughter" (Ps

                    Supra explicavit dominus rationes consolatorias contra
                    tribulationes discipulis superventuras, hic explicat
                    rationes consolatorias de recessu suo. Consolatus est autem
                    eos dominus de recessu suo triplici ratione. Primo ratione
                    accessus eorum ad patrem quem promittebat; unde dicebat:
                    <i
                      >non turbetur cor vestrum (...) in domo patris mei
                      mansiones multae sunt</i
                    >. Secundo ratione Paracliti quem missurus erat; unde
                    dicebat:
                    <i>et ego rogabo patrem, et alium Paraclitum dabit vobis</i
                    >. Tertio ratione iteratae suae visionis, quam asserebat:
                    <i>non relinquam</i>, inquam,
                    <i>vos orphanos: veniam ad vos</i>. Has autem tres rationes
                    explicat hic, sed ordine retrogrado, et primo promissionem
                    spiritus Paracliti; secundo iteratam sui visionem, ibi
                    <i
                      >modicum, et iam non videbitis, me; et iterum modicum, et
                      videbitis me</i
                    >; tertio introductionem ad patrem, ibi
                    <i>et in illo die me non interrogabitis</i>. Circa primum
                    duo facit. Primo praemittit necessitatem consolationis;
                    secundo ponit eam, ibi
                    <i>sed ego veritatem dico vobis</i> et cetera. Circa primum
                    duo facit. Primo praenuntiat suum recessum; secundo ostendit
                    huius praenuntiationis effectum, ibi
                    <i
                      >sed quia haec locutus sum vobis, tristitia implevit cor
                      vestrum</i

                    2082 Above, our Lord dealt with what would console his
                    disciples in their coming troubles. Here he deals with what
                    will console them against his leaving. Our Lord consoles
                    them against his leaving with three considerations: first,
                    they will have access to the Father, as promised when he
                    said, "Let not your hearts be troubled... In my Father's
                    house there are many rooms" (14:1); secondly, because he was
                    going to send the Paraclete, and so he said, "And I will
                    pray the Father, and he will give you another Paraclete"
                    [14:16]; thirdly, they will see him again, as he said, "I
                    will not leave your orphans; I will come to you" [14:18]. He
                    explains these three things here, but not in the above
                    order. First, we see the promise of the Spirit; secondly,
                    the fact that they will see him again (v 16); thirdly, we
                    see their access to the Father. He does two things with the
                    first: first, he mentions that they need some consolation;
                    secondly, he gives it (v 7). He does two things with the
                    first: first, he foretells his leaving them; secondly, he
                    mentions the effect of this prediction (v 6).

                        Recedit ergo ad patrem vadens; et ideo dicit: vobiscum

                        quidem secundum humanitatem ad eum apud quem ab aeterno
                        erat secundum divinitatem. Et hoc diffusius expositum
                        est in praecedentibus.

                        2083 He is leaving them, going to the Father. He says, I
                        was with you till now,
                        <b>but now I am going to him who sent me</b>, that is,
                        to the Father. This is a mark of perfection, for a thing
                        reaches its perfection when it returns to its source: "I
                        am ascending to him who sent me" (Tob 12:20); "The
                        rivers return to the place from which they came" [Sir
                        1:7]. He went, in his human nature, to the one with whom
                        he was from all eternity, in his divine nature. This was
                        explained more fully before.

                            <b>yet none of you asks me, Where are you going?</b>
                            Why does he says this? For Peter asked, "Lord, where
                            are you going?" (13:36); and Thomas said, "Lord, we
                            do not know where you are going" (14:5). Both
                            Chrysostom and Augustine give an answer to this, but
                            not the same one.

                                Et ideo huic quaestioni respondent Chrysostomus
                                et Augustinus; sed aliter et aliter.
                                Chrysostomus enim dicit, quod discipuli
                                audientes quod deberent interfici et absque
                                synagogis fieri, ita tristati et attoniti facti
                                sunt, ut quasi obliti de recessu Christi et
                                locutionem amittentes, eum de suo recessu non
                                interrogarent. Unde subdit

                                >. Et sic dominus dicens
                                <i>et nunc vado ad eum qui misit me</i>, eos
                                potius increpat, secundum Chrysostomum. Et hoc
                                non interrogabant; Deut. XXXII, 7:
                                <i>interroga patrem tuum, et annuntiabit tibi</i
                                >; Eccli. VI, 28:
                                <i>investiga illam, et manifestabitur tibi</i>.

                                Chrysostom says that when the disciples heard
                                that they would be killed and cast out of the
                                synagogues, they became so sad and stunned that
                                they practically forgot about Christ's leaving
                                them and losing the thread of his thought did
                                not ask him about this.

                                Thus when our Lord says,

                                Chrysostom. They did not question him about
                                this: "Ask your Father, and he will show you"
                                (Deut 32:7); "Search out and seek, and she will
                                become known to you" (Sir 6:28).

                                        humanam eius speciem, sicut homo
                                        delectatur de praesentia amici: et ideo
                                        de recessu eius tristabantur; Ps. XXIX,
                                        6: <i>ad vesperam</i>, scilicet
                                        passionis, <i>demorabitur fletus</i>, in

                                        2085 Now he mentions the sorrow of the
                                        disciples. For Chrysostom this sorrow is
                                        the effect of Christ's prediction [of
                                        the future troubles of the disciples] ‑
                                        For Augustine, their sorrow is the
                                        effect of Christ's leaving, for they
                                        were glad to be in his presence, and
                                        attracted in a certain carnal way to him
                                        in his human nature, like one friend is
                                        pleased at the presence of another. So
                                        they were sad that he was leaving:
                                        "Weeping may tarry for the night," that
                                        is, the time of the passion, "but joy
                                        comes" to the apostles "with the
                                        morning" of the resurrection (Ps 30:5).
                                        It is human for sorrow to touch our
                                        hearts, but it is bad when it completely
                                        takes over our heart because it then
                                        destroys our reason. So he says,
                                        somewhat like a rebuke,
                                        <b>sorrow has filled your hearts;</b>
                                        "Do not give yourself over to sorrow"
                                        (Sir 30:21); "Let not your hearts be
                                        troubled" (14:27).

                    discipulorum, et tertiam ex parte Christi. Ex parte quidem
                    mundi, quia spiritus sanctus adveniens mundum arguet; ex
                    parte discipulorum, quia eos instruet, ibi
                    <i>adhuc multa habeo vobis dicere</i> etc.; ex parte
                    Christi, quia ipsum clarificabit, ibi
                    <i>ille me clarificabit</i> et cetera. Circa primum duo
                    facit. Primo ponit utilitatem adventus spiritus sancti
                    quantum ad mundum; secundo exponit eam, ibi
                    <i>de peccato quidem, quia non crediderunt in me</i>.

                    2091 Above, our Lord consoled his apostles by promising them
                    the Holy Spirit. Here he shows the benefit the Holy Spirit
                    will bring to them when he comes. He mentions three
                    benefits: one for the world; a second for the disciples; and
                    a third for Christ. As for the world, the Holy Spirit will
                    convince the world; as for the apostles, the Spirit will
                    teach them (v 12); as for Christ, the Spirit will glorify
                    him (v 14). First, he mentions the benefit of the Spirit's
                    coming for the world; secondly, he explains it (v 9).

                                    through the apostles, just as the Holy
                                    Spirit does: "You desire proof that Christ

                                        One must therefore say that,

                                        <b>the world,</b> as the one who will
                                        invisibly enter into their hearts and
                                        pour his charity into them so that their
                                        fear is conquered and they have the
                                        strength to rebuke. For as was already
                                        said, as long as the disciples were
                                        carnally attracted to Christ, the Holy
                                        Spirit was not in them as he would be
                                        later. Consequently they were not as
                                        courageous then as they were after the
                                        Spirit came. "Their power," the power of
                                        the apostles, "came from the Spirit of
                                        his mouth" [Ps 33:6]; "Then the Spirit
                                        of God took possession of Zechariah" (2
                                        Chron 24:20). Again,
                                        <b>he will convince the world</b>
                                        because he will fill hearts which were
                                        before worldly and lead them to rebuke
                                        themselves: "I will reprove my ways in
                                        his sight" [Job 13:15]. The Holy Spirit
                                        does this: "Put a new and right spirit
                                        within me" (Ps 51:10).

                                            2094 For what will the Spirit rebuke
                                            the world? For three things. He will
                                            reprove the worldly for the sin they
                                            have committed: "Declare to my
                                            people their transgression" (Is
                                            58:1). And this was done by the
                                            apostles: "Their voice goes out
                                            through all the earth" (Ps 19:4). He
                                            will reprove the world for the
                                            righteousness it has neglected. And
                                            the apostles did this: "None is
                                            righteousness, no not one" (Rom
                                            3:10). And the Spirit will reprove
                                            the world because of the judgment it
                                            has held in contempt: "When
                                            wickedness comes, contempt comes
                                            also" (Prv 18:3); "She [Jerusalem]
                                            has despised my judgments" [Ez 5:6].

                                                2095 Now he explains all this.
                                                First, what he says about their
                                                sin, because they do not believe
                                                in me. The Spirit rebukes them
                                                only for the sin of disbelief
                                                because by faith all other sins
                                                are remitted. In a similar way
                                                our Lord charges the damned only
                                                with a lack of mercy, because
                                                all sins are washed away by
                                                mercy: "By mercy and faith sins
                                                are cleansed away" [Prv 15:27].
                                                The same applies here, because
                                                as long as they remain in
                                                disbelief, their other sins
                                                remain, but when there is no
                                                longer disbelief the other sins
                                                are remitted. He says, "because
                                                they do not believe in me,"
                                                using the form <i>in me,</i> and
                                                not the forms <i>mihi</i> or
                                                <i>me,</i> because even the
                                                devils believe that Christ
                                                exists and they tremble (Jas
                                                2:19). In me, that is, with a
                                                faith enlivened by hope and
                                                love. [On faith "in me" see no.

                                                    what he said about
                                                    righteousness when he says

                                                    apostles the explanation is
                                                    this: the world will be
                                                    rebuked because of our
                                                    righteousness, because the
                                                    world has not imitated it.
                                                    The righteousness, I say,
                                                    which is not from the law
                                                    but from faith: "The

                                                        Faith is concerned with
                                                        what is invisible (Heb
                                                        11:1). Now the disciples
                                                        saw one thing, the
                                                        humanity of Christ, and
                                                        did not see another, his
                                                        divinity. But Christ
                                                        promises this to them as
                                                        a reward: "I will...
                                                        manifest myself to him"
                                                        (14:21). Thus, the
                                                        disciples had faith only
                                                        regarding the divinity
                                                        of Christ; but when
                                                        Christ's human nature
                                                        was taken from them,
                                                        they had faith regarding
                                                        both. And so, according

                    2105 Above, we saw two fruits of the coming of the Holy
                    Spirit, which were the rebuking of the world and the
                    instruction of the disciples. Now the third fruit is
                    mentioned, the glorification of Christ. First, he mentions

                            knowledge of me. He will do this, first of all, by
                            enlightening the disciples: for they were still
                            carnal and attached to Christ in a carnal way, that
                            is, in the weakness of his flesh, not realizing the
                            grandeur of his divinity. Later, they were able to
                            grasp this through the Holy Spirit: "God has
                            revealed to us through the Spirit" (1 Cor 2:10).
                            Secondly, the Spirit will give them the confidence
                            to preach clearly, openly. Before this the disciples
                            were so timid that they did not dare to profess
                            Christ publicly, but when they were filled with the
                            Holy Spirit fear was cast out, and they proclaimed
                            Christ to the people, being somehow impelled by that
                            same Spirit: "He will come like a rushing stream,
                            which the wind [or Spirit] of the Lord drives" (Is
                            59:19). This is why the Apostle says: "The love of
                            Christ impels us" [2 Cor 5:14]. Thirdly, the Spirit
                            will glorify Christ by accomplishing marvelous works
                            in and through the apostles: "All things are
                            inspired by one and the same Spirit" (1 Cor 12:11).

                                2107 Now we see the reason why the Holy Spirit
                                will glorify Christ: it is because the Son is
                                the principle of the Holy Spirit. For everything
                                which is from another manifests that from which
                                it is. Thus the Son manifests the Father because
                                he is from the Father. And so because the Holy
                                Spirit is from the Son, it is appropriate that
                                the Spirit glorify the Son. He says,

                                    Tria enim sunt in acceptione creaturarum,
                                    quorum duo non sunt in divinis. Scilicet,
                                    quia in creaturis aliud est quod accipit, et
                                    aliud quod accipitur: quod non est in
                                    divinis, cum personae divinae simplices
                                    sint, nec in eis sit aliud et aliud: immo a
                                    quocumque accipit spiritus sanctus, accipit
                                    totam substantiam suam, similiter et filius.
                                    Aliud est, quod in creaturis accipiens
                                    aliquando fuit non habens id quod accipit,
                                    sicut si materia accipiat formam, vel
                                    subiectum accidens: aliquando enim materia
                                    fuit sine tali forma, et subiectum sine tali
                                    accidente. Et hoc quidem non est in divinis:
                                    quia filius ab aeterno est habens quod
                                    accipit a patre, et spiritus sanctus quod a
                                    patre et filio accipit. Ergo spiritus

                                    When creatures receive, three things are
                                    found, and two of these are not found in the
                                    divinity. In creatures, that which receives
                                    is one thing, and what is received is
                                    something else. This is not so in the
                                    divinity, since the divine persons are
                                    simple, and not composed of several
                                    elements. Indeed, the Holy Spirit receives
                                    his entire substance from whomever this
                                    Spirit receives, and so does the Son.
                                    Another difference is that among creatures
                                    the one who receives did not have at one
                                    time what he receives, as when matter
                                    receives a form, or a subject receives an
                                    accident: for at some time the matter was
                                    without such a form, and the subject without
                                    that accident. This is not so in the
                                    divinity, because what the Son receives from
                                    the Father the Son has from eternity, and
                                    what the Holy Spirit receives from the
                                    Father and the Son, the Spirit has from
                                    eternity. Accordingly, the Holy Spirit
                                    receives from the Son like the Son receives
                                    from the Father: "What my Father has given
                                    to me is greater than all" (10:29). Thus,
                                    when the expression "to receive" is used of
                                    the divinity, it indicates an order in
                                    origin.

                                            explained when Christ shows that the

                                            because of the unity and

                                                    part. The Father has as a
                                                    possession and as something
                                                    subject to himself the
                                                    totality of created things:
                                                    "The earth is the Lord's and
                                                    the fullness thereof" (Ps
                                                    24:1). The Father also has
                                                    something which is in him,
                                                    indeed, which is himself,
                                                    because the Father is
                                                    whatever is in Christ, since
                                                    the Father is his own
                                                    essence, own goodness, own
                                                    truth and own eternity. The
                                                    word "has" is being used in
                                                    this sense here. And so
                                                    whatever the Father has is
                                                    the Son's, because the Son
                                                    has the same wisdom and the
                                                    same goodness that the
                                                    Father also has: "For as the

                                                        some might make this
                                                        objection: If all that

                                                        also has, then since the

                                                        that the Son also has

                                                        I answer that this
                                                        argument would appear to
                                                        be valid if our Lord had
                                                        said, "All that God has
                                                        is mine." But he says,
                                                        <b
                                                          >all that the Father

                                                        and this keeps a
                                                        distinction between the
                                                        Father and the Son, and
                                                        leads us to understand
                                                        that all that the Father
                                                        has is the Son's, except
                                                        that by which the Father
                                                        is distinguished from
                                                        the Son. For by using
                                                        the word Father, Christ
                                                        declares that he is the
                                                        Son, and has not usurped

                                                        fatherhood.

                  16 "A little while, and you will see me no more; again a
                  little while, and you will see me [because I go to the
                  Father]." 17 Some of his disciples said to one another, "What
                  is this that he says to us, 'A little while, and you will not
                  see me, and again a little while, and you will see me', and,
                  'because I go to the Father'?" 18 They said, "What does he
                  mean by 'a little while'? We do not know what he means." 19
                  Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him; so he said to them,
                  "Is this what you are asking yourselves, what I meant by
                  saying, 'A little while, and you will not see me, and again a
                  little while, and you will see me'? 20 Truly, truly, I say to
                  you, you will weep and lament, but the world will rejoice, you
                  will be sorrowful, but your sorrow will turn into joy. 21 When
                  a woman is in travail she has sorrow, because her hour has
                  come; but when she is delivered of the child, she no longer
                  remembers the anguish, for joy that a child [man] is born into
                  the world. 22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again
                  and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy
                  from you."

                    2116 Above, our Lord explained one reason for their
                    consolation, that was his promise of the Holy Spirit. Here
                    he gives the second, which is that they will see him again.
                    First, the promise that they will see him again is made;
                    secondly, we see the perplexity of the disciples (v 17); and
                    thirdly, their perplexity is answered (v 19).

                        disciples, he also promised that they would see him
                        again. He insists on this several times so that by
                        considering the fact that he would come again they might
                        better endure his absence. He actually mentions three
                        things to console them: his absence will be brief; he
                        will be with them again; and he will leave with honor.

                                        Another interpretation would be that the

                                        before Christ's death, so that the
                                        meaning is: It will just be a
                                        <b>little while</b> until I am taken
                                        from you, that is, on the morrow: "Yet a
                                        little while I am with you" (13:33).
                                        <b>And you will see me no more</b>, that
                                        is, in mortal form, because "yet a
                                        little while, and the world will see me
                                        no more," as mortal (14:19); yet it will
                                        see him at the judgment and coming in
                                        majesty. But the disciples will see
                                        Christ when immortal, after the
                                        resurrection, because as we read in Acts
                                        (10:40): "God... made him manifest, not
                                        to all the people but to us who were
                                        chosen by God as witnesses." And so he
                                        adds,
                                        <b

                                        for I will remain in death only for a

                                        little while" [Is 54:8].

                                                    was so great that they did
                                                    not presume to question him.
                                                    The angels do the same: "Who
                                                    is this that comes from
                                                    Edom, in crimsoned garments
                                                    from Bozrah" (Is 63:1). And
                                                    he answers: "It is I who am
                                                    speaking of righteousness
                                                    and a defender who saves
                                                    you" [Is 63:1]. We see from
                                                    the words of the disciples

                                                    what Christ said, either
                                                    because they were still sunk
                                                    in sorrow or because the
                                                    words themselves were
                                                    obscure: "Are you also still
                                                    without understanding?" (Mt

                    2135 Above, our Lord enlarged on two things which would
                    comfort his apostles, the promise of the Paraclete and his
                    own return. Here he mentions a third reason by which he
                    comforts them, promising them access to the Father. First,
                    he promises them an intimate relationship with the Father;
                    secondly, he gives a reason for this intimacy (v 25). He
                    does two things about the first: he gives them that security
                    that comes from confidence; secondly, he encourages them to
                    act on their confidence (v 24). He does two things with the
                    first: first, he rejects a need for an intercessor;
                    secondly, he promises them an opportunity to ask (v 23).

                        <i>rogabitis</i>, Graeci habent quoddam verbum quod duo
                        significat, scilicet petere et interrogare; et ideo

                        nihil a me petetis, vel nihil me interrogabitis. Dicit

                        <b>In that day you will ask nothing of me</b>. According
                        to Augustine, where we have <i>ask</i>, the Greeks have
                        a word which means two things: to ask for something, and
                        to ask or pose a question.

                        Consequently,
                        <b>In that day you will ask nothing of me</b> can mean
                        two things: you will not ask me for anything, or you
                        will not question me about anything.

                            resurrection, or the day when we have the vision of
                            his glory.

                                De primo exponitur, secundum Chrysostomum
                                <i>in illo die</i>, scilicet quando a mortuis
                                resurrexero,

                                huiusmodi. Sed contra hanc expositionem obiicit
                                Augustinus: quia discipuli post resurrectionem
                                dicunt, Act. I, 6:
                                <i
                                  >si in tempore hoc restitues regnum Israel?</i
                                >
                                Et infra ult., 19, interrogat Petrus dicens:
                                <i>hic autem quid?</i>

                              <td>
                                2137 Chrysostom understands this passage the
                                first way.

                                Thus, <b>In that day</b>, when I arise from the
                                dead, <b>you will ask nothing of me,</b> that
                                is, you will not say such things as "Show us the
                                Father." Augustine objects to this
                                interpretation because after the resurrection
                                the disciples did say: "Lord, will you at this
                                time restore the kingdom to Israel?" (Acts
                                (1:6); and Peter poses the question: "Lord, what
                                about this man?" (20:21).

                                    dicendum, quod dominus illum diem vocat non
                                    solum diem resurrectionis, sed etiam diem
                                    illum quo a spiritu sancto docendi erant;
                                    supra eodem:

                                    Yet one can uphold Chrysostom's explanation
                                    by saying that our Lord calls
                                    <b>that day</b> not only the day of his
                                    resurrection, but also that day the
                                    disciples were to be taught by the Holy
                                    Spirit: "When the Spirit of truth comes, he
                                    will teach you all truth" [16:13]. And so by
                                    speaking in a vague manner of that time, our
                                    Lord also includes the coming of the Holy
                                    Spirit. It is like saying:
                                    <b>In that day</b>, once the Holy Spirit has
                                    been given,
                                    <b>you will ask nothing of me</b>, because
                                    you will know all things by the Holy Spirit:
                                    "His anointing teaches you about everything"
                                    (1 Jn 2:27). Again, according to Chrysostom,
                                    <b>In that day</b>, when the Holy Spirits
                                    comes, <b>you will ask nothing of me</b>,
                                    that is, you will have no need to ask me.

                                        dicit apostolus:
                                        <i>propter quod ter dominum rogavi</i>,
                                        idest Christum. Responsio. Dicendum,
                                        quod in Christo erat duplex natura:
                                        scilicet humana, per quam est mediator
                                        Dei et hominum: I Tim. II, 5, et divina,
                                        per quam est Deus unus cum patre.
                                        Christus autem secundum quod homo, non
                                        erat talis mediator ut numquam nos Deo
                                        coniungeret, sicut aliqui mediatores qui
                                        numquam extrema coniungunt. Coniungit
                                        ergo nos patri. Eadem autem est
                                        coniunctio ad Deum patrem et ad Christum
                                        secundum divinam naturam; unde dicit:
                                        non necesse habebitis ut utamini mea
                                        mediatione, inquantum homo. Sic ergo
                                        <i>in illo die non rogabitis me</i>,
                                        quasi mediatorem, quia per vos habebitis
                                        accessum ad Deum; sed rogabitis me ut
                                        Deum. Et licet Christus interpellet pro

                                        2138 But after the resurrection did not
                                        the apostles pray to Christ for things?
                                        It seems so, for the Apostle says:
                                        "Three times I besought the Lord," that
                                        is, Christ (2 Cor 12:8). I answer that
                                        there are two natures in Christ: his
                                        human nature, by which he is the
                                        mediator between God and us (1 Tim 2:5),
                                        and his divine nature, by which he is
                                        one God with the Father. Christ,
                                        considered as having a human nature, was
                                        not a mediator who never united us to
                                        God, like some mediators who never unite
                                        extremes. So, Christ joins us to the
                                        Father. Now to join God the Farther and
                                        to join Christ as God are the same. Thus
                                        he says: It is not necessary for you to
                                        use my mediation as man. Thus,
                                        <b
                                          >In that day you will ask nothing of
                                          me</b
                                        >
                                        as mediator, because you will have
                                        access to God by yourselves ‑ but you
                                        will ask me as God. Although Christ
                                        intercedes for us, as the Apostle says
                                        (Rom 8:34), still the Church does not
                                        ask him as an intercessor. Thus we do
                                        not say, "Christ, pray for us"; but we
                                        do ask him as God, adhering to him as
                                        God by faith and love.

                                                The saints do pray in our
                                                homeland: "Call now, if there is
                                                any who will answer you; and
                                                turn to some of the saints" [Job
                                                5:1]; and in 2 Maccabees (15:12)
                                                we see that a saint prayed for
                                                the entire Jewish people. Nor
                                                can one say that the saints pray
                                                just for others and not for
                                                themselves, for we read: "O
                                                Sovereign Lord... how long
                                                before you will judge and avenge
                                                our blood on those who dwell
                                                upon the earth?" (Rev 6:10).
                                                Further, the saints ask
                                                questions: for they will be
                                                equal to the angels (Mt 22:30),
                                                and the angels question: "Who is
                                                the King of glory?" (Ps 24:8),
                                                and "Who is this that comes from
                                                Edom?" (Is 63:1). Therefore, the
                                                saints do question.

                                                    Two points can be made in
                                                    answer to this. The time of
                                                    glory can be considered in
                                                    two ways: the time of the
                                                    beginning of glory, and the
                                                    time of its full completion.
                                                    The time of the beginning of
                                                    glory lasts until the day of
                                                    judgment: for the saints
                                                    receive glory in their soul,
                                                    but something still remains
                                                    to be received, that is, the
                                                    glory of the body for each
                                                    one, and the completion of
                                                    the number of the elect.
                                                    Consequently, till the day
                                                    of judgment the saints can
                                                    both ask for things and
                                                    question, but not about what
                                                    pertains to the very essence
                                                    of beatitude. The time of
                                                    fully complete glory is
                                                    after the day of judgment,
                                                    and after this nothing is
                                                    left to be asked for, and
                                                    nothing left to be known. It
                                                    is about this that he says,

                    2147 Above, our Lord promised his disciples an access and
                    intimacy with the Father. Now he gives the reason for this
                    intimacy. There are two things that make a person intimate
                    with another and foster confidence when asking for
                    something: knowledge and love. Thus our Lord gives these two
                    reasons here. The first is taken from their clear knowledge
                    of the Father; the second, from his special love for them (v
                    26).

                            Proverbium proprie dicitur quod communiter est in
                            ore omnium, sicut illud Prov. c. XXII, 6:

                            metaphorica, inde est quod proverbium quandoque
                            sumitur pro parabola, in qua aliud dicitur, aliud
                            signatur. Et hoc modo accipitur hic proverbium pro
                            parabola, idest pro parabolica locutione.

                            Indeed, their knowledge was imperfect; so he says,
                            <b>I have said this to you in proverbs.</b> A
                            proverb, strictly speaking, is a maxim, a common
                            expression, as "Train up a child in the way he
                            should go, and when he is old he will not depart
                            from it" (Prv 22:6). Now because proverbs are
                            sometimes not clear and are metaphorical, the word
                            "proverb" is sometimes used to indicate a parable,
                            which states one thing while actually meaning
                            something else. This is the case here, and "proverb"
                            should be taken to mean parable.

                                Potest autem hoc habere quadruplicem sensum.
                                Primus est talis secundum litteram, ut referatur
                                ad hoc quod immediate dixerat, hoc modo: dixi

                                et quod in nomine meo petetis, et sum quasi

                                <i>ipse pater amat vos</i>, et
                                <i>exivi a patre, et veni in mundum</i>. Et sic
                                videntur apostoli intellexisse, unde, his
                                auditis, dicunt ei:
                                <i>ecce nunc palam loqueris</i> et cetera.

                                2149 The statement,
                                <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> can
                                be taken in four ways. The first is literal, and
                                refers to what he had said immediately before
                                this. Then the sense is: I said to you that
                                hitherto you have asked nothing in my name, and
                                that you will ask in my name, and
                                <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b> and
                                obscurely. But <b>the hour is coming</b> when
                                what I said obscurely I will say plainly. Thus
                                he adds: "the Father himself loves you," and "I
                                came from the Father and have come into the
                                world." This seems to be the way the apostles
                                understood it because when they heard him say
                                these things they said, "Ah, now you are
                                speaking plainly, and not in proverbs" (16:29).

                                    XIII, 12, ideo tunc non in proverbiis, sed

                                    <b>I have said this to you in proverbs,</b>
                                    refers to everything which is read in this
                                    Gospel about the teaching of Christ. Then
                                    the next statement,

                                    would refer to the time of glory. For now we
                                    see in a mirror, in an obscure manner, since
                                    what we are told about God is presented to
                                    us in proverbs. But in our homeland we will
                                    see "face to face," as we read in 1
                                    Corinthians (13:12). Therefore, we will then
                                    be plainly told of the Father, and not in
                                    proverbs. He says, <b>of the Father</b>,
                                    because no one can see the Father in that
                                    glory unless the Son reveals him: "No one
                                    knows the Father except the Son and any one
                                    to whom the Son chooses to reveal him" (Mt
                                    11:27). For the Son is the true light, and
                                    gives us the light by which we can see the
                                    Father: "I am the light of the world"
                                    (8:12).

                                        does not fit this [second] explanation.
                                        For if that hour is the time of glory,
                                        we will not ask for anything because our
                                        desires will be satisfied with good.
                                        Accordingly, there are two other
                                        meanings. According to Chrysostom the
                                        sense is this:
                                        <b>I have said this to you,</b> that is,
                                        what I have just said,
                                        <b>in proverbs</b>, that is, in veiled
                                        language, not entirely expressing all
                                        that you should know about me and the
                                        Father, because "I have yet many things
                                        to say to you, but you cannot bear them
                                        now" (16:12). But
                                        <b>the hour is coming,</b> that is, when
                                        I have arisen from the dead,
                                        <b
                                          >when I shall no longer speak to you
                                          in proverbs,</b
                                        >
                                        that is, obscurely and in figures,
                                        <b
                                          >but tell you plainly of the
                                          Father.</b
                                        >
                                        <a

                                        Indeed, during those forty days during
                                        which he appeared to them, he taught
                                        them many mysteries and told many things
                                        about himself and the Father. Further,
                                        they had been raised to higher things by
                                        their faith in the resurrection, firmly
                                        believing that Christ was the true God.
                                        So we read that Christ was "speaking of
                                        the kingdom of God" to them (Acts 1:3),
                                        and that "He opened their minds to
                                        understand the scriptures" (Lk 24:45).

                                            sensual person understands spiritual
                                            words as proverbs, not because they
                                            were spoken as proverbs, but because
                                            the mind of such a person cannot
                                            rise above material things, and
                                            spiritual things are hidden (1 Cor
                                            2:14). But one who is spiritual
                                            understands spiritual words as
                                            spiritual. At the beginning, the
                                            disciples themselves were sensual,
                                            and what was told them they found
                                            obscure, and took as proverbs. But
                                            after they were made spiritual by
                                            Christ and had been taught by the
                                            Holy Spirit, they clearly understood
                                            spiritual words as spiritual. And so
                                            Christ says,
                                            <b
                                              >I have said this to you in

                                            >
                                            that is, you understood what I said
                                            as proverbs. But
                                            <b

                  29 His disciples said, "Ah, now you are speaking plainly, not
                  in any figure [proverb]! 30 Now we know that you know all
                  things, and need none to question you; by this we believe that
                  you came from God." 31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now
                  believe? 32 The hour is coming, indeed it has come, when you
                  will be scattered, every man to his home, and will leave me
                  alone; yet I am not alone, for the Father is with me. 33 I
                  have said this to you, that in me you may have peace. In the
                  world you have tribulation; but be of good cheer, I have
                  overcome the world."

                        sacrae Scripturae ita exprimitur Christi origo, sicut
                        hic, cum dicit:
                        <i>palam de patre meo annuntiabo vobis</i>, et,
                        <i>exivi a patre, et veni in mundum</i>. Et ideo
                        credentes hanc promissionem, qua dixit,
                        <i>palam de patre meo annuntiabo vobis</i>, eis
                        completam esse, ita ut non alia manifestatione

                        ut Augustinus dicit, ita adhuc ignorantes erant
                        discipuli, ut se non intelligere ignorent. Non enim
                        promiserat eis in illa hora se sine proverbiis
                        locuturum, sed in hora resurrectionis vel gloriae. Tamen
                        quantum ad ipsos discipulos iam clarius eis fuit locutus
                        tunc, quamvis alia claritas sermonum eius esset
                        expectanda. Infra XVIII, v. 20:
                        <i>ego palam locutus sum mundo</i>. Secundum confitentur
                        cum dicunt <i>nunc scimus quia scis omnia</i>.

                        say,
                        <b>Now you are speaking plainly, not in any proverb!</b>
                        If we consider this with attention we see that there is
                        scarcely any other place in sacred scripture where the
                        origin of Christ is so openly expressed as here, when he
                        says, "I shall tell you plainly of the Father," and "I
                        came forth from the Father and have come into the
                        world." And so believing that his promise to tell them
                        plainly of the Father had now been kept so that they did
                        not need any further teaching, they say,
                        <b>Ah, now you are speaking plainly</b>. As Augustine
                        remarks, the disciples were still so lacking in
                        understanding that they did not realize they were
                        lacking in understanding.

                        proverbs at that time, but at the time of the
                        resurrection or of glory. Yet as far as the disciples
                        were concerned, he was now speaking more clearly,
                        although they were later to understand his words still
                        more clearly.

                            argumentum est certae et perfectae scientiae quando

                            intentionem, quia scilicet dominus scit omnia cordis
                            eorum secreta, et de his quae dubitant satisfacit:
                            consolatur eos promittendo gaudium spiritus sancti,

                            <i>tu omnia nosti</i>; Sap. c. VIII, 8:

                            when they say,
                            <b>Now we know that you know all things</b>. At
                            first glance, the meaning seems to be that when one
                            clearly explains the things he says, this is a proof
                            of his certain and full knowledge of them: for the
                            sign of one who knows is the ability to fully teach
                            what he knows ‑ "Knowledge is easy for a man of
                            understanding" (Prv 14:6) ‑ and what is beyond one's
                            understanding cannot be plainly told in words. Yet
                            the apostles said this for another reason, which is
                            because the Lord knew all the secrets of their
                            hearts, and could satisfy their perplexities. He
                            consoled them by promising them the joy of the Holy
                            Spirit, that they would see him again, and that the
                            Father loves them. Thus they say,
                            <b>Now we know that you know all things</b>, that
                            is, the secrets of hearts: "Lord, you know
                            everything" (21:17); "The Lord God knows all things
                            before they are done" [Wis 8:8].

                                to contradict what they had just said, namely,
                                that he knows all things; for one who is wise is
                                questioned (rather than questioning others). Why
                                then is it not necessary to question him? The
                                answer is that they said this to indicate that
                                he even knew the secrets of hearts, because even
                                before he was questioned he satisfied their
                                perplexity when they were saying to each other,
                                "What does he mean by 'a little while'?"
                                (16:18). Nevertheless, Christ does ask and is
                                asked, not because he needs it, but because we
                                do.

                                            is understood as a question, it is a
                                            rebuke for being so slow to believe.
                                            It is like saying: Have you waited
                                            till now to believe? If we
                                            understand this remissibly, Christ
                                            is reproving the instability of
                                            their faith. Then it is like saying:
                                            It is true that you believe now, but
                                            as soon as I am betrayed, you will
                                            leave me: "They believe for a while
                                            and in time of temptation fall away"
                                            (Lk 8:13).

                                                away they lost what they had
                                                acquired through Christ. They
                                                had acquired the companionship
                                                of Christ, freedom from the
                                                burdens of ownership, and a life
                                                together. Peter mentions these
                                                three things in Matthew (19:27):
                                                "We," all of us, referring to
                                                their life together, "have left
                                                everything," referring to the
                                                freedom from the burdens of
                                                ownership, "and followed you,"
                                                referring to their companionship
                                                with Christ. They lost these
                                                things and our Lord foretold
                                                this to them when he said:
