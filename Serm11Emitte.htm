<p align=center><b>Introduction</b>
<p align=center><i>Friar Thomas of the Order of Preachers</i>
<p>For seven centuries St.
Thomas Aquinas has been revered as the Church's supreme dogmatic or speculative
theologian.  In the course of this long history, he has also, though perhaps
less widely, been recognized as a scriptural exegete of considerable subtlety
and insight.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn2" name="_ednref2" >[2]</a>
It is fair to say, however, that he is rarely thought of as a <i>preacher.  </i>Indeed,
the conventional image of him&#8212;that of an abstracted, solitary genius, aloof
from the cares of the world, pacing the halls in pursuit of an argument,
plunged into a literary apostolate of staggering dimensions&#8212;seems to exclude
preaching from the round of activities in which he could have been
realistically engaged.  His popular nickname, the Angelic Doctor, though very
well suited to the loftiness of his thought and the purity of his person, might
convey the impression that Thomas, like Moses during the revelation of the Law,
spent his days at the summit of God's mountain, unseen by the people.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn3" name="_ednref3" >[3]</a>
<p>Yet those who know more about the saint and his
times have good reason for calling into question the fidelity of such a
portrait to its flesh-and-blood original.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn4" name="_ednref4"
>[4]</a>
Thomas gave himself heart and soul to a new religious community whose very
identity was bound up with the mission of public preaching: the Dominicans, or
more properly, the <i>Ordo Fratrum Praedicatorum, </i>the order of preaching
brethren.  He pursued this specific vocation in the face of considerable&#8212;by
legend, violent and vulgar&#8212;opposition from members of his family.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn5" name="_ednref5" >[5]</a>
At the University of Paris, he undertook the three traditional duties of a
"master of the sacred page," <i>magister in sacra pagina</i>: lecturing on the
Bible, holding public disputations, and preaching.
<p>Beginning in the following September [of 1256] he had to perform the three functions of
the master in theology.  These were announced at the end of the twelfth century
by Peter Cantor and later confirmed in the statutes of the theology faculty: <i>legere,
disputare, praedicare.</i>  Thomas was completely aware of this, and an entire
passage in his <i>Principium </i>[inaugural lecture] explains the qualities
that the doctors in Sacred Scripture (<i>doctores sacrae scripturae, </i>the
title should be noted) must possess in order to carry out their triple function.
They must be "elevated" (<i>alti</i>) by the eminence of their lives to be able
to preach effectively; "enlightened" (<i>illuminati</i>) in order to teach in
an appropriate way; and "fortified" (<i>muniti</i>) to refute errors in
disputation.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn6" name="_ednref6" >[6]</a>
<p>In short, by his Dominican
vocation as by his academic position, Thomas was a man who should have been
much involved in preaching the word of God from the pulpit.  And in point of
fact, he was.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn7" name="_ednref7" >[7]</a>
As Ignatius Eschmann, O.P., summarizes:
"St. Thomas preached assiduously, as may be expected from a Friar Preacher and,
more especially still, a mediaeval Master of Theology whose statutory obligations
included preaching just as attendance at University sermons was obligatory for
the students." <a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn8" name="_ednref8"
>[8]</a>  A number of his
sermons have come down to us&#8212;several sets of <i>collationes </i>("conferences,"
as one could call them) and twenty-one "university sermons" that are either certainly
by Aquinas or attributable to him with a high degree of probability.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn9" name="_ednref9" >[9]</a>
<p>The tendency to overlook Thomas the preacher is
easily explained.  For one thing, of the great many sermons he must have
preached, relatively few are extant.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn10" name="_ednref10" >[10]</a>
Nor is this dearth peculiar to the Dumb Ox.  Most medieval sermons, in this
respect no different from sermons of any period, were not written as polished
literary products for the instruction of posterity, but were <i>pi&egrave;ces
d'occasion, </i>delivered from notes or outlines likely to be subsequently lost.
In some instances we have found outlines, but from such documents a full-scale
sermon cannot really be extrapolated.  It complicates matters, too, that while
these notes or outlines are often in Latin, the sermons based on them were just
as often preached in the vernacular.  (The moment a scribe enters the picture,
he will probably write down a summary in Latin, the academic's native tongue
and the language he is accustomed to abbreviating.)  Moreover, in contrast to
later ages when more convenient and more durable means of recording and
publishing were developed, a vast number of records from the Middle Ages have
been lost over the centuries due to natural decay, fire and flood, war,
reformatory purges, recycling, and so on&#8212;though enough manuscripts survive to
keep scholars busy indefinitely.  If a particular sermon was lucky enough to
survive the day of its delivery, this was owing either to the good offices of a
scribe with nimble quill catching the words as they came forth from the pulpit,
or to a deliberate plan on the part of the preacher.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn11"
name="_ednref11" >[11]</a>
In part, too, Thomas was not, you might say, a "preacher's preacher"; his chief
occupation, and one suspects preoccupation, was different: elaborate disputed
questions, compendia of doctrine, commentaries, apologetic and polemical
treaties, and the like&#8212;which are still definitely forms of preaching, as the
Dominicans have always seen it, but of a more rarefied kind, aimed at imparting
the science of sacred doctrine.
<p>When we turn to a homily by Aquinas, what do we
find?  Thomas's preaching, remarks L. H. Petitot, O.P., "ordinarily reproduced or prolonged his doctrinal
teaching in more accessible and edifying forms."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn12"
name="_ednref12" >[12]</a>
The same biographer offers an excellent summary of this aspect of the friar's
life and work:
<p>The
sermons of St. Thomas manifest the depth of his ascetic and mystical life.
Although the orator in him was sacrificed to favor his development as a theologian
and teacher, Thomas preached quite frequently.  In fact, he enjoyed great renown
as a preacher.  He delivered his sermons at Saint-Jacques in Paris, before the
Religious, the faithful, and members of the University.  In Italy he preached to the Roman Court.  At Naples, he spoke each night during Lent.  He evoked such emotion when speaking of the Passion that he had to stop while the people wept...  His commanding presence, the aura of learning and simplicity which
surrounded him, must have fascinated and charmed his listeners.  William of
Tocco tells us that, because of his constant abstraction of mind, Thomas could
speak no other vernacular language besides his native dialect.  At Naples, he used the language of the province.  The biographer adds that he put aside his
theological erudition and scholastic subtleties, and produced the fruits of
conversion in the hearts of the people.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn13" name="_ednref13">[13]</a>
<p>The Neapolitan sermons mentioned here were preached
during the Lent of 1273, the last of the saint's life, and had for their
subject the petitions of the Lord's Prayer.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn14" name="_ednref14"
>[14]</a>
Many who had heard Thomas in the pulpit or knew others who had heard him
testified during the canonization process that people were deeply moved by his
words.  Readers today tend to find the saint's "conferences" intellectually
nourishing but not especially <i>moving, </i>and so are puzzled when they hear
reports of the congregation's emotional response.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn15"
name="_ednref15" >[15]</a>
Obviously, much of the effect of a sermon depends on the actual delivery.  The
voice, the gestures, the timing, the grace of the Holy Spirit at work on a
receptive soul&#8212;these factors should not be overlooked.  Speaking from personal
experience, I have at times been powerfully moved by a sermon, only to find,
when I looked over the notes kindly given to me by the priest later on, that it
seemed rather sparse.  This is no fault of the preacher's, but a fault of the
written medium, which does poor justice to the spoken word.  One should bear
this in mind all the more for medieval sermons, which were often written out,
or copied down, in a kind of scholastic shorthand.  For instance, Aquinas may
have produced Latin outlines for his sermons on the Apostles' Creed, but the
full-fledged version he delivered in the Neapolitan dialect is something we
cannot reproduce; the Latin <i>reportatio </i>of Reginald of Piperno is trustworthy
as to content, but is more a doctrinal summary than a word-for-word copy.  The
results on paper can thus seem clipped in style, compressed in thought, not
very promising materials for public delivery.  But if to such a dry outline one
could "just add water"&#8212;the water of fluent speech and, especially, the tears of
fervor shed so often by the great saints&#8212;it would spring into bloom like a
desert flower rejoicing in the rain.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn16" name="_ednref16" >[16]</a>
As Petitot reminded us, Thomas was preaching in Naples in his childhood
mother-tongue, not in the Latin of the schools.  We are, needless to say,
grateful for the Latin summaries (<i>reportationes</i>)<i> </i>made by Reginald
of Piperno and Peter d'Andria, but these do not reproduce the exact tenor of
the original.  "Of St. Thomas's sermon," wrote Hyacinthe Dondaine, "we hear in
truth only the echo transmitted by the reporter."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn17"
name="_ednref17" >[17]</a>
<p align=center><i>The Pentecost sermon</i>
<p>Among the authentic sermons
of Aquinas are several so recently discovered that they have not yet been
published in <i>any </i>form, whether in Latin or in translation.  Here, we are
pleased to be able to offer a translation of one such sermon (or, more
precisely, two-part sermon), preached by Thomas on the Feast of Pentecost, in
all probability during his second term in Paris as regent master of theology,
1268-1272.  It was customary at this time to divide a sermon on a major feast
into two parts, called the <i>sermo</i> and the <i>collatio, </i>which were
delivered separately&#8212;one early in the day, the other in the evening.
Fittingly, the celebration of a great feast went from morning to night, with
solemn choral prayer and Mass, processions, a banquet, and so on.  Torrell
notes, <i>apropos </i>the sermon at hand: "This text, preached on a Pentecost,
is a precious witness of the rare cases in which, besides the morning
preaching, we have the second part, given at Vespers; which is to say that it
gives us a rather full account."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn18" name="_ednref18" >[18]</a>
<p>Although Fr. Bataillon has prepared a critical
edition from the three manuscripts in which it has been preserved (Salamanca,
Univ. 2187, f. 184ra-188va; Sevilla, Cabildo, 83.2.5, f. 136ra-140vb; and
Erlangen, Univ. 322, f. 83va-86ra), it is uncertain when the Latin text of this
sermon (and of all the others) will be released to the public in a volume of
the <i>editio Leonina.  </i>The present translation will therefore prove useful
to all students of St. Thomas, both for those who do not read Latin, and for
those who do, but have, as yet, no published Latin text to consult.
<p>Fr. Torrell appears to be the first commentator who
has been able to incorporate into his analysis of St. Thomas's rich theology of
the Holy Spirit a reference to the content of the Pentecost sermon, having
learned of its existence from his intimate involvement with the Leonine
Commission:
<p>Although it is already perfectly accessible, this teaching [just summarized] on the Holy
Spirit was not a mere theological thesis topic; Thomas speaks about it quite
volubly in his preaching.  We already used in passing his homilies on the
Credo.  But to better grasp the concrete form that this could take, we also
have a beautiful sermon that gives a more precise echo.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn19"
name="_ednref19" >[19]</a>
<p>Torrell limits himself to a
brief summary of the content, pointing out the extent to which Thomas
accentuates the omnipresence of the Spirit in Christian life.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn20"
name="_ednref20" >[20]</a>
The sermon itself is straightforward in approach, with a fourfold structure
highly favored by the saint.  The text preached on is a verse from Psalm 104
[103] that appears in the liturgy of Pentecost (and also, more familiarly, as
part of a much-loved prayer, the <i>Veni sancte Spiritus</i><a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn21"
name="_ednref21" >[21]</a>):
"Send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face
of the earth."  (Hence, one may refer to this sermon simply by its opening
phrase or incipit, <i>Emitte Spiritum.</i>)  Thomas points out that this verse
identifies four things: the nature of the Spirit, the purpose of His activity,
the working that accomplishes this purpose, and the object of His working, or
in short, who He is, why He acts, His acting, and what He acts upon.  Readers
familiar with Aristotle will recognize here the four causes: formal, final,
efficient, and material.  The <i>sermo </i>(the morning's homily) takes up the
first two points, while the <i>collatio </i>(the evening's homily) takes up the
last two points.  Some features characteristic of Thomas's homilies in general
and this one in particular include the pointed use of the second person,
calling each listener to attention; a rhetorical use of questions in order to
bring home truths more memorably; the use of many concrete illustrations to
which everyone can relate, along with some gentle but firm words of
remonstration; a high density and diversity of Scriptural citations ranging
over both Testaments; an "economic" and "cosmic" perspective that embraces the
whole history of salvation and, while emphasizing man, takes the whole universe
into its purview; a pronounced affective dimension, stressing the personal and
intimate friendship between God and man, and charity toward one's neighbors; a
number of ideas borrowed from the liturgy or liturgical customs.  One feature
of Aquinas's sermons that will surprise nobody is their resolute engagement
with doctrinal questions.  Despite its comparative simplicity, a homily by
Thomas stretches the listener's powers of understanding.  It goes without
saying that he wants people to be moved to a greater love of God, but he wants
people above all to <i>think </i>about the mysteries of faith&#8212;to think clearly
and deeply, so as to arrive at a better grasp of the <i>meaning </i>of the
feast at hand, or of a scriptural passage under consideration.  Of course,
Thomas was often preaching to theology students, so he could afford to tax his
congregation's powers more than a parish priest might find it wise to attempt
on a typical Sunday.  Still, this characteristic is true of his Neapolitan homilies,
too: they are not pious fluff to make people feel good (or feel bad); they aim
at a real understanding and, through this, a contemplation of mystery.  All the
same, a sermon has to be relatively brief and straightforward, otherwise it
will fail in its pastoral function.  Thomas never forgets this practical side
of things, making his points swiftly and clearly, and covering a lot of ground
in a short time.  He never wanders.
<p>I will not burden the introduction with a detailed
analysis of the sermon, much less a comparison of its contents to the teaching
contained in other works of St. Thomas.  The subject of Aquinas's pneumatology
has drawn the attention and exercised the talents of generations of
commentators, from classic exponents such as Cajetan, John of St. Thomas, and
the Carmelites of Salamanca down to eminent Thomists of the last century such
as Garrigou-Lagrange, Maritain, and Journet.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn22" name="_ednref22">[22]</a>
The secondary literature in this area is quite ample.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn23"
name="_ednref23" >[23]</a>
Deserving of special mention are the penetrating studies of Thomas's
Trinitarian doctrine by Bertrand de Margerie, S.J.,<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn24" name="_ednref24" >[24]</a>
and Gilles Emery, op.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn25"
name="_ednref25" >[25]</a>  As regards the
Church's Magisterium, the Roman Pontiffs have embraced and proposed Aquinas's
teaching on the Holy Spirit with the same conviction with which they have
adopted other central aspects of his theology, as evidenced by Leo XIII's
encyclical on the Holy Spirit, <i>Divinum Illud Munus </i>(May 9, 1897) and
John Paul II's encyclical <i>Dominum et Vivificantem </i>(May 5, 1986).<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn26" name="_ednref26" >[26]</a>
In fact, Leo XIII's encyclical has been described as D. J. Kennedy as "largely
drawn from St. Thomas," making it an ideal introduction to this area of the
Angelic Doctor's theology.</p>

<p align=center><i>Sermon and Collation of St. Thomas Aquinas for the Feast of Pentecost</i><a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn27" name="_ednref27">[27]</a>
<p align=center><B>Sermon for the Day</B>
<p align=center>"Send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew the face of the earth." (Ps. 103:30)<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn28" name="_ednref28" >[28]</a>
<p>We should speak about Him without whom no one can speak
rightly, about Him who gives speech and gives the power to speak copiously.
And indeed, it is impossible to speak rightly without Him.  Nor should one
marvel at what is said: "Who can know the sense [<i>sensum</i>]" of the truth
of God "unless he shall send His Spirit from the Most High?" (Wis. 9:17).<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn29" name="_ednref29" >[29]</a>
Without a feeling [<i>sensu</i>] for the truth, no one speaks what is true.  In
like manner, the Holy Spirit makes all the saints speak copiously, and for this
reason Gregory says: "Those whom He fills, He makes wise."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn30"
name="_ednref30" >[30]</a>
The same thing is manifest today [on Pentecost], when "the apostles were filled
with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in various tongues" (Acts 2:4).  Therefore,
even though we are mute, we shall ask that He who gives abundant speech shall
give me words to speak.
<p>"Send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created."  Today Holy Mother Church solemnly celebrates the sending of the Holy Spirit upon the
Apostles&#8212;a sending which the Prophet besought, when moved by the Spirit of
prophecy he said: "Send forth Thy spirit and they shall be created, and Thou
shalt renew the face of the earth."  These words give us four things to
consider: (1) what is proper to<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn31" name="_ednref31" >[31]</a>
the Holy Spirit himself, (2) His sending,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn32" name="_ednref32"
>[32]</a>
(3) the power of the one sent, and (4) the matter receptive of this power.  The
Prophet says, then: "Send forth": behold, the sending; "Thy Spirit": behold,
the Person sent; "and they shall be created, and Thou shalt renew": behold, the
effect of the one sent; "the face of the earth": behold, the matter receptive
of this effect.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn33" name="_ednref33" >[33]</a>
<p><b>What is proper to the Holy Spirit</b>
<p>First, I say that what is proper to the Holy Spirit
is indicated when the prophet says: "Thy Spirit."  Notice that the name
"spirit" seems to convey four things: subtleness<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn34"
name="_ednref34" >[34]</a>
of substance, perfection of life, impulse of motion, and hidden origin.  So,
first of all, the name "spirit" seems to convey subtleness of substance.  For
we are accustomed to call incorporeal substances "spirit."  Similarly, we call
subtle bodies such as air or fire "spirit."  Hence we read in the last chapter
of Luke's Gospel: "See my hands and my feet, that it is I myself; handle me,
and see; for a spirit has not flesh and bones as you see that I have" (Lk.
24:39).  And this is the way that "spirit" is distinguished from things that
have heavy matter, things that are composed out of flesh and body.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn35" name="_ednref35" >[35]</a>
Secondly, the name "spirit" seems to convey perfection of life.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn36"
name="_ednref36" >[36]</a>
For as long as animals have breath [<i>spiritum</i>] they are alive, and when
their breath leaves them, they perish.  "Thou takest away their breath, and
they die and return to their dust" (Ps. 103:29).  And in Genesis, Noah called
into his boat "all flesh in which there was the breath of life [<i>spiritus uitae</i>]."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn37" name="_ednref37" >[37]</a>
Thirdly, the name "spirit" seems to convey impulse of motion, for it is in this
way that we give the name "spirit" to winds.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn38" name="_ednref38"
>[38]</a>
And in the Psalms it says about this: "He spoke and there arose a storm of wind
[<i>spiritus</i>], the winds of storms shall be the portion of their cup."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn39" name="_ednref39" >[39]</a>
Men are also said to act "with spirit" when they do something forcefully, as
Isaiah has it: "the spirit of the robust, like a whirlwind driving against the
wall" (Is. 25:4).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn40" name="_ednref40" >[40]</a>
Fourthly, the name "spirit" customarily names a hidden origin, as when someone,
feeling troubled and not knowing the cause of what is troubling him, attributes
it to a "spirit."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn41" name="_ednref41" >[41]</a>
So we read in John: "The wind [<i>spiritus</i>] blows where it wills, and you
hear the sound of it, but you do not know whence it comes or whither it goes"
(Jn. 3:8).
<p>In line with these four things, we can seek out what
is proper to the Holy Spirit.  Proceeding in reverse order, He is called "the
Holy Spirit" on account of His being the hidden origin of things,<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn42" name="_ednref42" >[42]</a>
impulse of motion, holiness of life, and subtleness of substance.  First, I say
that one thing proper to the Holy Spirit is His being the hidden origin of
things.  Faith teaches us and reason persuades us that all visible and
changeable things have a hidden cause.  What is that cause?  God.  Hence the
Apostle says: "God is the one who created all things" (Heb. 3:4).  It is
certain that whatsoever is <i>other </i>than God is <i>created </i>by God.  But
in what manner did God create all things?  It was not by a natural necessity,
as fire burns; rather, He produced all things by His own will: "All things
whatsoever that He willed, He did" (Ps. 113:ii,
3).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn43" name="_ednref43" >[43]</a>
A craftsman makes a house by will, but is also urged on by necessity or usefulness&#8212;say,
that he may earn a profit or dwell in that house.  But God did not make the
world from a will of needy desire, for He does not need our goods.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn44" name="_ednref44" >[44]</a>
Why, then, did He make the world?  Surely not from a needy desire, but from a
loving will.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn45" name="_ednref45" >[45]</a>
Here's a comparison: an artisan who conceives a beautiful house in his mind,
not because he needs to build it, but simply loving the house's beauty&#8212;that
artisan's <i>love </i>would bring the house into being.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn46"
name="_ednref46" >[46]</a>
But what is the cause and root of the production of hidden things?  Surely
love.  Hence we read in the Book of Wisdom: "Thou lovest all the things which
are, and Thou hast hated none of the things which Thou didst make" (Wis. 11:25).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn47" name="_ednref47" >[47]</a>
And blessed Dionysius says that "divine love does not allow itself to be
without seed."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn48" name="_ednref48" >[48]</a>
This love is the Holy Spirit.  For this reason, the account in Genesis of the
beginning of creation says that "the Spirit of the Lord was borne over the waters"
(Gen. 1:2), namely, in order to produce matter and bring things into being.
Today we celebrate the feast of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit which is the source
[<i>principium</i>] of being for all things.  The Holy Spirit, whose property
is love, therefore has [the note of being creation's] hidden origin.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn49" name="_ednref49" >[49]</a>
<p>Secondly, "Holy Spirit" conveys
impulse of motion.  For we see in the world diverse motions: natural motions
and, in men and angels, voluntary motions.  Where do these diverse motions come
from?  They must come from a first mover, namely, from God.  "Thou shalt change
them and they shall be changed" (Ps. 101:27).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn50" name="_ednref50"
>[50]</a>
And God moves by will.  But what is the first motion of the will?  Surely
love.  And what sort of activity belongs to love?<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn51"
name="_ednref51" >[51]</a>
I say: he who is moved by love rejoices by love over the thing loved and
sorrows over what is contrary to it.  Hence in the first chapter of Ezekiel we
read: "Where the force of the Spirit was," that is, the inclination of divine
love, "there they were carried" (Ezek. 1:12).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn52" name="_ednref52"
>[52]</a>
And in truth, all things that are in the world are moved by the Holy Spirit, as
the book of Esther testifies when it says: "There is no one who could resist
His will" (Esther 13:9).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn53" name="_ednref53" >[53]</a>
This Holy Spirit whose feast we celebrate today is the source of all motion.
Now, some things in the world are moved from within themselves, while some
things are moved by others; the living are moved from within themselves, the
lifeless are [only] moved by others.  The source of <i>all </i>motion is alive,
rather <i>is </i>life.  Thus the Holy Spirit, in so far as He is the source of
all motion, <i>is life.  </i>"With Thee is the fountain of life" (Ps. 35:10).<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn54" name="_ednref54" >[54]</a>
And because He <i>is </i>life, He therefore <i>gives </i>life.  Great then is
the Holy Spirit in all things that are, and move, and live.  "In him, we live
and move and have our being" (Acts 17:28).  All things therefore have motion
and being from the Holy Spirit.
<p>Thirdly, if we consider the
subtleness of substance in the Holy Spirit, we shall see that He is love.  And
whose love?  That of God, and of those who love God.  It is of the very nature
of [this] love that the Holy Spirit has subtleness of substance.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn55" name="_ednref55" >[55]</a>
And on the part of the one loved [<i>amati</i>], He is the love by which God
loves God and by which the Father loves the Son.  The Book of Wisdom says: "For
there is in her," meaning the wisdom of God, "the spirit of understanding,"
which makes men understand.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn56" name="_ednref56" >[56]</a>
In Greek, "holy" signifies cleanness.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn57" name="_ednref57" >[57]</a>
Truly, the love by which a man loves bodily things is not clean, for since the
lover is united by love to that which he loves, the lover is made unclean to
the extent that he mixes himself up with such a thing.  For just as silver is
debased when mixed with an impure metal, so your soul is debased if is mixed up
with inferior or lower things by love of them.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn58" name="_ednref58"
>[58]</a>
But when your soul is joined to a higher thing, then the love is called <i>holy.
</i> Now, there are some who want to be devoted to God and yet who neglect the
salvation of their neighbor; such an attitude is not from the Holy Spirit.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn59" name="_ednref59" >[59]</a>
The Apostle Paul was solicitous over his neighbor's salvation, for which reason
he says: "I have become all things to all men, that I might be of profit to
all" (1 Cor. 9:22).  Again, there are some who are manifold but deceitful.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn60" name="_ednref60" >[60]</a>
Not thus is the Holy Spirit, for He is manifold in such a way that He,
remaining utterly one, bestows Himself upon diverse things.  Again, He is
subtle because He makes a man withdraw from earthly things and cling to God.
"One thing have I asked of the Lord, that will I seek after: that I may dwell
in the house of the Lord all the days of my life" (Ps. 26:4).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn61"
name="_ednref61" >[61]</a>
"It is good for me to cling to God" (Ps. 72:28).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn62"
name="_ednref62" >[62]</a>
<p>Fourthly, this Holy Spirit not only
gives being, being alive, and being in motion; nay more, He <i>makes men holy.</i><a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn63" name="_ednref63" >[63]</a>
Hence the Apostle says: "He was predestined God in power, according to the
Spirit of holiness" (Rom. 1:4).  No one is holy unless the Holy Spirit makes him
holy.  And how does He make someone holy?  I say: He brings it about that what
I have just been describing appears in all whom He makes holy, for He renders
them subtle, and contemptuous of temporal things.  As it says in John's Gospel:
"Do not love the world nor those things which are in the world.  If anyone
loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him" (1 Jn. 2:15).  Again, He bestows spiritual life upon those whom He makes holy, as it says in
Ezekiel: "Behold I will place the spirit within you, and you shall live" (Ezek.
37:5).  The spiritual life owes its very existence to the Holy Spirit.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn64" name="_ednref64" >[64]</a>
"If you live by the Spirit, walk also by the Spirit" (Gal. 5:25).  Again, the Holy Spirit, who makes people holy, by His own force moves them to work well.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn65" name="_ednref65" >[65]</a>
"He [the saint] comes as a rushing stream, which the wind [<i>spiritus</i>] of
the Lord drives forward" (Is. 59:19).  Some men are lazy, and these do not seem
to be driven by the Holy Spirit.  Hence on that verse of Acts, "Suddenly a
sound came from heaven like the rush of a mighty wind, and it filled all the
house where they were sitting" (Acts 2:2), the Gloss says: "the grace of the
Holy Spirit knows nothing of slow efforts."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn66" name="_ednref66"
>[66]</a>
Again, the Holy Spirit leads them back to the hidden origin through which we are
united to God; in the words of Isaiah, "the Spirit of the Lord will carry you
away to a place you do not know" (1 Kings 18:12<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn67"
name="_ednref67" >[67]</a>),
that is, to the heavenly inheritance.  "Thy good Spirit shall lead me into the
right land" (Ps. 142:10).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn68" name="_ednref68" >[68]</a>
What is proper to the Holy Spirit is now clear: He is the origin of living, of
being, and of moving.
<p><b>2. The sending of the Holy Spirit</b>
<p>Let us look into the second [point],
namely the sending of the Holy Spirit, which is marvelous and unknown to us,
because the Holy Spirit is sent without needing to be sent,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn69"
name="_ednref69" >[69]</a>
without change of Himself, without subjection, and without separation.
<p>I say, first, the Holy Spirit is sent without His
needing to be sent.  When someone is sent to a place so that an event may
happen which could not happen unless he were sent, this would be a sending out
of necessity.  But this has no place in the sending of the Holy Spirit, whom
the Book of Wisdom describes as "having every power, beholding all things" (Wis. 7:23).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn70" name="_ednref70" >[70]</a>
What, then, is the reason for the sending of the Holy Spirit?  <i>Our </i>neediness;
and the necessity of this neediness of ours comes partly from human nature's
dignity, and partly from its deficiency.  For the rational creature excels
other creatures because it can actually reach the enjoyment of God, which no
other earthly creature can do.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn71" name="_ednref71" >[71]</a>
"The Lord is my portion, said my soul" (Lam. 3:24).  Some seek their portion in this world, such as those who seek worldly honor or dignity.  But the
Psalmist says: "It is good for me to cling to God" (Ps. 72:28).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn72"
name="_ednref72" >[72]</a>
You should consider that all things that are moved to some end must have something
moving them toward that end.  Those that are moved to a natural end have a
mover in nature; but those that are moved to a supernatural end, namely to the
enjoyment of God, must have a supernatural mover.  Now, nothing can lead us to
our end unless two things are presupposed, for someone is led to an end by two
things&#8212;knowledge and love.  The kind of knowledge in question is supernatural:
"No eye hath seen, nor ear heard, nor hath it arisen in the heart of man, what
God hath prepared for those who love Him" (1 Cor. 2:9).  "Never have they
heard, nor perceived with ears, nor has eye seen, O God, without Thee, what
Thou hast prepared for those who await Thee" (Is. 64:4).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn73"
name="_ednref73" >[73]</a>
Now, whatever a man knows, he knows either by discovering it himself or by
learning from another.  Vision serves discovery and hearing serves learning,
and for this reason it is said that "eye hath not seen, nor ear heard," showing
that it [the final end] altogether transcends human knowledge.  It exceeds
human desire, too, and that is why Scripture says: "nor hath it arisen in the
heart of man."  How, then, is man led to know it?  It was necessary for
heavenly secrets to be <i>made known </i>to men; it was necessary for the Holy
Spirit to be invisibly sent, in order to move man's affections so that he may
tend toward that end.  And thus it says: "Eye hath not seen."  How, then, do we
know?  "God hath revealed it to us through His Spirit.  For the Spirit examineth
all things, even the deep things of God" (1 Cor. 2:10).  "Who would be able to know Thy thought [<i>sensum</i>], unless Thou gavest wisdom and sent the Holy
Spirit from the Most High?" (Wis. 9:17).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn74" name="_ednref74"
>[74]</a>
Therefore the Holy Spirit is sent not owing to any need of His, but for the
sake of our benefit.
<p>Again, the sending takes place
without any change in Himself.  There is change when a messenger is sent from
place to place, but the Holy Spirit is sent without any change of place because
He is the true God, unchangeable.  "While remaining in Himself, He renews all
things" (Wis. 7:27).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn75" name="_ednref75" >[75]</a>
How, then, is He sent?  He <i>draws us to Himself, </i>and in that way He is
said to be sent, as the sun is said to be sent to someone when he comes to
share in the sun's brightness.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn76" name="_ednref76" >[76]</a>
So it is with the Holy Spirit, and for this reason Scripture says about
uncreated Wisdom: "Send her from the heavens and from the seat of Thy
greatness, that she may be with me" (Wis. 9:10).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn77"
name="_ednref77" >[77]</a>
Again: "He hath sent His own Spirit, crying out Abba, Father" (Gal. 4:5).
These sendings are diffused "throughout all the nations" (Wis. 7:27) and are carried into holy souls.  When the "fullness of time" had come, the Son of
God was sent in the flesh (Gal. 4:4), and thus it was becoming that the Holy
Spirit, too, be visibly sent&#8212;but not in such a way that He took up a created
nature into the unity of His Person, as the Son did with human nature.
<p>Again, the Holy Spirit is sent
without subjection.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn78" name="_ednref78" >[78]</a>
Servants are sent by lords because they are subject to them.  It was for this
reason that certain heretics falsely believed that the Son and the Holy Spirit
were lesser than the Father, namely, because they were sent by Him.  But the
Holy Spirit makes us free,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn79" name="_ednref79" >[79]</a>
and therefore He is no servant.  He is sent by His own judgment, for "the
Spirit blows where He wills" (Jn. 3:8), and He is said to be "sent" only on
account of the Father's identity as origin.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn80" name="_ednref80"
>[80]</a>
We sometimes find [Scripture saying] that the Holy Spirit is sent by the
Father, sometimes by the Son; but the Greeks do violence to this truth [<i>in
hoc faciunt uim</i>], for they say that the Holy Spirit proceeds only from the
Father, not from the Son, and in saying this they proceed in a simplistic manner
[<i>ruditer</i>].<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn81" name="_ednref81" >[81]</a>
Where the Son speaks of the sending of the Holy Spirit, he adjoins the Son to
the Father or the Father to the Son, for our Lord speaks in one place of "the
Comforter, whom the Father will send in my name" (Jn. 14:26), and in another
place He says: "When the Comforter comes, whom I will send to you from the
Father" (Jn. 15:26).  "From the Father" indicates, therefore, authority of
origin.
<p>Again, the Holy Spirit is sent
without separation, because the Spirit of unity excludes separation.  Hence the
Apostle urges: "Take good care to preserve the unity of the Spirit in the bond of
peace" (Eph. 4:3).  The Holy Spirit gathers together [<i>congregat</i>], as we
are taught in John's Gospel [when Jesus prays to the Father]: "That they may be
one in us," through the unity of the Holy Spirit, "as we also are one" (Jn. 17:21-22).  This union is begun in the present through grace, and will be consummated in
the future through glory, to which may He lead us, who together with the Father
and the Son lives and reigns, one God, for ever and ever.  Amen.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn82" name="_ednref82" >[82]</a>
<p align=center><b>Evening Collation</b><a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn83" name="_ednref83">[83]</a>
<p>"Send forth Thy Spirit and they shall be created, and
Thou shalt renew the face of the earth."  This morning we spoke some words, as
well as we were able to do,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn84" name="_ednref84" >[84]</a>
about what is proper to the Holy Spirit, and about His sending.  Now it remains
for us to speak about the effects of the Holy Spirit, and to whom it belongs to
receive those effects.
<p><b>3. The effects of the Holy Spirit</b>
<p>Regarding what is set forth in the
words of the Psalmist, we are given to understand a twofold effect of the Holy
Spirit, namely, creation and renewal: "they shall be created, and Thou shalt
renew the face of the earth."  If we wish to take these words according as
"creation" suggests the production-into-being of the things of nature, the Holy
Spirit is in this way the Creator of all things, as Judith says: "Thou didst
send forth Thy Spirit, and they were created" (Jud. 16:17).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn85"
name="_ednref85" >[85]</a>
But let us now speak of a different creation.  As common usage has it, those
who are promoted to a higher state, such as the episcopacy or another dignity,
are said to be "created."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn86" name="_ednref86" >[86]</a>
In this way all those who are promoted to be sons of God are said to be
created, as if to say, promoted.  Hence blessed James says: "[Of his own will
he brought us forth by the word of truth] that we might be the beginning of His
creation" (Jas. 1:18).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn87" name="_ednref87" >[87]</a>
The Lord wished to establish a new creature, and so in the Book of Wisdom we
read: "God created all things that they might exist" (Wis. 1:14)&#8212;namely, in their natural existence; and He willed to <i>re-</i>create them, in order that they
might exist in the existence of grace.  The Apostles were the first fruits of
this re-creation.  This re-creation is spoken of in Galatians: "In Christ Jesus
neither circumcision nor uncircumcision is of any avail, but a <i>new creature</i>"
(Gal. 6:15).  What does this mean?  Before, there were pagans [<i>gentiles</i>],
and referring to this Paul says "uncircumcision"; after, there were circumcised
Jews, yet this condition availed nothing unless they were re-created through
the grace of Christ.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn88" name="_ednref88" >[88]</a>
This creation is the effect of the Holy Spirit.
<p>You should know that this re-creation
is made up of steps.  It can be looked at, first of all, with respect to the
grace of charity; secondly, the wisdom of knowledge; thirdly, the harmony of
peace; and fourthly, the constancy of firmness.
<p>Just as you see that when men are
brought into natural existence the first thing they obtain is life, so it ought
to be the same with the existence of grace.  But through what does a man live
in the existence of grace?  Surely through charity.  "We know that we have been
carried over from death into life because we love the brethren" (1 Jn. 3:14).  Whoever does not love his brother, regardless of whatever sort of good work he may
do, is dead.  Charity is the life of the soul, for just as a body lives through
its soul, so the soul lives through God, and God dwells in us through charity.
"He who abides in charity abides in God, and God abides in him" (1 Jn. 4:16).  In today's Gospel we heard: "If a man loves me, he will keep my word, and my
Father will love him, and we will come to him and make our home with him" (Jn. 14:23).  But the man who does not do the will of God does not perfectly love Him, for "it
belongs to friends to will and not will the same thing."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn89"
name="_ednref89" >[89]</a>
In the homily of today's office, Gregory says: "Love's proof is in love's
work."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn90" name="_ednref90" >[90]</a>
But you say: we just aren't able to fulfill the commands of God.  I say: you
aren't able to fulfill them <i>by your own powers, </i>but through the grace of
God you certainly can do so!  Hence the Evangelist adds: "My Father will love
him"&#8212;God shall not fail a man&#8212;"and we will come to him," that is, we will be
present to him (Jn. 14:23).  By that presence [of God in our hearts], we
[Christians] <i>will</i> be able to dedicate our powers to fulfilling God's
commands.  Concerning this charity for fulfilling God's commands, we read in
Ephesians: "we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus in good works"
(Eph. 2:10).  Where does this charity in us come from?  The Holy Spirit.  "The
charity of God is poured into our hearts by the Holy Spirit who is given to us"
(Rom. 5:5).  He who has a share of daylight has that light from the sun; in the
same way he who has charity has it from the Holy Spirit.  Therefore: "Send
forth Thy Spirit, and they shall be created"&#8212;namely, in the being of the life
of grace, through charity.
<p>You see that men, when they become
true lovers, make efforts to know the will of God.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn91"
name="_ednref91" >[91]</a>
"It belongs to friends to have one heart," as it says in Proverbs,<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn92" name="_ednref92" >[92]</a>
and God reveals His secrets to His friends.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn93" name="_ednref93"
>[93]</a>
And this is the second step of the creation which is from the Holy Spirit: that
they [who are re-created] may know God in wisdom.  "But I have called you
friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you"
(Jn. 15:15).  Hence, recognition of truth is also from the Holy Spirit.  In
today's Gospel: "The Counselor, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in
my name, he will teach you all things, and bring to your remembrance all that I
have said to you" (Jn. 14:26).  Now, however much a man may be taught
exteriorly, it will profit him nothing unless the grace of the Holy Spirit is
interiorly present.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn94" name="_ednref94" >[94]</a>
As the Gospel says, "The anointing will teach you concerning all things."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn95" name="_ednref95" >[95]</a>
And He not only teaches the truth, but will even call it back to mind.  [It is
as if our Lord were saying:] "I myself am able to teach you, but you do not by
this fact believe or want to fulfill what I teach.  But He who brings it about
that you believe and that you fulfill what you hear, <i>He </i>will call things
back to mind."  The Holy Spirit does this because he inclines the heart to give
assent and to carry out what it hears.  Hence our Lord says: "Everyone who has
heard and learned from my Father comes to me" (Jn. 6:45).<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn96" name="_ednref96" >[96]</a>
<p>The third step of creation has to do
with concord of peace.  St. James distinguishes between earthly and heavenly
wisdom, and taking up what is proper to heavenly wisdom he says: "The wisdom
which is from above is first of all chaste, then peaceable, modest, easy to be
persuaded, consenting to
the good, full of mercy and good fruits, without judging, without dissimulation"
(Jas. 3:17).  But
earthly wisdom is unchaste because it causes the affection to be corrupted by
the love of earthly things.  Hence we read in one of the canonical epistles [<i>in
Canonica</i>]: "Whatever they know of these things, by these things they are corrupted"
(Jude 10).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn97" name="_ednref97" >[97]</a>
Again, earthly wisdom makes men peevish and quarrelsome, but the wisdom which
is from above draws one to God, for it is "peaceable, modest, persuadable."
Quarrels arise from three things.  First, when someone is not modest.  As it
says in Proverbs: "He who thrusts himself forward and makes himself big incites
quarrels" (Prov. 28:25).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn98" name="_ednref98" >[98]</a>
Again, some men are stubborn in their opinion, nor do they allow themselves to
be persuaded of anything but what they have in their own head; heavenly wisdom,
on the contrary, is "persuadable."  Again, worldly wisdom does not allow its
wise men to come to an agreement with another, but heavenly wisdom brings about
agreement among good men, and is therefore "peaceable."  But who is it that
makes the peace?  The Holy Spirit, for "he is not a God of dissension but of
peace" (1 Cor. 14:33).  Hence it says in Ephesians: "Take good care to preserve
the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace" (Eph. 4:3).  The Lord exhorts us
to preserve this peace when He says: "Peace I leave with you, my peace I give
unto you; not as the world giveth do I give unto you" (Jn. 14:27).  This peace is twofold.  One is in the present&#8212;the peace in which we now live, yet in such a
way that we must still fight off vices; such is the peace the Lord "left with
us" right now.  The other is the peace that shall be in the future, without
fighting; and about this the Lord says: "not as the world giveth do I give unto
you."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn99" name="_ednref99" >[99]</a>
Now, some want peace only to be able to enjoy good things [more easily].<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn100" name="_ednref100" >[100]</a>
The Book of Wisdom says about this: "Living in a great war of ignorance, they
judged so many and so great evils to be peace" (Wis. 14:22).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn101" name="_ednref101" >[101]</a>
But what is true peace?  Augustine says that peace is "security of mind, tranquility
of soul, simplicity of heart, the bond of love, and the fellowship of charity."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn102" name="_ednref102" >[102]</a>
Peace has a threefold object: oneself, one's neighbor, and God.  Peace is
needed with regard to oneself, so that reason may not be infected by errors or
darkened by passions, and concerning this, Augustine says that peace is
"security of mind."  There should also be tranquility in affection, and
concerning this he says "tranquility of soul."  Again, there should be
simplicity in intention, and concerning this he says "simplicity of heart."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn103" name="_ednref103" >[103]</a>
Peace toward one's neighbor is the "bond of love," and peace with God is the
"fellowship of charity."  Is not peace then utterly necessary for us?  Surely
it is.  The Lord made His testament for the sake of peace, and those who do not
want to keep the testament cannot receive the inheritance; thus those who do
not want to keep peace cannot arrive at the heavenly inheritance.  But what if
someone were to say: "I want to have peace with God, but not with my
neighbor"?  The answer: such a thing is impossible.  Hence a certain saint
says: "No one can have peace with Christ who is out of harmony with a Christian."<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn104" name="_ednref104" >[104]</a>
Therefore, the third step of creation is the harmony of peace, and so the
prophet Isaiah declares: "I have created the fruit of the lips, peace" (Is.
57:19).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn105" name="_ednref105" >[105]</a>
<p>The fourth step is constancy of
firmness, and this too is from the Holy Spirit.  Hence the Apostle says to the
Ephesians: "according to the riches of His glory, may He grant you to be
strengthened with inner might through His Spirit in the inner man" (Eph. 3:16).  And in Ezekiel: "The Spirit entered into me and I stood upon my feet" (Ezek.
2:2).  And in the Gospel: "Let not your heart be troubled, nor let it be
afraid" (Jn. 14:27).  And in the Book of Wisdom: "God created man incorruptible"
(Wis. 2:25).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn106" name="_ednref106" >[106]</a>
<p>Therefore, the first effect of the
Holy Spirit is that He creates.
<p>The second effect is a renewal which
consists of four things: grace that cleanses, justice that is ever making
progress, wisdom that illuminates, and glory that attains consummation.
<p>I say that the effect of renewal
through the Holy Spirit consists, first of all, of the grace that cleanses.
Sin is a sort of old age of the soul, and a man is only freed from this old age
through justifying grace, by which he is cleansed from sin.  Hence the Apostle
writes: "As Christ has risen from the dead, so also let us walk in newness of
life" (Rom. 6:4).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn107" name="_ednref107" >[107]</a>
Where does this newness come from?  The Holy Spirit.  So the same Apostle
writes to Titus: "He saved us, not because of deeds done by us in
righteousness, but in virtue of His own mercy, by the laver of regeneration and
renewal in the Holy Spirit" (Tit. 3:5).  All sins are forgiven through that
laver, and in this way man is renewed.
<p>Secondly, this renewal consists in the justice that
is ever making progress.  If one should walk, grow tired, and become weak, and
then he rests, his powers seem to him to be renewed; and when a man works
diligently,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn108" name="_ednref108">[108]</a>
he is renewed when he gains further power for working.  About this renewal Job
says: "My glory shall be renewed, and the bow in my hand shall be repaired"
(Job 29:20).  The glory of the saints is the testimony of conscience.  A man is
renewed when he is quick to fight against vices.  Isaiah describes it: "They
shall take wings as eagles, they shall fly and not fail" (Is. 40:31),<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn109" name="_ednref109" >[109]</a>
namely, for running in the way of God's commandments (Ps. 118:32).<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn110" name="_ednref110" >[110]</a>
But who causes this running?  The Holy Spirit.  "He led us out through the
deep, as a horse in the wilderness that does not stumble, and the Spirit of the
Lord was his leader" (Is. 63:13-14).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn111" name="_ednref111">[111]</a>
<p>Thirdly, renewal comes about through
the wisdom that illuminates.  When a man comes to new knowledge of more of the
good things of God, he is renewed.  About this renewal it says in Colossians:
"Put on the new man who is created according to God."<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn112"
name="_ednref112" >[112]</a>
The "new man" [<i>nouus homo</i>] indicates Christ, because His was a novel [<i>noua</i>]
kind of conception,<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn113" name="_ednref113" >[113]</a>
"not from the seed of man, but from the Holy Spirit"<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn114"
name="_ednref114" >[114]</a>;
a novel kind of birth, because His mother remained a virgin after birth; a
novel kind of suffering [<i>passio</i>], because it was without guilt<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn115" name="_ednref115" >[115]</a>;
a novel kind of rising from the dead [<i>resurrectio</i>], because it was quick
and renewing, for He rose quickly and in glory<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn116"
name="_ednref116" >[116]</a>;
a novel kind of ascension, because he ascended by His own power, not by that of
another, as did Enoch and Elijah.<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn117" name="_ednref117" >[117]</a>
And so it is said in Ecclesiasticus: "Show signs anew and work wonders" (Sir.
36:6).  And because all things are renewed through Christ, therefore on solemnities
we use new vestments in church, that we may "sing to the Lord a new song"<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn118" name="_ednref118" >[118]</a>&#8212;as
though to signify that he who is renewed by the exterior cleanness of his
clothing is renewed interiorly in his mind by grace.  By "stripping off the old
man," i.e., the habit of sins with its deeds, "and putting on" the habit of
virtue which is not lacking in [good] deeds, "the new man," i.e., the rational
mind, will be renewed "in the knowledge of God" (Col. 3:9-10).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn119"
name="_ednref119" >[119]</a>
As Romans has it, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ" (Rom. 13:14).  And from whom does that wisdom come?  The Holy Spirit, as Job testifies: "As I see, there is
a spirit in men, and the inspiration of the Almighty gives understanding.
[They that are aged are not the wise men, neither do the ancients understand
judgment]" (Job 32:8-9).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn120" name="_ednref120" >[120]</a>
<p>Fourthly, renewal comes about through
the glory that attains consummation, when the body is renewed, the oldness of
punishment and guilt being taken away.  We read about this in the prophet
Isaiah: "Behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; [and the former things
shall not be remembered or come into mind]" (Is. 65:17).  And where does this
renewal come from?  The Holy Spirit.  He is the pledge of our inheritance, and
it is He who leads us into the heavenly inheritance.  He who needs to be created
and renewed shall obtain this from the Holy Spirit.
<p><B>4. The recipient of these effects</B>
<p>But who receives that renewal?  "The
face of the earth": that is, the whole world, which at one time was filled with
idolatry.  Today, the Lord gave to the Apostles the gifts of the charisms.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn121" name="_ednref121" >[121]</a>
It was of them that the prophet Isaiah said: "They who enter with force,"
namely, the force of the Holy Spirit, "from Jacob shall fill the face of the
earth with seed" (Is. 27:6).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn122" name="_ednref122" >[122]</a>
And "face of the earth" refers to the human mind, for just as it is through the
face that we see in a bodily manner, so it is through the mind that we see in a
spiritual manner, as it says in Genesis: "God created man from the slime of the
earth and breathed into his face the breath of life" (Gen. 2:7).  But in order that
the human mind may receive that renewal, it should have four things: it should
be clean, uncovered, directed, and stable and firm.
<p>Of the first, we read in Matthew:
"But you, when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face" (Mt. 6:17), namely, with tears of compunction, and then you will be able to receive the renewal
of the Holy Spirit.  "Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right
spirit within me" (Ps. 50:12).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn123" name="_ednref123" >[123]</a>
<p>Secondly,
the face of the mind should be open and uncovered.  The prophet says: "His face
is covered with fatness" (Job 15:27).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn124" name="_ednref124"
>[124]</a>
Some have the face of their mind covered over with the darkness of ignorance.
[Job, on the contrary, asserts:] "Darkness has not covered my face" (Job 23:17).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn125" name="_ednref125" >[125]</a>
And the Apostle: "But we all beholding the glory of the Lord with open face,"
namely, a face not covered over by affection for earthly things, "are transformed
into the same image from glory to glory as by the Spirit of the Lord" (2 Cor.
3:18).
<p>Thirdly,
the face of the mind should be directed toward God, as we read in the prayer:
"Now I turn my face toward Thee, and direct my eyes toward Thee" (Tob. 3:14).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn126" name="_ednref126" >[126]</a>
How do we turn our face toward God?  By a right intention; it is thus that we
obtain the renewal of the Holy Spirit.  Hence it says in the Gospel of Luke:
"He will give the good Spirit to those who ask him" (Lk. 11:13).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn127" name="_ednref127" >[127]</a>
Again, if you are turned [to God] through obedience, He will give the Holy
Spirit to those who obey Him.  Likewise, we should also turn our face toward
our neighbor, as Tobit says to his son: "Do not turn your face away from any
poor man, and the face of God will not be turned away from you" (Tob. 4:7).
Hence the Apostles received the Holy Spirit when they were <i>together</i>
(Acts 2:1-4).<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn128" name="_ednref128" >[128]</a>
<p>Fourthly,
the face of the mind should be firm.  It is written of Anna, mother of Samuel,
"her countenance was no more changed in various ways" (1 Sam. 1:18),<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn129" name="_ednref129" >[129]</a>
and for this reason she received the Holy Spirit.  And the book of Job says:
"Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure,
and will not fear" (Job 11:15).  The Holy Spirit is given to persons like
these.  That is why it says in the Gospel: "And eating together with them, he
charged them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the
Father, which, he said, 'you heard from me, for John baptized with water, but
before many days you shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'"<a href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn130"
name="_ednref130" >[130]</a>
But if they had gone away [from Jerusalem], they would not have received the
Holy Spirit.  "He who perseveres shall be saved" (Mt. 10:22; 24:13).  In our prayers today, we shall ask the Lord to grant us this grace of perseverance.<a
href="Serm11Emitte.htm#_edn131" name="_ednref131" >[131]</a>
Amen.

P. Kwasniewski and J. Holmes collaborated in making the translation; the former
wrote the introduction and notes.  Thanks are due to Randall Smith for his
comments on an earlier draft.  Two different orthographies for medieval Latin
have been widely employed in printed editions.&nbsp; This article follows the

Signs of a renewed appreciation in our own time can be discerned in the flood
of recent publications.  Examples include Michael Waldstein, "On Scripture in
the <i>Summa theologiae</i>," <i>Aquinas Review </i>1 (1994): 73-94;

of Thomas that he readily connects Christ and other biblical personages with
the theme of preaching as an exemplary spiritual work of mercy.  See Torrell,

d'Aquin" and "Jean-Baptiste figure du pr&ecirc;cheur chez Thomas d'Aquin," in idem, <i>Recherches

Several scholars in recent decades have advanced our knowledge of Thomas as a
preacher.  An overview of the subject is given in Torrell's <i>Person and Work </i>(69-74),
and in the same author's "La pratique pastorale d'un th&eacute;ologien du XIII<sup>e </sup>si&egrave;cle,

A large number of sermons and sermon notes were once attributed to Aquinas and
published in <i>opera omnia </i>editions, but these have long been known to be
spurious; famous authors tend to act as magnets for the attribution of such
works.  For a list of the sermons that <i>can </i>be confidently attributed to
Thomas, see Torrell, <i>Person and Work, </i>357-59; for a more detailed
discussion, see Bataillon, "Les sermons attribu&eacute;s &agrave; saint Thomas: Questions
d'authenticit&eacute;" in <i>Thomas von Aquin, </i>ed. Albert Zimmermann, Miscellanea
Mediaevalia 19 (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1988), 325-41.  The best current
text of fourteen of the university sermons may be found in <i>Sancti Thomae Aquinatis
Opera omnia ut sunt in Indice Thomistico, </i>ed. Roberto Busa, sj (Stuttgart: Frommann-Holzboog,
1980), vol. 6, pp. 33-48.  Of the five sermons listed in Torrell (<i>Person and
Work, </i>358-59) but not found in Busa's edition, one has been published by
Bataillon: "Le sermon in&eacute;dit de saint Thomas <i>Homo quidam fecit cenam magnam.
</i>Introduction et &eacute;dition," <i>RSPT </i>67 (1983): 353-68; the other four
have been edited by Bataillon, but not yet published.  Finally, there are two
additional sermons <i>not </i>listed in Torrell (ibid.), which are likely to be
included in the Leonine edition: their incipits are <i>Inueni Dauid </i>and <i>Petite
et accipietis.</i>

Fewer still of the individual "university sermons" have been translated into
English.  One may hope that this situation will soon change.  Meanwhile, apart
from the sermon presented in this article (<i>Emitte Spiritum</i>), two
nicely-translated sermons-one in honor of St. Martin (<i>Beatus uir</i>), the
other in honor of the Solemnity of All Saints (<i>Beata gens</i>)-are available
in a somewhat obscure collection: <i>Thomas Aquinas, Selected Writings, </i>ed.
M. C. D'Arcy, in the Everyman's Library series (London: J. M. Dent; New York:
E. P. Dutton, 1939), 1-23.  The third sermon contained in this collection is
the florid Corpus Christi address <i>Hodiernae festivitatis</i>, which is now
known to be spurious but makes for enjoyable reading nonetheless, followed by
the Office for Corpus Christi, which is almost certainly authentic (the
translation of this Office is found on pp. 30-50).  A translation by Athanasius
Sulavik of Thomas's sermon in honor of St. Nicholas, <em>Inueni Dauid, </em>accompanied
by my study "A Tale of Two Wonderworkers: St. Nicholas of Myra in the Writings and
Life of St. Thomas Aquinas,"&nbsp;is published in <em>Angelicum </em>82 (2005):
19-53.&nbsp; The "conferences" or sets of sermons have fared better in terms of
translations; see note 13.

Most biographers of St. Thomas have believed that his sermons on the Apostles'
Creed and on the Ten Commandments were also given during this Lent, but the
evidence for this view is slim; in reality, we know too little to give a
definite place and date for any of these thematic sets.  See Torrell, <i>Person
and Work, </i>72, 266, and 358.  Mandonnet is the spokesman for the older
position: "Le Car&ecirc;me de saint Thomas d'Aquin &agrave; Naples (1273)," in <i>San Tommaso
d'Aquino O.P., Miscellanea storico-artistica </i>(Rome, 1924), 195-212.

That they are intellectually nourishing, and not lightweight advertisements for
the "serious theology" of the dogmatic treatises, can be seen from a recent
study devoted to plumbing the depths of a single homily from the series on the
Apostles' Creed: Herwi Rikhof, "Thomas on the Church: Reflections on a Sermon,"
in Weinandy et al., <i>Aquinas on Doctrine, </i>199-224.

All the eyewitness accounts of Thomas, as of his spiritual father, Dominic,
speak frequently of profuse tears-in the case of the theologian, while he was offering
of Holy Mass; in the case of the founder, usually while he was praying for
sinners or preaching to the people.

This translation is based on the provisional critical edition of the Leonine
Commission; thanks are due to Fr. Bataillon for generously providing us with a
text to work from, as well as a list of <i>fontes </i>that supplied us with
citations from Scripture and other sources.  Scripture verses are translated exactly
as Thomas quotes them from memory, and the numbering of chapter and verse is
that of the Vulgate.  Where the RSV translation is importantly different, this
will be noted for the sake of comparison.  As is customary in medieval works,
throughout the sermon Scriptural verses are announced by author or book title,
seldom with any further specification, e.g.: "The Holy Spirit, as the origin of

Here Thomas is using the technical term <i>proprietas, </i>the "property" of
the divine Person, which refers to "what is proper to" the divine Person: that
which belongs to the Father as Father, the Son as Son, the Spirit as Spirit.
In the following sentences <i>proprietas </i>will at times be rendered "what is
proper to."  The term appears in the Preface of the Most Holy Trinity: "So that
in confessing the true and everlasting Godhead, we shall adore distinction in
persons, oneness in being, and equality in majesty" (<i>in personis proprietas,
et in essentia unitas, et in maiestate adoretur aequalitas</i>).  Cf. <i>Summa
theologiae </i>[<i>ST</i>]<i> </i>I, q. 32, a. 2, corp.: "Therefore the divine
essence is signified in the manner of 'what', and the 'person' in the manner of
'who', and the 'property' in the manner of 'that whereby' [the person is that
person and not another]" (<i>essentia significatur in divinis ut quid, persona
vero ut quis, proprietas autem ut quo</i>).

As usual, St. Thomas prefaces the main body of the text with an outline of the
content, announcing that there will be four parts.  The first two are taken up
in the <i>sermo, </i>the last two in the <i>collatio.  </i>We have numbered
them with bold-faced Arabic numbers.  As is very common in his works, Thomas
patterns his treatment after the four Aristotelian causes (agent, form, end,
and matter).  Here, he speaks first of who the Spirit is formally, then of the
purpose of His activity, then of His efficacy, and finally of the "matter" on
which He works-namely, the Christian faithful.

<i>Subtilitas </i>has a somewhat different meaning from that of its modern-day
transliteration, "subtlety," so I have written "subtleness."  <i>Subtilitas </i>indicates
an acuteness and a penetrativeness arising from lack of density, a certain
fineness or delicacy of nature or operation.  This is the reason why the
medievals refer to fire as subtle: it seems to lack bodily density and can "get
into" things, can penetrate into other substances and divide them.

Thomas simply writes: <i>propter occultam eius originem</i> (and in the next
sentence, <i>proprietas Spiritus sancti est occulta eius origo</i>).  Although
Aquinas does not expressly say so, the ensuing argument seems to depend <i>not </i>on
the Spirit himself having a hidden origin within the Godhead, but rather, on
all created things having <i>their </i>cause in an origin that is <i>hidden</i>
from view, the Spirit.  This is why faith and reason must <i>lead </i>us to
discover this cause, for it is not self-evident.  Hence, I have construed these
phrases to be speaking of the hidden origin <i>of things </i>and of their
motions.

In this line, "debased" translates <i>contrahit immundiciam</i>, for it does
not seem idiomatic in English to speak of silver "contracting uncleanness."
"Impure metal": <i>rei impure.</i>  The thought Thomas is expressing here has
to be understood with an implicit qualification: it is an <i>inordinate </i>or <i>disordered
</i>love of bodily things that is unclean and makes a person unclean.  If
bodily goods are so loved, they crowd out spiritual goods and debase the soul,
which was made for better things than mere bodies.  When such goods are rightly
loved, on the other hand, they enrich the soul's goodness by offering exercise
to moral virtue.  No one is more sensitive to the dangers of a dualistic
rejection of the goodness of bodily creatures than Aquinas, a fierce opponent
of medieval Manichaeism.

In the scriptural context, where the subject is wisdom personified, the verse
reads: "While remaining in herself, she renews all things."  In the sermon,
however, because the verse is applied directly to God, and the Latin gender is

"sound" masculine.  Hence the translation.  Two lines later, where Thomas

cor et unam animam; sicut dicitur Eth. 9, cap. 10: "Proprium amicorum est, unam animam in duobus corporibus

"Secrets" translates <i>secreta.  </i>Cf. <i>Summa contra gentiles </i>IV, cap.
21, et seq.  In Aquinas's <i>Commentary on John </i>15:15<i> </i>we read: "For the true sign of friendship is that a friend reveals the secrets of his
heart to his friend.  Since it belongs to friends to have one heart and one
soul, what one friend reveals to another does not seem to be placed outside his
own heart. . . .  Now God, reveals his secrets to us by making us sharers in
his wisdom" ("Verum enim amicitiae signum est quod amicus amico suo cordis
secreta revelet.  Cum enim amicorum sit cor unum et anima una, non videtur
amicus extra cor suum ponere quod amico revelat. . . .  Deus autem faciendo nos
participes suae sapientiae, sua secreta nobis revelat").

Here Thomas is borrowing ideas from Augustine, <i>Tract. in Ioan. </i>77,3
(CCSL 36:521.5-7; PL 35:1834), whom he had quoted to the same effect in the <i>Catena
aurea </i>on Jn. 14:27-a good example of how the preacher made use of his
academic "dossiers" to enrich his preaching.  On this topic, see Bataillon's
article "Les sermons de saint Thomas et la <i>Catena aurea</i>" in <i>St.
Thomas Aquinas 1274-1974, Commemorative Studies, </i>ed. Armand A. Maurer et
al. (Toronto: PIMS, 1974), 1:67-75.  All the allusions to Augustine in this part

On the theme of old age, <i>vetustas</i>, as an image of sinfulness, see John
Saward, <i>Cradle of Redeeming Love </i>(San Francisco: Ignatius Press, 2002),
259-64.  "The metaphor of oldness is neither an insult to the elderly nor a
license for the young.  The newness that Christ brings, first for the soul and
later [in the resurrection] for the body, is supernatural.  When old Simeon
takes the Infant Messiah into his arms, and the age prophetess speaks of Him
'to all that look for the redemption of Israel' (cf. Lk. 2:28ff.), they prove
themselves to be among the first recipients of the rejuvenating grace of
Christ. .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;Simeon and Anna have an eagle-like youthfulness of
soul that puts to shame the spiritual decrepitude of those chronologically
younger people, such as Herod, who lack the saints' perfection of childlike
hope in the Child-God" (ibid., 264).

A direct reference to Ps. 118:32, "I will run in the way of thy commandments
when thou enlargest my understanding" (Ps. 119:32, RSV); but very likely also a
recollection of some famous lines in the Rule of St. Benedict, which Thomas
would have heard read aloud during his boyhood years at Montecassino.  Near the
close of the Rule's Prologue, we read: "And so we are going to establish a
school for the service of the Lord.  In founding it we hope to introduce
nothing harsh or burdensome.  But if a certain strictness results from the
dictates of equity for the amendment of vices or the preservation of charity,
do not be at once dismayed and fly from the way of salvation, whose entrance
cannot but be narrow.  For as we advance in the religious life and in faith,
our hearts expand and we run in the way of God's commandments with unspeakable
sweetness of love" (trans. Leonard J. Doyle [Collegeville, Minn.: The
Liturgical Press, 1948, repr. 2001]).

Aquinas cites the Vulgate text accurately, but omits the phrase <i>quasi animal
in campo descendens, </i>which follows <i>quasi equum in deserto non
impingentem.  </i>A modern translation reads rather differently: "Who led them
through the depths?  Like a horse in the desert, they did not stumble.  Like
cattle that go down into the valley, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest.  So
Thou didst lead Thy people, to make for Thyself a glorious name" (RSV).

It is hard to bring out in English the play on words in this passage.  Thomas
is saying that Christ is fittingly called a new man, <i>nouus homo, </i>because
everything about Him was new-both in the sense of novel, never before seen, and
in the sense of newborn, fresh in vigor, untarnished by age.  The main accent
in the sentence is the "novelty" of the kind of conception, birth, etc. we see
in Christ.  I have added the implicit "kind of" to each phrase, since this is
how we would say it colloquially.

For Aquinas, suffering is always a punishment for wrongdoing-if not for
personal wrongdoing of one's own, then for that of Adam in which one shares as
a member of the human race, or that of someone else to whom one is united.
Hence, we suffer deservedly.  Christ, in contrast, inherited no wrong and did
no wrong; therefore he did not deserve to suffer.  Hence his Passion and death
were "novel" because, unlike ours, they were entirely voluntary and in no way
His "due."

Scripture records many instances of resurrections, but they are always a rising
again to the same mortal life; Lazarus, the widow's son, the daughter of
Jairus, all of these, though raised from the dead, must die again.  But Christ rises
immortal, i.e., to the life of glory or in a glorified state; "death has no
more dominion over him."  The "quick and renewing," <i>cita et innouans, </i>is
referring to the difference between Christ's resurrection to glory, which took
place on the third day after his death, and the bodily resurrection of the
other saints, which will take place at the end of time (the Virgin Mary being
the only known exception).

"[I]t is the spirit in a man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him
understand.  It is not the old that are wise, nor the aged that understand what
is right" (RSV).  Though Thomas cites only part of verse 8, the concluding
"etc."-a ubiquitous medievalism that <i>at least </i>means "the rest of the
verse," but can also mean "the rest of the passage in that vicinity"-draws our
attention to the contrast between God-given wisdom (verse 8) and merely human
wisdom (verse 9) gained by experience or study.

Where Thomas seems to say <i>a Jacob, </i>the Vulgate has <i>ad Jacob.</i>  The
Douay-Rheims version translates: "When they shall rush in unto Jacob, Israel shall blossom and bud, and they shall fill the face of the world with seed."
Cf. RSV: "In days to come Jacob shall take root, Israel shall blossom and put
forth shoots, and fill the whole world with fruit."  It should be noted that
Jerome favored the most literal translation possible from the Hebrew text,
while the RSV (and modern versions in general) tend to be more interpretive.
Whether the Vulgate's reading in a particular case is defensible or faulty is a
question to be settled by exegetes.  When citing Scripture in his sermons,
Thomas tends to avoid basing premises on a detail of the text, relying more on
the general "thrust" of a verse or the "drift" of its surrounding context.  For
this reason, among others, his handling of Scripture remains both timeless and
timely, in a way that is not always true of many of his contemporaries who
favored allegorical interpretations built upon tenuous linguistic associations.

Ps. 51:10 <i>iuxta Hebraeum.  </i>The surrounding verses are also pertinent to
Thomas's point: "Fill me with joy and gladness; let the bones which thou hast

Spirit from me.  Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, and uphold me with a
willing spirit" (vv. 8, 11-12).

In the book of Job, Eliphaz the Temanite, urging Job's guilt, builds up a vivid
description of the justly-punished evildoer: "The wicked man writhes in pain
all his days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless.
Terrifying sounds are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon
him. . . .  Because he has stretched forth his hand against God, and bids
defiance to the Almighty, running stubbornly against him with a thick-bossed
shield; because he has covered his face with his fat, and gathered fat upon his
loins, and has lived in desolate cities, in houses which no man should inhabit,
which were destined to become heaps of ruins; he will not be rich, and his
wealth will not endure, nor will he strike root in the earth; he will not
escape from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and his blossom will be
swept away by the wind" (Job 15, vv. 20-21, 25-30).  By "the prophet" Thomas is
referring to Job, not Eliphaz, whose speech happens to be recorded in the
prophet's book.

nec faciem meam operuit caligo, </i>"For I have not perished because of the
darkness that hangs over me, neither hath the mist covered my face."  Thomas
cites the verse as follows: <i>Non operuit faciem meam caligo, </i>"Darkness
has not covered my face."  The RSV renders the verse not as a negation but as
an affirmation: "I am hemmed in by darkness, and thick darkness covers my
face."  Notes in the RSV indicate manuscript support for either reading.

Thomas sees in the Pentecost event-where the Holy Spirit descends upon the
apostles precisely <i>as gathered together, </i>not as isolated individuals-a
model of the relationship between love and service of God, and the love and
service of neighbor.  The Spirit is given from above to those who are attentive
to the needs of their fellow Christians and fellow men.

The Vulgate (1 Kings 1:18 = 1 Sam. 1:18) reads: <i>Et abiit mulier in viam
suam, et comedit, vultusque illius non sunt amplius in diversa mutati.  </i>The
RSV renders the last phrase "and her countenance was no longer sad."  The point
Thomas seems to be making is that a person who is totally shaken up, tossed
this way and that-due to sadness or any other cause-is not living resolutely by
the Holy Spirit, who makes one endure hardships in a spirit of fortitude.
Hence the verse from Job about lifting up one's face with confidence, being
secure and not being afraid, and the verse about the Apostles <i>waiting </i>as
they were commanded to do,<i> </i>even though it may have been difficult for
them to wait.
