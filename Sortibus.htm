                633. Your love has requested me to write to you about what is to
                be noted about lots. And it is not right that the requests which
                charity confidently extends, should suffer a rebuff among
                friends. And so, in the desire to satisfy your request, I have
                taken the trouble to write what seems me should be written about
                lots, interrupting briefly during the solemn seasons,

                Primo igitur considerandum est, quod rerum quaedam sunt ex

                634. First, of all, there are, it should be noted tat certain
                things exist from necessity, and always exist, such as for God
                to be, for two and three to equal five, for the sun to rise, and
                other things of this type, which either always exist, or always
                come about in some way. In these matters, however, there is no
                place for the lot. Indeed it would seem to be cause for scorn
                for anyone to think that any information concerning the Divine
                existence, or concerning numbers, or about the motions of the
                sun and stars should be sought by means of lots.

                    Alia vero sunt quae naturaliter quidem contingunt et ut
                    frequentius eodem modo proveniunt, quandoque tamen, sed
                    rarius, aliter contingunt, sicut aestatem esse siccam,
                    hiemem vero pluviosam. Contingit tamen interdum, sed rarius,
                    evenire contrarium, ex eo quod solitus naturae cursus ex
                    aliquibus causis impeditur. In neutris autem praedictarum
                    rerum secundum se consideratis locum sors habet. Potest
                    quidem sors locum habere, non tamen secundum quod ipsae res
                    naturales in se considerantur, sed secundum quod earum
                    cursus attingit aliqualiter usum vitae humanae, sicut ab
                    aliquibus sorte inquiri potest, an fluvius inundet et domum
                    vel agrum occupet, an pluvia aestate abundet et fruges in
                    agro corrumpat; sed an abundet pluvia vel fluvius inundet in
                    locis desertis, in quibus hoc ad usum humanae vitae non
                    pertinet, nullus sorte inquirere studet.

                    635. There are other things, however, such as for the
                    summertime to be dry, and the wintertime to be rainy, which
                    certainly take place naturally, and most of the time happen
                    in the same way; sometimes however, occurring otherwise,
                    although more rarely. Yet it does happen occasionally,
                    although more rarely, that the contrary results, because
                    nature's usual course is impeded by some other causes. In
                    neither of the preceding cases, when considered in
                    themselves, is there place for the lot. But if the matters
                    in the second case be considered according as their course
                    in some way affects the exercise of human life, to such a
                    degree some may inquire by lot, as for instance whether a
                    river might overflow and fill both house and field, or
                    whether the rain might be plentiful during he summer. But no
                    one takes pains to inquire by lot whether the rain or a
                    river will overflow in desert places, where they do not
                    pertain to the service of human life.

                        Ex quo patet quod sors proprie in rebus humanis locum
                        habet. Sed quia ad unumquemque hominem pertinet
                        sollicitari de his quae pertinent ad usum propriae vitae
                        et eorum cum quibus quocumque modo communionem habet,
                        consequens est quod nec ad omnes res humanas inquisitio
                        sortis extendatur. Nullus enim in Gallia existens sorte
                        aliquid inquirendum curat de his quae ad Indos
                        pertinent, cum quibus nullatenus in vita communicat. Sed
                        de his consueverunt homines sorte aliquid inquirere quae
                        qualitercumque ad eos pertinent, vel ad sibi coniunctos.

                        630. Hence it is clear that the lot properly has a place
                        in human affairs. But because it pertains to every man
                        to be solicitous about those things which concern the
                        service of his own life and that of those with whom in
                        some way he has a share, it follows that the inquiry of
                        lots is not extended to all human affairs. For no one
                        living perchance in France would bother to make an
                        inquiry about a matter which pertains to the affairs of
                        Indians, whose life he no way shares. But men are
                        accustomed o seek information by lots about those things
                        which in any way whatever pertain to them, or to those
                        connected with them.

                            videntur. Nullus enim sorte inquirit ea quae per
                            suam industriam vel cognoscere, vel ad effectum
                            perducere potest. Derisibile namque videtur, si quis
                            sorte inquirat an comedat, vel fruges ex agro
                            colligat, vel si id quod videt, est homo vel equus.

                            be sought for information in all of these matters.
                            For no one seeks information by lots about a thing
                            which he can either know through his own effort, or
                            whose effect he can produce. It seems ridiculous,
                            moreover, if one should inquire by means of a lot
                            whether he should eat, or gather the crops from the
                            field, or if a thing which he can see is a man or a
                            horse.

                                affairs which in some way pertains to
                                themselves, and which through their own prudence

                service of human life, something is required by means of lot, it
                is necessary that the search for information by lots tend to
                this? that certain things be adjusted to the service of human
                life. But regarding the things which enter into human usage, men
                are anxious first to have them in whatever way they can,
                secondly to use them once they have them, and thirdly to know
                the future results of their use. And because we cannot
                appropriate for our uses things that are of service to our life
                unless they be possessed in some way? Things, however, according
                to their nature are common to all? It was necessary in order
                that men might separately use these, that they be in some way
                divided among men.

                    effected by human endeavor and harmony of wills, then lots
                    are not needed. But when human common sense does not suffice
                    to make this division harmoniously, then men are accustomed
                    to make the division by lot, according to Proverbs, "The lot
                    suppresses contentions."

                        possessions, so also there is one of honors or
                        dignities. Whence, whenever it happens that some are
                        unwilling harmoniously to choose one on whom a dignity
                        should be conferred, they conclude that it should be
                        required that the choice be made by lots. This was
                        observed in the Old Law as well, so that certain
                        individuals entered upon the office of the high priest
                        by lot. Hence it is said in chapter one of Saint Luke's
                        Gospel that Zechariah was chosen by lot to burn the
                        incense. Even Saul was elected king by lot, as is read
                        in the First Book of Kings.

                            distribution of honors happens, so also in the case
                            of the distribution of punishments. So therefore, if
                            it is believed that someone is to be punished, but
                            who is to be punished is unknown, it appears to some
                            that this information ought to be sought by lot. For
                            thus do we read that Jonah was thrown into the sea;
                            also that Joshua by means of lot punished Achor who
                            stole from the anathema, as is read in chapter seven
                            of the Book of Joshua.

                                dignity, or a punishment, and this may be called
                                the <i>distributive lot</i>, because through it
                                is divided that about which it is unknown how it
                                should be divided. Whence also, the word

                                    Sapien. IX, 14: cogitationes mortalium
                                    timidae et incertae providentiae nostrae,

                                    to who should have a thing, so also whether
                                    a thing should be made use of, and whether
                                    it might be altogether expedient to do some
                                    thing. For every action is a use either of
                                    itself or of some other thing. Therefore,
                                    when such a doubt occurs about what ought to
                                    be done, if indeed this doubt can be
                                    resolved through human prudence, we are of
                                    the opinion that one should recur to a human
                                    counsel. But because it is said in the Book
                                    of Wisdom, "The thoughts of mortal men are
                                    fearful, and our counsels uncertain," where
                                    uncertainty cannot be fully met by human
                                    counsel, they should have recourse to a
                                    decision by lots. We read an example of this
                                    in Esther, where it says, "The lot was cast
                                    into an urn on what day and what month the
                                    nation of the Jews should be destroyed." And
                                    because a lot of this type takes the place
                                    of consultation, it may be called the
                                    <i>advisory lot</i>, ordained as it were to
                                    the asking of counsel.

                exquirunt eorum quae humanam excedunt industriam. Quidam enim

                revelaverit secretum suum ad servos suos prophetas. Revelat
                autem interdum vigilantibus per manifestam visionem, interdum
                autem per somnium, secundum illud Num. XII, 6: si quis fuerit
                inter vos propheta domini, in visione apparebo ei, vel per
                somnium loquar ad illum. Huius autem gratiae particulariter
                plerique homines participes effecti, a Deo admonentur in somnis

                erudiens eos instruit disciplinam, ut avertat hominem ab his

                645. It must be understood, however, that some people seek, in
                many ways, a knowledge of things which are beyond human effort.
                Some beseech clear answers either from God, or from the demons.
                Of these the first group pertains to prophetic men, who, joined
                to God by a certain privileged familiarity, merit to be taught
                by Him about future events or about certain other supernatural
                things, according to the Book of Amos, "For the Lord God doth
                nothing without revealing his secrets to his servants the
                prophets." Sometimes, moreover, He gives His revelation to those
                who are awake, through a clear vision; sometimes, however,
                through a dream, according to the Book of Numbers, "If there be
                among you a prophet of the Lord, I will appear to him in a
                vision, or I will speak to him in a dream. Moreover, many
                perfect men having this particular grace have been warned in
                sleep about things pertaining to their welfare, for which reason
                the Book of Job says, "By dreams in a vision by night when deep
                sleep falls upon men, and they are sleeping in their beds: Then
                he opens the ears of men, and teaching instructs them in what
                they are to learn, that he may withdraw a man from the things he
                is doing, and may deliver him from pride."

                        646. But sometimes men seek knowledge of some hidden
                        things, receiving as it were a sign of them from some
                        things which they consider in other things. There are,
                        moreover, various species of this investigation. For
                        some seek knowledge of hidden things, whether relating
                        to future events or to things it is advantageous to do,
                        through a consideration of the heavenly motions, namely,
                        by observing their movements and positions, from which
                        they think they can have knowledge of future and occult
                        things. This pertains to mathematicians or astrologers,
                        who are also called "geneatics" [calculators of
                        nativities] because they take note of the days on which
                        people are born.

                            of some animals, and even men's sneezings. All this

                                of concealed things from some things which are
                                said or done by men under some testimony, which
                                type of inquiry, namely, is properly called
                                omen. We may take an example of this from
                                Valerius Maximus who narrates that when the
                                consul Lucius Paulus had been about to make war
                                with the Persian king, returning from court and
                                finding his daughter sad, he asked the cause of
                                the sadness. She replied, "Persa is dead," for a
                                certain young puppy named Persa had passed away.
                                Paulus therefore seized upon the omen, and
                                conceived in his mind the hope of a brilliant
                                triumph.

                                        knowledge of some hidden things. It also
                                        pertains to this type that by concealing
                                        some sheets of paper in a hidden place,
                                        writing different things on some of them
                                        and on others nothing, there is
                                        discerned what must happen to those
                                        taking the papers, or there is discerned
                                        form tem what ought to be done. Similar
                                        to this also is the hiding of certain
                                        unequal straws, whereby different things
                                        are indicated with reference to those
                                        who choose the larger. It seem also that
                                        sometimes the throwing of dice pertains
                                        to this type, or, if anything else is
                                        done whereby it might be decided how
                                        something is to be divided, or what
                                        ought to be done in order to know
                                        something hidden in the past or in the
                                        future. Whence also duels seem to
                                        pertain to this, except insofar as one
                                        man overcomes another mostly through art
                                        or strength. Also judgments by the
                                        red-hot iron or water or other things of
                                        this sort seem to pertain to this type,
                                        except that in these things there is no
                                        indifferent issue. Whence in these
                                        matters a more express judgment of
                                        divine power is required than in the
                                        other things mentioned above.

                                            to pertain to this third mode of
                                            inquiry, namely, when something is
                                            done that by a consideration of its
                                            outcome something hidden might be
                                            known. Whence lots are said to be
                                            cast, or thrown into the lap, or
                                            something else is added in the
                                            mentioning of lots which pertains to
                                            a human act, according to Proverbs,

                                                human endeavor, through

                654. It is also necessary to consider if the above-mentioned
                search for information by lots is efficacious. In this regard it
                is necessary to take into consideration various opinions about
                the occurrence of human affairs. There have been some who
                thought human affairs were regulated by no higher control, but
                by reason alone, in such a way he whatever happened in human
                affairs beyond human prudence, they believed to be completely
                fortuitous. Therefore, according to their opinion, there can be
                no foreknowledge of future events. For those things which happen
                fortuitously are unknowable. Whence, the divining lot is
                completely done away with. Similarly also, the advisory lot has
                no place, for the usefulness of seeking advice is reckoned from
                future events. Whence if the happenings of the future are
                unknowable, consultation will be in vain. Nevertheless,
                according to them, the distributive lot can have a place, not
                that through it might be discerned what is advantageous in
                dividing things, but so that what cannot be determined by reason
                may at least be left to fortune.

                    But this opinion confines divine providence, which is
                    infinite, within a certain limit. For while they remove from
                    divine providence human affairs in which, however, clear
                    indications of divine rule are for the most part apparent,
                    they also do an injustice to human affairs, which they
                    assert to vacillate without direction. It also removes cult
                    from all religion, and takes from men the fear of God.

                        655. But there have been others who said that all human
                        actions, and their issue, and all human affairs are
                        subject to the necessity of the stars. Whence, because
                        there exists a certain order by which the heavenly
                        bodies are moved, they think that from the consideration
                        of these they can foreknow with certitude future human
                        occurrences, except insofar as men lack experience for
                        this. And because according to their opinion all human
                        actions result by necessity from the stars, it follows
                        that even those human actions which are required for
                        lots, proceed from the disposition of the stars, that
                        this or that thing might result. For example, if a
                        geomancer marks out points in the dust, they claim that
                        his hand is moved according to the power of the heavens
                        to this extent, that such a number of points appears as
                        is in agreement with the heavenly disposition. They say
                        the same thing in other similar matters. Thus they say
                        that the future can be foreknown according to those
                        things which come about from actions of this type
                        inasmuch as they proceed from the power of the heavenly
                        bodies, from which they thought human occurrences to be
                        disposed.

                            depends on a consideration of future events. The
                            distributive lot also has a place, not only to this
                            extent, that the distribution of this is left to the

                            possessed.

                                    have a divining power, namely, inasmuch as
                                    the movements of the phantasms which occur
                                    in dreams proceed from the disposition of
                                    the heavenly bodies.

                                        evident falsity. For it is not possible
                                        that the heavenly bodies make an
                                        impression on anything incorporeal
                                        because any incorporeal thing is more
                                        powerful and more exalted than any body.
                                        The human intellect, however, is neither
                                        a body nor the power of a bodily organ,
                                        as Aristotle proves; otherwise it would
                                        not be able to know the natures of all
                                        bodies, just as they would not be able
                                        to see all colors if the pupil were
                                        tinged by some color.

                                            It is therefore impossible for a
                                            heavenly body to make an impression
                                            on the human intellect. The will,
                                            moreover, is in the intellective
                                            part and is moved by the good
                                            apprehended through the intellect.
                                            Whence, with equal reason, the
                                            heavenly bodies are unable to make
                                            an impression on it. All human acts,
                                            moreover, proceed principally from
                                            the intellect and the will. By an
                                            investigation of the heavenly
                                            bodies, therefore, future human acts
                                            cannot be foreknown for certain, and
                                            much less through an investigation
                                            of any other things which are moved
                                            by them, for example, by the
                                            chattering of birds, by marking off
                                            points, and by the other things
                                            already mentioned. It is clear,
                                            however, that most of the
                                            occurrences in human affairs depend
                                            upon human acts. Whence, the

                                            be foreknown in the ways just
                                            mentioned.

                                                of the sun." We see also the

                                                the lunar waxings and wanings

                His igitur visis, de facili patet utrum sortibus liceat uti. Et
                primo quidem manifestum est quod nulli Christiano licet cum
                Daemonibus aliquod societatis pactum habere. Dicit enim
                apostolus I ad Cor. X, 20: nolo vos socios fieri Daemoniorum: ad
                quam societatem pertinent non solum manifestae Daemonum
                invocationes, quibus nigromantici utuntur, sed etiam quaecumque
                occulta pacta cum Daemonibus inita. Et ideo Augustinus in II de
                doctrina Christiana, praemissis diversis superstitiosis hominum
                observationibus subdit: omnes artes huiusmodi vel nugatoriae vel
                noxiae superstitionis ex quadam pestifera societate hominum et
                Daemonum, quasi pacta infidelis et dolosae amicitiae constituta,
                penitus sunt repudianda et fugienda Christiano. Unde et Deut.
                XVIII, 10-11 dicitur: non inveniatur in te qui lustret filium
                suum aut filiam, ducens per ignem; aut qui ariolos sciscitetur,
                et observet somnia atque auguria; ne sit maleficus neque
                incantator, nec Pythones consulat, neque quaerat a mortuis
                veritatem.

                666. Having seen those things, therefore, it is effortlessly
                clear whether it is permitted to use lots. First of all, it is
                obvious that no Christian is permitted to have any pact of
                association with the demons. For the Apostle in the First
                Epistle to the Corinthians says, "I would not have you become
                associates of the devil," to which association pertain not only
                open invocations of the devil, which necromancers use, but any
                hidden pacts made with demons. Thus Augustine, in the second
                book of Christian Doctrine, having treated of the various
                superstitious observances of men, adds, "All arts of this sort
                are either nullities, or are part of a guilty superstition,
                springing out of a baleful fellowship between men and evils, and
                are to be utterly repudiated and avoided by the Christian as the
                covenants of a false and treacherous friendship." Wherefore,
                also, in Deuteronomy it says, "Neither let there be found among
                you any one that shall expiate his son or daughter, making them
                to pass through the fire; or that consults soothsayers, or
                observes dreams and omens, neither let there be any wizard, nor
                charmer, nor any one that consults pythonic spirits, or fortune
                tellers, or that seeks the truth from the dead."

                    Sed adhuc dubitatio restat, quae sint dicendae
                    superstitiosae inquisitiones sortium, vel quarumcumque
                    divinationum, per quas pacta cum Daemonibus contrahantur.
                    Cuius quidem dubitationis solutio haberi potest ex
                    praemissis Augustini verbis, si subtiliter discutiantur.
                    Dixit enim per artes nugatoriae vel noxiae superstitionis
                    pacta cum Daemonibus fieri. Noxia autem superstitio dicitur
                    quae aliquid manifeste illicitum continet; sicut
                    invocationes et sacrificia Daemonum, vel quaecumque
                    huiusmodi. Nugatorium autem dicitur quando quis utitur re
                    aliqua ad quod virtus eius extendi non potest: hoc enim in
                    vanum fieri videtur. Vana vero nugatoria dicimus: puta si
                    aeger medicinam assumat contra morbum quem potest sanare,
                    non est superstitiosa nugatio: sed si quis collo alliget
                    quaedam quae omnino ad rem non pertinent, etiam secundum
                    sententiam medicorum hoc ad nugatoriam superstitionem
                    pertinere videtur: et simile est, cum vestis a soricibus
                    roditur, plus timere suspicionem mali futuri quam praesens
                    damnum dolere: et multa exempla huiusmodi Augustinus ponit
                    ibidem.

                    667. But a doubt still remains as to what inquiries of lots
                    or of any other divinations trough which pacts are
                    contracted with demons should be called superstitious. The
                    solution of this doubt may indeed be had from the previous
                    words of Augustine, if they be precisely examined. For he
                    states that pacts with demons come about through the arts of
                    nullities or of guilty superstitions. That is called a
                    guilty superstition which clearly contains something
                    unlawful, such as invocations of and sacrifices to demons or
                    anything else of the sort. A thing is called a nullity, on
                    the other hand, when someone uses some particular thing for
                    a purpose for which the power of the thing cannot be
                    extended. In fact, this seems to come about in vain.
                    Therefore, we call nullities vain. For example, if a sick
                    man took medicine for a disease which it can cure, this is
                    not a superstitious nullity. But if someone were to bind to
                    the neck some things which pertain in no way to health, this
                    would seem to have reference to a superstitious nullity,
                    even according to the opinion of doctors. Similarly, when
                    clothes have been gnawed into by mice, to fear more the
                    possibility of future evil than to lament the present
                    damage. And in the same place Augustine sets down many other
                    examples of this type.

                        Ad quae autem virtus sortium se possit extendere, haberi
                        potest ex praemissis. Ostensum est enim quod caelestium

                        responsurus: unde talis consultatio ad societatem
                        Daemonum pertinet, qui inordinatis hominum motibus se

                        668. To what things the power of lots can extend is
                        reckoned from what has been said. For it has been shown
                        that the power of the heavenly bodies extends itself to
                        corporeal effects, but not to change the free will of
                        man. Whence, if someone consults an astrologer as to
                        whether a future summer will be dry or rainy, it is not
                        a nugatory consultation, as it would be if someone
                        should consult as to whether in digging a grave he would
                        come upon a treasure, or what another might answer to
                        his question. Whence such a consideration pertains to
                        the company of demons, who involve themselves in the
                        inordinate motions of men.

                            ipsorum, secundum illud Ierem. VIII, 7: milvus in

                            not a nugatory superstition, for animals are moved
                            by a certain natural instinct from an impression of
                            the heavenly bodies, in accordance with the

                                    company of the demons, who sometimes
                                    manifest efficacy in such matters in order
                                    to envelope the souls of men in vanities.
                                    Whence in Psalm 39 it says, "Blessed is the
                                    man whose trust is in the name of the Lord;
                                    and who hath not had regard to vanities, and
                                    lying follies." The sacred canons,
                                    therefore, condemn these lots, which,
                                    provided they come about from harmful and
                                    nugatory superstition, pertain to the
                                    company of the demons.

                                        same Psalm that the name of the Lord be
                                        his trust, and consequently if through
                                        the casting of lots someone seeks the
                                        divine judgment, it is not in itself a
                                        sin. For Augustine, concerning Psalm 30,
                                        "My lots are in thy hands," says, "The
                                        lot is no evil thing, but it is an
                                        event, in human doubt, indicating the

                                            lots of this type. In one way, if
                                            someone should think that there
                                            should be recourse to lots without
                                            any necessity, for this seems to
                                            test God, if someone having from
                                            human industry what he should do,
                                            and having omitted it, thinks divine
                                            judgment is to be sought. For it
                                            says in Second Paralipomenon, "But
                                            as we know not what to do, we can
