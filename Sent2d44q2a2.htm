          1. Matthew 17:25 says: "Therefore the sons are free." If then in any
          kingdom the sons of its king are free, then the sons of the king to
          whom all kingdoms are subject ought to be free in any kingdom. But
          Christians have been made sons of God —Romans 8:16: "The Spirit bears
          testimony to our spirit that we are sons of God." Therefore they are
          free everywhere, and are not held to obey secular powers.

          frees from observance of the old law. But by baptism a man comes under
          obligation to God, which is a greater bond that that of man to man by
          slavery. Therefore by baptism he is freed from slavery.

          4. It is legitimate for anyone, who can do so, to re-take what has
          been taken away from him unjustly. Now many secular princes unjustly
          usurped the dominion of Christian lands. Since, therefore, in such
          cases rebellion is legitimate, Christians have no obligation to obey
          these princes.

          in the <i>Book on Duties</i> [ <i>De Officiis</i> I, 8, 26] Cicero
          justifies Julius Caesar’s assassins. Although Caesar was a close
          friend of his, yet by usurping the empire he proved himself to be a
          tyrant. Therefore toward such powers there is no obligation of
          obedience.

          Respondeo dicendum, quod sicut dictum est, obedientia respicit in

          temporaliter sed etiam spiritualiter propter conscientiam, ut
          apostolus dicit Roman. 13, secundum quod ordo praelationis a Deo
          descendit, ut apostolus, ibidem, innuit. Et ideo secundum hoc quod a

          <i>Solution and determination.</i>
          Obedience, by keeping a commandment, has for its [formal] object the
          obligation, involved in the commandment, that it be kept. Now this
          obligation originates in that the commanding authority has the power
          to impose an obligation binding not only to external but also to
          internal and spiritual obedience—“for conscience sake”, as the Apostle
          says (Rom. xiii, 5.) For power (authority) comes from God, as the
          Apostle implies in the same place. Hence, Christians are bound to obey
          the authorities inasmuch as they are from God; and they are not bound
          to obey inasmuch as the authority is not from God.

          Now, this not being from God may be the case, first, as to the mode in

        <td>
          Concerning the first case we must again distinguish two defects: There
          may be a defect of the person acquiring authority inasmuch as this
          person is unworthy of it. There may also be a defect in the mode of
          acquiring authority, namely, if it is obtained by violence, or simony,
          or other illegitimate means.

          tenentur subditi.
        </td>
        <td>
          As to the first of these defects, we say that it does not constitute
          an obstacle against acquiring lawful authority. Since, then, as such,
          authority is always from God (and this is what causes the obligation
          of obedience), the subjects are bound to render obedience to these
          authorities, unworthy as they may be.

          Sed secundus defectus impedit jus praelationis: qui enim per
          violentiam dominium surripit non efficitur vere praelatus vel dominus;
          et ideo cum facultas adest, potest aliquis tale dominium repellere:

          subditorum, vel per auctoritatem superioris.
        </td>
        <td>
          As to the second of those defects, we say that in such a case there is
          no lawful authority at all. He who seizes power by violence does not
          become a true holder of power. Hence, when it is possible to do so,
          anybody may repel this domination, unless, of course, the usurper
          should later on have become a true ruler by the consent of the
          subjects or by a recognition being extended to him by a higher
          authority.

          Abusus autem praelationis potest esse dupliciter: vel ex eo quod est

          ut si praecipiat actum peccati contrarium virtuti ad quam inducendam
          et conservandam praelatio ordinatur; et tunc aliquis praelato non
          solum non tenetur obedire, sed etiam tenetur non obedire, sicut et

        <td>
          The abuse of power might take on two forms. First, a commandment
          emanating from the authority might be contrary to the very end in view
          of which authority is instituted, i.e., to be an educator to, and a
          preserver of, virtue. Should therefore the authority command an act of
          sin contrary to virtue, we not only are not obliged to obey but we are
          also obliged not to obey, according to the example of the holy martyrs
          who preferred death to obeying those ungodly tyrants.

          vel quia cogunt ad hoc ad quod ordo praelationis non se extendit; ut
          si dominus exigat tributa quae servus non tenetur dare, vel aliquid

          obedire.
        </td>
        <td>
          The second form of abusing power is for the authority to go beyond the
          bounds of its legal rights, for instance, when a master exacts duties
          which the servant is not bound to pay, or the like. In this case the
          subject is not obliged to obey, but neither is he obliged not to obey.

          Ad primum ergo dicendum, quod illa praelatio quae ad utilitatem
          subditorum ordinatur, libertatem subditorum non tollit; et ideo non
          est inconveniens quod tali praelationi subjaceant qui per spiritum
          sanctum filii Dei effecti sunt. Vel dicendum, quod Christus loquitur
          de se et suis discipulis, qui nec servilis conditionis erant, nec res
          temporales habebant, quibus suis dominis obligarentur ad tributa
          solvenda; et ideo non sequitur quod omnis Christianus hujusmodi
          libertatis sit particeps, sed solum illi qui sequuntur apostolicam
          vitam, nihil in hoc mundo possidentes, et a conditione servili
          immunes.

        <td>
          Ad 1. In answer to the first, authority which is instituted for the
          utility of the subjects does not take away their liberty. Therefore
          there is no problem in being subject to such authority for those who
          have become sons of God by the Holy Spirit. Or another answer could
          be: Christ is speaking about himself and his disciples, who were not
          of servile condition, nor did they have temporal property by which
          they would be obliged to pay tax to their lords. Therefore it does not
          follow that every Christian shares in this liberty, but only those who
          follow the apostolic life, owning nothing in this world, and
          unaffected by servile state.

          necessitatem moriendi et caecitatem, vel aliquid hujusmodi; sed
          regenerat in spem vivam illius vitae in qua omnia ista tollentur; et
          sic non oportet ut aliquis statim baptizatus a servili conditione
          liberetur, quamvis illa sit poena peccati.

        <td>
          Ad 2. In answer to the second, baptism does not delete all the
          penalties arising from the sin of the first parent, such as the
          necessity to die, or blindness, or the like, but it gives rebirth into
          a living hope of that life in which all those things are taken away.
          So someone just baptized need not be immediately liberated from a
          servile state, even though that is a penalty of sin.

          coexist, because when the truth of the Gospel came, the shadow of the
          old law ceased. But th bond taken on by baptism is compatible with
          servitude, and therefore it does not dissolve it.

          superior who might pronounce judgment upon the usurper. In this case
