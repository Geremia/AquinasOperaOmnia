          <td>beata gens, cujus est dominus deus ejus, populus quem elegit in haereditatem sibi. ps. xxxii, 12: multis modis sancta mater ecclesia studium suum adhibet ad hoc quod filios suos provocet ad desiderandum coelestia. et si recte inspicere vultis, videtur totum studium suum tendere ad hoc, quod, contemptis terrenis, transferat nos ad desiderandum coelestia; quod ex fundatore primo ecclesiae salvatore nostro patet, qui in praedicationis suae et doctrinae studio dixit matth. iii, 2: agite poenitentiam, ut nos removeret a mundanis; appropinquavit regnum coelorum: hoc dicit, ut nos alliciat ad desiderandum coelestia.
          <td>"Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord: the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance" (Psalm 32:12). In many ways, holy mother Church applies her effort to this end, that she advance her children to desire heavenly things. And if you wish to consider this properly, it would seem that the whole of her effort strives for this, which, having disdained earthly things, directs us to desire heavenly things; this is evident from the first founder of the Church, our Savior, who in His proclamation and in His zeal of instruction, says at Matthew 3:2, "Do penance" so that we might remove ourselves from earthly affairs; "for the kingdom of heaven is at hand": which he says to entice us to desire heavenly things.

          <td>inter alia provocativa coelestis desiderii recolit et infigit hodie cordibus nostris gloriam sanctorum in quam tendimus. si placet, in principio rogabimus deum, quod pro convenientia tantae celebritatis det mihi aliquid dignum dicere, quod sit ad ejus honorem et omnium sanctorum, et ad salutem animarum nostrarum.
          <td>Among the different things provocative of a desire for heavenly things, he recalls and impresses upon our hearts today the glory of the saints for which we strive. If it is agreeable, we will ask God at the beginning (of this sermon) that He give me something worthy to say on behalf of the fitting nature of so great a celebration, that it be to His honor, of all the saints, and the salvation our our souls.

          <td>beata gens etc.. inditum est communiter animis hominum, ut delectabiliter audiant laudes patriae suae et parentum suorum. laudes patriae, ut ad eam redire festinent: laudes parentum, ut eos imitando non sint degeneres.
          <td>"Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord." It is commonly laid upon men's souls that they hear with delight the praises of their homeland and of their parents. The praises of their homeland, that they may hasten to return to her; the praises of their parents, that they, by imitating them, may not become degenerate.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>sed quae est patria nostra? patria ad quam tendimus est coelestis patria. unde apostolus heb. xiii, 14: non habemus hic manentem civitatem, sed futuram inquirimus. parentes nostri sunt spirituales viri, qui nos docuerunt, nos instruxerunt, exemplum recte bene vivendi nobis praebuerunt. isti sunt sancti in patria quorum solemnia hodie celebramus, et ideo ipsorum laudibus debemus cum jucunditate insistere. unde in ecclesiastico xliv, 1: laudemus viros gloriosos, et parentes nostros in generatione sua.
          <td>But what is our homeland? That homeland for which we strive is a heavenly homeland. Wherefore, the Apostle state at Hebrews 13:14, "For we have not here a lasting city, but we seek one that is to come." Our parents are the spiritual people who have taught and instructed us, who have supplied us with an example of living rightly and well. These very people are saints in this (heavenly) homeland whose solemn rites we celebrate today. And for this reason we ought to persist in (our) praises of these very people with delight. Whence (it is said at) Ecclesiasticus 44:1, "Let us praise men of renown, and our fathers in their generation."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>videte: spiritus sanctus per os david collegium istud sanctorum commendat quadrupliciter. primo ex eorum dignitate. secundo ex eorum rectore. tertio ex eorum dispositione. quarto ex ipsorum electione. ex eorum dignitate commendat collegium illud sanctorum, ibi; beata gens. ex eorum rectore, ibi: cujus dominus deus ejus. ex ipsorum dispositione nominat populum cum dicit: populus. ex eorum electione (cum) dicit: quem elegit dominus etc..
          <td>Consider (the text before us): the Holy Spirit, through the mouth of David, praises this very assembly of the saints in a four-fold way. First, by reason of their dignity, second, their uprightness, third, their condition, and fourth, their election. By reason of their dignity, he praises that assembly of the saints, at, "Blessed are the people," their uprightness, at, "whose God is the Lord," their condition, he calls the people by name when he says "the people," and their election, when he says "whom he hath chosen for his inheritance."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>primo, dico, commendat david collegium istud sanctorum ex ipsorum dignitate, ibi: beata gens. dignitas collegii istius notatur quia pervenerunt illuc quo tendimus. item possident quodquod desideramus. item constituti sunt super illud quod intelligere possumus.
          <td>(With respect to the) first, I say that David praises this very assembly of the saints because of their dignity, at, "Blessed are the people." The dignity of this very assembly is indicated because they have arrived at that place for which we strive. (This is also indicated because) they possess that which we desire. (Finally, this is indicated because) they have been established beyond that which we are able to understand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>primo, dico, attenditur dignitas sanctorum, quia pervenerunt illuc quo tendimus. beatitudo finis est omnium actionum nostrarum. unde apostolus ad romanos vi, 22: habetis fructum vestrum in sanctificatione, finem vero vitam aeternam. et videte; dicit augustinus libro de civitate dei: quis est finis desideriorum nostrorum, nisi pervenire ad regnum ubi nullus est finis? et videte; finis hominis tribus comparatur in sacra scriptura. primo comparatur coronae. unde apostolus ii tim. iv, 8: in de reliquo reposita est mihi corona justitiae. aliquando comparatur bravio. unde apostolus ad philippenses iii, 14: ad destinatum prosequor, ad bravium supernae coelestis vocationis. item aliquando comparatur mercedi. unde in evangelio matth. v, 12: gaudete et exultate, quoniam merces vestra copiosa est in coelis. nec immerito comparavit filius hominis istis tribus, quia omnis actio nostra ad tria reducitur. actio quorumdam est per certamina, quantum ad activos. unde job vii, 1: militia est vita hominis super terram; et qui legitime certaverint eis debetur corona, quia ii tim. ii, 5 non coronabitur nisi qui legitime certaverit. alii currunt, ut contemplativi; et isti nihil habent retardans ipsos, sed velociter currunt. de istis dicit ps. cxviii, 32: viam mandatorum cucurri. sed certantibus debetur bravium. apostolus i cor. ix, 24: omnes currunt, sed unus solus bravium accipit. alii sunt laborantes, ut praelati, qui exercent salutaria in plebe; et istis debetur merces. unde apostolus i cor. iii, 8; unusquisque propriam mercedem accipiet secundum laborem suum.
          <td>(With respect to the) first (of these), I say that the dignity of the saints is attended to because they have arrived at that place for which we strive. Now, beatitude is the end of all of our actions. For this reason, the Apostle (says in his Letter) to the Romans 6:22, "You have your fruit unto sanctification, and the end life everlasting." And consider what St. Augustine says in his book <i>The City of God:</i> "What is the end of our desires, except to attain to that kingdom where there is no end?" Understand that in Sacred Scripture the end of man is likened to three things. First, it is compared to a crown. For this reason, the Apostle (says at) 2 Timothy 4:8, "As to the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of justice." Sometimes it is compared to a prize. Whence, the Apostle (says in his letter to the) Philipians 3:14, "I press towards the mark, to the prize of the supernal vocation." Lastly, it is sometimes compared to a reward. Whence (it is said) in the Gospel of Matthew 5:12, "Be glad and rejoice, for your reward is very great in heaven." Not undeservedly did the Son of Man refer himself to these three, because the whole of our activity is reduced to three things. The activity of some is after the manner of battles, so far as concerns their effects. Whence, (it is said at) Job 7:1, "The life of man upon earth is a warfare"; and a crown is due to those who have fought lawfully in these (battles), because (as it is said at) 2 Timothy 2:5, "For he also that striveth for the mastery, is not crowned, except he strive lawfully." (The activity of) others (is such that they) run, like those who contemplate; and these people have nothing slowing them down, but they run swiftly. (David) speaks of these people at Psalm 118:32, "I have run the way of thy commandments." But for those fighting, a prize is due. (Whence) the Apostle (says at) 1 Corinthians 9:24, "All run...but one receiveth the prize." Others are laborers, prelates for example, who perform beneficial works among the people; and to these (prelates) is due a reward. Whence, the Apostle (says at) 1 Corinthians 3:8, "Every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>sed quae est gloria sanctorum in patria? dico quod consecuti sunt coronam tamquam boni certatores. assecuti sunt bravium tamquam cursores, et consecuti sunt mercedem tamquam operarii boni. homines in mundo laborant habere coronas, sed illa corona est corruptibilis; corona sanctorum est incorruptibilis. unde apostolus i cor. ix, 25: illi quidem ut corruptibilem habeant coronam; nos vero incorruptibilem. est igitur dignitas sanctorum, quia pervenerunt illuc quo tendimus.
          <td>But what is the heavenly splendor of the saints in (their) homeland? I say that they have obtained the crown, just as the good fighters (have). They have gained the prize, just as the runners (have), and they have obtained the reward, just as the good workers (have). Men labor in this world to have crowns, but that crown is perishable; (while) the crowns of the saints are imperishable. Whence, the Apostle (states at) 1 Corinthians 9:25, "...and they indeed that they may receive a corruptible crown; but we an incorruptible one." This, therefore, is the dignity of the saints, because they have arrived at that place for which we strive.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item habent quidquid desideramus, et adhuc amplius. unde in proverbiis x, 24: desiderium suum justis dabitur. considera quid desiderare potes in voluptatibus et delectationibus, totum habent sancti. dico, in delectationibus spiritualibus, non in mundanis et foedis. ps. xv, 14: delectationes tuae in dextera tua.
          <td>(The dignity of this very assembly is indicated,) furthermore, (as) they have everything we desire, and more abundantly besides. Whence (it is said) at Proverbs 10:24, "To the just their desire shall be given." Consider what you are able to desire among the enjoyments and delights (available to man): the saints have them all. (But note well that) I say, among <i>spiritual</i> delights, and not among the worldly and base (delights and enjoyments. Thus we have) Psalm 15:11, "At thy right hand are (your) delights."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>si desideras divitias, sancti opulentissimi sunt. nihil deest timentibus dominum prov. i, 33: abundantia perfruentur.
          <td>If you desire riches, the saints are exceedingly wealthy. Nothing is lacking to those who fear the Lord (as is stated at) Proverbs 1:33, "(But he that shall hear me, shall rest without terror, and) shall enjoy abundance, (without fear of evils)."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item, si desideras honores, sancti in maximo honore constituti sunt. ps. cxxxiii, 17: nimis honorificati honorati sunt amici tui, deus. si appetis scientiam, illam perfecte habent sancti, quia ipsi bibunt scientiam de ipso fonte sapientiae. sancti plenissime habent quidquid homo potest hic peccando, vel non peccando appetere. apparet igitur dignitas sanctorum, quia ipsi pervenerunt quo tendimus, et habent quidquid desiderare possumus.
          <td>Likewise, if you desire honors, the saints have been established in the greatest honor. Psalm 138:17 (attests to this. It states) "Thy friends, O God, are made exceedingly honorable." If you thirst for knowledge, the saints have that perfectly, for these very people drink knowledge from the font of wisdom itself. The saints have most fully whatever man can desire here by sinning or not sinning. The dignity of the saints, therefore, is evident, for they themselves have arrived at that for which we strive, and have whatever we can desire.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item sunt in summo constituti ultra id quod intelligere possumus, quia ultra id quod potes intelligere est beatitudo beatorum. unde isaias lxiv, 4: oculus non vidit, deus, absque te quae praeparasti diligentibus te.
          <td>(Finally, the dignity of this very assembly is indicated as) they have been established in the highest (way), beyond that which we can understand, because beyond that which you can understand is the beatitude of the blessed. Whence, Isaiah (states at) 64:4, "Eye hath not seen, O God, besides thee, what things thou hast prepared for them that wait for thee."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>quae est ratio quod sancti sunt in summo constituti ultra id quod intelligere potes? certe quia sancti in patria quantum ad omnia habent impletum desiderium suum. et quomodo possunt omni bono impleri, nisi veniant ad fontem omnis boni? quando arbor est onusta fructibus, si venis ad unum ramum non potes accipere omnes fructus ejus. similiter si vadas ad alium ramum; sed qui radicem amputaret omnes fructus auferret arbori. similiter non potes perfrui omni bono, nisi venias ad fontem omnis boni: ille est ps. cii, 5, qui replet in bonis desiderium tuum. unde dixit dominus moysi exod. xxxiii, 39: ego ostendam tibi omne bonum, idest me ipsum, in quo est omne bonum; et quia deus magnus est super omnem intellectum, ideo sancti qui fruuntur deo in tantum sunt elevati, quod nullus attingere potest. unde isaias liii, 14: sustollam te super omnem altitudinem terrae, idest super omnem altum quod terrenus homo potest intelligere: ditabo, inquit, te altitudine patris tui; ps. cxlix est omnibus sanctis ejus. patet igitur dignitas et gloria sanctorum in patria, quia ipsi pervenerunt illuc quo tendimus, habent quidquid desiderare possumus, et sunt in alto constituti ultra id quod intelligere possumus.
          <td>What is the meaning that the saints have been established in the highest (way), beyond that which you can understand? Surely that the saints in (their) homeland have their desire satisfied with respect to all things. And how can they be filled with every good thing, unless they come to the fount of all good? When a tree is loaded with fruit, if you come to (but) one of its branches, you will not be able to take all of its fruit. Likewise if you go to another branch. But he who cuts the tree at its base <i>[or "But he who prunes the tree to its base"]</i> , he will carry off all its fruit. In like manner, you will not be able to enjoy fully every good, unless you come to the fount of every good: that is (referred to at) Psalm 102:5, "Who satisfieth thy desire with good things." Whence the Lord said to Moses (at) Exodus 33:19, "I will shew thee all good," that is, (I will show you) myself, in whom is every good; and since God is great and is above every intellect, for this reason the saints, who enjoy God so greatly, have been exalted (in the highest way), which no one can reach (in this present state). Whence Isaiah (states at) 58:14, "I will lift thee up above (all) the high places of the earth," that is, above every height which the earthbound man can understand: I will enrich you, he says, with the high places of your homeland; (as) Psalm 149 states "This glory) is for all of his saints." Therefore, the dignity and the heavenly splendor of the saints in (their) homeland is evident, because they themselves have arrived at that place for which we strive, that they have whatever we can desire, and that they have been established in the highest (way) beyond that which we can understand.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>videamus de eorum rectore. tota dignitas sanctorum dependet ex ipso rectore. valde miserum est et abjectum et horrendum quod homo subdatur inferiori se, vel vili. unde comminatur dominus per prophetam dicens: tradam aegyptum in manus dominorum crudelium. qui dignum habet cui serviat, est beatus. unde in ecclesiastico xxv, 11: beatus qui non servivit indignis se. indigni sunt daemones; nos sumus filii dei. indignum est quod serviant filii inimico patris; beati qui deo serviunt. unde in libro iii regum x, 8: beati servi tui. justum est esse subditum deo. summa perfectio rei est quod sit subdita suo perfectori. materia non est perfecta nisi subdatur formae, et aer non est decorus nisi quando subjicitur soli, nec anima est perfecta nisi subdita sit deo. in hoc igitur consistit beatitudo nostra, quod simus subditi deo.
          <td>Let us look at their uprightness. The entire dignity of the saints depends upon uprightness itself. Exceedingly unhappy, abject, and quaking with fear is that man who subjects himself to that which is inferior, or base. Whence, the Lord threatens through his prophet (Isaiah) saying (at 19:4), "I will deliver Egypt into the hand of cruel masters." He is happy who serves one who is worthy. Whence (it is said at) Ecclesiasticus 25:11, "Blessed is he that hath not served such as are unworthy of him." The unworthy are the demons; we ourselves are children of God. It is unworthy that the children (of God) serve the enemy of (their) Father; blessed are those who serve God. Whence (it is said) in the third book of Kings 10:8, "Blessed are thy servants." It is right to be subject to God. The highest perfection of a thing is that it be brought under its very own perfection. Matter is not perfected unless it is brought under form, air is not suitable until it is subjected to the sun, and the soul is not perfected unless it be brought under God. In this, therefore, consists our beatitude, that we be brought under God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>posses dicere: numquid subjecti sumus deo? verum est, sed mediate: scilicet mediantibus angelis, praelatis et pedagogis, qui nos custodiunt quomodo debemus ad beatitudinem pervenire; sed sancti in patria non sunt subjecti pedagogis. unde apostolus i ad cor. xv, 24: deinde finis; cum tradiderit christus regnum deo patri, et cum evacuaverit omnem principatum. dicit igitur: beata gens, cujus dominus deus ejus.
          <td>But you might say: "We are to be brough under God?" (Indeed) it is true, but (this subjection occurs) through the mediacy of another, namely through the mediating angels, prelates and teachers, who watch over us in such a way that we should arrive at (our) beatitude; but the saints in (their) homeland are not subject to teachers. Whence the Apostle (says at) 1 Corinthians 15:24, "Afterwards the end, when Christ shall have delivered up the kingdom to God and the Father, when he shall have brought to nought all principality." Therefore, he says "Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>et videte quod fuerunt aliqui, et sunt qui dixerunt felicitatem et beatitudinem esse in terrenis, quorum opinio describitur in ps. cxlii, 13: promptuaria eorum plena, eructantia ex hoc in illud. oves eorum faetosae, et cetera quae ponit. sequitur: beatum dixerunt populum, cui haec sunt. ita dixerunt vulgares, et falsa est opinio ista, quia transeunt omnia sicut umbra.
          <td>Consider what some (people) have come to. There are those who are said to be happy and blessed on earth. The view (of such people) is described at Psalm 143:13, "Their storehouses full, flowing out of this into that. Their sheep fruitful in young, abounding in their goings forth." (But, later in this same psalm at verse 15) it follows: "They have called the people happy, that hath these things." In such a way have the vulgar spoken, and this very view is false, because all things are passing away like a shadow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item non replent, quia avarus non implebitur pecunia. invenias in terrenis quod maneat, quod desiderium impleat, et confiteor tibi quod ibi est beatitudo; sed non invenitur. false igitur aestimant beatitudinem esse in terrenis. ubi igitur est beatitudo? psalmista respondet et dicit ps. cxliii: deus ejus.
          <td>Likewise, they do not satiate since a greedy person will not be satisfied by money. (Such a person says) "Get what lasts in this life, what fills (your) desire, and I confess to you that there is beatitude"; but it is not found (in such things). Therefore they falsely judge beatitude to be in earthly things. Where, then, is beatitude? The Psalmist responds and says in Psalm 32:12, ("Blessed is that people) whose God (is the Lord: the people whom he hath chosen for his inheritance").
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item alii sunt vel fuerunt, ut stoici, qui beatitudinem et felicitatem dixerunt esse in interioribus bonis. habere virtutes et scientiam dixerunt summum bonum; quorum opinio reprobatur in jeremia ix, 23: non glorietur, inquit, sapiens in sapientia sua et non glorietur, nec fortis in fortitudine sua. quare? quia quidquid est intus te ipsum subditur naturae tuae, sed quod beatum te facit debet esse supra te, non tibi subjectum; propter hoc sequitur: sed in hoc glorietur, scire et nosse me.
          <td>Furthermore, there are, or were some, like the Stoics, who said that beatitude and happiness consist in the interior goods. To have virtue and knowledge they called the highest good. The view of these people is condemned in Jeremiah 9:23, "Thus saith the Lord: Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, and let not the strong man glory in his strength." Why? Because whatever is within you is subject to your nature, but what makes you blessed ought to be above you, not subjected to you. Because of this, (the passage from Jeremiah) continues (at verse 24): "But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>sunt alii qui dicunt, quod beatitudo est in his quae sunt juxta nos. confidebant tales in homine, contra quos dicit ps. cxlv, 2: nolite confidere in principibus. non est etiam confidendum in angelis, quia aliqui dixerunt quod finis noster est videre angelos, sed constituitur intellectus noster ad visionem summae causae. anselmus: non enim videndo angelos beati sumus, sed videndo virtutem qua diligimus angelos. beata gens cujus est dominus deus ejus. et quomodo ejus? dico quod est deus ad cognoscendum, ad possidendum, et ad fruendum.
          <td>There are others who say that beatitude consists in those who are close to us. Such people trust in man (for their beatitude), against whom Psalm 145:2 speaks, "Put not your trust in princes (in the children of men, in whom there is no salvation)." (Beatitude) is also not to be trusted to the angels, since some (people) have said that our end is to see the angels. But our intellect is made for the vision of the highest cause. (Concerning this point,) St. Anselm (says): "Not by seeing the angels are we made happy, but by seeing the power by which we love the angels." "Blessed are the people whose God is the Lord." And in what manner (is God to be theirs)? I say that God is to be known, possessed, and enjoyed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>primo, dico, est deus eorum ad cognoscendum. in hoc est perfecta beatitudo sanctorum in patria, quod cognoscant deum. unde augustinus, libro confessionum lib. iv, c. iv: infelix enim homo qui scit illa omnia, te autem nesciat; beatus qui te scit, etiam si illa nesciat. qui autem te et illa novit, non propter illa beatior, sed propter te solum beatus. beatitudo est quod cognoscamus deum, sive quod habeamus deum ad cognoscendum. sed numquid sancti in patria cognoscunt deum? certe sic. unde jeremias xxxi, 34: non docebit vir (ultra) fratrem suum, et vir proximum suum, dicens; cognosce dominum; omnes cognoscent me, a minimo eorum usque ad maximum.
          <td>First, I say that their God is to be known. In this consists the perfect beatitude of the saints in (their) homeland, that they know God. Whence Augustine, in his book <i>The Confessions,</i> (at) IV.100.4 (states): "The unhappy man is one who knows other things, but does not know You; the happy or blessed man is one who knows You, even if he does not know other things. However, he who knows both You and other things, is happy not on account of (the knowledge of these) other things, but (rather) blessed because of (the knowledge of) you alone." Beatitude is that we know God, or that we have God to be known. But do the saints in (their) homeland know God? Certainly they do. Whence Jeremiah (states at) 31:34, "And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, saying: Know the Lord: for all shall know me from the least of them even to the greatest."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>sed quomodo habent sancti deum ad cognoscendum? dico quod istam cognitionem duo concomitantur, clara et aperta visio, et perfecta ad deum assimilatio.
          <td>But how do the saints have God to be known? I say that two things accompany this knowing, (namely) clear and free vision, and a perfect assimilation to God.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>primo, dico, istam cognitionem concomitantur clara et aperta visio. videmus enim modo a remotis deum per similitudinem creaturarum et in enigmatibus. unde job xxxvi, 25: omnes homines vident eum, unusquisque intuetur eum procul. apostolus ad rom. i, 20: invisibilia dei per ea quae facta sunt, intellecta, conspiciuntur; sed in patria sancti vident deum clare, non in speculo et enigmate.
          <td>First, I say, that this clear and free vision accompanies this knowing. For we see God in one way from afar through a likeness of creatures and in obscure ways. Whence (it is said at ) Job 36:25, "All men see him, every one beholdeth afar off." The Apostle (says at) Romans 1:20, "For the invisible things of him, from the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made;" but in (their) homeland, the saints see God clearly, and not "through a glass in a dark manner" (I Corinthians 13:12).

          <td>In order that we might see God clearly, it is necessary that we have clear eyes. If (your) eyes are cloudy or obscured, or if they have been disturbed, they are not sufficient to see in your mind the clarity (of God), (for) you are impeded from the sight of God by the fires of concupiscence, anger and evil desires. Psalm 57:9 (attests to this. It states that) "Fire" that is, of concupiscence, "hath fallen on them, and they shall not see the sun," that is, God. Therefore, clear and free vision accompanies this very knowing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item concomitatur eam perfecta ad deum assimilatio; quia cognitio non fit nisi per assimilationem cognoscentis ad cognitum, ut vult philosophus; sed sancti perfectam habent assimilationem ad deum. unde in joanne i joan. iii, 2: cum apparuerit, similes ei erimus, et videbimus eum sicuti est. si vis pervenire ad assimilationem dei in patria, debes studere assimilari ei in bonis operibus hic. christus venit pacem mittere in terra. eph. ii, 14: ipse est pax nostra qui fecit utraque unum. non semines igitur jurgia: sed ad pacem reducas discordias, si vis christo hic assimilari. unde in evangelio matth. v, 9: beati pacifici, quoniam filii dei vocabuntur. filius habet perfectam assimilationem cum patre. habebimus igitur in patria deum ad cognoscendum et ad videndum. unde augustinus in psalm. cxviii: finis omnium actionum nostrarum promittitur ista contemplatio. scribitur deut. x, 9 quod filii levi non habuerunt partem inter fratres, quia dominus possessio eorum. sancti habent deum in possessione, et sufficit eis. ps. xv, 6, 5: funes ceciderunt mihi in praeclaris; etenim haereditas mea praeclara est mihi. dominus pars haereditatis meae, et calicis mei, etc.
          <td>Likewise, a perfect assimilation to God accompanies (this knowing), since knowledge comes about only through an assimilation of the knower to the thing known, as the Philosopher meant; but the saints have a perfect assimilation to God. Whence in the first letter of John 3:2 (it says), "When he shall appear, we shall be like to him: because we shall see him as he is." If you want to attain to the assimiliation to God in (your heavenly) homeland, then you ought to be eager to be assimilated to Him through good works here (in this earthly condition). Christ comes to send peace into this world. Ephesians 2:14, "For he is our peace, who hath made both one." Therefore, do not sow (the seeds of) strife, but resolve discord into peace, if you want to be assimilation or likened here to Christ. Whence in the Gospel of Matthew 5:9 (it is said), "Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God." The son has a perfect likeness to (his) father. We, therefore, will have in (this) homeland God to be known and understood. Whence Augustine (says in his Commentary) on Psalm 118: "This very contemplation is promised (to us) as the end of all of our actions." It is written (in) Deuteronomy 10:9 that the sons of Levi did not have any part (or possession) among (their) brethren: because the Lord was their possession. The saints have God in (their) possession, and (this) satisfies them. Psalm 15:6, 5, "The lines are fallen unto me in goodly places: for my inheritance is goodly to me. The Lord is the portion of my inheritance and of my cup."

          <td>But in what manner do the saints possess God? I say they are blessed by possessing God, because (as it is said at Psalm 33:9-10 or Psalm 111:1) "Blessed is he who fears him." And in what way do they attain to his possession? I say through love. Whence (it is said in) the first letter of John 4:16, "He that adibeth in charity, abideth in God, and God in him." And in Tobias 13:18, "Blessed are all they that love thee."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">

          <td>But what do you possess by possessing God? I say that by possessing God you possess what is in God. And what is in God? Glory and wealth. Psalm 111:3 (states), "Glory and wealth shall be in his house." The saints in (their) homeland have glory and honor. They are all kings (as says) Revelation 5:10, "Thou hast made us to our God a kingdom (and priests, and we shall reign on the earth)." This very glory is promised to the humble, because (as it is said in) Job 22:29, "He that hath been humbled, shall be in glory." And in the Gospel of Matthew 5:3, "Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven." Furthermore, the saints have infinite wealth, since they have whatever a man can desire.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>sed quibus datur ista possessio. numquid litigantibus? certe non. in mundo acquirit homo quandoque terrena litigando, et per fraudem. sed coelestes divitiae acquiruntur per mansuetudinem. unde in canonica jacobi i, 2: in mansuetudine suscipite insitum verbum. et in evangelio matth. v, 4: beati mites, quoniam ipsi possidebunt terram. habent igitur sancti deum ad cognoscendum et possidendum.
          <td>But to whom is this possession given? To the quarrelsome? Certainly not. In this earthly existence, man acquires whatever earthly riches (he wants) by quarrelling, and through fraud. But heavenly riches are acquired through meekness. Whence in James 1:21 (it is said), "In meekness receive the ingrafted word." And in the Gospel of Matthew 5:4, "Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land." Therefore, the saints have God to be known and to be possessed.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>tertio, sancti in patria habent deum ad fruendum et delectandum. job xxii, 26: super omnipotentem deliciis afflues: sancti in patria non delectantur in re temporali, sed in deo fonte totius boni. unde dominus luc. xxii, 30: ut edatis et bibatis super mensam meam in regno meo. quid est edere super mensam dei? hoc est delectari et refici in quo deus reficitur. et quid est hoc in quo deus reficitur? hoc est ejus bonitas. quando reficeris de bonitate dei, tunc edis in mensa dei, et hoc est beatitudo sanctorum. unde dicitur luc. xiv, 15: beatus qui manducabit panem in regno sanctorum.
          <td>Third, the saints in (their) homeland have God to be enjoyed and delighted in. Job 22:26 (states), "(Then) shalt thou abound in delights in the Almighty." The saints in (their) homeland do not delight in temporal things, but in God, the fount of all good. Whence the Lord (states at) Luke 22:30, "That you might eat and drink at my table, in my kingdom." What is it to eat at the table of God? This is to be delighted and renewed in that which God is renewed. And what is this in which God is renewed? This is his goodness. When you are renewed by the goodness of God, then you will eat at the table of God, and this is the beatitude of the saints. Whence it is said at Luke 14:15, "Blessed is he that shall eat bread in the kingdom of the saints."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>et videte: delectatio ista tres proprietates habet: quia gaudium istud est consolatorium. per illud gaudium homo amisit omnes tristitias. unde isaias lxv, 16: oblivioni traditae sunt angustiae, priores non sunt in memoria nec ascendent super cor, quia videbitis et exultabitis in his quae feci. augustinus dicit libro xxii, de civitate dei c. xxx, quod aliter obliviscitur doloris eruditus et doctus, et aliter expertus et passus. eruditus et doctus obliviscitur doloris quando negligit. expertus et passus quando transfertur ad gaudium. et sancti propter gaudium obliviscuntur omnium dolorum. est igitur gaudium illud consolatorium.
          <td>Consider (that) this delight has three characteristic features: (first,) that joy is of those things that console. Through that joy, man loses all sadness. Whence (it is said in) Isaiah 65:16, 17-18 "The former distresses are forgotten...the former things shall not be in remembrance, and they shall not come upon the heart. But you shall be glad and rejoice forever in these things, which I create." Augustine says in Book 22, Chapter 30 of <i>The City of God,</i> that "A well-instructed and learned man forgets pain one way, and he who has actually suffered from it forgets it in another; the former by neglecting what he has learned, the latter (by escaping what he has suffered)" when he is brought to joy. And the saints, because of (their) joy, forget every pain. Therefore joy itself is of those things that console.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item est plenum. quare est plenum? quia est de creatore, et de creaturis omnibus nihil occurret menti tuae quod te non faciet gaudere. ingredietur ad contemplationem divinitatis, et egredietur ad contemplationem creaturarum, et ubique refectionem inveniet in deo et creaturis. est igitur gaudium plenum. unde in joanne xvi, 24: petite ut gaudium vestrum sit plenum. augustinus: ad istam satietatem nemo pervenire potest nisi esuriendo justitiam. unde in evangelio matth. v, 6: beati qui esuriunt et sitiunt justitiam quoniam ipsi saturabuntur.
          <td>Secondly, (this joy) is full. Why is it full? Because it is of the Creator, and of all creatures, (for) nothing occurs to your mind that does not make you to rejoice. One enters into the contemplation of the deity, and goes forth (from this) to the contemplation of creatures, and finds refreshment everywhere in God and creatures. This joy, therefore, is full. Whence (it is said) in John 16:24, "Ask...that your joy may be full." (Again) Augustine (says), "No one can attain to this sufficiency except by hungering for justice." Whence (it is said) in the Gospel of Matthew 5:6, "Blessed are they that hunger and thirst after justice: for they shall have their fill."
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>item est illud gaudium purum non permixtum moerori et anxietatibus, sicut gaudium saeculi, de quo dicitur prov. xix, 13: risus dolore miscebitur. isaias xxxv, 10: gaudium et laetitiam obtinebunt, et fugiet ab eis dolor et gemitus. et in proverb. i, 33: abundantia perfruetur, timore malorum sublato. illud gaudium habebunt misericordes, quia matth. v, 7: beati misericordes, quia ipsi misericordiam consequuntur. augustinus: ipse est finis noster, quem sine fine videbimus, sine fastidio amabimus, et sine fatigatione laudabimus; sed quid erit in illo fine? sine fine vacabimus, vacando videbimus, videndo amabimus, amando laudabimus. beatus qui erit in illo fine, quia ps. xxxv, 5: beati qui habitant in domo tua, domine. ad illam beatitudinem perducat nos qui cum patre et filio et spiritu sancto vivit et regnat etc.
          <td>Lastly, that joy is pure and not mixed with mourning and distresses, as is the joy of this age, concerning which it is said at Proverbs 14:13, "Laughter shall be mingled with sorrow," (at) Isaiah 35:10, "They shall obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall flee away," and at Proverbs 1:33, "He shall enjoy abundance, without fear of evils." The merciful will have that joy, because (as it is said in) Matthew 5:7, "Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy." And Augustine (states that) "He Himself is our end, whom we will see without end, will love without weariness, and will praise without fatigue; but what will occur in that end? Without end, we will be free (of all earthly cares), we will see by being free, we will love by seeing, and we will praise by loving." Blessed is he who will be in that end, because (as) Psalm 83:5 (states), "Blessed are they that dwell in thy house, O Lord." Let (my sermon) guide us to that beatitude which lives and reigns with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.

          <td>First, I say, that a numerous multitude is required for a people, because one or two do not make a people. Do these people not constitute a multitude? Indeed they do. Whence, in today's epistle (Revelation 7:9, it says) "I saw a great multitude which no man could number." This belongs to the dignity of a king, and most especially of that king who has a great people. Whence, (it is said) at Proverbs 14:28, "In the multitude of people is the dignity of the king." And Boethius says that "A king is glorified on account of the multitude of (his) citizens." The earth is nothing in comparison to the heavens. Dionysius says in his book <i>Concerning the Heavenly Hierarchy,</i> Chapter 14, that "A multitude of material things is nothing in relation to (a multitude) of spiritual things." And of the Lord it is said that a million used to minister to him; and one billion used to assist him, and thereafter, the multitude of all the saints. In the third book of Kings (4:20 it is said), "Juda and Israel were innumerable, as the sand of the sea in multitude: eating and drinking, and rejoicing." Only God knows the multitude of the saints, (as) Psalm 146:4 (states), "Who telleth the number of the stars." The multitude, therefore, of the people refers to the dignity of the king.

And Helisaeus said to his son at 4 Kings 6:16, "Fear not: for there are more with us than with them." Therefore, the multitude of the saints in (their) homeland is (referred) to the saints according to (their) joy, to God with respect to (His) honor, and to us according to (our) safety.

          <td>(Lastly,) we must speak of the election of the saints. The distinction of the saints according to (our) knowledge is treated of in the epistle (of today's readings). But this diversity is in the world, not in heaven. Whence, the Apostle (states at) Colossians 3:11, "Where there is neither Gentile nor Jew...Barbarian nor Scythian." And (there is also what) Saint Peter (says at) Acts 10:35, "But in every nation, he that feareth God, and worketh justice, is acceptable to him."

The truth is that all the saints rule with God, but the Apostles rule particularly. Whence (it is said) in Luke 22:29, "And I dispose to you, as my Father hath disposed to me, a kingdom" and just as they have been leaders of the Church, so too in the homeland do they have a kingly dignity.

          <td>(In response to this, we should note that) the Philosopher says, "The inexperienced easily declare (after) considering too little." Now, it is not necessary (for virtue to consist) in a mean according to quantity, but (rather) according to right reason. The Philosopher says in the fourth book of the <i>Nichomachean Ethics,</i> (IV. 3. 1123b13-14) that "The magnanimous man holds an extreme in extension but a mean in appropriateness, for he thinks himself deserving in accord with his worth." Philosophers have given up all their possessions and have lived moderately so that they might devote themselves to philosophy. If this occurred among the Gentiles, it ought well to occur among Christians. But if a man desires to be temperate when (his) wife asks what is owed (to her), this would be vicious; but in virginity is the greatest virtue. Therefore, the Apostles have acquired the kingdom by poverty. We find the victorious martyrs who "by faith conquered kingdoms," (Hebrews 11:33), and these blessed people are meek, because neither murmuring nor complaints resound (from them). Concerning these people, it is said in the Gospel of Matthew 5:4, "Blessed are the meek: for they shall possess the land."

Abraham received into his own bosom all the elect. Whence it is said in Matthew 8:11, "Many shall come from the east and the west, and shall sit down (in the bosom of) Abraham, and with Isaac, and Jacob."

In this way, (then,) it is clear how the poor acquire the kingdom, the meek the land, the mourning comfort, those hungering for justice their fill, the merciful mercy, the clean of heart the vision of God, and the peacemakers are called the children of God. Let (my sermon) guide us to that fellowship which is with the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, one God forever and ever. Amen.
