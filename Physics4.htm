            <td>The question, what is place? presents many difficulties. An examination of all the relevant facts seems to lead to divergent conclusions. Moreover, we have inherited nothing from previous thinkers, whether in the way of a statement of difficulties or of a solution.

            <td>The existence of place is held to be obvious from the fact of mutual replacement. Where water now is, there in turn, when the water has gone out as from a vessel, air is present. When therefore another body occupies this same place, the place is thought to be different from all the bodies which come to be in it and replace one another. What now contains air formerly contained water, so that clearly the place or space into which and out of which they passed was something different from both.

            <td>Further, the typical locomotions of the elementary natural bodies—namely, fire, earth, and the like—show not only that place is something, but also that it exerts a certain influence. Each is carried to its own place, if it is not hindered, the one up, the other down. Now these are regions or kinds of place—up and down and the rest of the six directions. Nor do such distinctions (up and down and right and left, etc.) hold only in relation to us. To us they are not always the same but change with the direction in which we are turned: that is why the same thing may be both right and left, up and down, before and behind. But in nature each is distinct, taken apart by itself. It is not every chance direction which is 'up', but where fire and what is light are carried; similarly, too, 'down' is not any chance direction but where what has weight and what is made of earth are carried—the implication being that these places do not differ merely in relative position, but also as possessing distinct potencies. This is made plain also by the objects studied by mathematics. Though they have no real place, they nevertheless, in respect of their position relatively to us, have a right and left as attributes ascribed to them only in consequence of their relative position, not having by nature these various characteristics.

            <td>Again, the theory that the void exists involves the existence of place: for one would define void as place bereft of body. These considerations then would lead us to suppose that place is something distinct from bodies, and that every sensible body is in place.

            <td>Hesiod too might be held to have given a correct account of it when he made chaos first. At least he says: 'First of all things came chaos to being, then broad-breasted earth,' implying that things need to have space first, because he thought, with most people, that everything is somewhere and in place. If this is its nature, the potency of place must be a marvellous thing, and take precedence of all other things. For that without which nothing else can exist, while it can exist without the others, must needs be first; for place does not pass out of existence when the things in it are annihilated.

After treating in Book III of motion, and the infinite, which belongs intrinsically to motion insofar as it is in the genus of continuous things, the Philosopher now intends, in Book IV, to deal with the things that are extrinsically connected with motion.

          <td>As to the first he does two things: First, [277] he proposes what he intends and says that just as it is the business of the natural philosopher to determine about the infinite; namely, whether it exists or not, and how it exists, and what it is, so also about place; Secondly, at no. 407, he proves what he had said: First from the viewpoint of place itself; Secondly, from our viewpoint [i.e., that of the ones studying place] at no. 409.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum ponit duas rationes: quarum prima talis est. Ea quae sunt communia omnibus naturalibus, pertinent maxime ad considerationem naturalis; sed locus est huiusmodi: omnes enim communiter opinantur omnia ea quae sunt, in aliquo loco esse. Et ad hoc probandum utuntur sophistico argumento a positione consequentis. Argumentantur enim sic. Quod non est, nusquam est, idest in nullo loco est: non enim est dare ubi sit Tragelaphus aut sphinx, quae sunt quaedam fictitia sicut Chimaera. Argumentatur ergo quod si id quod in nullo loco est, non sit; ergo omne quod est, est in loco.
          <td>407. About the first he gives two reasons, of which the following is the first [278]. Whatever things are common to all natural things pertain especially to the considerations of the natural philosopher; but place is such, for all generally maintain that whatever exists is in some place. They prove it by a sophistic argument consisting of positing the consequent. They argue thus: What does not exist is nowhere, i.e., in no place, for there is no place where the goat-stag or the sphinx exist, which are certain fictions after the manner of chimeras. They argue therefore that if what is found in no place does not exist, then whatever exists is in a place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed si esse in loco convenit omnibus entibus, videtur quod locus magis pertineat ad considerationem metaphysici quam physici.
          <td>But if to be in place belongs to all beings, it seems that place pertains rather to the consideration of metaphysics then that of physics.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et dicendum est quod hic argumentatur ab opinione ponentium omnia entia esse sensibilia, propter hoc quod imaginationem corporum transcendere non possunt: et secundum hos naturalis scientia est philosophia prima, communis omnibus entibus, ut dicitur in IV Metaphys.
          <td>And it must be said that Aristotle here argues from the opinion of those who posit that all beings are sensible, on account of their inability to go beyond their imaginations. According to them, natural science is first philosophy, common to all beings, as is mentioned in <i>Metaphysics</i> IV (L.5).
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: et de motu qui communis maxime est etc.: quae talis est. Ad philosophum naturalem pertinet considerare de motu; sed motus qui est secundum locum, quem dicimus loci mutationem, est maxime communis inter omnes motus: quaedam enim, scilicet corpora caelestia, moventur hoc motu tantum, cum tamen nihil moveatur aliis motibus quin moveatur hoc motu. Similiter etiam hic motus est magis proprius: quia hic solus motus est vere continuus et perfectus, ut in octavo probabitur. Motus autem secundum locum non potest cognosci nisi cognoscatur locus. Naturalis igitur debet considerare de loco.
          <td>408. Then [279] he gives the second reason: The consideration of motion belongs to the natural philosopher; but the motion which is according to place and is called “change of place” is the most general of all motions. For some things namely, the heavenly bodies, are moved solely according to this motion and nothing is moved with other motions without being moved by this one. Moreover, this motion is more properly so because it alone is truly continuous and perfect, as will be proved in Book VIII. But notion according to place cannot be known without knowing place. The natural philosopher therefore should consider place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: habet autem multas dubitationes etc., inducit ad idem rationem ex parte nostra. De illis enim a sapientibus determinandum est, de quibus dubitatio est; multae autem dubitationes sunt de loco, quid sit. Quarum quidem dubitationum duplex est causa. Una est ex parte ipsius loci: quia non omnes proprietates loci ducunt in eandem sententiam de loco; sed ex quibusdam proprietatibus loci videtur quod locus sit hoc, ex quibusdam autem videtur quod locus sit aliud. Alia vero causa est ex parte hominum: quia antiqui neque bene moverunt dubitationem circa locum, neque etiam bene exquisierunt veritatem.
          <td>409. Then [280] he arrives at the same conclusion from our viewpoint: Wise men should settle matters about which there is doubt; but there are many doubts about what place is. The cause of these doubts is twofold. One is based on place itself: because not all the properties of place lead to the same opinion about place, but from certain properties of place it seems that place is one thing and from other properties that it is something else. The other cause is based on men, for the ancients neither proposed their doubts about place well nor pursued the truth of the matter well.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: quod quidem igitur locus sit etc., incipit determinare de loco: et primo per modum disputativum; secundo determinando veritatem, ibi: post haec autem accipiendum et cetera.
          <td>410. Then [281] he begins to determine about place. First in a dialectical manner; Secondly, by determining the truth, at no. 434.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit: primo inquirit disputative an sit locus; secundo quid sit, ibi: quoniam autem aliud et cetera.
          <td>As to the first he does two things: First he discusses dialectically whether place exists; Secondly what it is at no. 422.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit: primo ponit rationes ad ostendendum locum esse; secundo ad ostendendum quod locus non sit, ibi: at vero habet defectum et cetera.
          <td>About the first he does two things: First he gives reasons showing that place exists; Secondly, showing that it does not exist, at no. 415.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit: primo ostendit locum esse, rationibus acceptis a rei veritate; secundo ab opinionibus aliorum, ibi: amplius vacuum et cetera.
          <td>As to the first he does two things: First he shows that place exists, by using reasons based on the truth of things; Secondly, by reasons based on the opinions of others, at no. 413.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum ponit duas rationes: in quarum prima sic procedit. Dicit enim quod ex ipsa transmutatione corporum quae moventur secundum locum, manifestum est quod locus aliquid sit. Sicut enim transmutatio quae est secundum formas, homines induxit ad cognitionem materiae, quia scilicet oportet esse aliquod subiectum in quo sibi formae succedant; ita transmutatio secundum locum induxit homines ad cognitionem loci; oportet enim esse aliquid ubi sibi corpora succedant. Et hoc est quod subdit, quod exeunte aqua inde ubi nunc est, sicut ex quodam vase, iterum subintrat aer. Cum igitur eundem locum quandoque aliud corpus detineat, ex hoc manifestum videtur esse quod locus sit aliud ab iis quae sunt in loco et transmutantur secundum locum: quia ubi nunc est aer, prius aqua ibi erat; quod non esset si locus non esset aliud et ab aere et ab aqua. Relinquitur igitur quod locus est aliquid; et est quoddam receptaculum, alterum ab utroque locatorum; et est terminus motus localis a quo et in quem.
          <td>411. In regard to the first, he gives two reasons. In the first of these he proceeds thus: That place is something, is clear from the very transmutation of bodies that are moved according to place. For just as the transmutation which is according to form led men to the knowledge of matter, because there had to be a subject in which the forms could succeed one another, so transmutation according to place led men to a knowledge of place, for there had to be something where bodies could succeed one another. And this is what he adds, namely, that when water goes out from where it now is, i.e., from some vessel, air re-enters. Since, therefore, another body sometimes occupies the same place, it is clear that place is something different from the things that are in place and which are moved according to place. For where air now is there was previously water, and this would not be if place were not something different from both the air and the water. Consequently, place is something: it is a sort of receptacle distinct from any of the things located in it, and it is the term “from which” and “unto which” of local motion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius autem loci mutationes et cetera. Et dicit quod cum quorumcumque corporum motus ostendat locum esse, ut dictum est, motus localis corporum naturalium simplicium, ut ignis et terrae et aliorum huiusmodi gravium et levium, non solum ostendit quod locus sit aliquid, sed etiam quod locus habeat quandam potentiam et virtutem.
          <td>412. He gives the second reason [282], saying that since the motion of any body whatsoever shows that place exists, as has been said, then the local motion of natural simple bodies, such as fire and earth, and such like heavy and light bodies, not only shows that place is something, but also that place has a certain power and force.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Videmus enim quod unumquodque horum fertur in suum proprium locum quando non impeditur, grave quidem deorsum, leve autem sursum. Ex quo patet quod locus habet quandam virtutem conservandi locatum: et propter hoc locatum tendit in suum locum desiderio suae conservationis. Non autem ex hoc ostenditur quod locus habeat virtutem attractivam, nisi sicut finis dicitur attrahere.
          <td>For we observe that each of these bodies is carried to its proper place when it is not prevented, i.e., the heavy are carried down and the light upward. This shows that place has a certain power of pre-serving the thing that is in place. For this reason, an object tends to its own place by a desire of self-preservation. This, however, does not prove that place has the power to attract, except in the sense in which the end is said to attract.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sursum autem et deorsum, et alia de numero sex distantiarum, scilicet ante et retro, dextrorsum et sinistrorsum, sunt partes et species loci. Huiusmodi autem distantiae determinantur in universo secundum naturam, et non solum quoad nos. Et hoc patet, quia in his in quibus ista dicuntur quoad nos, non semper idem est sursum vel deorsum vel dextrorsum vel sinistrorsum; sed variatur secundum quod diversimode nos convertimur ad ipsum; unde multoties aliquid immobile manens, quod prius erat dextrum, fit sinistrum, et similiter de aliis, prout nos diversimode ad illa convertimur.
          <td>“Up” and “down” and the other directions, namely, “before” and “behind,” “right” and “left,” are the parts and species of place. These directions are determined in the universe according to nature and not merely in relation to ourselves. This is clear from the fact that when we speak of them in relation to ourselves, the same thing is not always “up” or “down,” “right” or “left,” but varies according to our various relations to it. Hence it frequently happens that an immobile object which was “on the right” comes to be “on the left.” The same is true of the other directions, depending on our different relations to them.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed in natura aliquid determinatum est sursum et deorsum secundum motum gravium et levium: et aliae positiones secundum motum caeli, ut in tertio dictum est. Non enim indifferenter quaecumque pars mundi est sursum vel deorsum: sed semper sursum est quo feruntur levia, deorsum autem quo feruntur gravia. Quaecumque autem secundum se habent determinatas positiones, necesse est quod habeant potentias quibus determinentur: alia enim est in animali potentia dextri, et alia sinistri. Unde relinquitur quod locus sit, et habeat aliquam potentiam.
          <td>But in nature there is a definite “up” and “down” according to the motion of heavy and light bodies, and the other [four] directions are determined by the movements of the heavens, as was said in Book III. It is not just any part of the universe that is “up” and just any part that is “down,” but “up” is always whether light bodies are carried and “down” is whether heavy bodies tend. Now whatever things have according to themselves definite positions must have powers by which they are determined, for in an animal the power of the right is distinct from the power of the left. Accordingly, place exists and has definite powers.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quod autem in aliquibus dicatur positio solum quoad nos, ostendit per mathematica; quae quidem, licet non sint in loco, tamen attribuitur eis positio solum per respectum ad nos. Unde in eis non est positio secundum naturam; sed solum secundum intellectum, secundum quod intelliguntur in aliquo ordine ad nos, vel supra vel subtus vel dextrorsum vel sinistrorsum.
          <td>Now, that in certain things the position is assigned only in relation to us is shown in mathematical objects, which, although they are not in place, yet have a position attributed to them solely in relation to ourselves. Hence they have no position according to nature but only according to the intellect, inasmuch as they are understood in some relation to ourselves, either as above or below, or to the right or left.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: amplius vacuum affirmantes etc., ostendit locum esse, ex opinionibus aliorum. Et primo ex opinione ponentium vacuum. Quia quicumque affirmant vacuum esse, necesse est quod dicant esse locum, cum vacuum nihil aliud sit quam locus privatus corpore. Et sic ex hoc et ex praemissis rationibus potest aliquis concipere quod locus sit aliquid praeter corpora, et quod omnia corpora sensibilia sint in loco.
          <td>413. Then [283] he appeals to the opinions of others to show that place exists. First, to the opinion of those who posit a void. For whoever asserts that the void exists must admit that place exists, since the void is nothing more than a place devoid of body. And so from this and from the reasons given above, it is possible to conceive that place is something other than bodies and that all sensible bodies exist in place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: videbitur autem utique etc., inducit ad idem opinionem Hesiodi, qui fuit unus de antiquis poetis theologis; qui posuit primo factum esse chaos. Dixit enim quod primo inter omnia factum est chaos, quasi quaedam confusio et receptaculum corporum; et postea facta est terra lata ad recipiendum diversa corpora: ac si primo necesse esset esse receptaculum rerum quam ipsas res. Et hoc ideo posuerunt quia crediderunt, sicut et multi alii, quod omnia quae sunt, sint in loco. Quod si verum est, sequitur quod locus non solum sit, sed quod habeat mirabilem potentiam, quae sit prima omnium entium. Illud enim quod potest esse sine aliis, et alia non possunt esse sine eo, videtur esse primum. Locus autem secundum eos potest esse sine corporibus: quod exinde coniiciebant, quia videmus locum remanere destructis locatis. Res autem non possunt esse sine loco. Relinquitur igitur secundum eos, quod locus sit primum inter omnia entia.
          <td>414. Secondly, [284] to confirm the same point he uses the opinion of Hesiod, who was one of the ancient theological poets. It was he who taught that the first thing made was chaos. For he said that the first of all things made was chaos, it being a sort of confusion and a receptacle for bodies; later the extended earth was made to receive various bodies—as if first a receptacle of things had to exist before the things themselves could exist. And he and others posited this because, with many others, they believed that all things that exist are in place. And if this is true, it follows that place not only exists but that it has a remarkable power in that it is the first of all beings. For that can exist without other things but they not without it, seems to be first. But according to them place can exist without bodies—a conjecture they made by observing that place remains even when the things occupying it are destroyed. But things cannot exist without place. It follows, therefore, according to them, that place is the first among all beings.

            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">οὐ μὴν ἀλλ' ἔχει γε ἀπορίαν, εἰ ἔστι, τί ἐστι, πότερον ὄγκος τις σώματος ἤ τις ἑτέρα φύσις· ζητητέον γὰρ τὸ γένος αὐτοῦ πρῶτον. διαστήματα μὲν οὖν ἔχει τρία, μῆκος καὶ πλάτος καὶ βάθος, οἷς ὁρίζεται σῶμα πᾶν. ἀδύνατον δὲ σῶμα εἶναι τὸν τόπον· ἐν ταὐτῷ γὰρ ἂν εἴη δύο σώματα.
            <td>True, but even if we suppose its existence settled, the question of its nature presents difficulty—whether it is some sort of 'bulk' of body or some entity other than that, for we must first determine its genus. (1) Now it has three dimensions, length, breadth, depth, the dimensions by which all body also is bounded. But the place cannot be body; for if it were there would be two bodies in the same place.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ἔτι εἴπερ ἔστι σώματος τόπος καὶ χώρα, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ ἐπιφανείας καὶ τῶν λοιπῶν περάτων· ὁ γὰρ αὐτὸς ἁρμόσει λόγος· ὅπου γὰρ ἦν πρότερον τὰ τοῦ ὕδατος ἐπίπεδα, ἔσται πάλιν τὰ τοῦ ἀέρος. ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδεμίαν διαφορὰν ἔχομεν στιγμῆς καὶ τόπου στιγμῆς, ὥστ' εἰ μηδὲ ταύτης ἕτερόν ἐστιν ὁ τόπος, οὐδὲ τῶν ἄλλων οὐδενός, οὐδ' ἐστί τι παρ' ἕκαστον τούτων ὁ τόπος.
            <td>(2) Further, if body has a place and space, clearly so too have surface and the other limits of body; for the same statement will apply to them: where the bounding planes of the water were, there in turn will be those of the air. But when we come to a point we cannot make a distinction between it and its place. Hence if the place of a point is not different from the point, no more will that of any of the others be different, and place will not be something different from each of them.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">τί γὰρ ἄν ποτε καὶ θείημεν εἶναι τὸν τόπον; οὔτε γὰρ στοιχεῖον οὔτ' ἐκ στοιχείων οἷόν τε εἶναι τοιαύτην ἔχοντα φύσιν, οὔτε τῶν σω ματικῶν οὔτε τῶν ἀσωμάτων· μέγεθος μὲν γὰρ ἔχει, σῶμα δ' οὐδέν· ἔστι δὲ τὰ μὲν τῶν αἰσθητῶν στοιχεῖα σώματα, ἐκ δὲ τῶν νοητῶν οὐδὲν γίγνεται μέγεθος.
            <td>(3) What in the world then are we to suppose place to be? If it has the sort of nature described, it cannot be an element or composed of elements, whether these be corporeal or incorporeal: for while it has size, it has not body. But the elements of sensible bodies are bodies, while nothing that has size results from a combination of intelligible elements.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ἔτι δὲ καὶ τίνος ἄν τις θείη τοῖς οὖσιν αἴτιον εἶναι τὸν τόπον; οὐδεμία γὰρ αὐτῷ ὑπάρχει αἰτία τῶν τεττάρων· οὔτε γὰρ ὡς ὕλη τῶν ὄντων (οὐδὲν γὰρ ἐξ αὐτοῦ συνέστηκεν) οὔτε ὡς εἶδος καὶ λόγος τῶν πραγμάτων οὔθ' ὡς τέλος, οὔτε κινεῖ τὰ ὄντα.
            <td>(4) Also we may ask: of what in things is space the cause? None of the four modes of causation can be ascribed to it. It is neither in the sense of the matter of existents (for nothing is composed of it), nor as the form and definition of things, nor as end, nor does it move existents.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ἔτι δὲ καὶ αὐτὸς εἰ ἔστι τι τῶν ὄντων, ποὺ ἔσται. ἡ γὰρ Ζήνωνος ἀπορία ζητεῖ τινὰ λόγον· εἰ γὰρ πᾶν τὸ ὂν ἐν τόπῳ, δῆλον ὅτι καὶ τοῦ τόπου τόπος ἔσται, καὶ τοῦτο εἰς ἄπειρον.
            <td>(5) Further, too, if it is itself an existent, where will it be? Zeno's difficulty demands an explanation: for if everything that exists has a place, place too will have a place, and so on ad infinitum.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ἔτι ὥσπερ ἅπαν σῶμα ἐν τόπῳ, οὕτω καὶ ἐν τόπῳ ἅπαντι σῶμα· πῶς οὖν ἐροῦμεν περὶ τῶν αὐξανομένων; ἀνάγκη γὰρ ἐκ τούτων συναύξεσθαι αὐτοῖς τὸν τόπον, εἰ μήτ' ἐλάττων μήτε μείζων ὁ τόπος ἑκάστου. διὰ μὲν οὖν τούτων οὐ μόνον τί ἐστιν, ἀλλὰ καὶ εἰ ἔστιν, ἀπορεῖν ἀναγκαῖον.
            <td>(6) Again, just as every body is in place, so, too, every place has a body in it. What then shall we say about growing things? It follows from these premisses that their place must grow with them, if their place is neither less nor greater than they are. By asking these questions, then, we must raise the whole problem about place—not only as to what it is, but even whether there is such a thing.

          <td>Postquam philosophus posuit rationes ad ostendendum quod locus sit, hic ponit sex rationes ad ostendendum quod locus non sit. Principium autem ad investigandum de aliquo an sit, oportet accipere quid sit, saltem quid significetur per nomen. Et ideo dicit quod quamvis ostensum sit quod locus sit, tamen habet defectum, idest dubitationem, quid est, etsi est: utrum scilicet sit quaedam moles corporea, aut aliqua natura alterius generis.
          <td>415. After giving reasons to show that place exists, the Philosopher now gives six reasons showing that place does not exist. Now the way to begin investigating the question “whether a thing exists” is to settle on “what it is,” at least as to what its name means. Therefore he says [285] that although it has been shown that place exists, there is a difficulty, i.e., a question, about what it is, even if it does exist: Is it a bodily mass or a nature of some other kind?
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ex hoc sic argumentatur. Si locus est aliquid, oportet quod sit corpus: quia locus habet tres dimensiones, scilicet longitudinis, latitudinis et profunditatis: his autem determinatur corpus; quia omne quod habet tres dimensiones, est corpus. Sed impossibile est locum esse corpus: quia cum locus et locatum sint simul, sequeretur duo corpora esse simul; quod est inconveniens. Ergo impossibile est locum aliquid esse.
          <td>416. Hence, he argues thus: If place is anything it must be a body; for place has three dimensions, namely, length, width and depth; and such things determine a body because whatever has three dimensions is body. But place cannot be a body, because, since place and the body in it are together, there would be two bodies together, which is unacceptable. Therefore, it is impossible for place to be anything.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius, si vere corporis locus est etc.: quae talis est. Si locus corporis vere est quoddam receptaculum corporis aliud a corpore, oportet quod etiam superficiei sit aliquod receptaculum aliud ab ipsa: et similiter est de aliis terminis quantitatis, quae sunt linea et punctus. Et hanc conditionalem sic probat. Propter hoc enim ostendebatur locus esse alius a corporibus, quia ubi nunc est corpus aeris, ibi prius erat corpus aquae: sed similiter ubi prius erat superficies aquae, nunc est superficies aeris: ergo locus superficiei est aliud a superficie. Et similis ratio est de linea et puncto.
          <td>417. He gives a second reason [286]: If the place of a body is a receptacle distinct from the body, then the place of its surface must be a receptacle distinct from this surface, and similarly for the other limits of quantity, such as the line and the point. He proves this conditional proposition in the following manner: Place was proved to be distinct from bodies on the ground that where the body of air now is, there was the body of water previously; but similarly where the surface of the water was, there is now the surface of the air; therefore the place of the surface is distinct from the surface and the same holds for the line and the point.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Argumentatur ergo a destructione consequentis, per hoc quod non potest esse aliqua differentia loci puncti a puncto: quia, cum locus non excedat locatum, locus puncti non potest esse nisi aliquod indivisibile. Duo autem indivisibilia quantitatis, ut duo puncta simul coniuncta, non sunt nisi unum: ergo eadem ratione neque locus superficiei erit aliud a superficie, neque locus corporis erit aliud a corpore.
          <td>He argues therefore by the destruction of the consequent, starting from the fact that there can be no difference between the place of this point itself. For, since a place is not greater than the thing in place, the place of a point can be only an indivisible. Now two quantitative indivisibles, e.g., two points joined together, are just one point. For the same reason, therefore, neither the place of the surface will be different from the surface itself, nor the place of the body different from the body itself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: quid enim forte ponemus esse locum? et cetera: quae talis est. Omne quod est, vel est elementum, vel est ex elementis; sed locus neutrum horum est; ergo locus non est. Mediam probat sic. Omne quod est elementum vel ex elementis, est de numero corporeorum vel incorporeorum; sed locus non est de numero incorporeorum, quia habet magnitudinem; nec de numero corporeorum quia non est corpus, ut probatum est; ergo neque est elementum, neque ex elementis.
          <td>418. He gives a third reason [287]: whatever is, either in an element or composed of elements; but place is neither of these; therefore place does not exist. The middle [minor] premise he proves thus: Whatever is an element or composed of elements is either corporeal or incorporeal; but place is not incorporeal, for it has magnitude, nor is it corporeal, because it is not a body, as we have already shown. Therefore it is neither an element nor composed of elements.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quia posset aliquis dicere quod, licet non sit corpus, est tamen elementum corporeum; ad hoc excludendum subiungit quod sensibilium corporum sunt elementa corporea: quia elementa non sunt extra genus elementatorum. Nam ex intelligibilibus principiis, quae sunt incorporea, non constituitur aliqua magnitudo. Unde si locus non sit corpus, non potest esse elementum corporeum.
          <td>Now since someone might say that even though it is not a body, it is nevertheless a bodily element, he excludes this by adding that all sensible bodies have corporeal elements, because the elements are not outside the genus of their compounds. For no magnitude results from intelligible principles which are incorporeal. Hence if place is not a body, it cannot be a corporeal element.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit ibi: amplius et cuius utique etc.: quae talis est. Omne quod est, aliquo modo est causa respectu alicuius; sed locus non potest esse causa secundum aliquem quatuor modorum. Neque enim est causa sicut materia, quia ea quae sunt non constituuntur ex loco, quod est de ratione materiae; neque sicut causa formalis, quia tunc omnia quae habent unum locum, essent unius speciei, cum principium speciei sit forma; neque iterum sicut causa finalis rerum, quia magis videntur esse loca propter locata, quam locata propter loca; neque iterum est causa efficiens vel motiva, cum sit terminus motus. Videtur igitur quod locus nihil sit.
          <td>419. He gives the fourth reason [288]: Everything that exists is somehow a cause in relation to something else; but place cannot be a cause in any of the four ways. It is not a cause as matter, because things that exist are not composed out of place and that is implied in the very notion of matter, nor is it a formal cause, for then all things that have the same place would be of the same species, since the principle of the species is the form. It is not like the final cause in things, since places seem to be for the sake of the things in place rather than they for the sake of the places. Finally, it is not an efficient or moving cause, since place is the terminus of a motion. Therefore it seems place is nothing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quintam rationem ponit ibi: amplius et ipse, si est aliquid eorum etc., quae est ratio Zenonis: et est talis. Omne quod est, est in loco; si igitur locus est aliquid, sequitur quod sit in loco, et ille locus in alio loco, et sic in infinitum: quod est impossibile; ergo locus non est aliquid.
          <td>420. He gives the fifth reason [289], which is Zeno’s reason: Whatever exists is in place; hence if place is anything it follows that it is itself in place and that place in another place and so on ad infinitum. But this is impossible; consequently, place is not anything.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit ibi: amplius, sicut omne corpus etc.: quae talis est. Omne corpus est in loco, et in omni loco est corpus, ut a multis probabiliter existimatur: ex quo accipitur quod locus non sit minor neque maior quam locatum. Cum ergo locatum crescit, oportet quod crescat et locus; sed hoc videtur impossibile, cum locus sit quoddam immobile; non ergo locus aliquid est.
          <td>421. He gives the sixth reason [290]: Every body is in a place and in every place is a body (according to the opinion of many). From this it is taken that place is neither smaller nor larger than the thing in place. When therefore a thing in place grows, its place also should grow. However, this seems impossible, for place is an immobile something. Therefore place is not anything.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ultimo epilogat quod per huiusmodi rationes non solum dubitatur quid sit locus, sed etiam an sit. Huiusmodi autem rationes solventur per ea quae sequuntur.
          <td>In summary he says that for reasons of this sort doubts are raised not only as to the nature of place, but also as to its very existence. However, these reasons will be answered by what follows.

            <td>We may distinguish generally between predicating B of A because it (A) is itself, and because it is something else; and particularly between place which is common and in which all bodies are, and the special place occupied primarily by each. I mean, for instance, that you are now in the heavens because you are in the air and it is in the heavens; and you are in the air because you are on the earth; and similarly on the earth because you are in this place which contains no more than you. Now if place is what primarily contains each body, it would be a limit, so that the place would be the form or shape of each body by which the magnitude or the matter of the magnitude is defined: for this is the limit of each body. If, then, we look at the question in this way the place of a thing is its form.
          <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
            <td style="font-family:" palatino="">ᾗ δὲ δοκεῖ ὁ τόπος εἶναι τὸ διάστημα τοῦ μεγέθους, ἡ ὕλη· τοῦτο γὰρ ἕτερον τοῦ μεγέθους, τοῦτο δ' ἐστὶ τὸ περιεχόμενον ὑπὸ τοῦ εἴδους καὶ ὡρισμένον, οἷον ὑπὸ ἐπιπέδου καὶ πέρατος, ἔστι δὲ τοιοῦτον ἡ ὕλη καὶ τὸ ἀόριστον· ὅταν γὰρ ἀφαιρεθῇ τὸ πέρας καὶ τὰ πάθη τῆς σφαίρας, λείπεται οὐδὲν παρὰ τὴν ὕλην. διὸ καὶ Πλάτων τὴν ὕλην καὶ τὴν χώραν ταὐτό φησιν εἶναι ἐν τῷ Τιμαίῳ· τὸ γὰρ μεταληπτικὸν καὶ τὴν χώραν ἓν καὶ ταὐτόν. ἄλλον δὲ τρόπον ἐκεῖ τε λέγων τὸ μεταληπτικὸν καὶ ἐν τοῖς λεγομένοις ἀγράφοις δόγμασιν, ὅμως τὸν τόπον καὶ τὴν χώραν τὸ αὐτὸ ἀπεφήνατο. λέγουσι μὲν γὰρ πάντες εἶναί τι τὸν τόπον, τί δ' ἐστίν, οὗτος μόνος ἐπεχείρησεν εἰπεῖν.
            <td>But, if we regard the place as the extension of the magnitude, it is the matter. For this is different from the magnitude: it is what is contained and defined by the form, as by a bounding plane. Matter or the indeterminate is of this nature; when the boundary and attributes of a sphere are taken away, nothing but the matter is left. This is why Plato in the Timaeus says that matter and space are the same; for the 'participant' and space are identical. (It is true, indeed, that the account he gives there of the 'participant' is different from what he says in his so-called 'unwritten teaching'. Nevertheless, he did identify place and space.) I mention Plato because, while all hold place to be something, he alone tried to say what it is.

            <td>In view of these facts we should naturally expect to find difficulty in determining what place is, if indeed it is one of these two things, matter or form. They demand a very close scrutiny, especially as it is not easy to recognize them apart.

As we pointed out, where air was, water in turn comes to be, the one replacing the other; and similarly with other bodies. Hence the place of a thing is neither a part nor a state of it, but is separable from it. For place is supposed to be something like a vessel—the vessel being a transportable place. But the vessel is no part of the thing.

It is impossible that what has no reference to motion or the distinction of up and down can be place. So place must be looked for among things which have these characteristics. If the place is in the thing (it must be if it is either shape or matter) place will have a place: for both the form and the indeterminate undergo change and motion along with the thing, and are not always in the same place, but are where the thing is.

Now common place is so called only <i>per accidens</i> and in relation to a previous place. He explains this thus: “I can say that you are in the heavens, because you are in the air which is in the heavens, and that you are in the air and in the heavens, because you are on earth and you are said to be on earth, because you are in a place containing nothing but you.”

          <td>Sic ergo illud quod primo et per se continet unumquodque, est per se locus eius; huiusmodi autem est terminus ad quem res terminatur; sequitur ergo quod locus proprie et per se sit terminus rei. Forma autem est terminus uniuscuiusque: quia per formam terminatur materia uniuscuiusque ad proprium esse, et magnitudo ad determinatam mensuram: quantitates enim rerum consequuntur formas earum. Videtur igitur secundum hanc considerationem, quod locus sit forma.
          <td>424. Consequently, what contains a thing primarily and <i>per se</i> is its <i>per se</i> place. Now such a place is the boundary at which a thing is terminated. Therefore, place is properly and <i>per se</i> a boundary of a thing. But the boundary of each thing is its form, because it is through the form that the matter of anything is limited to its own existence and magnitude to a determinate measure. For the quantities of things follow upon their forms. According to this, therefore, it seems that place is the form.

          <td>Sed sciendum est quod in hac ratione est sophisma consequentis: syllogizatur enim in secunda figura ex duabus affirmativis.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: secundum autem quod videtur esse locus etc., ponit rationem Platonis, per quam sibi videbatur quod locus esset materia. Ad cuius evidentiam sciendum est quod antiqui putaverunt locum esse spatium quod est inter terminos rei continentis, quod quidem habet dimensiones longitudinis, latitudinis et profunditatis. Non tamen huiusmodi spatium videbatur esse idem cum aliquo corporum sensibilium: quia recedentibus et advenientibus diversis corporibus sensibilibus, remanet idem spatium. Secundum hoc ergo sequitur quod locus sit dimensiones separatae.
          <td>425. Then [292] he gives a reason of Plato through which it seemed to him that place is matter. To see this, one must note that the ancients thought that place was the space enveloped by the boundaries of the container, which has the dimensions of length, breadth, and depth. But this space did not seem to be the same as any sensible body, because the space remained the same even when various bodies successively entered it and left. Thus it follows that place is a set of separate dimensions.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ex hoc volebat syllogizare Plato quod locus esset materia. Et hoc est quod dicit, quod secundum quod locus videtur aliquibus esse distantia magnitudinis spatii, separata a quolibet corpore sensibili, videbatur quod locus esset materia. Ipsa namque distantia vel dimensio magnitudinis, altera est a magnitudine. Nam magnitudo significat aliquid terminatum aliqua specie, sicut linea terminatur punctis, et superficies linea, et corpus superficie, quae sunt species magnitudinis: sed dimensio spatii est contenta sub forma et determinata, sicut corpus determinatur plano, idest superficie, ut quodam termino. Id autem quod continetur sub terminis, videtur esse in se non determinatum. Quod autem est in se non determinatum, sed determinatur per formam et terminum, est materia, quae habet rationem infiniti: quia si ab aliquo corpore sphaerico removeantur passiones sensibiles et termini quibus figuratur dimensio magnitudinis, nihil relinquitur nisi materia. Unde relinquitur quod ipsae dimensiones ex se indeterminatae, quae per aliud determinantur, sint ipsa materia.
          <td>426. From this Plato wished to demonstrate that place is matter. This is what he [Aristotle] says: Because some consider that place is the distance of the magnitude of space distinct from every sensible body, place would seem to be matter. For the distance or dimension of a magnitude is distinct from the magnitude. For magnitude signifies something terminated by some species [or form], as a line is terminated by points, and a surface by line, and a body by surface, and these are species of magnitude. But the dimension of space is contained under a determined form as a body is determined by a plane, i.e., by a surface, as, by a definite boundary. Now whatever is contained under boundaries seems to be in itself not determined. What is not determined in itself but by a form and boundary is matter which has the nature of the infinite. For were we to remove from some spherical body its sensible qualities and the boundaries by which the dimension of its magnitude acquires its definite figure, nothing would remain but the matter. Consequently the dimensions themselves, which are not determined by themselves but by something else, are matter.

          <td>Et hoc praecipue sequebatur secundum radices Platonis, qui ponebat numeros et quantitates esse substantias rerum.
          <td>This followed mainly from the underlying principles of Plato, who posited numbers and quantities as the substance of things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quia igitur locus est dimensiones, et dimensiones sunt materia, dicebat Plato in Timaeo, quod idem est locus et materia. Omne enim receptivum alicuius dicebat esse locum, non distinguens inter receptibilitatem loci et materiae: unde cum materia sit receptivum formarum, sequitur quod materia sit locus.
          <td>427. Therefore, because place is dimensions and dimensions are matter, Plato said in the <i>Timaeus</i> that place and matter are the same. For he said that whatever is a receptacle of anything is a place (failing to distinguish between the receptiveness of place and of matter). Hence, since matter receives form, it follows that matter is place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tamen sciendum est quod de receptivo diversimode Plato loquebatur: quia in Timaeo dixit receptivum esse materiam; in dogmatibus autem dictis et non scriptis, idest cum verbotenus docebat in scholis, dicebat receptivum esse magnum et parvum, quae etiam ex parte materiae ponebat, ut supra dictum est. Tamen, cuicumque attribueret esse receptivum, semper dicebat quod receptivum et locus sint idem. Sic igitur, cum multi dicerent locum esse aliquid, solus Plato conatus est assignare quid sit locus.
          <td>Yet it should be noted that Plato spoke in various ways about receptacles: for in the <i>Timaeus</i> he said that the receptacle is matter but in his “unwritten teaching,” i.e., his oral teaching in the schools, he said that the receptacle was “the large and the small,” which however he allied with matter, as we have said above. Yet no matter to what he attributed receptivity, he always said that the receptacle and place are the same. Therefore, while many did say that place is something, Plato alone endeavored to say what place is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: merito autem ex his intendentibus etc., concludit ex praedictis, quod si locus est vel materia vel forma, rationabile videtur quod difficile sit cognoscere quid sit locus: quia tam materia quam forma habent altissimam speculationem et difficilem; et non est facile etiam cognoscere unum eorum sine altero.
          <td>428. Then [293] he concludes from the foregoing that if place is either matter or form, it seems reasonable to say that it is difficult to know what place is: because both matter and form involve very lofty and difficult speculation; moreover, it is not easy to know either of them without the other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: at vero quod impossibile sit etc., ponit quinque rationes in contrarium. Circa quarum primam dicit, quod non est difficile videre locum non esse materiam vel formam: quia forma et materia non separantur a re cuius sunt; sed locum contingit separari, quia in loco in quo erat aer, postea est aqua; et etiam alia corpora ad invicem transmutant locum. Unde manifestum est quod locus non est pars rei ut materia vel forma. Neque est etiam habitus, seu quodcumque accidens: quia partes et accidentia non sunt separabilia a re; sed locus est separabilis. Et hoc manifestat per exemplum: quia locus videtur comparari ad locatum sicut quoddam vas; sed in hoc tantum differt, quod locus est immobilis, vas autem mobile, ut infra exponetur. Sic igitur per hoc quod locus est separabilis, ostenditur quod locus non sit forma. Sed quod locus non sit materia, ostenditur non solum per hoc quod est separabilis, sed etiam per hoc quod continet: materia autem non continet, sed continetur.
          <td>429. Then [294] he gives five reasons to the contrary. In the first of these he says that it is not difficult to see that place is neither matter nor form. For form and matter are not separate from the thing of which they are components, whereas place can be separated—in the place where air was, water now is. In like manner, other bodies also mutually change place. Hence it is clear that place is not part of a thing, as matter or form. Nor is place an accident of a thing, because parts and accidents are nor separable from a thing, whereas place is separable. He shows this by an example: place seems to be related to the thing in place as a vessel, the only difference being that place is immobile and the vessel mobile, as will be explained below (L.6). Consequently, since place is separable, it is not form. But that place is not matter is shown not only by the fact that it is separable, but also by the fact that it contains, whereas matter does not contain but is contained.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: videtur autem semper et cetera. Quia enim ostenderat quod locus non est materia nec forma, per hoc quod locus separatur a locato, vult ostendere quod etiam si locus nunquam separaretur a locato, ex hoc ipso quod dicimus aliquid esse in loco, apparet quod locus non est forma neque materia: quia omne quod dicitur esse alicubi, videtur et ipsum esse aliquid, et alterum aliquid esse ab eo in quo est. Unde cum aliquid dicitur esse in loco, sequitur quod locus sit extra locatum. Materia autem et forma non sunt extra rem: ergo neque materia neque forma est locus.
          <td>430. He now gives a second reason [295]. Since he had shown that place is neither matter nor form on the ground that place is separated from the thing in place, he now wishes to show that even if place were never separated from the thing in place, yet the very fact that we say something is in place shows that place is neither form nor matter. For whatever is said to be anywhere seems both to be something and to be distinct from that in which it is. Hence, when something is said to be in place, it follows that place is outside the thing, whereas matter and form are not outside the thing. Therefore, neither matter nor form is place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: Platoni igitur dicendum est et cetera. Hic arguit specialiter contra positionem Platonis digrediendo. Dictum est enim supra in tertio, quod Plato posuit ideas et numeros non esse in loco. Sequebatur autem, secundum eius sententiam de loco, quod essent in loco: quia omne participatum est in participante; species autem et numeros ponebat participari, sive a materia, sive a magno et parvo. Sequitur ergo quod species et numeri sint in materia, sive in magno et parvo. Si igitur materia, vel magnum et parvum est locus, sequitur quod numeri et species sint in loco.
          <td>431. In the third reason [296] he makes a digression to argue specifically against the position of Plato. For it was said in Book III that Plato posited ideas and numbers as not in place. But logically, according to his opinion about place, they should be in place, because whatever is participated is in the participant—and he said that species and numbers are participated either by matter or by “the large and the small.” Accordingly, species and number exist in matter or in “the large and small,” Therefore, if matter or “the large and the small” are place, it follows that numbers and species are in place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit ibi: amplius quomodo ferretur et cetera. Circa quam dicit quod non poterit convenienter assignari quomodo aliquid moveatur secundum locum, si materia et forma sint locus. Impossibile est enim assignare locum in iis quae non moventur sursum vel deorsum, vel quomodocumque aliter secundum locum; unde in illis quaerendus est locus, quae secundum locum moventur. Sed si in ipso quod movetur est locus quasi aliquid ei intrinsecum (quod oportet dicere si materia vel forma sit locus), sequitur quod locus erit in loco: quia omne quod transmutatur secundum locum, est in loco; sed ea quae sunt in re ut species et infinitum, idest materia, moventur simul cum re, quia non semper sunt in eodem loco, sed sunt ubi est res. Ergo oportet quod materia et forma sint in loco. Si igitur alterum eorum sit locus, sequitur quod locus sit in loco, quod est inconveniens.
          <td>432. He gives the fourth reason [297]. In this regard he says that no good explanation could be given of how something could be moved according to place, if matter and form are place. For it is impossible to assign a place in things that are not moved up or down or in any direction of place; hence place must be sought in things that are moved according to place. But if place is something intrinsic to what is moved (which would be the case if matter or form were place), it follows that place will be in a place, for whatever is changed in respect to place is itself in place. Now whatever is in a thing, such as its species and the infinite, i.e., its matter, is moved with the thing, since they are not always in the same place, but are wherever the thing is. Therefore, matter and form must be in a place. Therefore, if either of them is place, it follows that place is in a place, which is unacceptable.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quintam rationem ponit ibi: amplius cum ex aere fit aqua etc.: quae talis est. Quandocumque aliquid corrumpitur, corrumpuntur aliquo modo partes speciei ipsius; materia autem et forma sunt partes speciei; ergo corrupta re, ad minus per accidens forma et materia corrumpuntur. Si igitur materia et forma sit locus, sequitur quod locus corrumpatur, si locus pertinet ad speciem: quia corpus quod generatur non esset in eodem loco, si locus aeris pertineret ad speciem eius, sicut cum aqua generatur ex aere. Sed non est assignare qualiter locus corrumpatur: ergo non potest dici quod materia vel forma sit locus.
          <td>433. The fifth reason is then given [298]. Whenever anything is corrupted, the parts of its species are somehow corrupted. Now matter and form are the parts of the species. Therefore, when the thing corrupts, then, at least <i>per accidens</i> , the matter and form are corrupted. Consequently, if matter and form are place, it follows that place is corrupted, if place pertains to the species. Now the body which is generated would not be in the same place, if the place of air pertained to the species of the air, as when water is generated from air. But no explanation can be given of how place is corrupted; hence it cannot be said that matter or form are place.

Et isto secundo modo potest dici aliquid esse in seipso. Cum enim alicuius totius duae partes ita se habeant quod una sit in quo est aliquid, et alia sit quod est in illa, sequitur quod totum dicatur et in quo est ratione unius partis, et quod est in hoc ratione alterius: et sic totum dicetur esse in seipso.
          <td>He says first, therefore [301] that something may be understood to be in itself in two ways: in one way, primarily and per se; in another way, in relation to something else, i.e., in relation to a part. And it is in this second way that something may be said to be in itself. For when two parts of some whole are so related that one part is that in which the other exists and the other is that which is in the first, it follows that the whole is both that “in which” something exists (by reason of one part) and that which is “in this” (by reason of the other), and thus is the whole said to be in itself.

          <td>For we observe that something is said of something according to a part, for example, someone is called “white” because his surface is white, and a man is called “knowing” because science is in his rational part. If therefore we take a jug full of wine as a certain “whole” whose parts are jug and wine, neither of the parts will exist in itself, i.e., neither the jug nor the wine, but this whole, which is a jug of wine, will be in itself inasmuch as each is a part of it, i.e., both the wine which is in the jug and the jug in which the wine is. It is in this way, therefore, that one and the same thing can be in itself.

Et similiter scientia primo dicitur esse in anima, non autem in homine, in quo est per animam. Et secundum hoc, scilicet secundum animam et superficiem, sunt appellationes quibus nominatur homo albus vel sciens, cum anima et superficies sint sicut partes in homine: non quod superficies sit pars, sed quia se habet ad modum partis, inquantum est aliquid hominis, ut terminus corporis.
          <td>He says, therefore, that there is no case of anything being primarily in itself. And he makes clear what it is for something to be primarily in itself by citing an example of the opposite. For something white is said to be in a body, because the surface is in the body: hence the white is nor primarily in the body but in the surface. In like manner, science is said to be primarily in the soul, and not in the man, in whom science exists by reason of the soul. And it is according to this, i.e., according to the soul and the surface, that the appellations whereby a man is called “white” or “knowing” are verified, since the soul and the surface are as parts of man—not that the surface is a part, but it is like a part, inasmuch as it is something of the man, as The boundary of his body.

But when they are together, as when a jug is full of wine, then because both jug and wine are parts, the same thing will be existing in itself (as was explained above), not primarily but through its parts, just as white is not primarily in the man but is there through the body, and in the body through the surface. But it is not in the surface through anything else; hence it is said to be in the surface primarily. Nor is that in which something exists primarily, and that which is in it, the same, as in the case of white and surface. For surface and white are specifically different, and the nature and potency of each is different.

          <td>And he explains the first point in two ways: namely, inductively and with an argument. He says therefore first, that by considering inductively all the ways determined above in which something is said to be in itself, it is found that nothing exists in itself primarily and <i>per se</i> : for nothing is the totality of itself, [i.e., in itself as whole in part?], nor as part [in whole?] as genus [in species?], and so on. He lays this down by concluding from what has gone before, because just as it is clear in the case of the white and of the surface (which are related as form and matter) that they differ both in species and in power, the same thing can be considered in all the other modes.

Unde hoc posito, scilicet quod vinum sit amphora et vinum, et amphora sit vinum et amphora, si quis dicat quod alterum eorum sit in altero, ut puta vinum in amphora, sequitur quod vinum recipiatur in amphora non inquantum vinum est, sed inquantum vinum est illa, scilicet amphora. Quare, si esse in amphora primo et per se convenit amphorae ex eo quod ponitur aliquid primo et per se in seipso esse, sequitur quod nihil possit dici esse in amphora, nisi inquantum ipsum est amphora. Et sic, si vinum dicatur esse in amphora, sequitur quod esse in amphora competit vino, non secundum quod vinum est vinum, sed secundum quod vinum est amphora.
          <td>441. Then [304] he proves the same thing with an argument and says that it is clear by reasoning that it is impossible for anything to be primarily and <i>per se</i> in itself. For if there be anything such, necessarily the same thing, in the same way, will have the notion both of that in which something is, and that which is in it. Hence, each would have to be both the container and the content; for example, the jug would be the vessel and the wine, and the wine both the wine and jug, if something could be primarily and <i>per se</i> in itself. Now on this assumption (namely, that the wine is both the jug and wine, and the jug both wine and jug), if anyone were to say that either is in the other, for example, that the wine is in the jug, it would follow that the wine is received into the jug not inasmuch it is wine, but inasmuch as wine <u>is</u> the jug. Wherefore, if to be in the jug primarily and <i>per se</i> is a property of the jug (on the assumption that something is primarily and per se in itself), it follows that nothing can be said to be in the jug except inasmuch as that something is the jug. And so, if the wine is said to be in the jug, it follows that to be in the jug belongs to the wine, not inasmuch as it is wine, but inasmuch as the wine is the jug.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et eadem ratione, si amphora recipiat vinum, recipiet ipsum non inquantum amphora est amphora, sed inquantum amphora est vinum. Hoc autem est inconveniens. Unde manifestum est, quod secundum alteram rationem est id in quo, et quod in hoc. Alia est enim ratio eius quod est in aliquo, et eius in quo est aliquid. Non potest ergo per se et primo aliquid esse in seipso.
          <td>For the same reason, if the jug receives the wine, it will receive it not inasmuch as the jug is jug but inasmuch as the jug is wine. Now this is unacceptable. Hence, it is clear that it is under different aspects that something is “that in which” and “that which is in.” For it is one thing to be that which is in something, and another to be that in which something is. Consequently, nothing can be primarily and <i>per se</i> in itself.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: at vero neque secundum accidens etc., ostendit quod non sit aliquid primo in seipso etiam secundum accidens. Dicitur enim aliquid esse in aliquo secundum accidens, quando est in eo propter aliquid aliud in eo existens; ut si dicamus hominem esse in mari, quia est in navi, quae est in mari: in hac tamen primo dicitur esse, idest non propter partem. Si igitur contingat aliquid esse in seipso primo, non per se quidem, sed per accidens, sequitur quod sit in seipso propter hoc quod aliquid aliud sit in ipso. Et sic sequitur quod duo corpora sint in eodem, scilicet illud corpus quod est in eo, et ipsummet quod est in seipso. Sic enim amphora erit in seipsa per accidens, si ipsa amphora, cuius natura est ut recipiat aliquid, sit in seipsa, et iterum illud cuius est receptivum, scilicet vinum: ergo in amphora erit et amphora et vinum, si propter hoc quod vinum est in amphora, sequitur amphoram esse in seipsa: et sic duo corpora essent in eodem. Sic igitur patet quod impossibile est aliquid esse primo in seipso.
          <td>442. Then [305] he shows that nothing exists primarily in itself even according to accident. For something is said to be in something according to accident, when it is in it on account of something else existing in it; as, for example, when we say that a man is in the sea because he is in a boat which is in the sea: he is nevertheless said to be in the boat primarily, i.e., not according to a part. If therefore something could be in itself primarily, though not <i>per se</i> but <i>per accidens</i> , it would be in itself on account of something else being in it. And so it follows that two bodies are in the same thing; namely, the body which is in something and that same thing as existing in itself. In this way a jug will be in itself <i>per accidens</i> , if the jug itself, whose nature it is to receive something, is in itself, and again that which it receives, i.e., the wine. Therefore, in the jug will exist both jug and wine, if, because the wine is in the jug it follows that the jug is in itself; and so two bodies would be in the same. Consequently, it is clearly impossible for anything to be primarily in itself.

          <td>443. Then [306] he settles certain doubts. First he destroys Zeno’s reason which was appealed to as proof that place does not exist on the assumption that, if it did, it must exist in something else and so on <i>ad infinitum</i> . But this, as he says, is not difficult to answer after one knows the various ways in which something is said to be “in” something else.

          <td>444. Then [307] he also settles the doubts mentioned above about the nature of place (namely, whether it be form or matter) by appealing to his proof that nothing exists in itself primarily and <i>per se</i> . For it is clear from this proof that nothing can be the vessel or place of that which is contained in it after the manner of a part such as matter or form is: for that which is in something and that in which something is must be primarily and per se distinct, as we have shown. Hence, it follows that neither form nor matter is place; rather place is something entirely different from the thing in place, whereas matter and form belong to the thing in place as intrinsic parts thereof.

But he says this in keeping with the opinion of those who posited no body other than the four elements: for he has not yet proved the heavenly body to be neither light nor heavy—which he will prove later in <i>De Coelo</i> , I .

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum quatuor praemittit. Quorum primum est, quod nunquam fuisset inquisitum de loco, nisi esset aliquis motus secundum locum. Ex hoc enim necesse fuit ponere locum aliud a locato, quia inveniuntur in eodem loco successive duo corpora, et similiter unum corpus in duobus locis; sicut etiam transmutatio formarum circa unam materiam, induxit in cognitionem materiae. Et propter hoc maxime opinantur aliqui quod caelum sit in loco, quia semper movetur. Sed motuum aliquis est secundum locum per se, scilicet loci mutatio: alius autem ex consequenti, scilicet augmentum et decrementum; quia augmentata quantitate vel diminuta, corpus accipit maiorem vel minorem locum.
          <td>449. In regard to the first, be makes four preliminary statements, the first of which is that the question of place would never have arisen were there no motion in regard to place. For it was necessary to posit place as something distinct from the object in place, because two bodies are found successively in the same place, and, in like manner, one body successively in two places. (Similarly, it was the successive change of forms in one and the same matter that led to the knowledge of matter). For this reason some are convinced that the heavens are in place, since they are always in motion. Now, of motions, one is according to place per se, namely, the change of place; another is consequently related to place, namely, increase and decline, because as a body grows or decreases, it acquires a larger or a smaller place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum ponit ibi: est autem quod movetur aliud et cetera. Et dicit quod aliquid movetur per se in actu, sicut quodcumque corpus; aliud vero secundum accidens. Quod quidem contingit dupliciter. Quaedam enim moventur secundum accidens, quae tamen sunt possibilia moveri per se; sicut partes alicuius corporis, dum sunt in toto, moventur per accidens; sed quando separantur, moventur per se; ut clavus, quando est infixus navi, movetur per accidens, sed quando extrahitur, movetur per se. Quaedam vero non possunt moveri per se, sed semper moventur per accidens; sicut albedo et scientia, quae mutant locum inquantum mutatur illud in quo sunt. Hoc autem induxit, quia hoc modo aliquid per se vel per accidens, actu vel potentia natum est esse in loco, sicut et moveri.
          <td>450. He gives the second [311], saying that some things are moved, <i>per se</i> in act as in the case with every body, while others according to accident. This latter can occur in two ways. For some things that could be moved essentially are de facto moved accidentally, as the parts of a body while they are in the whole body are moved <i>per accidens</i> but when they are separated they are moved <i>per se</i> . Thus, a nail, when it is embedded in a ship, is moved <i>per accidens</i> , but when it is extracted it is moved <i>per se</i> . Other things are not be moved <i>per se</i> , but only <i>per accidens</i> , as is the case with whiteness and knowledge, which change place as that in which they are changes place. This point was brought up because things are apt to be in place <i>per se</i> or <i>per accidens</i> , actually or potentially in the same way as they are apt to be moved in those ways.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium ponit ibi: quoniam autem dicimus esse et cetera. Et dicit quod aliquis dicitur esse in caelo sicut in loco, propter hoc quod est in aere, qui quidem est in caelo. Nec tamen dicimus quod in toto aere sit aliquis primo et per se; sed propter ultimam extremitatem aeris, quae continet aliquem, dicitur aliquis esse in aere; quia si totus aer esset locus alicuius, puta hominis, non esset aequalis locus et locatum; quod est contra suppositionem prius positam. Sed id in quo est aliquid primo, videtur esse extremum corporis continentis, et sic est huiusmodi, scilicet aequale.
          <td>451. He gives the third [312] when he says that someone is said to be in the heavens as in a place because he is in the air which indeed is in the heavens. Yet we do not say that anyone is in the entire air primarily and <i>per se</i> , but by reason of the ultimate boundary of the air containing him he is said to be in the air. For if the whole air were anything’s place, e.g., a man’s, the place and the thing in place would not be equal—which is against what was supposed above. But that in which something exists primarily is seen to be the boundary of the containing body; and this is what primary place means, i.e., equal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartum ponit ibi: cum quidem igitur non divisum et cetera. Et primo ponit; secundo probat, ibi: et cum continuum et cetera.
          <td>452. He gives the fourth reason [313]. First, he mentions it; secondly, he proves it, at no. 453.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod cum continens non est divisum a contento, sed est ei continuum, non dicitur esse in illo sicut in loco, sed sicut pars in toto; utpote, si dicamus unam partem aeris contineri a toto aere. Et hoc concludit ex praemissis, quia ubi est continuum, ibi non est accipere ultimum in actu, quod supra dixit requiri ad locum. Sed cum continens est divisum, et contiguum contento, tunc, contentum scilicet, est in loco, existens in ultimo continentis primo et per se: illud inquam continens, quod non est pars eius, neque est maius neque minus secundum dimensionem, sed aequale. Et quomodo possint esse continens et contentum aequalia, ostendit per hoc quod ultima contingentium se sunt simul; unde oportet eorum ultima esse aequalia.
          <td>He says therefore first that whenever the container is not separate from the thing contained but is continuous with it, the latter is not said to be in it as in a place, but as a part in a whole; as, for example, when we say that one part of the air is contained by the totality of air. And he concludes this from what went before, because where there is a continuum there is no ultimate boundary in act, something that is required for place, as was stated above. But when the container is separated, and contiguous to the thing contained, this latter is in place and exists in the ultimate boundary of the container primarily and <i>per se</i> , of a container, that is, which is not a part of the contained and neither greater nor less but equal in dimension. But how the container and the thing contained can be equal he shows by pointing out that the ultimate boundaries of things touching are together: whence, their ultimate boundaries must be equal.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: et cum continuum quidem sit etc., probat istud quartum duabus rationibus. Quarum prima est, quod contentum continuum continenti, non movetur in continente, sed simul cum illo, sicut pars simul cum toto: sed quando est divisum contentum a continente, tunc potest moveri in illo, sive continens moveatur sive non; homo enim movetur in navi, vel quiescente vel mota. Cum ergo aliquid moveatur in loco, sequitur quod locus sit continens divisum.
          <td>453. Then he proves the fourth point by two arguments [314]. The first of these is that something contained that forms a continuum with the container is not moved in the container but with the container, as the part is moved simultaneously with the whole; but when it is separate from the container, then it can be moved in it, whether the container be moved or not—for a man is moved on a ship whether it be moving or at rest. Therefore, since something can be moved in a place, it follows that place is a separated container.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius, cum non divisum sit et cetera. Et dicit quod cum contentum non sit divisum a continente sed continuum ei, tunc dicitur esse in eo sicut pars in toto; ut visus est sicut pars formalis in oculo, et manus sicut pars organica in corpore: sed cum divisum est contentum a continente, tunc dicitur esse in eo ut in vase, sicut aqua in cado et vinum in scypho: quorum haec est differentia, quod manus movetur cum corpore sed non in corpore, sed aqua movetur in cado.
          <td>454. He gives a second argument for the fourth point [315], saying that when the thing contained is not separate from the container but continuous with it, then it is said to be in it as a part in a whole, as sight is in the eye as a formal part and the hand in the body as an organic part. But when the container and the thing contained are separate, then the latter is in it as in a vessel; as water in a barrel or wine in a cup.

          <td>458, In regard to the first he does two things. First [318] he sets down why form seems to be place: it is because form is a container, and this seems to be a property of place. Now the boundaries of the containing body and those of the contained are together, since the container and the contained are contiguous. Thus it does not seem that the containing boundary, which is place, is separate from that of the body contained. Consequently, there does not seem to be any difference between place and form.

          <td>Secundo, ibi: sunt quidem igitur utraque etc., ostendit quod forma non sit locus.

          <td>459. Secondly, [319], he shows that form is not place. For although place and form are alike in this, that each is a kind of boundary, nevertheless they are not the boundary of one and the same thing: for form is the boundary of the body of which it is the form, while place is not a boundary of the body of which it is the place, but of the body containing it. So, although the boundaries of the container and of the contained are together, they are not identical.

Quia si non esset ibi aliud praeter illud corpus, sequeretur quod vel locus non esset aliud a locato, vel quod id quod est medium inter extremitates continentis, non posset esse locus. Sicut autem oportet locum esse aliquid praeter corpus contentum, ita videtur quod oporteat locum esse aliquid praeter corpus continens; ex eo quod locus manet immobilis, corpus autem continens, et omne quod est in eo, contingit transmutari.

          <td>He says therefore first that frequently a body contained by place, and distinct from it, is changed from one place to another, and any number of bodies can succeed into its original place (but always in such a way that the container remains immobile) in the way that water goes out of a vessel. For this reason it seems that place is some middle space between the boundaries of the containing body, as though there were something there besides the body moved from one place to another. For if nothing were there besides the contained body, it would follow either that place is not distinct from the thing in place, or that what exists within the confines of the container’s boundaries cannot be place. Now just as place must be something over and above the contained body, so it must be something other than the containing body, due to the fact that place remains immobile, whereas the containing body and everything in it can be changed about. But in addition to the containing body and the contained body there is nothing present except the dimensions of space, which exist in no body. Consequently, because place is immobile, it seems that space is place.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: hoc autem non est etc., ostendit quod spatium non sit locus, duabus rationibus. Circa quarum primam dicit, quod hoc non est verum, quod aliquid sit ibi infra extremitates corporis continentis, praeter corpus contentum, quod transfertur de loco in locum: sed infra illas extremitates corporis continentis incidit aliquod corpus, quodcumque illud esse contingat, ita tamen quod sit de numero corporum mobilium, et iterum de numero eorum quae sunt apta nata tangere corpus continens. Sed si posset esse aliquod spatium continens medium, praeter dimensiones corporis contenti, quod semper maneret in eodem loco, sequeretur hoc inconveniens, quod infinita loca simul essent. Et hoc ideo, quia cum aqua et aer habeant proprias distantias, et quodlibet corpus, et quaelibet pars corporis; omnes partes idem facient in toto quod tota aqua facit in vase. Secundum vero eorum positionem qui tenent sententiam de spatio, dum tota aqua est in vase, sunt ibi aliae dimensiones spatii praeter dimensiones aquae. Omnis autem pars continetur a toto sicut locatum a vase: nec differt nisi solum quantum ad hoc, quod pars non est divisa, locatum autem est divisum. Si ergo pars dividatur in actu, sequetur quod sint ibi aliae dimensiones totius continentis praeter dimensiones partis.
          <td>461. Then [321] he shows that space is not place by two arguments. As to the first of these, he states it is not true that there is anything within the confines of the containing body other than the contained body which is transferred from place to place. Rather, within the confines of the containing body there happens a body of some kind, having, nevertheless, the following two characteristics: that it be a mobile body, and be naturally apt to touch the containing body. But if, in addition to the dimensions of the contained body, there were present a space which always remained in the same place, the embarrassing conclusion would follow that there would be infinite places together. The reason is because water and air have their own dimensions, and so does each body, and each part of a body. Now all these parts will do the same thing in the whole body that the whole water does in a vessel. According to those who hold the opinion that space is place, when the entire water is in the vessel there are present, in addition to the dimensions of the water, also other dimensions of space. Now every part of a whole is contained by the whole as a thing in place is contained by a vessel: the only difference being that the part is not separated from the whole, whereas the thing in place is separated from place. If therefore a part be actually separated within the whole, it will follow that, in addition to the dimensions of the part, also other dimensions of the containing whole will be present.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Non potest autem dici quod divisio faceret ibi esse de novo aliquas dimensiones: non enim divisio causat dimensionem, sed praeexistentem dividit. Ergo antequam pars esset divisa a toto, erant aliae propriae dimensiones partis, praeter dimensiones totius penetrantes etiam partem. Quot ergo partes est accipere per divisionem in aliquo toto, ita quod una contineat aliam, tot dimensiones ab invicem distinctae erunt ibi, quarum quaedam alias penetrabunt. Est autem accipere in infinitum in aliquo toto continuo partes, quae alias continent, propter hoc quod continuum in infinitum dividitur. Relinquitur igitur quod sint infinitae dimensiones se invicem penetrantes. Si igitur dimensiones corporis continentis penetrantes locatum sunt locus, sequitur quod sint infinita loca simul, quod est impossibile.
          <td>But it cannot be said that such division would make new dimensions to exist: for division does not cause dimension; rather it divides dimension already existing. Therefore, before that part was divided in the whole, there were present other proper dimensions of the part, in addition to the whole’s dimensions, which also penetrate that part. Now there will be as many sets of dimensions all distinct, some of which interpenetrate others, as there are parts obtainable by division of the whole, parts, namely, so divided that one contains another. But it is possible in a continuous whole to obtain <i>ad infinitum</i> parts which contain other parts, because a continuum can be divided <i>ad infinitum</i> , Consequently, we should have infinite dimensions mutually penetrating themselves. If, therefore, the containing body’s dimensions, penetrating the thing in place, are place, it follows that there are infinite places together—which is impossible.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: simul autem erit et locus etc., ponit secundam rationem, quae talis est. Si dimensiones spatii quod est inter extremitates corporis continentis, sint locus, sequitur quod locus transmutetur: manifestum est enim quod transmutato aliquo corpore, ut puta amphora, transmutatur illud spatium quod est infra extremitates amphorae, cum nusquam sit nisi ubi est amphora. Omne autem quod transmutatur in aliquem locum, penetratur secundum eorum positionem, a dimensionibus spatii in quod transmutatur. Sequitur ergo quod aliquae aliae dimensiones subintrant dimensiones illius spatii amphorae; et sic loci erit alius locus, et multa loca erunt simul.
          <td>462. Then [322] he gives a second reason, which is the following. If the dimensions of the space which is between the boundaries of the containing body are place, it follows that place can be transported. For it is clear that when a body is transported, as, for example, a jug, the space within the jug is transported, since that space can never be except where the jug is. Now whatever is transported to another place is penetrated (according to those who hold the doctrine of space as place) by the dimensions of the space into which it is transported. Therefore it follows that other dimensions enter the dimensions of the jug’s space; consequently there would be another place of place, and many places would be existing together.

          <td>Hoc ergo inconveniens accidit quia ponitur alius esse locus corporis contenti, ut aquae, et vasis, ut amphorae. Nam secundum illorum opinionem, locus aquae est spatium quod est infra extremitates amphorae: locus autem totius amphorae est spatium, quod est infra extremitates corporis continentis amphoram. Sed nos non dicimus quod alius sit locus partis, in quo movetur pars, cum totum vas transmutatur secundum idem (dicit autem hic partem, corpus contentum in vase, ut aquam contentam in amphora): quia secundum Aristotelem aqua movetur per accidens vase transmutato, et non mutat locum nisi inquantum amphora locum mutat. Unde non oportet quod locus in quem vadit, sit locus partis per se; sed solum inquantum est locus amphorae. Sed secundum tenentes opinionem de spatio, sequitur quod ille locus per se respondeat aquae, sicut et amphorae; et quod per se etiam respondeat spatio: et per se loquendo spatium illud movebitur et habebit locum, et non solum per accidens.
          <td>463. This unacceptable consequence arises from positing one place for the contained body, for example, the water; and another place for the vessel, for example, the jug. For according to the opinion we are discussing, the place of the water is the space within the boundaries of the jug, while the place of the whole jug is the space within the boundaries of the body containing the jug. We, however, do not assign a special place for the part, in which the part moves, as distinct from the whole, when the entire vessel is transported (by “part” he means the body contained in the vessel, as the water contained in the jug): because, according to Aristotle, the water is moved <i>per accidens</i> when the vessel is transported, and it changes place only inasmuch as the jug changes its place. Hence it is not necessary that the place into which the transfer is made, be the place of the part <i>per se</i> , but only inasmuch as it becomes the place of the jug. But according to those who hold the opinion about space as place, it follows that the new place would belong <i>per se</i> both to water and to the jug. Likewise, that space would be transported and would have a place <i>per se</i> , and not only <i>per accidens</i> .

          <td>Et licet corpus continens quandoque moveatur, non tamen sequitur secundum opinionem Aristotelis, quod locus moveatur, aut quod loci sit locus. Contingit quidem enim aliquod corpus continens, in quo est aliquid contentum, moveri, sicut aer vel aqua aut aliquae partes aquae: ut puta si navis est in fluvio, partes aquae quae inferius continent navem moventur; sed tamen locus non movetur.
          <td>Now although the containing body is sometimes moved, it does not follow according to the opinion of Aristotle, that the place is moved, or that there is a place of a place. For it does indeed happen that a containing body, in which something is contained, is sometimes moved, as are air or water or certain parts of the water, For example, if a boat is in a river, the parts of the water which surround the boat from below are in motion, but the boat’s place is not moved. Hence, he adds, “but not that place where they occur,”, i.e., that in which things occur as in a place is not moved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et hoc est quod subdit, sed non in quo fiunt loco, idest sed non illud in quo aliqua fiunt sicut in loco, movetur.

Licet enim hoc continens moveatur prout est hoc corpus, tamen prout consideratur secundum ordinem quem habet ad totum corpus caeli non movetur: nam aliud corpus quod succedit, eundem ordinem vel situm habet per comparationem ad totum caelum, quem habuit corpus quod prius effluxerat. Hoc est ergo quod dicit, quod licet aqua vel aer moveatur, non tamen movetur locus prout consideratur ut pars quaedam loci totius caeli, habens determinatum situm in universo.
          <td>How this is true he makes clear by adding, “which is a part of the place which is the place of the whole heavens.” For although this container [e.g., the water surrounding the boat] be moved inasmuch as it is this body, yet in regard to its relation to the whole body of the heavens it is not moved: the body which succeeds it has the same order or position in relation to the whole heavens as had the body which previously flowed on. This therefore is what he says, namely, that although the water or the air be moved, not so the place, considered precisely as a certain part of the place of the whole heavens and as having a definite position in the universe.

          <td>464. Then [323] he continues by considering matter. First he shows why matter seems to be place; Secondly, that it is not place, at no. 465.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod materia videtur esse locus, si aliquis consideret transmutationem corporum succedentium sibi in eodem loco, in aliquo uno subiecto quiescente secundum locum; et non habeatur respectus ad hoc quod locus est separatus, sed attendatur solummodo transmutatio in aliquo uno continuo. Aliquod enim corpus continuum et quietum secundum locum, cum alteratur, unum et idem numero nunc quidem est album, nunc autem nigrum, et nunc est durum et prius molle. Et propter istam transmutationem formarum circa subiectum, dicimus quod materia est aliquid, quae manet una, facta transmutatione secundum formam. Et per talem etiam apparentiam videtur locus esse aliquid: quia in eo permanente succedunt sibi diversa corpora. Sed tamen alio modo loquendi utimur in utroque. Nam ad designandum materiam vel subiectum, dicimus quod id quod nunc est aqua, prius erat aer: ad designandum autem unitatem loci, dicimus quod ubi nunc est aqua, ibi prius erat aer.
          <td>He says therefore first that matter appears to be place, should one consider the transmutation of the bodies which succeed each other in the same place, as this occurs in some, one subject that is at rest in a place, with attention being paid, not to the fact that place is separate, but only to the fact that the transmutation is occurring in one and the same continuum. For some continuous body, at rest according to place, when it is being altered in quality, now white, now black; now hard, while previously soft. Yet it remains one and the same in number. And on account of this transmutation of forms in the subject we say that matter is something that remains one whole change taken place with respect to forms. Because of this, place seems to be something, because in it as remaining different bodies succeed each other. Nevertheless we use different terminology when referring to these two cases: to designate matter or the subject, we say, “What is now water, was previously air”; to designate unity in place, we say, “Where water is now there was air previously.”

          <td>465. Then [324] he shows that matter is not place, because, as we said above, matter is not separated from the thing of which it is the matter, nor does it contain the latter: both of which characteristics belong to place. Place, therefore, is not matter.

Et ne aliquis intelligat contentum vel locatum esse aliquod spatium medium, subiungit, quod corpus contentum dicitur illud, quod est natum moveri secundum loci mutationem.
          <td>466. Then [325], having eliminated the first three members, he concludes to the fourth. And he says that since place is not any of these three, i.e., neither form, nor matter, nor some space which is other than the internal distances of the things in place, it must be the fourth of the above named, i.e., the boundary of the containing body. And lest anyone understand that the thing contained or in place is some middle space, he adds that the contained body is what is apt to be moved in respect to change of place.

          <td>467. Then [326] he tracks down the specific difference of place; namely, that it is immobile. In regard to this he does two things: First, he shows that an error arose from improperly considering this difference; Secondly, how we must understand the immobility of place, at no. 468.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod videtur magnum aliquid et difficile accipere quid sit locus; tum propter hoc quod quibusdam videtur, quod locus sit materia vel forma, quae habent altissimam considerationem, ut supra dictum est; tum propter hoc quod mutatio eius quod fertur secundum locum, fit in quodam quiescente et continente. Cum igitur nihil videatur esse continens et immobile nisi spatium, videtur contingere quod locus sit quoddam spatium medium, quod sit aliud a magnitudinibus quae moventur secundum locum. Et ad credulitatem huius opinionis multum proficit, quod aer videtur esse incorporeus: quia ubi est aer, videtur quod non sit corpus, sed quoddam spatium vacuum. Et sic videtur locus non solum esse terminus vasis, sed quoddam medium, tanquam vacuum.
          <td>He says therefore that it is a large undertaking and a difficult one to understand what place is, both because some have thought it is matter or form, both of which involve lofty speculation, as was said above (L.3), and because the change that occurs when things change place, occurs in something both at rest and containing, Now, since nothing seems to be containing and immobile except space, it seems that place is a sort of middle space distinct from the magnitudes which are moved in respect to place. And the fact that air seems to be incorporeal helps to make this opinion credible: for where air is there appears to be no body but a certain empty space. Thus place seems to be not only the boundaries of a vessel but something between the boundaries as a vacuum or void.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: est autem sicut vas etc., ostendit quomodo intelligenda sit immobilitas loci, ut excludatur opinio praedicta. Et dicit quod vas et locus in hoc differre videntur, quod vas transmutatur, locus autem non. Unde sicut vas potest dici locus transmutabilis, ita locus potest dici vas immobile. Et ideo, cum aliquid movetur in aliquo corpore quod movetur, sicut navis in flumine, utitur isto in quo movetur magis sicut vase, quam sicut loco continente: quia locus vult esse immobilis, idest de aptitudine et natura loci est quod sit immobilis; et propter hoc magis potest dici quod totus fluvius sit locus navis, quia totus fluvius est immobilis. Sic igitur fluvius totus inquantum est immobilis, est locus communis.
          <td>468. Then [327], in order to exclude the aforesaid opinion, he shows how we must understand the immobility of place. And he says that a vessel and place are seen to differ in this, that a vessel can be transported but place cannot, Hence, just as a vessel can be called “a transportable place,” so place can be called “an immobile (non-transportable) vessel.” Therefore, when something is being moved in a body that is in motion, as a ship in a river, we speak of that in which it is being moved as a vessel rather than of a containing place, because place “wants to-be immobile,” i.e., it is of the very nature and aptitude of the place to be immobile.. On this account it is better to speak of the whole river as being the place of the ship, because the river as a whole is immobile. Thus the whole river inasmuch as it is immobile is the common place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Cum autem locus proprius sit pars loci communis, oportet accipere proprium locum navis in aqua fluminis, inquantum habet ordinem ad totum fluvium ut est immobilis. Est igitur accipere locum navis in aqua fluente, non secundum hanc aquam quae fluit, sed secundum ordinem vel situm quem habet haec aqua fluens ad totum fluvium: qui quidem ordo vel situs idem remanet in aqua succedente. Et ideo licet aqua materialiter praeterfluat, tamen secundum quod habet rationem loci, prout scilicet consideratur in tali ordine et situ ad totum fluvium, non mutatur.
          <td>However, since proper place is a part of common place, we must consider the proper place of the ship in flowing water, not the water inasmuch as it is flowing, but in its relation to the order or position which this flowing water has to the river as a whole: it is this order or position that remains constant, while the water flows on. Therefore, although the water materially passes on, yet, insofar as it has the motion of place, i.e. insofar as it is considered as having a certain order and position with respect to the whole river it does not change.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et per hoc similiter accipere debemus quomodo extremitates corporum mobilium naturalium sint locus, per respectum ad totum corpus sphaericum caeli, quod habet fixionem et immobilitatem propter immobilitatem centri et polorum. Sic igitur, licet haec pars aeris quae continebat, vel haec pars aquae effluat et moveatur inquantum est haec aqua; tamen secundum quod habet haec aqua rationem loci, scilicet situs et ordinis ad totum sphaericum caeli, semper manet. Sicut etiam dicitur idem ignis manere quantum ad formam, licet secundum materiam varietur consumptis et additis quibusdam lignis.
          <td>This also shows how we ought to consider how the boundaries of natural mobile bodies are place with respect to the entire spherical body of the heavens, which is fixed and immobile on account of the immobility of the center and of the poles. Therefore, although this part of air which contains, or this part of water, flow by and move as this water, yet, insofar as this water has the motion of place, viz., a position and order to the whole spherical body of the heavens, it always remains. This is like the same fire remaining as to its form, although as to its matter it is varied as wood is consumed and other wood added.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et per hoc cessat obiectio quae potest fieri contra hoc quod ponimus locum esse terminum continentis: quia cum continens sit mobile, et terminus continentis erit mobilis; et sic aliquod quietum existens, habebit diversa loca.

Ex quo patet quod tota ratio loci in omnibus continentibus est ex primo continente et locante, scilicet caelo.
          <td>469. This removes an objection that could be lodged against positing place as the boundary of the container, for since the container is mobile, its boundary will also be mobile; consequently, a thing at rest will have diverse places. But this does not follow: because the boundary of the container is not place insofar as it is this surface of this particular mobile body, but by reason of the order or position it has in the immobile whole. From which it is evident that the whole notion of place in all containers is taken from the first container and locator, namely, the heavens.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: quare terminus continentis etc., concludit ex praemissis definitionem loci, scilicet quod locus est terminus immobilis continentis primum. Dicit autem primum, ut designet locum proprium, et excludat locum communem.
          <td>470. Then [328] he concludes form the foregoing the definition of place, namely, that place is <u>the immobile boundary of that which contains first</u> . He says “first” to designate proper place and exclude common place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: et propter hoc medium caeli etc., ostendit definitionem esse bene assignatam, per hoc quod ea quae dicuntur de loco, congruunt secundum hanc definitionem. Et ponit tria. Quorum primum est, quod propter hoc quod locus est continens immobile, medium caeli, idest centrum, et ultimum circularis loci mutationis, idest corporum circulariter motorum, ultimum dico versus nos, scilicet superficies orbis lunae, videtur hoc quidem esse sursum, scilicet ultimum praedictum, illud vero esse deorsum, scilicet medium. Et hoc maxime proprie videtur dici inter omnia: quia centrum sphaerae semper manet.
          <td>471. Then [329] he shows that the definition is well assigned, because the things said about place concur with this definition. And he gives three such things: The first is that, since place is an immobile container, the middle of the heavens, i.e., the center, and the boundary of circular change of place, i.e., of the bodies moved in a circle, namely, the boundary as to us, i.e., the surface of the sphere of the moon, is (namely, the latter) seen as “up”, and the other (namely, the middle) as “down”. Things absolutely in place, and things in place in a certain respect and this last named (the middle or center) is seen to be said most properly of all. For the center of a sphere is always at rest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Illud autem quod est ultimum in corporibus circulariter motis versus nos, licet moveatur circulariter, tamen manet inquantum similiter se habet, idest in eadem elongatione ad nos. Et quia ad propria loca moventur corpora naturalia, inde est quod levia naturaliter moventur sursum et gravia deorsum: quia ipsum medium et terminus continens versus medium, vocatur deorsum; et similiter ipsum ultimum, et quod est versus ultimum, dicitur esse sursum. Utitur autem tali modo loquendi, quia terrae, quae est simpliciter gravis, locus est medium; aquae autem locus est versus medium. Et similiter locus ignis, qui est simpliciter levis, est ultimum; locus autem aeris est versus ultimum.
          <td>Now that which is the boundary in relation to us of the bodies moved in a circle [namely, the surface of the sphere of the moon], although it moves in a circle, nevertheless remains, insofar as it remains in the same way, i.e., at the same distance from us. Hence, since natural bodies are moved to their proper places, it follows that light bodies naturally move “up”, and heavy bodies “down”—for both the middle (center) and the containing boundary in the direction of the middle are called “down”; and likewise the boundary in the other sense [ the surface of the sphere of the moon], and what is in the direction of that boundary, are called “up”. He uses this manner of speaking, because it is the center that is the place of the earth, which is simply heavy, while toward the center the place of water is found. In like manner, the place of fire, which is simply light, is the outermost, while the place of air is toward the outermost.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum ponit ibi: et propter hoc planum videtur et cetera. Et dicit quod quia locus est terminus, propter hoc locus videtur esse sicut quaedam superficies, et sicut quoddam vas continens: non autem sicut spatium vasis continentis.
          <td>He gives the second [330], saying that because place is a boundary, place seems to be like a certain surface and like a containing vessel, but not like the space [or volume] of the containing vessel.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertium ponit ibi: amplius, simul cum re et cetera. Et dicit quod quia locus est terminus, propter hoc simul est locus et locatum: quia simul est finis locati et terminus continentis, qui est locus; quia tangentium ultima simul sunt. Et secundum hoc etiam intelligitur quod locus aequatur locato: quia scilicet aequantur secundum extrema.
          <td>He gives the third [331] when he says that, because place is a boundary, the place and the thing in place are together; for the limits of the thing in place and the boundary of the container, which is place, are together (for the boundaries of things that touch are together). This also explains why place is equal to the thing in place: namely, because they are equated as to their boundaries.

On the line on which it is moved, its parts have place: for each is contiguous the next. But (2) other things are in place indirectly, through something conjoined with them, as the soul and the heaven.

          <td>473. He concludes therefore first [332] from the foregoing that, since place is the boundary of the container, whenever a body has another body outside it and containing it, it is in place absolutely and <i>per se</i> ; if such a body does not have an external body containing it, it is not in place at all. The only body in the universe that exemplifies this second case is the outermost sphere, whatever it may be. Hence, according to this definition, it follows that the outermost orb is not in place.

Now this difficulty does not arise for those who hold the opinion that space is place. For they are not forced to say that, in order to be in place, the outermost sphere must have a body containing it; rather, the space penetrating the entire universe and all its parts is the place of the entire universe and of each of its parts, according to these Philosophers.

          <td>475. Wherefore Alexander said that the outermost orb is not in place at all: for it is not necessary for every body to be in place, since place is not in the definition of body.

          <td>But since every motion must fit into one of the genera of motion, Avicenna, following him, said that the motion of the outermost sphere is not motion in place but motion in <i>situs</i> [position in place]. This is against Aristotle, who says in Book V (L. 4) that motion is present only in three genera, namely, quality, quantity, and “where.”

Secus autem est de albedine et similibus, quae participantur secundum magis et minus. Quaelibet autem species situs habet rationem in indivisibili consistentem; ita quod si aliquid additur vel minuitur, non est eadem species situs. Unde impossibile est quod in genere situs sit motus.
          <td>Avicenna’s position is untenable because it is impossible that motion strictly speaking be in a genus the notion of whose species consists in an indivisible. For the reason why there is not motion in the genus “substance” is that the nature of every species of substance consists in an indivisible, due to the fact that the species of substances do not admit of more or less; on this account, since motion is successive, a substantial form is not made existent by motion but by generation, which is the terminus of motion. The case is different with whiteness and like things, which can be participated according to more or less. But every species of <i>situs</i> has a nature that consists in an indivisible, so that if anything be added or taken away the original species does not remain. Hence it is impossible for motion to exist in the genus of <i>situs</i> .

          <td>Besides, the same difficulty remains. For <i>situs</i> taken as a predicament implies the order of parts in place; although if it be taken as a difference in the genus of quantity it implies merely an order of parts in a whole.

Sic igitur dicunt quod superficies convexa sphaerae contentae, est locus primae sphaerae. Sed hoc est contra suppositiones communes prius de loco positas: scilicet quod locus sit continens, et quod locus sit aequalis locato.
          <td>476. Others such as Avempace said that place should be assigned in one way to a body moving in a circle and in another way to a body moving in a straight line. For since a straight line is imperfect, since it can be added to, a body moving in a straight line requires a place externally containing it, but because a circular line is perfect within itself, a body moving in a circle does not require an external place to contain it, but merely a place about which it may revolve; hence it is that circular motion is said to be motion about a center. So therefore they say that the convex surface of the sphere contained is the place of the first sphere. But this is against the common suppositions about place already laid down; namely, that place is a container, and that it is equal to the thing in place.

Manifestum est autem quod corpora circulariter mota habent fixionem per immobilitatem centri: unde ultima sphaera dicitur esse in loco per accidens, inquantum centrum circa quod revolvitur, habet esse in loco.

To understand this, one should consider that everything which has fixity by means of something else, is said to be in place <i>per accidens</i> , due to the fact that that by means of which it is fixed is in place, as it evident in the case of a nail fixed in a ship and of a man at rest in a ship. Now it is clear that bodies moving rotationally are fixed because their center is immobile; hence the outermost sphere is said to be in place <i>per accidens</i> , insofar as the center about which it is revolving has existence in place, The fact that the lower spheres have a <i>per se</i> place in which they are contained is incidental and not essential to a body moving rotationally.

Sic igitur alicui corpori moto localiter, necesse est assignare locum, secundum quod in illo motu consideratur successio diversorum corporum in eodem loco. In his igitur quae moventur motu recto, manifestum est quod duo corpora succedunt sibi in loco secundum totum; quia totum unum corpus dimittit totum locum, et in ipsum totum subintrat aliud corpus. Unde necesse est quod corpus quod movetur motu recto, sit in loco secundum se totum.
          <td>To understand this it must be recalled that Aristotle said above that there would be no discussion about place except for the act of motion, which reveals the existence of place from the fact that bodies succeed one another in the same place. Hence, although place is not of the essence of body, yet it is necessary for a body moved according to place. In the case of a body moving locally, the reason it is necessary to assign a place is because in that motion a succession of diverse bodies in the same place is considered. Therefore, in the case of bodies moving in a straight line it is clear that one body succeeds another in the same place according to their totality, for one whole body leaves one whole place which is then occupied by another whole body. Hence a body which is in motion in a straight line must be in place in its entirety.

          <td>In motu autem circulari, licet totum fiat in diversis locis ratione, non tamen totum mutat locum subiecto: semper enim remanet idem locus subiecto, sed diversificatur ratione tantum, ut in sexto huius dicetur. Sed partes mutant locum non solum ratione, sed subiecto. Attenditur ergo in motu circulari successio in eodem loco, non totorum corporum, sed partium eiusdem corporis. Non igitur corpori quod movetur circulariter, debetur ex necessitate locus secundum totum, sed secundum partes.
          <td>But in the case of rotational motion, although the whole body comes to be in different places as distinguished by reason, nevertheless the whole body does not change its place as to subject: for the place remains ever the same as to subject; but varies only according to reason, as will be said in Book VI (L.2). Nevertheless the parts change place not only as to reason but as to subject also. Therefore in the case of rotational motion there is not a succession of whole bodies in the same place but of parts of the same body. Therefore a rotating body does not essentially require a place according to its totality but according to its parts.

Et sic non videtur verum quod ultimae sphaerae debeatur locus ratione partium.
          <td>479. But against this there seems to be the objection that the parts of a continuous body are neither in place nor moved in respect to place; rather, it is the whole that is both moved and in place. But it is clear that the outermost sphere is a continuous body; therefore, its parts are neither in place nor in motion in place. Consequently, it does not seem to be true that place should be attributed to the outermost sphere by reason of its parts.

Et hoc maxime apparet in continuis humidis, quae sunt facilis divisionis, sicut in aqua, cuius partes inveniuntur moveri infra totam aquam. Sic igitur, quia aliquid dicitur de toto ratione partium, inquantum partes ultimae sphaerae sunt in loco in potentia, tota ultima sphaera est in loco per accidens ratione partium: et sic esse in loco sufficit ad motum circularem.
          <td>The answer to this objection is that, although the parts of a continuous body are not actually in place, they are so potentially, insofar as the continuum is divisible. For a part, if it is separated, will be in the whole as in a place; hence, in this manner the parts of a continuum are moved in place. This is clearly evident in liquid continua which are easy to divide—for example, in the case of water, whose parts are found to be in motion within the whole water. Consequently, because something is said of a whole by reason of its parts, insofar as the parts of the outermost sphere are potentially in place the entire outermost sphere is in place <i>per accidens</i> by reason of its parts: and to be in place in that way is enough for rotational motion.

Necesse est enim quod gradatim ab uno immobili descendatur ad diversitatem quae est in mobilibus. Minor est autem variatio quae est secundum partes existentes in loco in potentia, quam quae est secundum tota existentia in loco in actu. Unde primus motus, qui est circularis, minus habet de difformitate, et plus retinet de uniformitate, propinquior existens substantiis immobilibus. Multo autem convenientius est dicere quod ultima sphaera sit in loco propter partes suas intrinsecas, quam propter centrum, quod est omnino extra substantiam eius; et magis consonat opinioni Aristotelis, ut patet inspicienti sequentia, in quibus philosophus manifestat quomodo caelum sit in loco, ibi: unde et si aqua fiat et cetera.
          <td>480. If a further objection is raised that what is in act is prior to what is in potency and that consequently it seems Improper that the first local motion be that of a body existing in place by means of its parts which are potentially in place, the reply is that this is most fitting to the first motion. For it is necessary that the descent from the one immobile being to the diversity which is found in mobile things be made step by step. Now the variation based on parts existing in place potentially, is less than that of wholes existing in place actually. Hence the first motion, which is rotational has less deformity and retains greater uniformity, being closer to the immobile substances. Now it is much better to say that the outermost sphere is in place on account of its intrinsic parts, than an account of the center which is entirely extrinsic to its substance; and this is more in agreement with Aristotle’s opinion, as is clear if one considers the passage following, in which Aristotle shows how the heavens are in place.

Sed tota aqua quodammodo movebitur, et quodammodo non. Non enim sic movebitur quod tota simul mutet locum, quasi translata in alium locum subiecto diversum: sed movebitur circulariter; qui quidem motus requirit locum partium, et non totius.

          <td>482. Therefore, because he had said that if a body does not have something outside of it containing it, it is not in place <i>per se</i> , he concludes [333] that if a body of this kind, such as the outermost sphere is, be water (which will more easily illustrate what we are about to say on account of its easy divisibility), its parts will be in motion inasmuch as one part contains another, thus making it exist in place after a fashion. But the entire water will be in motion in one sense and in another sense not. For it will not be in motion in such a way that the entire water will change its place as though being transferred to another place distinct as to subject, but it will be moved rotationally—a motion that requires place for the parts and not for the whole. And it will be moved, not up and down, but circularly: for some things are moved up and down and change place in their entirety, namely, rare and dense bodies, or light and heavy things.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: sicut autem dictum est etc., ostendit quomodo partes ultimae sphaerae sunt in loco.

          <td>483. Then [334] he indicates how the parts of the outermost sphere exist in place, saying that, as was mentioned above, some things are actually in place, others potentially. Hence in the case of a continuum of similar parts the parts are in place potentially, as in the case of the outermost sphere; but when the parts are separated and merely contiguous, as occurs in a pile of stones, the parts are in place actually.

Sed caelum, idest ultima sphaera, non est hoc modo in loco, sicut dictum est, cum nullum corpus contineat ipsum: sed secundum quod movetur circulariter, partibus sibi invicem succedentibus, sic et locus debetur partibus eius in potentia, ut dictum est, inquantum scilicet una pars eius est habita, idest consequenter se habens, ad aliam.
          <td>484. Then [335] he shows how from this it follows that the entire sphere is in place. And he says that some things are <i>per se</i> in place—as any body that is <i>per se</i> in motion in place, whether it be in respect to local motion or increase, as was said above (L.5). But the heavens, i.e., the outermost sphere, are not in place in this manner, as was said, since no body contains them; but inasmuch as they are moved rotationally, with part succeeding part, place is attributed to the parts potentially, as was said, inasmuch as one part-is “had,” i.e., is consecutive, with respect to another.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quaedam vero secundum accidens sunt in loco, sicut anima et omnes formae: et hoc etiam modo caelum, idest ultima sphaera, est in loco, inquantum omnes eius partes sunt in loco, ex eo quod unaquaeque pars eius continetur sub alia secundum circulationem. In corpore enim non circulari pars extrema remanet non contenta, sed continens tantum: sed in corpore circulari quaelibet pars est continens et contenta, in potentia tamen. Unde ratione omnium partium suarum corpus circulare est in loco. Et hoc accipit esse per accidens, scilicet per partes, sicut supra, cum dixit quod partes corporis moventur per accidens in loco.
          <td>Certain things, indeed, are in place <i>per accidens</i> , e.g., the soul, and all forms; and in this manner the heavens, i.e., the outermost sphere, is in place insofar as all its parts are in place, since each of its parts is contained under another in the rotation of the sphere. For in a non-round body the outermost part remains uncontained and merely containing; but in a round body each part is both container and contained, potentially however. Hence it is by reason of all its parts that a found body is in place. And this Aristotle takes to <i>per accidens</i> , namely, what is true of the parts, as above when he said that the parts of a body are in motion <i>per accidens</i> in place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: unde movetur circulariter etc., inducit quandam conclusionem ex praedictis. Quia enim dixerat quod corpus quod circulariter movetur, non oportet esse in loco secundum totum, sed solum per accidens, ratione partium, concludit quod corpus supremum movetur solum circulariter, propter hoc quod ipsum totum non est alicubi; quia quod est alicubi, ipsum est aliquid, et habet aliquid extra se a quo continetur; sed extra totum nihil est. Et propter hoc omnia dicuntur esse in caelo sicut in ultimo continente, quia caelum fortassis est quod est totum continens. Dicit autem fortassis, quia nondum probatum est quod extra caelum nihil sit. Non est autem sic intelligendum, quod ipsum corpus caeli sit locus: sed quaedam superficies ultima eius versus nos; et est sicut terminus tangens corpora mobilia quae in ipso sunt. Et propter hoc dicimus quod terra est in aqua, quae est in aere, qui est in aethere, idest igne, qui est in caelo, quod non est ulterius in alio.
          <td>485. Then [336] he draws a conclusion from the foregoing. For since he had said that a body in rotational motion need not be in place in its entirety but only <i>per accidens</i> by reason of its parts, he concludes that the outermost body is moved only rotationally, because the whole in question is not anywhere; what is somewhere is itself something, and has something outside of it by which it is contained; but there is nothing outside the whole. For this reason all things are said to be in the heavens as in the outermost container, because the heavens are probably the containing whole. He says “probably,” because it has not yet been proved that there is nothing outside the heavens. It is not to be thought that the very body of the heavens is a place; rather, it is a certain final surface of it turned toward us which is as a boundary in contact with the mobile bodies existing in it. For this reason we say that earth is in water which is in air, which is in either, i.e., fire, which is in the heavens, which are not in anything else.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum vero intentionem Averrois, littera ista aliter exponenda est. Nam exemplum de aqua quod primo inducit, non est referendum secundum ipsum ad ultimam sphaeram, sed ad totum universum: quod quidem movetur inquantum partes eius moventur, quaedam quidem circulariter, ut corpora caelestia, quaedam vero motu sursum vel deorsum, ut inferiora corpora. Quod vero postmodum inducitur, quod quaedam sunt in loco actu, quaedam potentia, non est referendum ad prius dicta, sed oportet ut propter se dictum accipere. Quia enim dixerat quod quaedam sunt in loco secundum partes, quaedam secundum totum, consequenter adiungit quod quaedam sunt in loco secundum actum, quaedam secundum potentiam: et ulterius, quod quaedam sunt in loco per se, quaedam per accidens.
          <td>486. However, according to the intention of Aristotle, this passage must be explained differently. For the example of water which he first adduced is not to be referred, according to him, to the outermost sphere only, but to the entire universe, which indeed is moved insofar as its parts are moved—some rotationally, as are the heavenly bodies; some up and down, as are the lower bodies. As to what he said later on, that some things are actually in place and other potentially, this is not to be referred to what he said previously but is to be taken independently. For since he had said that some things are in place according to their parts and others according to their totality, he adds after that, that some things are in place according to act and others according to potency; finally, he says that some things are in place per se and others <i>per accidens</i> .
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ubi notandum est quod caelum secundum ipsum dupliciter accipitur hic: nam primo caelum accipitur pro universitate corporum, et maxime caelestium; secundo pro ultima sphaera.

          <td>In this connection note that according to Aristotle “the heavens” are to be taken in two senses here: first, they are taken for the entire universe of bodies and especially of the heavenly; secondly, for the outermost sphere. He says therefore that those things are in place <i>per se</i> which are in motion according to place, whether they are in motion according to their totality or according to their parts, as are the heavens, i.e., the universe; in place <i>per accidens</i> are the soul and the heavens, i.e., the outermost sphere. For it is necessary to say that all the parts of the universe are somehow in place: the outermost sphere <i>per accidens</i> and other bodies <i>per se</i> , inasmuch as they are contained by a body outside of them.

For this part has the same relation to its place, as a separable part to its whole, as when one moves a part of water or air: so, too, air is related to water, for the one is like matter, the other form—water is the matter of air, air as it were the actuality of water, for water is potentially air, while air is potentially water, though in another way. These distinctions will be drawn more carefully later. On the present occasion it was necessary to refer to them: what has now been stated obscurely will then be made more clear. If the matter and the fulfilment are the same thing (for water is both, the one potentially, the other completely), water will be related to air in a way as part to whole. That is why these have contact: it is organic union when both become actually one. This concludes my account of place—both of its existence and of its nature.

Unde facit mentionem solum de quatuor residuis.
          <td>487. After explaining what place is, the Philosopher now uses his definition to resolve the doubts that were raised about place (L.2). Now there were mentioned above six reasons to show that place does not exist. Of these he bypasses two: the one in which it was asked whether place be an element or a composite of elements; the other in which it was shown that place cannot be reduced to any genus of cause. He bypasses them because no one who posited place took it either as an element or as a cause of things. Hence he makes mention only of the four remaining.

          <td>488. One of these was that, since place never lacks a body, and a body never lacks a place, it seemed to follow that if the body grew, the place would grow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed hoc sequitur si supponatur quod locus sit spatium quoddam coextensum dimensionibus corporis, ut intelligatur illud spatium crescere, crescente corpore. Sed hoc non est necesse secundum definitionem praedictam de loco, quod sit terminus continentis.

Sed haec etiam ratio procedit secundum imaginationem eorum qui opinabantur locum esse spatium coaequatum dimensionibus corporis: unde oportebat quod cuilibet dimensioni corporis responderet dimensio spatii, et similiter cuilibet puncto corporis. Sed hoc non oportet dicere, si ponamus locum esse terminum continentis.
          <td>469. Another argument was that, if the place of a body be distinct from the body, then the place of a point would be distinct from the point; wherefore, it did not seem possible for place to be distinct from the body, since the place of a point is not distinct from the point. But this argument was based on the imagining of those who opined, that place, is the space coextensive with the volume of the body, so that a dimension of space would correspond to a dimension of the body and in like manner to each point of the body, This, however, need not be said if we suppose that place is the boundary of the container.

          <td>490. Another argument was that, if place is anything, it must be a body, since it has three dimensions. Consequently, there would be two bodies in the same place. But according to those who agree that place is the boundary of the containing body it is not necessary to say that two bodies would be in the same place, or that there is some bodily space intervening between the boundaries of the containing body, but that there is some body there.

          <td>Item alia ratio fuit, quod si omne quod est, est in loco, sequetur quod etiam locus sit in loco. Quae quidem ratio de facili solvitur, supposito quod locus sit terminus continentis. Manifestum est enim secundum hoc, quod locus est in aliquo, scilicet in corpore continente; non tamen sicut in loco, sed sicut terminus in aliqua re finita, ut punctum in linea et superficies in corpore. Non enim necessarium est quod omne quod est, sit in aliquo sicut in loco; sed hoc necesse est solum de corpore mobili: motus enim induxit ad distinguendum inter locatum et locum
          <td>491. Likewise another argument was that, if everything that exists is in place, it will follow that even a place is in place. This argument is easy to answer, if we suppose that place is the boundary of the container, For according to this it is clear that place is in something; namely, in the containing body, but it is there, not as in a place, but as a boundary in a finite thing, just as a point is in a line and a surface in a body. For it is not required that everything that is, be in something as in a place; this is required only of a mobile body, for it is motion that led to distinguishing between the thing in place and the place itself.

          <td>492. Then [338] he uses his definition to give a reason for the properties of place. First, as to the fact that a body is naturally borne to its proper place; Secondly, as to the fact that a body naturally rests in its own place, at no. 493.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod si ponatur locus esse terminus continentis, rationabiliter assignari potest causa, quare unumquodque corpus feratur ad proprium locum: quia illud corpus continens, ad quod consequenter se habet corpus contentum et locatum, et quod ab eo tangitur terminis simul existentibus, et hoc non per violentiam, est proximum ei secundum naturam. Ordo enim situs in partibus universi attenditur secundum ordinem naturae. Nam corpus caeleste, quod est supremum, est nobilissimum: post quod inter alia corpora secundum nobilitatem naturae est ignis; et sic deinceps usque ad terram. Unde manifestum est quod corpus inferius, quod se habet consequenter secundum situm ad corpus superius, est proximum sibi in ordine naturae. Et ideo addit non vi, ut ostendat naturalem ordinem situs, cui respondet ordo naturarum, et excludat ordinem situs violentum, sicut aliquando per violentiam corpus terrestre est super aerem vel aquam. Et huiusmodi duo corpora se consequentia in naturali ordine situs, et in ordine naturarum simul apta nata esse, sunt impassibilia: idest, cum continuantur ad invicem et fiunt unum, ad quod aptitudinem habent propter propinquitatem naturae, tunc sunt impassibilia. Sed dum tanguntur distincta existentia, propter contrarietatem qualitatum activarum et passivarum, sunt activa et passiva ad invicem. Sic igitur proximitas naturae, quae est inter corpus continens et contentum, est causa quare corpus naturaliter movetur ad suum locum: quia oportet quod gradus naturalium locorum respondeat gradui naturarum, ut dictum est. Sed haec ratio non potest assignari si ponatur locus esse spatium: quia in dimensionibus spatii separatis nullus ordo naturae considerari potest.
          <td>He says first therefore, that if place be taken to the boundary of the container, the reason why each body is naturally borne to its own place can be given: it is because the containing body (which is next to the contained and located body, and which is touched by it so that the boundaries of both are together not by compulsion) is akin to it in nature. For the order of <i>situs</i> in the parts of the universe follows upon the order of nature. For the heavenly body, which is supreme, is the most noble; after it, among the other bodies the noblest in nature is fire, and so on down to earth. Hence it is clear that the lower body which is situated according to position, next to the higher body, is akin to it in the order of nature. And therefore he adds, “not by compulsion,” in order to point out the natural order of <i>situs</i> to which the order of nature corresponds and to exclude a compulsive order of <i>situs</i> , as when by compulsion a body of earth is above air or water. Two such bodies next to one another in the natural order of <i>situs</i> and which, in the natural order of natures, are disposed to be together, do not affect each other; i.e., when they are made continuous to each other and become one—and for this they have an aptitude on account of the similarity of their natures—then they do not interact. But when distinct things are in contact, their mutually interact on account of the contrariety of their active and passive qualities. Therefore it is the kinship of nature existing between the container and the thing contained that explains why a body is naturally moved to its own place: because the rank in natural places must correspond to the rank in natures, as was said. But such a reason cannot be assigned if place is taken to be space: because in the separated dimensions of space no order of nature can be considered.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: et manet igitur natura etc., assignat causam quare corpora naturaliter quiescant in suis locis. Et dicit quod hoc accidit rationabiliter, si ponamus locum esse terminum corporis continentis: quia secundum hoc corpus locatum se habet ad corpus continens sicut quaedam pars ad totum, divisa tamen. Et hoc manifestius apparet in corporibus quae sunt facilis divisionis, sicut est aer vel aqua: horum enim partes possunt moveri ab aliquo in toto, sicut locatum movetur in loco. Et hoc etiam non solum verum est secundum figuram continendi unum sub alio, sed etiam secundum proprietatem naturae. Aer enim se habet ad aquam ut totum, quia aqua est ut materia, aer autem ut forma; nam aqua est quasi materia aeris, et aer est sicut forma eius. Quod ex hoc apparet, quia aqua est in potentia ad aerem simpliciter.
          <td>493. Then [330] he gives the reason why bodies naturally rest in their own place. And he says that this happens reasonably, if we grant that place is the boundary of the containing body: because according to this the contained body is related to the containing body after the manner of a part to a whole—a separated part, however. This is abundantly clear in bodies that are easy to divide, such as air or water: for their parts can be moved by something in the whole just as a thing in place is moved in a place. And this also is not only true according to the figure of containing one under the other, but even according to the properties of their nature. For air is related to water as the whole, because water is like matter and air like the form: water is as the matter of air, and air is as the form of water. This is so because water is in potency to air absolutely.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed verum est quod etiam aer est quodam alio modo in potentia ad aquam, ut determinabitur posterius in libro de generatione: sed ad praesens tempus necesse est hoc accipere ad ostensionem propositi. Sed hic non declaratur per certitudinem, sed in libro de generatione declarabitur certius. Ibi enim dicetur quod cum ex aqua generatur aer, est corruptio secundum quid, et generatio simpliciter, propter hoc quod perfectior forma introducitur, et imperfectior abiicitur. Cum autem ex aere generatur aqua, est corruptio simpliciter et generatio secundum quid, quia perfectior forma abiicitur, et imperfectior introducitur. Sic igitur aqua simpliciter est in potentia ad aerem, sicut imperfectum ad perfectum: aer autem est in potentia ad aquam, sicut perfectum ad imperfectum. Unde aer se habet ut forma et ut totum, quod habet rationem formae: aqua vero se habet ut materia et ut pars, quae pertinet ad rationem materiae. Quamvis igitur idem sit et materia et actus, quia aqua in se continet utrumque; sed tamen hoc quidem est in potentia proprie loquendo, scilicet aqua, sicut imperfectum: illud vero, scilicet aer, in actu ut perfectum. Unde habebit se aqua ad aerem quodammodo sicut pars ad totum. Et ideo his, scilicet aeri et aquae, cum sint duo distincta, inest tactus: sed cum ex utrisque fit unum, uno transeunte in naturam alterius, tunc fit copulatio, idest continuatio. Sicut igitur pars naturaliter quiescit in toto, ita et naturaliter corpus quiescit in suo loco naturali.
          <td>Now while it is true that in some other ways air is in potency to water, as will be explained later in <i>De Generatione</i> , it is necessary for the present to accept this in order that we may explain our proposition. Here it is not declared as a certainty, but in the <i>De Generatione</i> it will be proved with greater certainty. For it will be said there that, when air is generated from water, it is corruption <i>secundum quid</i> and generation simply, because a more perfect form is being introduced and a less perfect one is being put off. But when water is generated from air, it is corruption simply and generation <i>secundum quid</i> , because. a more perfect form is being put off and an imperfect one being introduced. Consequently, water is in potency to air absolutely as the imperfect to the perfect; but air is in potency in water as the perfect to the imperfect. Hence air is as the form, and as the whole which is like the form; water, however, is as the matter and as a part, which pertains to the notion of matter. Therefore, although the same thing is both matter and act, because the water contains both in itself; yet properly speaking, the latter, i.e., the water, is in potency as an imperfect thing, but the former, i.e., the air, in act as a perfect. Hence water will be related to air somewhat as part to whole. And therefore these things, the air and the water, when they are distinct things, they are in contact; but when they form a unity, by one passing into the nature of the other, then coupling, i.e., continuity occurs. Therefore, just as the part naturally is at rest in the whole, so also a body naturally rests in its natural place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Considerandum tamen est quod philosophus hic loquitur de corporibus secundum formas substantiales, quas habent ex influentia corporis caelestis, quod est primus locus, et dans virtutem locativam omnibus aliis corporibus: secundum autem qualitates activas et passivas est contrarietas inter elementa, et unum est corruptivum alterius.
          <td>Note, however, that the Philosopher is speaking here of bodies according to the substantial forms which they have under the influence of the heavenly body which is the first place, and which gives to all other bodies the power to act as places.

For those who hold that the void exists regard it as a sort of place or vessel which is supposed to be 'full' when it holds the bulk which it is capable of containing, 'void' when it is deprived of that—as if 'void' and 'full' and 'place' denoted the same thing, though the essence of the three is different.

But people really mean that there is an empty interval in which there is no sensible body. They hold that everything which is in body is body and say that what has nothing in it at all is void (so what is full of air is void). It is not then the existence of air that needs to be proved, but the non-existence of an interval, different from the bodies, either separable or actual—an interval which divides the whole body so as to break its continuity, as Democritus and Leucippus hold, and many other physicists—or even perhaps as something which is outside the whole body, which remains continuous.

If it could, and there were two bodies in the same place, it would also be true that any number of bodies could be together; for it is impossible to draw a line of division beyond which the statement would become untrue. If this were possible, it would follow also that the smallest body would contain the greatest; for 'many a little makes a mickle': thus if many equal bodies can be together, so also can many unequal bodies.

          <td>497. He says first therefore [342] that some of the earlier philosophers desirous of demonstrating that the void does not exist erred by not arguing against the reasons given for the existence of the void. For they did not show that the void does not exist, but gave their reasons to show that something full of air is not a void, as is evident from Anaxagoras and others who reasoned like him. In order to destroy the void they wanted to demonstrate that air is something, and thus, since the void is that in which nothing exists, it followed that something full of air is not a void.

          <td>It is clear therefore that they are not objecting against those who posit a void, because all such claim it is empty space in which no sensible body exists, for they assume that whatever exists is body perceptible to sense, and thus, where no sensible body exists, they believe nothing exists.

Quod quidem dupliciter aliqui ponebant esse vacuum: uno modo sicut separatum a corporibus, ut si diceremus spatium quod est infra extremitates alicuius domus, esse vacuum; alio modo sicut actu existens inter corpora, quod distinguit corpora ab invicem ut non sint continua, ut dixerunt Democritus et Leucippus et multi aliorum naturalium philosophorum. Imaginabantur enim quod si totum ens esset continuum, omnia essent unum: non enim esset assignare quare magis distinguerentur corpora plus hic quam ibi. Unde inter omnia corpora distincta, ponebant interesse aliquod spatium vacuum, in quo nullum ens esset. Et quia Democritus ponebat corpora componi ex multis corporibus indivisibilibus, ponebat in intermedio illorum corporum indivisibilium esse quasdam vacuitates, quas dicebat poros; et sic omnia corpora dicebat componi ex pleno et vacuo. Vel si etiam totum corpus mundi sit continuum, et non sit inter partes universi aliqua vacuitas, ponebant tamen vacuum esse extra totum mundum.
          <td>498. Therefore, to destroy their position it is not enough to show that air is something, but also one must show that there is no space without a sensible body. Space was supposed to be a void in two ways: first, as something separated from bodies, as though we were to say that the space within the confines of a house is a void; secondly, as something existing In act between bodies, preventing them from being continuous, as Democritus and Leucippus and many of the other natural philosophers held. For they imagined that if the totality of being were continuous, all things would be one: for there would be no more reason for distinguishing bodies at one point rather than another.. Hence between all distinct bodies they posited intervals of empty space in which no being existed. And since Democritus posited that bodies are composed of many indivisible bodies, he posited between those indivisibles certain empty places which he called “pores”.- in this way he explained that all bodies are composed of the full and of the empty. Or if the entire body of the world are continuous and no such empty place existed between the parts of the universe, they yet posited a void existing outside the universe.

Quarum una erat, quod motus secundum locum, qui est loci mutatio et augmentatio, ut supra dictum est, non esset si vacuum non esset. Quod sic ostendebant. Si enim aliquid movetur secundum locum, non potest moveri in plenum; quia locus plenus uno corpore, non potest recipere aliud. Quia si reciperet, sequeretur duo corpora esse in eodem loco; et eadem ratione sequeretur de quocumque: non enim potest assignari differentia quare duo corpora sint in eodem loco et non plura. Et si hoc contingit, scilicet quod quotcumque corpora sint in eodem loco, sequetur quod parvissimus locus possit recipere maximum corpus; quia multa parva constituunt unum magnum. Unde si multa parva aequalia sint in uno loco, et multa inaequalia. Sic ergo probata hac conditionali, quod si motus est, vacuum est, arguebant a positione antecedentis: motus est; ergo vacuum est.
          <td>500. He says therefore first [343] that those who affirmed the existence of the void gave more opposite reasons. One of which was that motion is respect of place, i.e., change of place and increase, as was said above, would not exist if there were no void. They showed this in the following manner: If something is in motion according to place, it cannot be moved into what is full because a place filled with one body cannot receive another. For, if it received it there would then be two bodies in the same place—and the same would follow for any [additional] body: for there is no reason why many bodies could not be in the same place if two could. And if that were to happen, i.e., that any number of bodies were in the same place, it would follow that the smallest place could receive the largest body—because many small things form one large thing. Hence, if any small equal bodies could exist in the same place, then also many could. And so, having proved this conditional position that there is motion, there is a void, they argue (by positing the antecedent): “But there is motion; therefore, there is a void.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: Melissus quidem igitur etc., ostendit quod Melissus, supposita eadem conditionali, argumentabatur e contra a destructione consequentis: quia si motus est, vacuum est; sed vacuum non est; ergo motus non est: ergo totum ens est immobile.
          <td>501. Then [344] he shows how Melissus, supposing the same conditional, argued in a contrary manner from the denial of the consequent, and reasoned thus: if motion exists, there is a void; but there is no void; therefore motion does not exist. Consequently, the totality of being is immobile.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Iste est igitur unus modus quo aliqui probabant vacuum esse quasi separatum.
          <td>Thus the foregoing is one way in which some proved that the void exists after the fashion of something separate.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: alio vero modo, quia videntur etc., ponit tres rationes ponentium vacuum esse in corporibus. Quarum prima est ex his quae condensantur. Videntur enim eorum quae inspissantur, partes coire vel convenire in invicem, et se invicem calcare et comprimere, ita quod sicut fertur, dolia tantum de vino recipiunt cum utribus, quantum etiam sine utribus, et praecipue si utres sint subtiles; propter hoc quod vinum in utribus condensari videtur. Hanc autem condensationem fieri existimabant ac si densato corpore, partes subintrarent in quasdam vacuitates.
          <td>502. Then [345] he lists three reasons given by those who held that the void exists in bodies. The first of these is based on things that condense. For in the case of things that can be compressed it seems that the parts come together and fit in together and press down and compress each other so that, as is held, casks will hold as much wine with the wine skins as without, especially if the wine skins are thin, because in the wine skins the wine seems to become condensed. This condensation they believed to take place as though in the condensed body the parts entered into certain empty spaces.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius autem et augmentum etc.: quae sumitur ex augmento. Augentur enim corpora per alimentum, quod corpus quoddam est. Duo autem corpora non possunt esse in eodem loco; ergo oportet esse aliquas vacuitates in corpore augmentato, in quibus recipiatur alimentum. Et sic necesse est esse vacuum ad hoc quod recipiatur alimentum.
          <td>503. The second reason he gives [346] is based on increase: For a body grows on account of food, which is a body. But two bodies cannot exist in the same place. Therefore there must be, in the body which has grown, certain voids in which the food may be received. Consequently, there must be a void in order that food be taken in,
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: testimonium autem et cetera. Quae sumitur ex vase pleno cinere, quod tantum recipit de aqua, quantum si esset vacuum: quod non esset nisi essent aliquae vacuitates inter partes cineris.
          <td>504. The third reason [347] is based on a vessel full of ashes being able to absorb as much water as the empty vessel. This would not be the case unless there were empty spaces between the parts of the ashes.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: esse autem affirmaverunt etc., ponit opiniones non naturalium de vacuo. Et dicit quod etiam Pythagorici affirmaverunt esse vacuum: quod quidem ingrediebatur infra partes mundi a caelo, propter vacuum infinitum, quod ponebant esse extra caelum quasi quendam aerem vel spiritum infinitum: ut sicut ille qui respirat, dividit suo flatu aliqua faciliter divisibilia, ut aquam aut huiusmodi, ita ex aliquo quasi respirante, ingrederetur distinctio in res; quam non intelligebant fieri nisi per vacuum, sicut de Democrito dictum est: ac si vacuum nihil esset aliud quam distinctio rerum. Et quia prima distinctio et pluralitas invenitur in numeris, ideo vacuum primo ponebant in numeris: ut per naturam vacui una unitas distingueretur ab alia, ne numerus sit continuus, sed habeat naturam discretam. Sed quia isti quasi aequivoce loquebantur de vacuo, appellantes rerum distinctionem vacuum, propter hoc infra de hac opinione non prosequitur.
          <td>505. Then [348] he gives the opinions of the non-natural philosophers about the void. And he says that the Pythagoreans also posited a void which entered into the parts of the universe from the heavens, on account of the infinite void which they supposed existed outside the heavens—a void like some infinite air or infinite spirit [i.e. breath]: just as a person who breathes divides by means of his breath certain things that are easy to divide, such as water or similar things, so it was that the things of this world became distinct by some being as though through breathing. They did not understand this to except through a void, as was mentioned in regard to Democritus—as though the void were nothing other than the distinction between things. And because the first distinction and plurality is found in numbers, therefore they first of all posited a void in numbers, so that it is through the nature of the void that one unit would be distinct from another—so that number would not be continuous but would have a discrete nature. But because they spoke of the void in a quasi-equivocal manner, calling the distinction of things “a void” Aristotle does not discuss this opinion below.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ultimo autem quasi epilogando concludit, dictum esse propter quid quidam dicunt esse vacuum, et quidam non dicunt.

The reason for this is that people take what exists to be body, and hold that while every body is in place, void is place in which there is no body, so that where there is no body, there must be void.

            <td>For the fact of motion in respect of place comes to the aid both of those who maintain that place is something over and above the bodies that come to occupy it, and of those who maintain that the void is something.

It is not in the least needed as a condition of movement in general, for a reason which, incidentally, escaped Melissus; viz. that the full can suffer qualitative change. But not even movement in respect of place involves a void; for bodies may simultaneously make room for one another, though there is no interval separate and apart from the bodies that are in movement. And this is plain even in the rotation of continuous things, as in that of liquids.

The same argument applies to the ashes. It is evident, then, that it is easy to refute the arguments by which they prove the existence of the void.

For the question of what something is comes after the question of whether it exists.

          <td>Dicit ergo quod secundum opinionem hominum, videtur vacuum nihil aliud significare quam locum in quo nihil sit.

Sed quia homines opinantur quod omne ens sit corpus, sequitur secundum eorum opinionem quod ubi non est corpus, nihil sit.
          <td>509. He says therefore that according to common opinion, the void seems to signify nothing more than a place In which there is nothing. The reason for this is because properly that is said to be a void in which there is not any body, and since only a body can be in place, void seems to mean nothing more than a place without any thing in it. But because people suppose that every being is a body, it follows that according to their opinion where there is not body, there is nothing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ulterius opinantur quod omne corpus sit tangibile, id est habens tangibiles qualitates. Et huiusmodi corpus est quod est grave vel leve: nondum enim erat notum quod corpus caeleste esset praeter naturam quatuor elementorum. Unde cum proprie de ratione vacui sit quod sit locus in quo non est aliquod corpus, sequitur quod vacuum sit in quo non est corpus grave vel leve: non quidem quod hoc sit de ratione vacui secundum primam impositionem nominis, sed secundum quandam syllogisticam deductionem ex communi opinione hominum, opinantium omne corpus esse grave vel leve: sicut etiam secundum opinionem communem hominum existimantium omne ens esse corpus, sequitur vacuum esse in quo nihil est.
          <td>And further they believe that every body is tangible, i.e., that it has tactile qualities. And a body of this kind is heavy or light: for in their time it was not yet known that a heavenly body is different in nature from any of the four elements. Hence since it is the very nature of the void to be a place in which there is not a body, it follows that the void is that in which there is neither a light nor a heavy body. However, this is not to say that it belongs to the notion of the void according to the primary meaning of the word, but rather by reason of a certain syllogistic deduction that starts with the general opinion of people that every body is either heavy or light; just as the common opinion of people that every being is a body, leads to the conclusion that the void is that in which there is nothing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sic igitur tribus modis potest accipi huius nominis significatio: una est propria, scilicet vacuum est locus in quo non est corpus: aliae duae secundum opinionem hominum; quarum una est communior, scilicet vacuum est locus in quo nihil est; alia vero est magis coarctata, scilicet vacuum est locus in quo non est corpus grave vel leve.
          <td>Consequently, the meaning of this word “void” is three-fold: one is proper, namely, that the void is that in which there is not any body; the others come from the general opinion of people: the first is more common, namely, that the void is a place in which nothing exists; the second is more restricted, namely, that the void is a place in which there is neither a heavy nor a light body.

Et sic concludit quod uno modo dicitur vacuum, spatium quod non est plenum corpore sensibili secundum tactum, quod scilicet est grave vel leve.
          <td>510. Then [351] he shows that must be added to this meaning. For he says that it is not correct to say that a point is a void, even though in a point there is no tangible body. So we must add that the void to a place in which there is not a tangible body, but which has in it space to receive a tangible body, just as a blind person is said to be one who lacks sight but to apt to have it. And so he concludes that in one way the void is called a space which is not full of a body that is sensible by touch, i.e., a body that is heavy or light.

Et solvit quod si spatium in quo est tantum sonus vel color, sit susceptivum corporis tangibilis, vacuum est: si vero non, non est vacuum. Et hoc ideo, quia haec non est propria definitio vacui, vacuum est in quo nihil est, nisi secundum opinionem credentium, ubi non est corpus nihil esse.
          <td>511. Then [352] he clears up the following difficulty; If there is color or sound in a certain space, should it be called a void or not? This question arises because the definition first given says that the void is that in which there is nothing. And he answers by saying that if the space in which there is just sound or color has room for a tangible body, it is a void; if not, not. The reason is that the proper definition of the void is not “that in which there is nothing,” and such a definition is held only by people who believe that where no body is, nothing is.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: alio autem modo etc., ponit aliam significationem vacui secundum usum Platonicorum.

Unde aliqui dicunt materiam corporis, secundum quod est absque forma, esse vacuum: qui etiam materiam dicunt esse locum, ut supra dictum est. Sed non bene dicunt: quia materia non est separabilis a rebus quarum est materia; sed homines quaerunt locum et vacuum, tanquam aliquid separabile a corporibus locatis.
          <td>512. Then [353] he gives the meaning of “void” as used by the Platonists. And he says that there is another meaning of the void: that in which there is no “this something” or any corporeal substance. Now a “this something” comes about on account of the form. Hence some claim that the matter of a body, insofar as it is apart from its form, is the void. These are the same who claim that matter is place, as was stated above (L.3). But this is poor judgment, for matter is not separable from the things of which it is the matter; whereas men inquire about place and the void as being separable from bodies in place.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo, quod quia vacuum est locus privatus corpore, et determinatum est de loco quomodo sit et quomodo non sit (dictum est enim quod locus non est aliquod spatium, sed terminus continentis); manifestum est etiam quod neque vacuum est spatium separatum a corporibus, neque intrinsecum corporibus, sicut ponebat Democritus. Et hoc ideo, quia ponentes vacuum quocumque istorum modorum, volunt quod vacuum non sit corpus, sed spatium corporis. Ideo enim videbatur aliquid esse vacuum, quia locus aliquid est: et sicut locus videbatur esse spatium, ita et vacuum. Si ergo locus non est aliquod spatium praeter corpora, neque vacuum potest esse spatium praeter corpora. Et cum de ratione vacui sit quod sit spatium corporis praeter corpora, ut supra dictum est, sequitur quod vacuum non sit.
          <td>He says therefore first that since the void is a place without a body in it, and since we have already decided how place exists and how it does not (for we have said that place is not a space but the boundary of a container), it is clear that the void is neither a space separated from bodies nor intrinsic to them as Democritus supposed. This is so because those who suppose that space exists in either of those two ways, intend the void to be not a body, but the space of a body. For they thought that the void was something because place was something, and just as place seems to be space, so also the void. But if place is not a space outside of bodies, neither can the void be a space outside of bodies. And since it is the very nature of the void to be a bodily space existing outside of bodies, as was said above, it follows that the void does not exist.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: et propter eadem acceptum etc., ostendit quare posuerunt vacuum.

Negantibus autem locum et vacuum, non provenit motum secundum locum esse. Et sic vacuum quodammodo opinantur causam esse motus eo modo quo et locum, ut in quo scilicet est motus.
          <td>514. Then [355] he shows why they posited a void. And he says that they admitted the existence of the void for the same reason that they admitted place, namely, on account of motion, as we said above: for it comes about that local motion is saved, both for those who assert that place is something over and above the bodies which are in place and for those who claim that the void exists. But for those who deny place and the void, there cannot be local motion. Consequently, some believed that the void is a cause of motion in the way that place is, i.e., as that in which motion takes place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: neque una autem necessitas est etc., excludit rationes ponentium vacuum esse. Et non intendit hic rationes praemissas vera solutione solvere; sed instantiam dare ex qua ex ipso aspectu apparet, quod rationes non ex necessitate concludunt. Primo ergo excludit rationes ponentium vacuum separatum; secundo ponentium vacuum in corporibus, ibi: contingit autem densari et cetera.
          <td>515. Then [356] he rejects the arguments of those who posit existence of the void. He does not, however, intend here to give a true solution to the aforesaid arguments, but to bring an objection which at a glance shows that their arguments do not conclude with necessity. First therefore he rejects the reasons given by those who posit a separated void; Secondly, the arguments of those who posit a void existing in bodies, at no. 517.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Primam autem rationem excludit dupliciter. Primo quidem, quia non est necessarium si motus sit quod vacuum sit. Et si loquamur universaliter de qualibet specie motus, manifeste apparet quod nequaquam est necessarium. Nihil enim prohibet id quod est plenum, alterari: solus enim motus localis excludi videtur si vacuum non ponatur. Et hoc latuit Melissum, dum credidit remoto vacuo omnem speciem motus auferri.
          <td>516. He rejects the first reason in two ways: First, because even though motion exists, it does not necessarily follow that the void exists. And if we speak generally of any species of motion, it is clear that the void is not necessary at all. For nothing prevents the full from being altered [i.e., having motion in quality], since only local motion seems to be excluded if the void is not posited. Yet Melissus did not see this, for he believed that if there were no void, no motion of any kind could exist.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo excludit eandem rationem per hoc quod neque motus localis tollitur, si vacuum non sit. Dato enim quod nullum spatium separabile sit praeter corpora quae moventur, potest motus localis esse per hoc quod corpora subintrent se invicem per modum inspissationis, et sic aliquid in plenum movetur, et non in vacuum. Et hoc apparet manifeste in generationibus corporum continuorum, et praecipue in humidis, sicut videtur in aqua. Si enim proiiciatur lapis in aliquam magnam latitudinem aquae, manifeste apparet fieri quasdam circulationes circa locum percussionis, quousque pars aquae depulsae commoveat aliam et subintret ipsam: unde quia modica pars aquae subintrat per quandam diffusionem in maiorem aquam, circulationes praedictae a parvo in maius procedunt, quousque totaliter deficiant.
          <td>Secondly, he rejects the same reason on the ground that not even local motion is destroyed, if there is no void. For, assuming that there is no separable space over and above moving bodies, local motion can take place, if bodies make room for one another by contracting: thus they would be moving into the full rather than into the empty. This is evident in the generations of continuous bodies, especially in liquids, such as water. For if a stone is thrown into a large surface of water, circles appear around the place of entry as long as one part of the moving water agitates another part and enters it. Hence, because a small portion of water by a process of diffusion enters a larger section, the circles grow from small to large until they cease entirely.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: contingit autem densari etc., excludit rationes ponentium vacuum in corporibus. Et primo rationem quae procedebat ex condensatione. Et dicit quod contingit corpora condensari, et partes corporis subintrare sibi invicem, non propter hoc quod pars subintrans vadat in locum vacuum; sed ideo quia erant aliqua foramina, plena aliquo corpore subtiliori, quod facta condensatione elabitur: sicut quando aqua colliditur et inspissatur, aer qui intus erat, excluditur. Et haec maxime apparent in spongia, et in huiusmodi corporibus porosis. Haec igitur solutio non ostendit causam condensationis, quam inferius ponit: sed ostendit quod etiam per hunc modum manifeste excludi potest necessitas vacui.
          <td>517. Then [357] he rejects the reasons given by those who posit a void in bodies. And first of all the reason based an condensation. And he says that bodies happen to become condensed, and parts of a body mutually penetrate, not because the invading part is entering an empty place but because there were certain openings, full of a more subtle body which escapes under condensation, just when water is compressed and contracted, the air that was present is expelled. This takes place manifestly in a sponge and other like porous bodies. Therefore this solution does not give the reason for condensation (he will give this later [L.14]: but it does show that also in this way, the need of a void can be clearly eliminated.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: et augmentari etc., excludit rationem quae procedit ex augmento. Et dicit quod augmentum contingit esse non solum per additionem alicuius corporis ingredientis in corpus augmentatum, ut sic necesse sit esse vacuum, sed etiam per alterationem: sicut cum ex aqua fit aer, maior fit quantitas aeris quam erat aquae. Et haec etiam non est vera solutio rationis inductae: sed solum instantia quaedam, ne sit necesse ponere vacuum. Vera autem solutio ponitur in libro de generatione, ubi ostenditur quod alimentum non sic transit in id quod augetur, quasi sit aliud corpus ab ipso; sed quia convertitur in substantiam eius, sicut ligna apposita igni, convertuntur in ignem.
          <td>518. Secondly [358] he rejects the argument based on growth. And he says that growth occurs not only by the addition of some body invading the growing body so as to make the void necessary but also by alteration, as, when air comes to be from water, the quantity of air becomes greater than the quantity of water. This too is not the true solution of their argument but merely an objection showing that it is not necessary to posit a void. The true solution is given in the book “ <i>De Generatione</i> , where it is shown that food does not pass into that which grows as to be a body distinct from it; rather it is converted into its substance, as wood added to fire is converted into fire.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio ibi: omnino autem et quae est de augmento etc., excludit simul et rationem de augmento et rationem de aqua effusa in cinerem: et dicit quod utraque ratio impedit seipsam. Quod sic patet. Est enim circa augmentum haec dubitatio. Videtur enim vel quod non totum augeatur; vel quod augmentum non fiat per additionem corporis, sed per additionem alicuius incorporei; aut quod contingat duo corpora esse in eodem loco. Hanc igitur dubitationem, quae communiter videtur esse tam contra ponentes vacuum, quam contra non ponentes, volunt solvere. Sed tamen non demonstrant quod vacuum sit; vel oportet eos dicere, si augmentum sit propter vacuum, quod totum corpus sit vacuum, cum totum corpus augeatur.
          <td>519. Thirdly [351] he rejects together both the argument about increase [in growth] and that about water poured on ashes and says that each of these arguments blocks the other. This is evident as follows. For there is in respect to increase this difficulty: it seems either that the whole body is not being increased, or that increase does not come about by the addition of body but by the addition of something incorporeal, or that two bodies can be in the same place. Now it is this difficulty, which seems to be against both these who posit a void and against those who do not, that they wish to solve. But they do not show that the void exists, or, if increase is due to the void, then they would have to say that the whole body is a void, since the whole body is increased.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et similiter dicendum est de cinere: quia si vas plenum cinere recipit tantum de aqua quantum vacuum, oportet dicere quod totum sit vacuum. Non est igitur hoc propter vacuitatem: sed propter commixtionem in aqua. Aqua enim commixta cineri condensatur, et aliqua pars eius exhalat; et iterum partes cineris magis inspissantur humefactione: cuius signum est, quod non potest extrahi tantum de aqua, quantum prius fuit.
          <td>Likewise, in regard to the ashes: for if a vessel full of ashes can take as much water as the empty vessel, then one has to say that the whole container must be a void. Therefore this is not due to empty space but to being mixed in with the water. For when water is mixed with ashes it condenses and part of it evaporates; moreover, parts of the ash are condensed on account of the moisture, and a sign of this is that not as much water can be recovered as was put in.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ultimo autem concludit quod manifestum est, quod facile est solvere ea ex quibus demonstrant vacuum esse.
          <td>Finally, he concludes that it is clearly easy to solve the arguments by which they prove the existence of a void.

            <td>Let us explain again that there is no void existing separately, as some maintain. If each of the simple bodies has a natural locomotion, e.g. fire upward and earth downward and towards the middle of the universe, it is clear that it cannot be the void that is the condition of locomotion. What, then, will the void be the condition of? It is thought to be the condition of movement in respect of place, and it is not the condition of this.

            <td>Again, if void is a sort of place deprived of body, when there is a void where will a body placed in it move to? It certainly cannot move into the whole of the void. The same argument applies as against those who think that place is something separate, into which things are carried; viz. how will what is placed in it move, or rest? Much the same argument will apply to the void as to the 'up' and 'down' in place, as is natural enough since those who maintain the existence of the void make it a place. And in what way will things be present either in place—or in the void? For the expected result does not take place when a body is placed as a whole in a place conceived of as separate and permanent; for a part of it, unless it be placed apart, will not be in a place but in the whole. Further, if separate place does not exist, neither will void.

            <td>If people say that the void must exist, as being necessary if there is to be movement, what rather turns out to be the case, if one the matter, is the opposite, that not a single thing can be moved if there is a void; for as with those who for a like reason say the earth is at rest, so, too, in the void things must be at rest; for there is no place to which things can move more or less than to another; since the void in so far as it is void admits no difference.

            <td>The second reason is this: all movement is either compulsory or according to nature, and if there is compulsory movement there must also be natural (for compulsory movement is contrary to nature, and movement contrary to nature is posterior to that according to nature, so that if each of the natural bodies has not a natural movement, none of the other movements can exist); but how can there be natural movement if there is no difference throughout the void or the infinite? For in so far as it is infinite, there will be no up or down or middle, and in so far as it is a void, up differs no whit from down; for as there is no difference in what is nothing, there is none in the void (for the void seems to be a non-existent and a privation of being), but natural locomotion seems to be differentiated, so that the things that exist by nature must be differentiated. Either, then, nothing has a natural locomotion, or else there is no void.

            <td>Further, in point of fact things that are thrown move though that which gave them their impulse is not touching them, either by reason of mutual replacement, as some maintain, or because the air that has been pushed pushes them with a movement quicker than the natural locomotion of the projectile wherewith it moves to its proper place. But in a void none of these things can take place, nor can anything be moved save as that which is carried is moved.

So that a thing will either be at rest or must be moved ad infinitum, unless something more powerful get in its way.

          <td>Circa primum ponit sex rationes. Circa quarum primam dicit quod oportet iterum dicere quod non est vacuum separatum, sicut quidam dicunt. Ideo autem apponit iterum, quia hoc etiam aliqualiter ostensum est ex parte loci: si enim locus non sit spatium, sequitur quod vacuum nihil sit, ut supra dictum est. Sed nunc iterum idem ostendit ex parte motus: ponebant enim vacuum, ut dictum est, propter motum. Sed propter motum non est necessarium ponere vacuum. Maxime enim videtur quod esset causa motus localis: sed propter motum localem non oportet ponere vacuum, quia omnia corpora simplicia habent motus locales naturales, sicut motus naturalis ignis est sursum, et motus terrae est deorsum et ad medium. Et sic manifestum est quod natura uniuscuiusque corporis est causa motus localis, et non vacuum. Quod quidem esset, si propter necessitatem vacui aliqua corpora naturalia moverentur. Si autem non ponitur causa motus localis, nullius alterius motus causa poni potest, neque alterius rei. Frustra igitur vacuum esset.
          <td>521. In regard to the first point he gives six reasons. In regard to the first of which he says [360] that we must repeat that there is no separated void as some assert. He says “repeat,” because this was already somewhat proved from the notion of place: for if place is not space, it follows that the void is nothing, as was said above. But now he proves the same point again from motion: for void was posited, as we said, on account of motion. But motion does not necessarily require a void. For it would seem especially to be the cause of local motion. But it is not necessary to posit a void in order to explain local motion, because all simple bodies have natural local motions, as the natural motion of fire is upward and that of earth downward toward the center. Thus it is clear that it is the nature of each body that causes its local motion and not the void. The latter would be the cause if any natural bodies were moved due to the necessity of a void. But if it is not set down as the cause of local motion, it cannot be considered the cause of any other motion or of any other thing. The void therefore would exist without a purpose.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius, si est etc.: quae talis est. Si ponatur vacuum esse, non potest assignari causa motus naturalis et quietis naturalis. Manifestum est enim quod corpus naturale movetur ad locum suum naturalem et quiescit in eo naturaliter, propter convenientiam quam habet cum ipso, et quia non convenit cum loco a quo recedit. Sed vacuum non habet aliquam naturam per quam possit convenire vel disconvenire a corpore naturali. Si ergo ponatur aliquod vacuum, quasi quidam locus privatus corpore, non poterit assignari ad quam partem illud corpus naturaliter moveatur. Non enim potest dici quod feratur ad quamlibet partem, quia hoc videmus ad sensum esse falsum, quia ab una parte naturaliter recedit, et naturaliter accedit ad aliam.
          <td>522. He then gives the second reason [361]. If a void be postulated, no reason can be assigned for natural motion and rest. For it is clear that a natural body is moved toward its own natural place and rests there naturally on account of the kinship it has with its place and because it has no kinship to the place from which it departs. But the void has no nature by which it could be akin or hostile to a natural body. Therefore, it there were a void, considered as a certain place without a body in it, one could not assign any part to which the body would be naturally moved. For we cannot say that it would be borne to just any part, because observation shows that this is wrong, for a body naturally goes from one place and naturally approaches another.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et haec eadem ratio valet contra eos qui ponunt locum esse quoddam spatium separatum, in quod corpus mobile fertur. Non enim erit assignare quomodo corpus positum in tali loco, vel moveatur vel quiescat: quia dimensiones spatii nullam habent naturam per quam possit attendi similitudo vel dissimilitudo ad corpus naturale. Et merito congruit eadem ratio de vacuo et de sursum et deorsum, idest de loco, cuius partes sunt sursum et deorsum. Quia illi qui ponunt vacuum, dicunt ipsum esse locum.
          <td>This same reason is valid against those who posit place as a separate space into which a mobile body is borne. For it would be impossible to explain how a body in such a place could either be moved or be at rest: for the dimensions of space have no nature to which a natural body could be similar or dissimilar. Deservedly, then, the same argument applies to the void as to “up” and “down,” i.e., to place, whose parts are “up” and “down”; for those who posit a void call it place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et non solum ponentes vacuum, et ponentes locum esse spatium, non possunt assignare quomodo aliquid moveatur et quiescat secundum locum: sed etiam non possunt convenienter assignare quomodo aliquid sit in loco vel in vacuo. Si enim locus ponatur esse spatium, oportet quod totum corpus inferatur in illud spatium; et non sicut accidit apud ponentes locum esse terminum corporis continentis, quod locatum est in loco sicut in aliquo separato, et sicut in quodam corpore continente et sustentante. Et hoc videtur esse de ratione loci, quod aliquid sit in loco sicut in separato et seorsum existente: quia si pars alicuius corporis non ponatur seorsum ab ipso corpore, non erit in eo sicut in loco, sed sicut in toto. Est igitur de ratione loci et locati, quod locus seorsum sit a locato. Et hoc non accidit si spatium sit locus, in quod totum mergitur totum corpus. Non igitur spatium est locus. Et si spatium non est locus, manifestum est quod vacuum non est.
          <td>Moreover, not only are those who posit a void and those who posit place to be space unable to explain how something is moved and at rest In respect to place, but also how something exists in place or in the void. For if place is supposed to be space, then the whole body would have to be enclosed inside that space, and not as happens with those who agree that place is the boundary of the containing body and that a thing is in place as in something separate and as in a body that contains and sustains it. Indeed, it seems to be of the very nature of place that something be in place as in something separated and existing apart from it: for if any part of a body is not laid down as separated from the body, it will exist in that body not as in a place but as in the whole. Therefore, it pertains to the very nature of place and of the thing in place that one be separated from the other. But this does not happen if place is space into whose entirety the entice body is immersed. Therefore space is not place. And if space is not place it is clear that no void is place.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertiam rationem ponit ibi: accidit autem dicentibus et cetera. Et dicit quod, cum antiqui philosophi ponerent quod necesse est vacuum esse si est motus, e converso accidit: quia si est vacuum, non est motus. Et hoc probat per quoddam simile. Quidam enim dixerunt quod terra quiescit in medio propter similitudinem partium circumferentiae undique: et sic terra, cum non habeat quare moveatur magis versus unam partem circumferentiae quam versus aliam, quiescit. Et eadem ratione necesse est in vacuo quiescere. Non enim est assignare quare magis moveatur, ad unam partem quam ad aliam: quia vacuum, inquantum huiusmodi, non habet differentias in suis partibus; non entis enim non sunt differentiae.
          <td>523. He gives the third reason [362] saying that, whereas the early philosophers claimed that the void had to be, if motion existed, the very opposite is the case: for if there were a void there would be no motion. And this he proves by a simile. For some have said that earth comes to rest at the center on account of the likeness of the parts on the whole circumference: consequently, earth, having no reason to be moved toward one part of the circumference more than another, rests. The same reason would cause rest in a void. For there would be no reason for earth to be moved to one part rather than to another, since the void, as such, does not have differences among its parts—for non-being does not possess differences.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quartam rationem ponit ibi: deinde quoniam omnis motus etc.: quae talis est. Motus naturalis est prior violento, cum motus violentus non sit nisi quaedam declinatio a motu naturali. Remoto ergo motu naturali, removetur omnis motus; cum remoto priori, removeatur posterius. Sed posito vacuo, removetur motus naturalis; quia tollitur differentia partium loci, ad quas est motus naturalis, sicut et posito infinito, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>524. He gives the fourth reason [363]as follows. Natural motion is prior to compulsory since compulsory motion is only a departure from natural motion. Therefore, remove natural motion and all other motion is removed; for when the prior is removed, all that follows is removed. But if the void is posited, natural motion is removed; because the differences among the parts of place would be taken away and it is toward such parts that natural motions tend The same holds if the infinite be posited, as we said above.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed hoc interest inter vacuum et infinitum, quia posito infinito, nullo modo potest poni neque sursum neque deorsum neque medium, ut in tertio dictum est: posito autem vacuo, possunt haec quidem poni, sed non quod ad invicem differant; quia nullius et non entis, et per consequens vacui, cum sit non ens et privatio, non est aliqua differentia. Sed loci mutatio naturalis requirit locorum differentiam, quia diversa corpora ad diversa loca moventur. Unde oportet loca naturalia differre ad invicem. Si igitur ponatur vacuum, nullius erit naturalis loci mutatio. Et si non est loci mutatio naturalis, nulla loci mutatio erit. Unde si est aliqua loci mutatio, oportet quod vacuum non sit.
          <td>There is, however, this difference between the void and the infinite, that after granting the infinite there is no way of positing “up” or “down” or “center,” as we pointed out in Book III; but after granting a void, these places could be posited, but it would not be because they were mutually different: for no difference can be assigned in the realm of nothing and non-being and, consequently, of the void, which is a non-being and a privation. Yet natural changes of place do require difference of place, because diverse bodies are moved to diverse places. Consequently, natural places must be different one from the other. Therefore, if a void be posited, nothing could undergo a natural change of place; and if there is no natural change of place, there will be no change of place of any sort. Hence, if there is any change of place, there can be no void.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quintam rationem ponit ibi: amplius, nunc quidem proiecta et cetera. Circa quam considerandum est quod solet esse quaedam dubitatio circa ea quae proiiciuntur: oportet enim movens et motum simul esse, ut infra in septimo probatur; et tamen illud quod proiicitur, invenitur moveri etiam postquam separatum est a proiiciente, sicut apparet in lapide proiecto, et sagitta emissa per arcum. Nunc igitur supposito quod vacuum non sit, solvitur ista dubitatio ex parte aeris, quo medium repletur. Et hoc dupliciter. Dicunt enim quidam quod ea quae proiiciuntur, moventur etiam postquam non tanguntur a proiiciente, propter antiperistasim, idest repercussionem vel contra-resistentiam: aer enim motus repercutitur ad alium aerem, et ille ad alium, et sic deinceps; et per talem repercussionem aeris ad aerem movetur lapis.
          <td>525. The fifth reason is then given [364]. in regard to this it should be considered that some question exists about projectiles: for the mover and the thing moved must be always together, as will be proved below in Book VII (1-3). Yet a projectile is found to be in motion even after it is separated from the projector, as is evident in the case of a stone that is thrown, or of an arrow shot from a bow. Now on the supposition that there is no void this difficulty is solved by attending to the air with which the medium [the field of trajectory] is filled. And it is solved in two ways. For some assert that projectiles remain in motion even after they are no longer contact with what gave them impulse on account of <i>antiperistasis</i> , i.e., repercussion or counter-resistence: for the air that has been pushed, pushes against other air, and that against other air, and so on, and it is on account of this impact of air against air that the stone is moved.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Alii vero dicunt quod hoc ideo est, quia aer, qui continuus existens a proiiciente impellitur, velocius impellit corpus proiectum, quam sit motus quo corpus proiectum fertur naturaliter in proprium locum. Unde propter velocitatem motus aeris non permittitur corpus proiectum, ut puta lapis vel aliud huiusmodi, cadere deorsum; sed fertur secundum impulsionem aeris.
          <td>The other explanation is that the continuum of air that received the impact from the projector pushes the impelled body with more speed than the speed of the motion by which the projectile is naturally borne to its proper place. Hence the speed of the air movement prevents the projectile, for example, the stone, or some other such, from falling downward; but it is carried along by the impulse of the air.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Nulla autem istarum causarum posset poni, si esset vacuum; et ita corpus proiectum nullo modo ferretur nisi quandiu veheretur, puta a manu proiicientis, sed statim emissus a manu caderet; cuius contrarium videmus. Non ergo est vacuum.
          <td>Now neither of these explanations could be alleged if there were a void; consequently, a projectile could be moved only as long as it was carried, for example, in the hand of the one casting it: but as soon as it was released from the hand it would fall. But it is the opposite that happens. Therefore, there is not a void.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sextam rationem ponit ibi: amplius nullus utique etc.: quae talis est. Si motus sit in vacuo, nullus poterit assignare causam propter quid illud quod movetur, alicubi stat. Non enim est ratio quare magis quiescat in una parte vacui quam in alia; neque in his quae moventur naturaliter, cum non sit differentia in partibus vacui, ut supra dictum est; neque in his quae moventur motu violento. Nunc enim dicimus quod cessat motus violentus, ubi deficit repercussio vel impulsio aeris, secundum duas causas assignatas. Oportebit ergo quod vel quiescat omne corpus, et nihil moveatur; aut si aliquid moveatur, quod movetur in infinitum, nisi occurrat ei aliquod corpus maius, quod violentum motum eius impediat.
          <td>526. He then gives the sixth reason [365]. If motion were in a void, no one could give a reason why the moving object should stop anywhere. For there is no reason why it should stop at one part of the void rather than another. This is true both in the case of objects that are moved naturally, because there is no difference among the parts of the void, as we have said, and in the case of objects moved by a compulsory motion. For now we say that a violent compulsory motion ceases when repercussions or impulsions of the air are lacking, on account of the two reasons already given. Therefore it will have to be admitted either that every body is at rest and nothing in motion or that, if anything be in motion, it will remain In motion to infinity unless it runs into a more powerful body that could impede its compulsory motion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ad confirmationem autem huius rationis, subiungit causam quare ponunt aliqui motum fieri in vacuo; quia scilicet vacuum cedit, et non resistit mobili; unde cum vacuum similiter cedit ex omni parte, feretur in infinitum ex qualibet parte.
          <td>In support of this reasoning, he gives the reason why some posit motion in the void. It is because the void yields to and does not resist the mobile; hence since the void yields in the same way, in all directions, a mobile thing should be moved in all directions <i>ad infinitum</i> .

For let B be water and D air; then by so much as air is thinner and more incorporeal than water, A will move through D faster than through B. Let the speed have the same ratio to the speed, then, that air has to water. Then if air is twice as thin, the body will traverse B in twice the time that it does D, and the time G will be twice the time E.

So that it will traverse Z in an equal time whether Z be full or void. But this is impossible. It is plain, then, that if there is a time in which it will move through any part of the void, this impossible result will follow: it will be found to traverse a certain distance, whether this be full or void, in an equal time; for there will be some body which is in the same ratio to the other body as the time is to the time.

Secundario autem impedit, si etiam quiescat: quia si simul moveretur cum mobili, non impediret, sed magis iuvaret, sicut fluvius qui defert navem inferius. Sed inter ea quae impediunt, magis impedit illud quod non facile dividitur; et tale est corpus magis grossum. Et hoc manifestat per exemplum. Sit enim corpus quod movetur a; spatium per quod movetur, sit b; et tempus in quo a movetur per b, sit c. Ponamus autem aliud spatium quod sit d, aequalis longitudinis cum b; sed tamen d sit plenum subtiliori corpore quam b, secundum aliquam analogiam, idest proportionem, corporis medii, quod impedit motum corporis; ut puta quod spatium b sit plenum aqua, spatium vero d sit plenum aere. Quanto ergo aer est subtilior aqua et minus spissus, tanto mobile quod est a, citius movebitur per spatium d, quam per spatium b. Quae est ergo proportio aeris ad aquam in subtilitate, eadem est proportio velocitatis ad velocitatem: et quanto est maior velocitas, tanto est minus tempus; quia velocior motus dicitur, qui est in minori tempore per aequale spatium, ut in sexto dicetur. Unde, si aer est in duplo subtilior quam aqua, sequetur quod tempus in quo a movetur per b, quod est plenum aqua, sit duplum tempore in quo pertransit d, quod est plenum aere: et ita tempus c, in quo pertransit spatium b, erit duplum tempore quod est e, in quo pertransit spatium d. Et sic poterimus universaliter accipere, quod in quacumque proportione medium, per quod aliquid fertur, est subtilius et minus impeditivum et facilius divisibile, in eadem proportione erit motus velocior.
          <td>First of all he explains the first proposition of this argument. And he says that the medium through which a body is in motion is the cause of its fastness or slowness because it acts as an obstacle to the body in motion. The greatest obstacle occurs when the medium is in a contrary motion, as is evident in the case of a ship whose movement is impeded by the wind. The medium is an obstacle in a secondary way even if it is not in motion, because if it were in motion with the object it would not be an obstacle but a help, as the water which carries a ship downstream. But among obstacles a greater impediment is offered by things that are not easy to divide, such as the grosser bodies. He explains this by an example. Let the body in motion be A, and let the space through which it is being moved be B, and the time in which A is being moved through B be C. Let us posit another space, D, of the same length as B, but let D be full of a subtler body than the one in B, so that a certain analogy, i.e., ratio, exists between the bodies which impede the motion (for example, let B be full of water and D full of air). Now to the extent that air is subtler than water and less condensed, to that extent will the mobile A be more quickly moved through D than through B. Therefore the ratio of the velocities will equal the ratio of the subtlety of air to the subtlety of water. And the greater the velocity, the less the time: because that motion is faster which covers the same interval in less time, as will be shown in Book VI (L.3). Hence if air is twice as subtle as water, the time it takes A to be moved through B (full of’ water) will be twice the time for A to pass through D (full of air). Consequently, the time C in which it travels the distance B will be twice the time it takes E to pass through D. Therefore, we can take it as a general rule that in whatever ratio the medium (in which something is in motion) is subtler and less resistant and more easily divisible, in that ratio will the motion be faster.

          <td>530. Then [368] he explains the second proposition, and says that the void is not exceeded by the full according to some certain ratio. And he proves this by the fact that a number does not exceed nothing [zero] by any ratio, for ratios can exist only between one number and another, or between a number and unity; as four exceeds three by one, and exceeds two by more yet, and one by still more. Hence there is said to be a greater ratio existing between four and one, than between four and two, or four and three. But four does not exceed nothing according to any ratio.

For a same reason one could not say that a line exceeds a point unless it were composed of points and divided into points.

Et hoc quidem continget, si inveniatur aliquod corpus quod differat in subtilitate ab aere, quo ponebatur plenum spatium d, secundum illam proportionem quam habet tempus e ad tempus I; ut puta si dicatur illud corpus esse ignis, quo ponatur plenum spatium z, quod prius ponebatur vacuum: quia si corpus quo ponitur plenum spatium z, est tanto subtilius corpore quo ponitur plenum spatium d, quantum tempus e excedat tempus I, sequetur quod mobile quod est a, si feratur per z, quod est spatium plenum subtilissimo corpore, et per d, quod est spatium plenum aere, transibit per z e converso in maiori velocitate in tanto tempore, quantum est I. Si ergo nullum corpus sit in quo est z, sed ponatur hoc spatium vacuum, sicut et primo; adhuc debebit velocius moveri. Sed hoc est contra id quod fuit positum. Positum enim erat quod motus fieret per spatium z, quod est vacuum, in tempore I; et sic cum in tempore I transeat idem spatium, cum est plenum subtilissimo corpore, sequitur quod in eodem tempore transibit idem mobile unum et idem spatium, cum est vacuum et cum est plenum.
          <td>Now if it is supposed that a motion through Z has a certain ratio in respect of speed to the motions through B and D, then it must be admitted that the motion through Z (the void) takes place in some definite portion of time, because velocities are distinguished according to the quantities of the times consumed, as was said above. If therefore we say the object A passes through the empty space Z in a definite time, let that time be I, which must be less than the time E required for A to pass through D, which is full of air. Then the ratio of the motion through the empty to the motion through the full will equal the ratio of time E to time I. But during time I, the mobile A will pass through a definite space that is full of a subtler body than exists in D, i.e., than D. And this will happen, if one can find a body which differs in subtlety from air (of which D is full) in the ratio that the time E has to the time I. For example, say the space Z, which had been originally empty space, is now full of fire. If the body of which Z is full is subtler than the body of which D is full, in the amount that the time E exceeds the time I, it will follow that the mobile A, if it is in motion through Z (which is the space now full of a most subtle body), and through D (which is the space full of air), it will pass through Z conversely at a greater speed in a time I. If therefore no body exists in Z but it is again considered to be empty space, as previously, it will have to move even faster. But this is against what was laid down, namely, that the motion through Z (empty space) required time I. Consequently, since in time I it passes over the same space when it is full of the most subtle of bodies, it follows that during the same time the same mobile passes through one and the same space, when that space is empty and when it is full.

          <td>Sed contra hanc rationem Aristotelis insurgunt plures difficultates. Quarum quidem prima est, quod non videtur sequi, si fiat motus per vacuum, quod non habeat proportionem in velocitate ad motum qui fit per plenum. Quilibet enim motus habet determinatam velocitatem ex proportione potentiae motoris ad mobile, etiam si nullum sit impedimentum. Et hoc patet per exemplum et per rationem. Per exemplum quidem in corporibus caelestibus, quorum motus a nullo impeditur; et tamen eorum est determinata velocitas, secundum determinatum tempus. Per rationem autem, quia ex hoc ipso quod in magnitudine, per quam transit motus, est accipere prius et posterius, contingit etiam accipere prius et posterius in motu; ex quo sequitur motum esse in determinato tempore. Sed verum est quod huic velocitati potest aliquid subtrahi ex aliquo impediente. Non igitur oportet quod proportio motus ad motum in velocitate, sit sicut proportio impedimenti ad impedimentum, ita quod si non sit aliquod impedimentum, quod motus fiat in non tempore: sed oportet quod secundum proportionem impedimenti ad impedimentum, sit proportio retardationis ad retardationem.
          <td>534. But several difficulties arise against this reasoning of Aristotle. The first is that it does not seem to follow that if motion takes place in the void that it has no ratio to motion in the full. For every motion has its definite velocity from the ratio of the motive energy to the mobile, even if no obstacle exists. And this is evident both from an example and from reason. From an example, indeed, in the heavenly bodies, whose motion encounters no obstacle and yet they have a definite velocity depending on the amount of time. From reason also: for, since it is possible to point out a “before” and “after” in the magnitude through which the motion takes place, so also one can take a “before” and “after” in the motion from which it follows that motion is in a determined time. But it is true that this velocity can be diminished on account of an obstacle. Yet it is not necessary therefore to make the ratio of motion to motion in respect of velocity be as the ratio of obstacle to obstacle, so as to make the motion occur in no time, if there be no obstacle; rather, the ratio of one slowing up to another slowing up must correspond to the ratio of obstacle to obstacle.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde posito quod motus sit per vacuum, sequitur quod nulla retardatio accidat supra velocitatem naturalem; et non sequitur quod motus qui est per vacuum, non habeat proportionem ad motum qui fit per plenum.
          <td>Hence on the assumption that motion takes place in the void, it follows that no slowing up happens to the natural speed, but it does not follow that a motion in the void will have no ratio to motion in the full.

          <td>Huic autem obiectioni Averroes in commento suo resistere conatur. Et primo quidem conatur ostendere hanc obiectionem ex falsa imaginatione procedere. Dicit enim quod ponentes praedictam obiectionem imaginantur additionem in tarditate motus fieri, sicut fit additio in magnitudine lineae, quod pars addita sit alia a parte cui additur. Ita enim videtur praedicta obiectio procedere, ac si tardatio fiat per hoc, quod aliquis motus addatur alteri motui, ita quod subtracto illo motu addito per impedimentum retardans, remaneat quantitas motus naturalis. Sed hoc dicit non esse simile: quia cum retardatur motus, quaelibet pars motus fit tardior; non autem quaelibet pars lineae fit maior.
          <td>535. Averroes attempts to counter this objection in his commentary. First he tries to show that this objection proceeds from false imagination. For he says that those who make the above objection imagine that an addition in slowness of motion occurs just like an addition in the magnitude of a line, where the added part is distinct from the part to which the addition is made. For the above objection seems to proceed as though slowing up takes place by adding one motion to another motion in such a way that if you were to subtract the motion that was added through the obstacle which slows, the quantity of natural motion would then be left. But this is not the case, because when a motion is slowed up, each part of the motion becomes slower, whereas each part of a line does not become larger.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde ostendere nititur, quomodo ratio Aristotelis necessitatem habeat. Et dicit quod velocitas vel tarditas motus consurgit quidem ex proportione motoris ad mobile; sed oportet mobile esse aliquo modo resistens motori, sicut patiens quodammodo est contrarium agenti. Quae quidem resistentia potest esse ex tribus. Primo quidem ex ipso situ mobilis: ex hoc enim ipso quod movens intendit transferre mobile ad aliquod ubi, ipsum mobile in alio ubi existens repugnat intentioni motoris; secundo ex natura mobilis, sicut apparet in motibus violentis, ut cum grave proiicitur sursum; tertio ex parte medii. Omnia enim haec tria accipienda sunt simul ut unum resistens, ad hoc quod causetur una causa tarditatis in motu. Quando igitur mobile, seorsum consideratum secundum quod differt a movente, est aliquid ens actu, potest inveniri resistentia mobilis ad motorem, vel ex parte mobilis tantum, sicut accidit in corporibus caelestibus, vel ex parte mobilis et medii simul, sicut accidit in corporibus animatis quae sunt hic. Sed in gravibus et levibus, subtracto eo quod mobile habet a movente, scilicet forma, quae est principium motus, quam dat generans, quod est movens, non remanet nisi materia, ex cuius parte nulla resistentia potest considerari ad movens; unde relinquitur in talibus sola resistentia ex parte medii. Sic igitur in corporibus caelestibus est differentia velocitatis solum secundum proportionem motoris ad mobile; in corporibus vero animatis secundum proportionem motoris ad mobile et ad medium resistens simul. Et in talibus procederet obiectio praedicta, quod remota retardatione quae est ex parte medii impedientis, adhuc remanet determinata quantitas temporis in motu, secundum proportionem motoris ad mobile. Sed in gravibus et levibus non potest esse retardatio velocitatis, nisi secundum resistentiam medii; et in talibus procedit ratio Aristotelis.
          <td>Then he attempts to show how Aristotle’s argument concludes with necessity. And he says that the speed or slowness of a motion does indeed arise from the proportion of the mover to the mobile; but the mobile must in some manner resist the mover, as the patient is in a certain way contrary to the agent. This resistance can arise from three sources: First, from the <i>situs</i> of the mobile; for from the very fact that the mover intends to transfer the mobile to some certain place, the mobile, existing in some other place, resists the intention of the mover. Secondly, from the nature of the mobile, as is evident in compulsory motions, as when a heavy object is thrown upwards. Thirdly, from the medium. All three are taken together as one resistance, to constitute one cause of slowing up in the motion. Therefore when the mobile, considered in isolation as different from the mover, is a being in act, the resistance of the mobile to the mover can be traced either to the mobile only, as happens in the heavenly bodies, or to the mobile and medium together, as happens in the case of animate bodies on this earth. But in heavy and light objects, if you take away what the mobile receives from the mover, viz., the form which is the principle of motion given by the generator, i.e., by the mover, nothing remains but the matter which can offer no resistance to the mover. Hence in light and heavy objects the only source of resistance is the medium. Consequently, in heavenly bodies differences in velocity arise only on account of the ratio between mover and mobile; in animate bodies from the proportion of the mover to the mobile and to the resisting medium—both together. And it is in these latter cases that the given objection would have effect, viz., that if you remove the slowing up caused by the impeding medium, there still remains a definite amount of time in the motion, according to the proportion of the mover to the mobile. But in heavy and light bodies, there can be no slowing up of speed, except what the resistance of the medium causes—and in such cases Aristotle’s argument applies.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed haec omnino videntur esse frivola. Primo quidem, quia licet quantitas tarditatis non sit secundum modum quantitatis continuae, ut addatur motus motui, sed secundum modum quantitatis intensivae, sicut cum aliquid est altero albius; tamen quantitas temporis ex qua Aristoteles argumentatur, est secundum modum quantitatis continuae, et fit tempus maius per additionem temporis ad tempus; unde subtracto tempore quod additur ex impediente, remanet tempus naturalis velocitatis.
          <td>536. But all this seems quite frivolous. First, because, although the quantity of slowing up is not parallel to the mode of continuous quantity, so that motion is added to motion, but parallel to the mode of intensive quantity, as when something is whiter than something else, yet the quantity of time from which Aristotle argues is parallel to the manner of continuous quantity—and time becomes greater by the addition of time to time. Hence if you subtract the time which was added on account of the obstacle, the time of the natural velocity remains.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde quia in gravibus et levibus remota forma, quam dat generans, remanet per intellectum corpus quantum; quod ex hoc ipso quod quantum est, in opposito situ existens, habet resistentiam ad motorem; non enim potest intelligi alia resistentia in corporibus caelestibus ad suos motores. Unde nec etiam in gravibus et levibus sequetur ratio Aristotelis, secundum quod ipse dicit.
          <td>Then, because if you remove the form which the generator gives to light and heavy bodies there still remains in the understanding “quantified body,” which from the very fact that it is a quantified body existing in an opposite <i>situs</i> offers resistance to the mover. For we cannot suppose in heavenly bodies any other resistance to their movers. Hence, as he [Averroes] presents the case, even in the case of heavy and light bodies the reasoning of Aristotle would not follow.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo melius et brevius dicendum est, quod ratio Aristotelis inducta, est ratio ad contradicendum positioni, et non ratio demonstrativa simpliciter.

Et ideo contra eos Aristoteles argumentatur, ac si tota causa velocitatis et tarditatis esset ex parte medii; sicut etiam et supra evidenter hoc ostendit dicens, quod si natura est causa motus simplicium corporum, non oportet ponere vacuum ut causam motus eorum: per quod dat intelligere quod totam causam motus ponebant ex parte medii, et non ex natura mobilis.
          <td>Therefore it is better and briefer to say that the argument brought forward by Aristotle is an argument aimed at contradicting his opponent’s position and not a demonstrative argument in the absolute sense. For those who posited a void did so in order that motion be not prevented. Thus, according to them, the cause of motion was on the part of a medium which did not impede motion. And therefore Aristotle argued against them as though the total cause of fastness and slowness derived from the medium, as he clearly shows above when he says that if nature is the cause of the motion of simple bodies, it is not necessary to posit the void as the cause of their motion. In this way he gives us to understand that they supposed the total cause of the motion to depend on the medium and not on the nature of the mobile.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secunda autem dubitatio contra rationem praedictam est, quia si medium quod est plenum, impedit, ut ipse dicit, sequitur quod non sit in hoc medio inferiori aliquis motus purus non impeditus, quod videtur inconveniens.

          <td>537. The second difficulty against [Aristotle’s] argument is that if the medium which is full impedes, as he says it does, then it follows that there will not be any pure unimpeded motion in this lower medium—and this seems unfitting. To this the Commentator replies that the impediment that arises from the medium is required by the natural motion of heavy and light bodies, so that there can be resistance of the mobile to the mover, at least on the side of the medium.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed melius dicendum est quod omnis motus naturalis incipit a loco non naturali, et tendit in locum naturalem.

          <td>But it is better to say that every natural motion begins from a place that is not natural and tends to a natural place. Hence until it reaches its natural place it is not unfitting if something unnatural be attached to it.

          <td>Et dicit quod haec quae dicentur consequuntur, si consideretur differentia velocitatis et tarditatis, secundum quod mobilia quae feruntur se invicem excellunt; quia videmus quod per aequale spatium finitum, citius feruntur ea quae habent maiorem inclinationem aut secundum gravitatem aut secundum levitatem; sive sint maiora in quantitate, aequaliter gravia vel levia existentia, sive sint aequalia in quantitate, et sint magis gravia vel levia. Et hoc dico si similiter se habeant secundum figuras: nam corpus latum tardius movetur, si deficiat in gravitate vel magnitudine, quam corpus acutae figurae. Et secundum proportionem quam habent magnitudines motae ad invicem vel in gravitate vel in magnitudine, est proportio velocitatis. Unde et oportebit ita esse etiam si sit motus per vacuum, scilicet quod corpus gravius seu levius aut magis acutum velocius feratur per medium vacuum. Sed hoc non potest esse: quia non est assignare aliquam causam propter quam unum corpus alio velocius feratur. Si enim motus fiat per spatium plenum aliquo corpore, potest assignari causa maioris vel minoris velocitatis, secundum aliquam praedictarum causarum: hoc enim est, quia illud quod movetur maius existens, ex sua fortitudine velocius dividit medium; vel propter aptitudinem figurae, quia acutum est penetrabilius, aut propter inclinationem maiorem, quam habet vel ex gravitate vel ex levitate, vel etiam propter violentiam prohibentis. Vacuum autem dividi non potest citius vel tardius: unde sequetur quod omnia aequali velocitate movebuntur per vacuum. Sed hoc manifeste apparet impossibile.
          <td>And he says that what he is about to say will follow logically, if we attend to the difference of speed and slowness insofar as bodies in motion exceed one another. For we see that over a given equal space, greater speed is shown by bodies having a greater inclination due either to heaviness or lightness, whether they are greater in quantity but equally heavy or light, or whether they are equal in quantity but unequal in heaviness or lightness. And I say this if they are similar in shape. For a wide body is moved more slowly if it be deficient in heaviness or size than a body with a pointed shape. And the ratio of the velocity corresponds to the ratio which the moving magnitudes have to one another in respect to their weight or in respect to their magnitude. And this will have to be true also if the motion occurs in the void, namely, that a heavier body or a lighter body or a more pointed body will be moved faster through an empty medium. But this cannot be, since it is impossible to explain why one body would be moved faster than another. For if the motion takes place within a space filled with some body, an explanation for the greater or lesser speed can be given—it will be due to any of the aforesaid causes. The explanation is that a greater body will on account of its strength divide the medium more quickly, either an account of its shape, because what is sharp has greater penetrating power; or on account of a greater inclination traceable either to the heaviness or lightness of the body; or even to the force imparted by that which projects it. But the void cannot be cleaved faster or slower. Hence it will be moved through a void with equal speed. But this clearly appears as impossible.

Sed solvenda est haec dubitatio sicut et prius.
          <td>It should be observed that in this reasoning process there exists the same difficulty as in the first one. For he seems to suppose that difference in velocity in motions is due only to the different ways in which the medium can be cleaved, whereas the fact is that there are differences of velocity among the heavenly bodies in which there is no full medium resisting which has to be cleaved by the motion of the heavenly body. But this difficulty should be solved as the above one was.

Sic igitur praemissi philosophi opinantur vacuum esse quoddam discretum et separatum secundum se, scilicet quoddam spatium habens dimensiones separatas: et huiusmodi vacuum opinantur necesse esse, si sit motus secundum locum.

          <td>540. Finally [347] he summarizes, and concludes that from the foregoing it is clear that in regard to the philosophers who posit a void, the contrary of what they supposed as a reason for proving it occurs. For they proceeded on the assumption that motion could not take place unless there was a void. But the contrary has been proved; namely, that if there be a void, there is no motion. Thus, therefore, those philosophers believe that the void is some distinct and separate thing—a space having separate dimensions—and they believed it was such a space that had to exist if local motion were to be possible. However, to posit such a separated void is the same as saying that place is a kind of space distinct from bodies—which is impossible, as was shown in the treatise on place.

            <td>But even if we consider it on its own merits the so-called vacuum will be found to be really vacuous. For as, if one puts a cube in water, an amount of water equal to the cube will be displaced; so too in air; but the effect is imperceptible to sense. And indeed always in the case of any body that can be displaced, must, if it is not compressed, be displaced in the direction in which it is its nature to be displaced—always either down, if its locomotion is downwards as in the case of earth, or up, if it is fire, or in both directions—whatever be the nature of the inserted body. Now in the void this is impossible; for it is not body; the void must have penetrated the cube to a distance equal to that which this portion of void formerly occupied in the void, just as if the water or air had not been displaced by the wooden cube, but had penetrated right through it. But the cube also has a magnitude equal to that occupied by the void; a magnitude which, if it is also hot or cold, or heavy or light, is none the less different in essence from all its attributes, even if it is not separable from them; I mean the volume of the wooden cube. So that even if it were separated from everything else and were neither heavy nor light, it will occupy an equal amount of void, and fill the same place, as the part of place or of the void equal to itself. How then will the body of the cube differ from the void or place that is equal to it? And if there can be two such things, why cannot there be any number coinciding? This, then, is one absurd and impossible implication of the theory.

          <td>If anyone places a cubic body in water (i.e., a body having six square surfaces) an amount of water equal to the quantity of the cube must be displaced. And what is true of water is true of air, although it is not so evident, because water is more perceptible to sense than air. By the same reasoning applied to the case of any body that can be displaced, in some part, it must, if the parts are not compressed, or enter into each other, be dislodged either (1) according to the state of a yielding body (when it has free exit); for example, if it is a heavy body such as earth it will yield downwards, and if it is a light body such as fire it will yield upwards, and if it is a body which is light in relation to one body and heavy in relation to another, it will yield in both directions, such as do air and water; or (2) because the body yields on account of the condition of the newly imposed body, i.e., when the yielding body is prevented by the imposed body, i.e., when the yielding body is prevented by the imposed body from being moved according to its demands but is moved according to the demands of the imposed body. And in general it can be held as true that a body must yield to an inserted one, lest two bodies be in the same place.

          <td>But this will not be true in the case of the void, i.e., that it must yield to the inserted body, since the void is not a body, whereas whatever is moved in any manner whatsoever is a body. But if there be empty space and a body inserted therein, then the inserted body must pass through that space which previously was empty and cohabit the same space as the void—just as if water or air were not to yield to a wooden cube, but were to pass into the cube in such a way that the air and water would penetrate that cubic body and cohabit with it.

Hoc autem quod est secundum rationem alterum a passionibus, est ipsum corpus lignei cubi, idest quod pertinet ad corporeitatem eius. Si ergo separetur hoc corpus ab omnibus quae sunt alia ab ipso secundum rationem, ita quod non sit neque grave neque leve, sequitur quod contineat vel occupet de spatio vacuo aliquid aequale sibi.

And even though the wooden cube be hot or cold, heavy or light, nevertheless the cubic body is other in notion from all the sensible qualities, that are its accidents, although it be not separable from them in reality. Now what is in conception distinct from the qualities is the body of a wooden cube, i.e., that which pertains to its corporeity. Now if this body be separated from whatever is distinct from it in notion, so that it is neither heavy nor light, it follows that it will occupy a volume of empty space equal to itself. Thus in the same part equal to it, which is part of the place and of the void, the body of the wooden cube will be.

Duae autem magnitudines aequalis quantitatis non possunt differre, nisi secundum situm. Non enim potest imaginari quod haec linea sit alia ab illa sibi aequali, nisi inquantum imaginamur utramque in alio et alio situ. Unde si ponantur duae magnitudines simul, non videtur quod possint differre: et sic si duo corpora aequalia dimensionata sint simul, sive sint cum passionibus sensibilibus sive non, sequitur quod duo corpora sint unum. Vel si adhuc corpus cubicum, et spatium quod est locus vel vacuum, remaneant duo et simul sint, non potest assignari ratio quare non quaecumque alia corpora simul possint esse in eodem. Et ita, sicut corpus cubicum simul est cum spatio loci aut vacui, ita etiam simul cum utroque poterit adhuc esse aliud tertium vel etiam quartum corpus: quod est impossibile. Non enim potest dici quod simul cum corpore cubico ligneo non possit esse simul aliud corpus sensibile, propter materiam: quia corpori non debetur locus ratione materiae, nisi secundum quod materia continetur sub dimensionibus. Unde quod duo corpora non possint esse simul, non est ex parte materiae vel passionum sensibilium, sed solum ex ratione dimensionum, in quibus non potest esse diversitas si sint aequales, nisi secundum situm, ut dictum est. Unde cum dimensiones sint in spatio vacuo sicut in corpore sensibili, sicut duo corpora sensibilia non possunt esse simul, ita nec corpus sensibile simul cum spatio vacuo. Hoc est igitur unum inconveniens et impossibile, quod sequitur ex praemissa positione, quod duo corpora sunt simul.
          <td>On this assumption it does not seem possible to find a difference between the body of the cube and the dimensions of the place or void. For just as the dimensions of the place or void exist without sensible qualities, so too the dimensions of the cubic body, at least according to notion, are distinct from its sensible qualities. But two magnitudes of equal quantity can differ only in <i>situs</i> . For we cannot imagine one line as distinct from another of equal length, unless we imagine one in one <i>situs</i> and the other in another. Hence, if two magnitudes are imagined together, it does not seem that they can differ: consequently, if two bodies of equal dimensions are together, whether accompanied by their sensible qualities or not, it follows that two bodies are one, or if the cubic body and the space which is the place or void remain two, but are still together, there is no reason why any number of bodies cannot be there. In that case, just as the cubic body is together with the space of the place or void, along with both a third or even a fourth body ought to be able to be inserted. This, of course, is impossible. For we cannot say that it is because of matter that some other sensible body cannot exist together with the wooden cubic body, for place does not belong to a body because of its matter, except in the sense that the matter is contained under dimensions. Hence the impossibility for two bodies to be together is not on account of the matter or of the sensible qualities, but only on account of the dimensions, in which no diversity can be found if they are equal except a diversity based on <i>situs</i> , as was said. Wherefore since there are dimensions in empty space just as there are in a sensible body, then, just as two sensible bodies cannot be together, so neither can a sensible body be together with empty space. So this is one unacceptable result and impossibility that follows from the aforementioned premise: namely, that two bodies would be in the same place.

Si ergo dimensiones corporis cubici non differunt a dimensionibus loci secundum rationem, quare oportet facere aliquem locum corporibus extra proprium corpus uniuscuiusque, si locus nihil aliud est quam corpus impassibile, idest absque passionibus sensibilibus? Ex quo enim corpus habet proprias dimensiones, ad nihil videtur esse necessarium quod ponantur circa ipsum aliquae aliae dimensiones spatii aequalis suis dimensionibus.

          <td>542. He then gives the second reason [376], saying that it is clear that a cube which is transferred to an empty space has what all other bodies have, namely, dimensions. If therefore the dimensions of the cube do not differ from the dimensions of the place according to conception, why is it necessary to find for a body a place distinct from its own body, if place is nothing more than “impossible body,” i.e., a body without sensible qualities? In view of the fact that a body has its own dimensions, there seems to be no necessity for it to be surrounded by other dimensions of a space equal to its own dimensions. Consequently if the void is presumed, or place as a certain separated space, it follows that bodies do not have to be in place.

Quia si etiam pisces essent ferrei, et haberent similem apparentiam cum aqua, non posset aqua discerni ab eis per visum; nec tamen sequeretur quod aqua non esset, vel etiam pisces: quia non solum visu, sed etiam tactu discernitur illud quod tangitur. Et sic patet aerem aliquid esse: quia tactu percipitur calidus vel frigidus.
          <td>543. He gives the third reason [377] when he says that if there were a void, it would have to be evident in mobile things. But there is no evidence of a void anywhere in the world, because what is full of air seems to be a void, though it to not. For air is something, although not perceptible to sight. Now if fish were made of iron and had the same appearance as water, our sight would not be able to distinguish them from water; but it would not follow that the water, or even the fish, were non-existent: for it is not only by sight but also by touch that we can discern what is touched. Consequently, it is evident that water is something, because touch can perceive whether it be hot or cold.

          <td>545. He says therefore first [347] that there have been some philosophers who believed that there is a void in bodies, basing their argument on the existence of rarity and density. For they believed that rarefaction and condensation took place on account of a void inhering in bodies. If rarity and density did not exist, they say, the parts of bodies could not “go in,” i.e., enter each other, and “harden,” i.e., be compressed by condensation. But if this does not take place, they deduced certain difficulties both in respect to local motion, and in respect to the motions of generation and corruption, or alteration.

          <td>Ex parte quidem motus localis, quia oportebit dicere vel quod omnino motus non sit, vel quod uno moto moveatur totum universum, sicut dixit Xuthus philosophus.

          <td>In respect to local motion, because it would be necessary to admit either that motion does not exist at all, or that the whole universe is moved with one motion, as says Xuthus, a philosopher. This would be because if a body were moved locally, when it approached a place full of another body, this body would have to be expelled, and tend toward another place and the body found there would have to go to yet another place, so that, unless there were condensation of bodies, all bodies would have to be in motion.

          <td>Ex parte vero generationis sive alterationis sequitur hoc inconveniens, quod semper fiat aequalis mutatio ex aere in aquam, et ex aqua in aerem: ut puta, si ex aqua unius cyathi generatus est aer, oportet quod ex tanto aere quantus est aer generatus, alibi generetur aqua. Et hoc ideo, quia maior quantitas est aeris quam aquae ex qua generatur. Occupat igitur aer generatus maiorem locum quam aqua ex qua generatur. Et sic oportet quod vel totum corpus universi occuparet maiorem locum; vel quod alibi tantumdem de aere convertatur in aquam: vel oportet dicere quod sit aliquid vacuum intra corpora, ad hoc quod fiat condensatio corporum; quia non opinabantur quod aliter contingeret condensari et rarefieri corpora, nisi vacuo in eis existente.

The reason is that there is now a greater amount [i.e. volume] of air than there previously was of water from which it was generated. The generated air therefore occupies a greater place than the water from which it was generated. Consequently, either the whole body of the universe would have to occupy a greater place, or else as much air in some other place would have to be converted into water, or else finally, it must be admitted that there is a void within bodies to allow them to be condensed, because these philosophers supposed that bodies could not become condensed and rarefied unless there was a void existing in them.

The second interpretation is that the void is not separate in respect to <i>situs</i> from the other parts of the body; as if we should say that the dimensions, which they said were the void would penetrate all the parts of the body.

          <td>547. He then [380] disproves the aforesaid position as to the second interpretation and gives four reasons for rejecting it. He says, therefore, that if the void is not in bodies in such a way as to be separable and distinct from the other parts but is nevertheless present in bodies, the situation is less impossible, because the difficulties mentioned above against a separate void do not arise; yet against this also certain discrepancies do arise. First of all, the void will not be the cause of every local motion, as the maintained, but only of upward motion—for the void, according to them, is the cause of rarity, and the rare in turn is found to be light, as is evident in fire, and what is light travels upwards; consequently, the void will be the cause only of upward motion.

Et sic vacuum inditum corporibus fert secum corpus in quo est.
          <td>548. He gives the second reason [381] when he says that according to those who posit a void in bodies the void is the cause of motion, not as that in which something is moved (in the way that those who held for a separate empty space posited the void as a cause of motion), but as the cause of motion in such a way that the empty space within the bodies transports them: it is analogous to the case of inflated wine-skins, which, due to the fact that they are carried upward on account of their lightness, also carry upward whatever is attached to them. And in this way the void inherent in bodies carries with it the body in which it is.

          <td>549. The third reason [382] is given when he says that if the cause of upward motion is the void carrying a body upward, then since there is nothing to carry the body down, there would be no explanation of why heavy bodies are carried downwards.

And this is true unless the motion is rotational: for example, let A be in motion to place B, and B to place C, and C to place D, and again D to place A. In this case, on the assumption of rotational motion, it will not be necessary, if one thing moves, that the whole universe be disturbed. But we do not see every local motion of natural bodies to be rotational, but many are in a straight line. Hence, there will be still disturbance of the heavens, unless condensation and the void be admitted.

Et similiter est cum e converso ex aere generatur aqua.

And the same is true in reverse, when from air water is generated. But there is this difference: when air is generated from water, there is a change from small to large; because the quantity of air generated is larger than the quantity of water from which it was generated. But when, from air, water is made, there is produced contrariwise a transmutation from largeness to smallness. Therefore when a large amount of air is reduced to a smaller amount by condensation, or from a small amount to a larger amount by rarefaction, it is the same matter which becomes both in act, namely, large and small, while being previously in potency to them.

And with good reason: for rarity arises from matter receiving greater dimensions, density from matter receiving lesser dimensions. Consequently, if you take diverse bodies of equal quantity, one being rare and the other dense, then the dense has more matter. Now it was said above in the treatise on place that the contained body is related to the container, as is matter to form; consequently, a heavy body which tends toward the middle [i.e., center]contained is with good reason more dense because it has more matter. Just as, therefore, the circumference of a larger circle, when it is restricted to a smaller circle does not receive concavity in a part not previously concave, but rather a part previously concave was reduced to a greater concavity, and just as any part of fire that anyone may take will be hot, so also it is the whole body that becomes rare or dense by the “conduction,” i.e., contraction, or expansion of one and the same matter, accordingly as it is moved to greater or smaller dimensions.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et hoc patet per ea quae sequuntur ex raro et denso, quae sunt qualitates. Nam ad densum sequitur grave et durum. Et de gravi quidem ratio assignata est; de duro autem ratio manifesta est: quia durum dicitur quod magis resistit pulsui vel divisioni; quod autem habet plus de materia, minus est divisibile, quia minus obedit agenti, propter hoc quod est magis remotum ab actu. E converso autem, ad rarum sequitur leve et molle.
          <td>This is clear from what follows from rarity and density, namely, qualities. For the heavy and the hard follow from density. Why heaviness follows density has already been explained. Why hardness follows is easy to explain: that is hard which is better able to resist both pressure and cleavage; but what has more matter is less divisible, because it is less obedient to something acting upon it, on account of its being more remote from actuality. Contrariwise, lightness and softness follow upon rarity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed grave et durum in aliquibus dissonant, sicut in ferro et plumbo: nam plumbum est gravius, sed ferrum est durius. Et huius ratio est, quia plumbum habet plus de terrestri: sed id quod est aquae in eo, est imperfectius congelatum et digestum.
          <td>But the heavy and the hard fail to coincide in some things: for lead is heavier, but iron is harder. The reason for this is that lead has more of the element “earth” in it, but what there is of “water” in it is less perfectly congealed and distributed.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: ex dictis igitur manifestum est etc., concludit principale propositum.

Et sic nullo modo est vacuum, nisi aliquis penitus velit vocare vacuum materiam, quae quodammodo est causa gravitatis et levitatis, et sic est causa motus secundum locum. Densum enim et rarum sunt causa motus secundum contrarietatem gravis et levis; sed secundum contrarietatem duri et mollis, sunt causa passibile et impassibile: nam molle est id quod facile patitur divisionem, durum autem e contra, ut dictum est. Sed hoc non pertinet ad loci mutationem, sed magis ad alterationem.
          <td>557. Then [389] he concludes his chief proposition. And he says it is clear from the foregoing that there is no separate empty space: it is not anything existing absolutely outside a body; or in a rarefied thing after the manner of empty holes; or in potency in a rarefied body, according to those who did not posit a void that exists in bodies as something separated from the fullness of the body. Consequently, in no way is there a void, unless someone simply wants to call matter the void, since it is somehow the cause of heaviness and lightness, and consequently the cause of motion in respect of place. For density and rarity are causes of motion according to the contrariety of heavy and light; but in regard to the contrariety of hard and soft, passible and non-passible are the causes: for the soft is that which easily suffers division and the hard contrariwise, as was said. However, this does not pertain to local motion but rather to [the motion called] “alteration.”

But the prior 'now' cannot have ceased-to-be in itself (since it then existed); yet it cannot have ceased-to-be in another 'now'.

          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod ex his duabus rationibus potest aliquis concipere, quod tempus vel omnino non sit, vel sit aliquid quod vix et obscure percipi possit. Prima ergo ratio talis est. Omne compositum ex his quae non sunt, impossibile est esse, vel habere aliquam substantiam. Sed tempus componitur ex his quae non sunt; quia temporis est aliquid praeteritum, et iam non est, aliud est futurum, et nondum est, et ex his duobus componitur totum tempus, infinitum et perpetuum positum. Ergo impossibile est tempus aliquid esse.
          <td>559. He says then [391] that two reasons could lead us to suppose either that time does not exist at all or that it is something that can scarcely and only in an obscure way be conceived. Here is the first reason: anything that is composed of things which do not exist cannot have any existence or any substance; but time is composed of what does not exist—for part of time is the past which no longer exists, and the rest is the future, which does not yet exist (and these two things comprise the whole of time considered as infinite and everlasting). Therefore, it is impossible for time to be anything.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: adhuc autem omnis etc.: quae talis est. Cuiuslibet divisibilis existentis necesse est esse, dum est, aliquam partem eius, aut aliquas. Sed tempus non est huiusmodi; quia quaedam partes temporis sunt iam praeteritae, aliae vero sunt futurae, et nihil temporis quod sit divisibile est in actu. Ipsum vero nunc, quod est in actu, non est pars temporis: quia pars est quae mensurat totum, ut binarius senarium; vel saltem ex qua componitur totum, sicut quaternarius est pars senarii, non mensurans ipsum, sed quia ex ipso et binario componitur senarius; tempus autem non componitur ex ipsis nunc, ut infra probabitur. Tempus igitur non est aliquid.
          <td>560. The second reason [392] is as follows: As long as any divisible thing is existing there must exist some part of it or a number of parts. But time does not meet these requirements—for some parts of time are already past and others are in the future, so that no divisible part of time is actually existing. And the “now” which is actual is not a part of time: for a part is either a measure of a whole, as two is the measure of six, or at least it is a component of the whole, as four is a part of six (although not its measure) since from it and two, six is composed. Time however does not have “nows” as its parts, as will be proved later (Book VI). Therefore, time is not anything.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: amplius autem ipsum nunc etc., inquirit utrum sit idem nunc in toto tempore. Et circa hoc tria facit: primo movet quaestionem; secundo obiicit ad unam partem, ibi: si quidem enim nunc etc.; tertio ad alteram, ibi: at vero neque nunc et cetera.
          <td>561. Then [393] he inquires whether there be the same “now” through the whole of time. About this he does three things: First, he raises the question; Secondly, he objects to one side of the question, at no. 562; Thirdly, he objects to the opposite side, at no. 563.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod non est facile scire, utrum nunc, quod videtur distinguere inter praeteritum et futurum, semper maneat idem in toto tempore, an sit aliud et aliud.
          <td>He says therefore first that it is not easy to be certain whether the “now” which is seen to distinguish the past from the future always remains identical with itself throughout the whole of time or whether it is other and other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: si quidem enim nunc etc., ostendit quod non sit aliud et aliud nunc, tali ratione. Duae partes temporis quae sunt aliae ab invicem, non possunt simul esse, nisi una contineat aliam, sicut maius tempus continet minus, ut annus mensem, et mensis diem (simul enim est et dies et mensis, et mensis et annus). Sed unum nunc, cum sit indivisibile, non continet alterum: si ergo est accipere in tempore duo nunc, necesse est quod illud nunc quod prius fuit et modo non est, aliquando corrumpatur, et quod nunquam duo nunc sint simul. Omne autem corruptum necesse est in aliquo nunc corrumpi. Non autem potest dici quod prius nunc sit corruptum in ipso nunc priori, quia tunc erat ipsum nunc, et nihil corrumpitur dum est. Similiter etiam non potest dici, quod prius nunc corrumpatur in posteriori: quia impossibile est sic se habere duo nunc ad invicem, quod sint habita, idest immediate se consequentia, sicut etiam impossibile est de duobus punctis. Et hoc nunc supponatur, quia in sexto probabitur. Sic igitur inter quaelibet duo nunc sunt infinita nunc. Si ergo prius nunc corrumpatur in aliquo posteriori nunc, sequitur quod illud nunc quod est ante, simul sit cum omnibus nunc intermediis; quod est impossibile, ut dictum est. Impossibile est igitur esse aliud et aliud nunc.
          <td>562. Then [394] he gives a reason to show that the “now” is not other and other. Two parts of time which are not the same cannot be existing together unless one contains the other, as a greater period of time contains a smaller, e.g., as a year contains the month and the month the day (for the day and the month and the year exist together). But one “now,” since it is indivisible, does not contain another. If, therefore, we are to accept two “now’s” in time, then that “now” which existed before the present one and no longer exists, ceased to be sometime, and so two “now’s” are never together. However, anything that ceased to be, did so in some “now.” But it cannot be that the prior “now” ceased to be in that prior “now,” because the prior “now” was existing then, and nothing ceases to be while it is. Likewise, it cannot be said that the prior “now” ceases to be in a later one: for it is impossible to have two “now’s” together as “had,” i.e., so as to follow immediately one upon the other, just as the same thing is impossible in the case of two points. (This is supposed now, but will be proved in Book VI). Thus, between any two “now’s” there are an infinity of “nows.” If, therefore, that prior “now” ceases to be in some later “now,” it follows that the prior “now” was existing along with all the intermediate “now’s”—which is impossible, as we have said. It is impossible, therefore, that the “now” be other and other.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: at vero neque etc., ostendit quod non possit esse unum et idem nunc, duabus rationibus. Quarum prima talis est. Nullius divisibilis finiti potest esse unus terminus tantum; neque si sit continuum secundum unam dimensionem tantum, ut linea; neque si secundum plures, ut superficies et corpus. Nam unius lineae finitae termini sunt duo puncta, et superficiei plures lineae, et corporis plures superficies. Sed ipsum nunc est terminus temporis. Cum igitur sit accipere aliquod tempus finitum, necesse est ponere plura nunc.
          <td>563. Then [395] he gives two reasons to show that there cannot be just one “now.” The first is that no finite divisible thing can have just one boundary; whether it be a divisible of one dimension, as a line; or of more than one dimension, as a plane or a solid. For the boundaries of one finite line are two points and of a surface the boundaries are several lines, and of a body several planes. But the “now” is a boundary of time. Since therefore it is possible to conceive of a finite time there must be more than one “now.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius si simul esse etc.: quae talis est. Illa dicuntur esse simul secundum tempus, et nec prius nec posterius, quae sunt in eodem nunc: si igitur est idem nunc permanens in toto tempore, sequitur quod illa quae fuerunt ante mille annos, sint simul cum his quae sunt hodie.
          <td>564. He gives a second reason [396].Those things are said to be together in time, and neither previously nor later, which are in the same “now.” If therefore it is the same “now” that persevere throughout time, it follows that things which existed a thousand years ago are together with things that exist today.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ultimo autem epilogando concludit, tot opposita esse de ipsis nunc, quae sunt in tempore.
          <td>Summarizing, he concludes that these are the conflicting opinions about the “now’s” which exist in time.

So, just as, if the 'now' were not different but one and the same, there would not have been time, so too when its difference escapes our notice the interval does not seem to be time. If, then, the non-realization of the existence of time happens to us when we do not distinguish any change, but the soul seems to stay in one indivisible state, and when we perceive and distinguish we say time has elapsed, evidently time is not independent of movement and change. It is evident, then, that time is neither movement nor independent of movement.

And thus if a circular revolution is time, there are many times together—which is impossible. For no two parts of time are together unless one contains the other, as we have said.

And he says that some thought the sphere of the heavens in time, because all things are in time and all things are also in the sphere of the whole, because the heavens contain all things. Hence they wished to conclude that the sphere of the heavens is time. But there were two things wrong in their reasoning: first, because something is not said univocally as being in time and in place; secondly, because they were using two affirmative premises in a Second Figure syllogism. Therefore he says that their position is too foolish to consider the impossibilities that follow upon it. For it is clear that all the parts of the sphere exist simultaneously, whereas the parts of time do not.

Quorum primum dicitur propter motum in substantia et quantitate et qualitate; secundum autem dicitur propter motum in ubi, qui dicitur motus in loco. Sed tempus est ubique et apud omnia: ergo tempus non est motus.
          <td>In regard to the first he gives two reasons to show that time is not a motion or a change (for it certainly seems to be such). Here is his reason: Every change and motion is certainly only in the thing being changed or in the place where the changer and changed are. The first of these is mentioned because of motion in substance and quantity and quality; the second because of motion in the predicament “where,” called motion in place.” But time is everywhere and exists among all things. Therefore time is not a motion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: amplius autem mutatio etc.: quae talis est. Omnis mutatio et motus est velox aut tardus: sed tempus non est huiusmodi: ergo tempus non est motus vel mutatio. Mediam sic probat. Tardum et velox determinantur ex tempore: quia velox dicitur quod movetur per multum spatium in pauco tempore; tardum autem quod e converso per paucum spatium in multo tempore. Sed tempus non determinatur tempore, neque secundum suam quantitatem, neque secundum suam qualitatem; quia idem non est mensura sui ipsius. Ergo tempus non est neque velox neque tardum. Et quia proposuerat quod mutatio est velox aut tarda, non facta mentione de motu, subiungit quod quantum ad praesens, non differt dicere motum aut mutationem: in quinto enim ostendetur eorum differentia.
          <td>569. He gives the second reason [402]: Every change and motion is either slow or fast; but time is not either. Therefore time is neither a motion nor a change. He explains the minor premise thus: Slow and fast are determined by time—because that is fast which is moved a great distance in a short time and that is slow which is moved a short distance in much time. But time is not determined by either according to its quantity or its quality, because nothing is its own measure. Therefore, time is neither slow nor fast. And since he had proposed that change is fast or slow, without mention of motion, he adds that for the present it does not matter whether one says “motion” or “change.” Their difference will be shown in Book V.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: at vero, neque sine motu etc., ostendit quod tempus non est sine motu: quia quando homines non mutantur secundum suam apprehensionem, aut, si mutantur, tamen latet eos, tunc non videtur eis quod pertranseat aliquod tempus. Sicut patet in iis qui in Sardo, quae est civitas Asiae, dicuntur fabulose dormire apud heroas, idest apud deos. Animas enim bonorum et magnorum heroas vocabant, et quasi deos colebant, ut Herculis et Bacchi et similium. Per incantationes enim aliquas, aliqui insensibiles reddebantur, quos dicebant dormire apud heroas; quia excitati, quaedam mirabilia se vidisse dicebant, et futura quaedam praenunciabant. Tales autem ad se redeuntes, non percipiebant tempus quod praeterierat dum ipsi sic absorpti erant; quia illud instans primum, in quo dormire coeperant, copulabant posteriori nunc in quo excitabantur, ac si essent unum; medium enim tempus non percipiebant. Sicut igitur, si non esset aliud et aliud nunc, sed idem et unum, non esset tempus medium; sic et quando latet diversitas duorum nunc, non videtur tempus esse medium. Si ergo tunc accidit non opinari tempus, cum non percipimus aliquam mutationem, sed homini videtur quod sit in uno indivisibili nunc; tunc autem percipimus fieri tempus, quando sentimus et determinamus, id est numeramus, motum aut mutationem; manifeste sequitur quod tempus non sit sine motu, neque sine mutatione.
          <td>570. Then [403] he shows that although time is not motion, it is not independent of motion: for when men are not changing according to what they apprehend, they are changing without being aware of it, then it does not seem to them that time is passing. This is clear in the fable about the city in Asia called Sardo. In Sardo certain people were said to sleep among the Heroes, i.e., among the gods. For they called the souls of the good and the great “Heroes,” and worshipped them as gods, as in the case of Hercules and Bacchus and the like. Certain ones were rendered insensible by means of incantations and said to sleep among the gods, because then they awoke they claimed to have seen marvelous things and foretold future events. These persons, returning to themselves, were not aware of the time which elapsed while they were thus absorbed; because that first instant in which they began to sleep they joined to the instant in which they awoke, as if it were one instant—but the time that elapsed escaped them. Therefore just as there would be no intervening time between “now’s,” if the “now” of time were always the same and not other and other, so also when two “now’s” are fused in our apprehension, the elapsed time is not apprehended, and there seems to have been no intervening time. If, then, we are apt to think that no time has elapsed when we do not perceive any changes, and that we are in one and the same indivisible “now,” but we then perceive time to be elapsing when we sense and determine, i.e., motion and change, it clearly follows that time is not independent of motion and change.

Now we perceive movement and time together: for even when it is dark and we are not being affected through the body, if any movement takes place in the mind we at once suppose that some time also has elapsed; and not only that but also, when some time is thought to have passed, some movement also along with it seems to have taken place.

For what is bounded by the 'now' is thought to be time—we may assume this. When, therefore, we perceive the 'now' one, and neither as before and after in a motion nor as an identity but in relation to a 'before' and an 'after', no time is thought to have elapsed, because there has been no motion either. On the other hand, when we do perceive a 'before' and an 'after', then we say that there is time. For time is just this—number of motion in respect of 'before' and 'after'.

Contingit enim quandoque quod percipimus fluxum temporis, quamvis nullum motum particularem sensibilem sentiamus; utpote si simus in tenebris, et sic visu non sentimus motum alicuius corporis exterioris. Et si nos non patiamur aliquam alterationem in corporibus nostris ab aliquo exteriori agente, nullum motum corporis sensibilis sentiemus: et tamen si fiat aliquis motus in anima nostra, puta secundum successionem cogitationum et imaginationum, subito videtur nobis quod fiat aliquod tempus. Et sic percipiendo quemcumque motum, percipimus tempus: et similiter e converso, cum percipimus tempus, simul percipimus motum.

          <td>572. First [404] therefore he investigates this part: that time is “something of motion.” He says that since we are investigating what time is, we must begin by understanding what aspect of motion time is. That time is something of motion is manifested by the very fact that we sense motion and time together. For it happens that we perceive the flow of time even though we are not sensing any particular sensible motion; for example, if we are in the dark and do not see any external object moving. And if while we are in this situation, we are not undergoing any bodily changes brought about by an external agent, then we are not sensing any motion of a sensible body. Yet if there is a motion within our soul, such as a succession of thoughts and imaginings, suddenly it appears to us that some time is elapsing. Thus by perceiving any sort of motion we perceive time and, vice-versa, when we perceive time we are simultaneously perceiving a motion.

          <td>Habet autem dubitationem quod hic dicitur de perceptione temporis et motus. Si enim tempus consequatur aliquem motum sensibilem extra animam existentem, sequitur quod qui non sentit illum motum, non sentiat tempus; cuius contrarium hic dicitur. Si autem tempus consequatur motum animae, sequetur quod res non comparentur ad tempus nisi mediante anima; et sic tempus erit non res naturae, sed intentio animae, ad modum intentionis generis et speciei. Si autem consequatur universaliter omnem motum, sequetur quod quot sunt motus, tot sint tempora: quod est impossibile, quia duo tempora non sunt simul, ut supra habitum est.
          <td>573. What has been just said about the perceiving of time and of motion raises a difficulty. For if time follows upon some sensible motion outside the mind, it follows that whosoever does not sense that motion, does not sense time; whereas the opposite of that is said here. And if time depends upon some motion of the mind, it follows that things are not connected to time except through the medium of the mind: thus time will not be a thing of nature but a notion in the mind like the intention of genus and species. But if time follows upon any and every motion, then there are as many times as there are motions—which is impossible, for there cannot be two times together as we said above.

Unde quicumque percipit quemcumque motum, percipit tempus: licet tempus non consequatur nisi unum primum motum, a quo omnes alii causantur et mensurantur: et sic remanet tantum unum tempus.
          <td>574. In order to clear up this difficulty it must be remembered that there is one first motion which is the cause of every other motion. Hence whatever is in a transmutable state possesses that state on account of the first motion, which is the motion of the first mobile being. Whosoever, therefore, perceives any motion, whether it exists in sensible things or in the mind, is perceiving transmutable being and consequently is perceiving the first motion, which time follows. Thus anyone who perceives any motion whatsoever is perceiving time, although time follows upon just the one first motion by which all other motions are caused and measured. Consequently, there remains only one time.

For supposing that time is something of motion, namely, that it follows upon motion, there still remains the task of investigating according to what does time follow upon motion; the answer being that it follows upon motion “according to before and after.” As to this then he does three things: First he shows how “before and after” are found in motion; Secondly, how they are related to motion, at no. 578; Thirdly, he shows that time follows motion according to “before and after,” at no. 579.

Quia ergo motus secundum locum, est secundum magnitudinem ex quodam in quiddam et omnis magnitudo est continua; oportet quod motus consequatur magnitudinem in continuitate, ut, quia magnitudo continua est, et motus continuus sit. Et per consequens etiam tempus continuum est: quia quantus est motus primus, tantum videtur fieri tempus.

          <td>576. He says therefore first that everything that is being moved is being moved. from something to something. But of motions the first is local motion, which is from place to place along a magnitude. But it is the first motion that time follows upon, and therefore, to investigate time, one must take local motion. Since, then, motion according to place is motion according to a magnitude from one place to another, and since every magnitude is continuous, motion must follow magnitude in regard to its continuity, so that, just as magnitude is continuous, so also is motion. Consequently time also is continuous: for the quantity of the first motion and the quantity of time correspond. For time is not measured according to the quantity of just any motion, since something is being moved over a small distance In a large amount of time, and a fast object, vice-versa. Time however corresponds only to the quantity of the first motion.

Et hoc ideo, quia magnitudo est quantitas positionem habens: de ratione autem positionis est prius et posterius: unde ex ipsa positione, locus habet prius et posterius. Et quia in magnitudine est prius et posterius, necesse est quod in motu sit prius et posterius proportionaliter his quae sunt ibi, scilicet in magnitudine et in loco. Et per consequens etiam in tempore est prius et posterius; quia motus et tempus ita se habent, quod semper alterum eorum sequitur ad alterum.
          <td>577. Then [406] he shows that the same order prevails in respect to “before and after,” saying that “before and after” are first of all in a place or in a magnitude. This is so, because a magnitude is a quantity having position; position, however, implies “before and after.” Hence from its position place has “before and after.” And because there is “before and after” in magnitude, it follows that there is a “before and after” in motion corresponding to the things which are there, i.e., in magnitude and place. Consequently, there is a prior and subsequent also in time: for motion and time are so related that the one always follows the other.

De ratione enim motus est, quod sit actus existentis in potentia: sed quod in motu sit prius et posterius, hoc contingit motui ex ordine partium magnitudinis. Sic igitur prius et posterius sunt idem subiecto cum motu, sed differunt ratione. Unde restat inquirendum, cum tempus sequatur motum, sicut supra ostensum est, utrum sequatur ipsum inquantum est motus, an inquantum habet prius et posterius.
          <td>578. Then [407] he shows how “before and after” are related to motion. And he says that the “before and after” of these, namely, of time and of motion is, as to what it is, motion; yet in conception, it is distinct from motion and not motion. For it is the notion of motion that it be the act of a being in potency; but that there be in motion a “before and after” occurs in it by reason of the order of the parts of the magnitude. Accordingly, “before and after” are the same as motion as to subject but they differ from it as to notion. Hence the task remains to inquire, since time follows motion, whether it follows upon it inasmuch as it is motion, or inasmuch as it has a “before and after.”

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: at vero et tempus cognoscimus etc., ostendit quod tempus sequatur motum ratione prioris et posterioris.

Relinquitur ergo quod tempus sequitur motum secundum prius et posterius.
          <td>579. Then [408] he shows that motion follows upon time by reason of “before and after.” For it has been shown that the reason why time follows motion is that we recognize both simultaneously. Therefore time follows motion according to that which, when it is perceived in motion, time is perceived. But it is then that we perceive time, when we distinguish a “before” and “after” in motion; and it is then that we say time is passing when we have a sense of the “before” and “after” in motion. Consequently time follows motion according to “before and after.”

Cum enim intelligimus extrema diversa alicuius medii, et anima dicat illa esse duo nunc, hoc prius, illud posterius, quasi numerando prius et posterius in motu, tunc hoc dicimus esse tempus. Tempus enim determinari videtur ipso nunc. Et hoc supponatur ad praesens, quia postea erit magis manifestum. Quando igitur sentimus unum nunc, et non discernimus in motu prius et posterius; vel quando discernimus in motu prius et posterius, sed accipimus idem nunc ut finem prioris et principium posterioris; non videtur fieri tempus, quia neque est motus. Sed cum accipimus prius et posterius et numeramus ea, tunc dicimus fieri tempus. Et hoc ideo, quia tempus nihil aliud est quam numerus motus secundum prius et posterius: tempus enim percipimus, ut dictum est, cum numeramus prius et posterius in motu. Manifestum est ergo quod tempus non est motus, sed sequitur motum secundum quod numeratur. Unde est numerus motus.
          <td>580. Then [409] he shows what aspect of motion time is, and says that it is “the number of motion.” He explains this by using the same means as before, namely, our knowledge of time and motion. For it is clear that when we take in motion something different from something other and understand that there is something between them, then it is that we determine that time exists. For when we perceive the differing boundaries of something and the mind calls them two “now’s,” one being before and the other after, as though the mind were counting the “before’s” and “after’s” in a motion, that is what we call time. For time seems to be determined by the “now.” (This statement is taken for granted at present, but later it will be explained). When therefore we sense one “now” but do not discern a “before” and “after” of motion, or when we in discerning a “before” and “after” take the same “now” as the end of the prior and the beginning of the subsequent, no time seems to exist because no motion seemed to exist. But when we discern a “before” and “after” and count them, then we say that time is produced. This is so because time is nothing less than “the numbering of motion according to before and after”: for we perceive time, as was said, when we count the “before and after” of motion. it is clear there fore that time is not motion, but accompanies motions inasmuch as it is counted. Hence time is the number of motion.

          <td>Si quis autem obiiciat contra praedictam definitionem, quod prius et posterius tempore determinantur, et sic definitio est circularis, dicendum est quod prius et posterius ponuntur in definitione temporis, secundum quod causantur in motu ex magnitudine, et non secundum quod mensurantur ex tempore. Et ideo supra Aristoteles ostendit quod prius et posterius prius sunt in magnitudine quam in motu, et in motu quam in tempore, ut haec obiectio excludatur.
          <td>But if someone objects against this definition and says that “before and after” are determined by time, and consequently, that the definition is circular, he should remember that “before and after” are placed in the definition of time inasmuch as they are caused in motion by magnitude, and not inasmuch as they are measured out of time. That is why Aristotle had previously shown that “before and after” are present in magnitude before they are so in motion, and they are in motion before they are in time, to exclude this objection.

          <td>581. Then [410] he clarifies the aforesaid definition in two ways, and first by a sign. Now that which is a standard of judging something to be more and less is a number of it. But the standard for judging whether a motion is greater or smaller is time. Therefore, time is a number.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: quoniam autem numerus etc., manifestat quod dictum est per distinctionem numeri; et dicit quod numerus dicitur dupliciter. Uno modo id quod numeratur actu, vel quod est numerabile, ut puta cum dicimus decem homines aut decem equos; qui dicitur numerus numeratus, quia est numerus applicatus rebus numeratis. Alio modo dicitur numerus quo numeramus, idest ipse numerus absolute acceptus, ut duo, tria, quatuor. Tempus autem non est numerus quo numeramus, quia sic sequeretur quod numerus cuiuslibet rei esset tempus: sed est numerus numeratus, quia ipse numerus prioris et posterioris in motu tempus dicitur; vel etiam ipsa quae sunt prius et posterius numerata.
          <td>Secondly, [411] he makes clearer what has been stated by distinguishing number, saying there are two. First there is that which is actually numbered which can be, as when we say ten men or 100 horses, and this is called “number numbered,” because it is a number applied to the things that are numbered. Then there is the number by which we count, i.e., number considered absolutely, such as two, three, four [the counting numbers]. Now time is not a counting number; otherwise the number of anything would be time; rather it is a number numbered, because it is the number of before and after in motion that we call “time,” or else the things that are counted before and after.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et ideo, licet numerus sit quantitas discreta, tempus tamen est quantitas continua, propter rem numeratam; sicut decem mensurae panni quoddam continuum est, quamvis denarius numerus sit quantitas discreta.
          <td>Therefore, although number is discrete quantity, time is nevertheless a continuous quantity on account of the thing counted, just as ten measures of cloth is a continuous quantity, even though ten is a discrete quantity.

This is an identical substratum (whether a point or a stone or something else of the kind), but it has different attributes as the sophists assume that Coriscus' being in the Lyceum is a different thing from Coriscus' being in the market-place. And the body which is carried along is different, in so far as it is at one time here and at another there. But the 'now' corresponds to the body that is carried along, as time corresponds to the motion. For it is by means of the body that is carried along that we become aware of the 'before and after' the motion, and if we regard these as countable we get the 'now'. Hence in these also the 'now' as substratum remains the same (for it is what is before and after in movement), but what is predicated of it is different; for it is in so far as the 'before and after' is numerable that we get the 'now'.

But that which always exists throughout the whole of time is the same, namely, the “now,” which as to its nature is always the same. While in conception it varies accordingly as it is prior and subsequent. Thus the “now” measures time, not inasmuch as it is always the same thing, but inasmuch as in conception it is other and other, and “before” and “after”.

          <td>584. Then [413] he explains what he had just said and declares that the “now” is somehow always the same and somehow not. For insofar as it is always being considered as being in something other and other in the succession of time and of motion, in that sense it is other and not always the same. And this is what we stated above, namely, that “it is other in motion.” for this is the <i>esse</i> of the “now,” i.e., it is according to this that its notion is taken, namely, as considered in the succession of time and motion. But insofar as the “now” is a certain being, from that viewpoint it is always the same thing.

Si autem punctum suo motu faciat lineam, ipsum punctum quod fertur, est quo cognoscimus motum, et prius et posterius in ipso. Non enim motus percipitur nisi ex hoc, quod mobile aliter et aliter se habet: et secundum id quod pertinet ad praecedentem dispositionem mobilis, iudicamus prius in motu: secundum autem id quod pertinet ad sequentem dispositionem mobilis, iudicamus posterius in motu. Hoc ergo quod movetur, quo motum cognoscimus, et discernimus prius et posterius in ipso, sive sit punctum, sive sit lapis, sive quodcumque aliud, ex ea parte qua est quoddam ens, quodcumque sit, est idem, scilicet subiecto, sed ratione est alterum. Et hoc modo sophistae utuntur altero, cum dicunt Coriscum alterum esse in theatro et in foro, sic arguentes secundum sophisma accidentis: esse in foro est aliud ab eo quod est esse in theatro; sed Coriscus est nunc in foro, nunc in theatro; ergo est alius a se. Sic igitur patet quod id quod movetur est alterum secundum rationem, in eo quod est alibi et alibi, licet sit idem subiecto.
          <td>He says therefore, first that, as was said above, in respect of continuity and in respect of “before” and “after”, motion follows upon magnitude and time upon motion. Let us imagine, therefore, after the manner of geometers, that a point in motion is making a line: then, just as there is something that remains identical in this motion, so there must be something that remains identical throughout time. If the moving point should make a line, it is by the moving point that we discern the motion and the “before” and “after” in it. For motion is perceived only because the mobile thing is in other and other states: according to what pertains to the previous position of the mobile, we judge something as “before” in motion, and according to what pertains to a subsequent position, we judge something as “after” in motion. Therefore this thing which is being moved, by which we recognize that there is motion and by which we discern a “before” and “after” in it, whether it be a point or a stone or anything else, insofar as it is a certain being, whatever it may be, is the same, namely as to subject—but in conception it is other. And this is the way the Sophists use the term “other” when they say that Coriscus in the forum is other than Coriscus in the theater, arguing thus: according to the fallacy of accident: to be in the forum is other than to be in the theater; but Coriscus is now in the forum and now in the theater; therefore he is other than himself. In like manner, it is plain that that which is being moved is other according to conception insofar as it is now here, now there—while remaining the same as to subject.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed sicut tempus sequitur ad motum, ita ipsum nunc sequitur ad id quod fertur. Et hoc probat, quia per mobile cognoscimus prius et posterius in motu. Cum enim invenimus mobile in aliqua parte magnitudinis per quam movetur, iudicamus quod motus qui fuit per unam partem magnitudinis, prius praeteriit, et per aliam partem magnitudinis post sequetur. Et similiter in numeratione motus, quae fit per tempus, id quod distinguit prius et posterius temporis, est ipsum nunc, quod est terminus praeteriti et principium futuri. Sic igitur se habet nunc ad tempus, sicut mobile ad motum: ergo secundum commutatam proportionem, sicut tempus ad motum, ita et nunc ad mobile. Unde si mobile in toto motu est idem subiecto, sed differt ratione, oportebit ita esse et in nunc, quod sit idem subiecto et aliud et aliud ratione: quia illud quo discernitur in motu prius et posterius, est idem subiecto, sed alterum ratione, scilicet mobile; et id secundum quod numeratur prius et posterius in tempore est ipsum nunc.
          <td>Now just as time follows upon motion, so the “now” follows that which is being moved. This is so because it is through the mobile that we know the “before” and “after” in motion. For when we see the mobile in some certain part of a magnitude through which it is being moved, we judge that the motion which passed through one part of the magnitude has ceased to be before and that motion through another part will follow after. In like manner, in the counting of motion (which counting is done by time), that which distinguishes the “before.” and “after” of time is the “now,” which is the end of the past and the beginning of the future. Thus the “now” is related to time as the mobile in to motion. Therefore also, by commuting the proportion, we get that time is to motion as the “now” is to the mobile. Hence, if the mobile remains the same as to subject throughout the entire motion—though differing in conception—the same will be true of the “now”: it too will remain the same as to subject but will be other and other in conception. For that by which “before” and “after” are discerned in a motion is the same as to subject but differing in conception, the mobile; and that according to which “before” and “after” are counted in time is the “now.”

Sublata igitur alia et alia dispositione a mobili, remanet substantia semper eodem modo se habens. Unde intelligitur nunc ut semper stans, et non ut fluens, nec habens prius et posterius. Sicut igitur nunc temporis intelligitur ut numerus mobilis, ita nunc aeternitatis intelligitur ut numerus, vel potius ut unitas rei semper eodem modo se habentis.
          <td>586. This train of thought makes easy an understanding of eternity. For the. “now,” insofar as it corresponds to a mobile that is continually other and other, distinguishes the “before” and “after” in time and by its flow makes time, just as a point makes a line. But if that varying status of the mobile be removed, the substance remains always in the same state; whence the “now” is then understood as always standing still and not as flowing nor as having a “before” and “after.” Therefore, just as the “now” of time is understood as the number of the mobile, so the “now” of eternity is understood as the number, or rather the unity of a thing always remaining in the same state.

Et hoc etiam ostendit ex habitudine motus ad mobile: quia motus cognoscitur per id quod movetur, et loci mutatio per id quod localiter fertur, quasi minus notum per magis notum. Quod ideo est, quia id quod movetur est hoc aliquid, idest res quaedam per se stans; quod non convenit motui. Unde mobile est notius motu, et per mobile cognoscitur motus: et similiter tempus per ipsum nunc.

          <td>587. Then [415] he shows whence the “now” derives its function of measuring time. And he says it is because that which is best known in time is the “now”, and what is best known in any genus is the measure of everything in that genus, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i> X. He also shows this from the relation of motion to the mobile: for motion is perceived through something being moved and local motion is perceived through observing something being moved locally; after the manner of the better known manifesting the less known. This is so because that which is being moved is “this something,” i.e., a certain thing stable in itself—a characteristic which does not belong to motion. Hence the mobile is more known by us than the motion, and motion is known through the mobile object. In like manner., time is made known through the “now.” Thus, he reaches the conclusion principally intended: that what is called the “now” is always the same in one way, and in another way not, because it is similar to the mobile, as was said.

Relinquitur igitur quod tempus et nunc non sunt sine invicem. Attendendum est autem quod tempus semper comparatur loci mutationi, qui est primus motuum: tempus enim est numerus primi motus, ut dictum est.
          <td>589. He says therefore first that it is plain that if there is no time, there will be no “now,” and if no “now,” no time. This is explained by the relation of motion to the mobile. For just as the change of place and that which is being changed are together, so the count of that which is being changed accompanies the count of the change of place. But time is the number of a local motion, while the “now” is related to what is being moved, not as its number (since the “now” is indivisible), but as the unit of number. It follows therefore that time and the “now” are not one without the other. Notice that time is always compared to a local motion, which is the first of all motions: for time is the number of the first motion, as was said.

Et hoc etiam consequens est ad id quod invenitur in loci mutatione, cuius numerus est tempus, et in eo quod fertur secundum locum, cui respondet ipsum nunc. Manifestum est enim quod omnis motus habet unitatem ab eo quod movetur: quia scilicet illud quod movetur est unum et idem manens in toto motu; et non est indifferenter id quod movetur, uno motu manente, quodcumque ens, sed illud idem ens quod prius incepit moveri: quia si esset aliud ens quod postea moveretur, deficeret primus motus, et esset alius motus alterius mobilis. Et sic patet quod mobile dat unitatem motui, quae est eius continuitas.
          <td>He says therefore first that what we have already said makes clear that time is made continuous with the “now,” i.e., by the “now,” and is divided by the “now.” This fact also follows from what is found in local motion (the number of which is time) and in the object that is being moved according to place which corresponds to the ‘how”). For it is clear that every motion derives its unity from the object being moved, since that which is being moved remains one and the same throughout the whole course of the motion. And it is not a matter of indifference whether that which is moved, in the course of one motion, be any being at all, but rather it must be that same being which first began to be moved, for if it were another being that was later moved, the former motion would have failed and there would now be another motion of another mobile. So it is clear that it to the mobile that gives unity to the motion, which unity constitutes its continuity.

          <td>Sed verum est quod mobile est aliud et aliud secundum rationem.

Sic igitur mobile et continuat motum et distinguit ipsum. Et eodem modo se habet nunc ad tempus.
          <td>But it to true that the mobile is other and other according to conception. And it to in this way that it distinguishes the prior and the subsequent part of motion: because insofar as the mobile is considered under one aspect or disposition it is recognized that whatever disposition was in the mobile previous to its present state pertained to the prior part of the motion; whatever disposition will come after this state will pertain to the subsequent part of the motion. Thus it is that the mobile both continues the motion and distinguishes its parts. And the same holds for the “now” in relation to time.

          <td>591. Then [418] he explains a case of the same in the matter of line and point. And he says that the conclusion drawn about time and the “now” in the preceding section follows in a way from what is found in a line and a point; for the point continues the line and distinguishes its parts, inasmuch as it is the beginning of one part and the end of another.

          <td>But there is a difference in the case of line and point, and in the case of time and the “now”. For both the point and the line are something stationary; whence a person can consider the same point twice and use it as two [give it two interpretations] namely, as both a beginning and an end. When we thus use the point as two, rest occurs, as is evident in a reflex motion, in which that which was the and of the first motion is the beginning of the second and reflected motion. It is on this basis that we shall prove in Book VIII that a reflex motion is not continuous but that an intermediate pause occurs.

          <td>But the “now” is not stationary, because it corresponds to the mobile which is always being carried along during the motion—which also accounts for the “now” having to be always other and other in conception as was said above. Therefore since time is the number of motion, it does not number motion in the sense that some same time is taken as the beginning of one and the end of another, but rather it numbers motion by taking two boundaries of time, namely, two “nows,” which are nevertheless not parts of time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quare competat iste modus numerandi in tempore magis quam alius, quo per punctum numerantur partes lineae, inquantum est principium et finis, ratio est quae dicta est, quia secundum hunc modum utitur aliquis puncto ut duobus; et sic accidit quies media, quae non potest esse in tempore et in motu. Non tamen intelligendum est per id quod dicitur, quod idem nunc non sit principium futuri et finis praeteriti, sed quod non percipimus tempus numerando motum per unum nunc, sed magis per duo, ut dictum est: quia sequeretur quod in numeratione motus idem nunc sumeretur bis.
          <td>The reason why this method of counting is used in numbering time, rather than the method used when a point numbers the parts of a line (where the same point is considered both a beginning and an end), is that, as was stated, in the latter method we use the point as two things and this brings about an intermediate pause, which cannot exist in time or in motion. Now this does not mean that the same “‘now” is not the beginning of the future and the end of the past, but that we do not perceive time by counting motion in terms of one “now” but in terms of two, as was said; otherwise, in our counting of motion the same “now” would be employed twice.

And he says it is plain that the “now” is not a part of time, just as what distinguishes a motion is not a part of the motion, namely, some disposition in the mobile itself, just as points are not parts of a line.

Sic igitur nunc est terminus solius temporis, sed est numerus omnium mobilium quae moventur in tempore.
          <td>He concludes, therefore, finally that the “now,” insofar as it is a certain boundary, is not time but it happens to time, as a boundary does to that which is bounded; but insofar as time or the “now” numbers other things, the “now” is the number of things other than time. The reason is because a boundary can only be of that of which it is the boundary; but a number can be applied to various thing, as the number of ten horses is also that of other things. Thus therefore the “now” is the boundary only of time, but it is the number of all mobiles that are being moved in time.

About which he does four things: First, he shows in what sense there to found in time a smallest part, and in what sense there is not; Secondly, why time is said to be “much” and “little,” “short” and “long”, but not “fast” and “slow,” at no. 595; Thirdly, in what sense time is the saw, and in what sense it is not [ever the same again] at no. 596; Fourthly, how time to known through motion and vice-versa, at no. 597.

Non enim est tempus numerus simpliciter, sed numerus numeratus.
          <td>594. He says therefore first [420] that the previously given definition of time makes clear that time is “the number of motion according to before and after,” as was expounded above, and that time is a type of continuum, as is likewise manifest from what has gone before. For although it does not have continuity insofar as it is a number, yet it has continuity by reason of that of which it is the number: for it is the number of a continuum, namely, of motion, as was said above. For time to not a number absolutely but a number of something numbered.

Sicut in multis lineis secundum multitudinem quidem est minimum, ut una linea vel duae lineae; una quidem si accipiatur id quod est minimum simpliciter in numero; duae autem si accipiatur id quod est minimum in genere numeri, habens rationem numeri. Sed in lineis non est invenire minimum secundum magnitudinem, ut sit scilicet aliqua linea minima; quia semper est dividere quamcumque lineam.
          <td>Among absolute numbers there is unequivocally a least to be found, namely, two. But if we consider owe certain number, namely, the number of something that is continuous, then there is in one sense a minimum and in one sense no minimum, because in the order of multitude [plurality] there is a least, but not in the order of magnitude. For example, in a plurality of lines there is a minimum according to plurality, i.e., one line or two lines (one if you consider what is the minimum in number absolutely; two if you mean that which is least in the genus of number, having the notion of number). But in respect of magnitude there is no minimum in lines, so that there would be namely, some smallest lines—because it is always possible to divide any line whatsoever.

          <td>Et similiter dicendum est de tempore: quia est invenire in eo minimum secundum multitudinem, scilicet unum vel duo, ut puta aut unum annum aut duos annos, aut duos dies aut horas.

          <td>A parallel situation is found in time, for there is a minimum according to multitude, namely, one or two, for example, one year or two years or two days or two hours. But in the order of magnitude there is no minimum, because of any given time there are parts into which it may be divided.

Inquantum ergo est continuum, dicitur tempus et longum et breve, sicut et linea; inquantum autem numerus est, dicitur et multum et paucum. Esse autem velox et tardum, nullo modo competit numero: neque numero simpliciter, ut manifestum est; neque etiam potest convenire numero alicuius rei. Nam esse velox vel tardum, dicitur de aliquo secundum quod est numeratum: dicitur enim velox motus, eo quod parvo tempore numeratur; tardum autem e converso. Unde manifestum est quod tempus nullo modo potest dici velox vel tardum.
          <td>595. Then [421] he gives a reason why time is not said to be slow or fast, but great and small, short and long. For it has already been shown that time is both a number and a continuum. Insofar, therefore, as it is the latter, time, is said to be “long” and “short”, insofar as it is a number, it is said to be “great” and “small.” But to be “fast” and “slow” in no wise belongs to number, neither to number absolutely, as is plain, not to the number of some things. For to be “fast” or “slow” is said of something accordingly as it is numbered: for a motion is called “fast” insofar as it is counted off in a short time—and “slow” conversely. Hence it is clear that in no sense can time be called “fast” or “slow.”

Dicit ergo primo quod tempus simul existens, est idem ubique, idest respectu omnium quae moventur ubicumque. Non enim diversificatur secundum diversa mobilia; sed diversificatur secundum diversas partes eiusdem motus. Et ideo tempus prius et tempus posterius non est idem. Et hoc ideo, quia prima mutatio praesens, cuius primo et principaliter numerus tempus est, una est; sed huius mutationis altera pars est, quae iam facta est et pertransiit, et altera, quae futura est. Unde et tempus alterum est quod prius fuit, et alterum quod futurum est. Et hoc ideo, quia tempus non est numerus simpliciter, sed numerus alicuius rei numeratae, scilicet prioris et posterioris in motu; et huic numero semper accidit esse alterum, et prius et posterius, propter hoc quod ipsa nunc, secundum quod se habent prius et posterius, semper sunt altera. Si autem esset numerus simpliciter, tunc esset idem tempus et mutationis quae praeteriit, et eius quae futura est; quia numerus simpliciter est unus et idem diversorum numeratorum, ut centum equorum et centum hominum. Sed numerus numeratus est alius diversorum: centum enim equi sunt aliud quid a centum hominibus. Et quia tempus est numerus prioris et posterioris in motu; quia alia sunt quae in motu se habent prius et posterius secundum id quod praeteriit de motu, et alia secundum id quod sequitur; propter hoc est aliud tempus praeteritum, et aliud futurum.
          <td>He says therefore first that the time existing at a given moment is the same everywhere, i.e., it is the same in respect to everything that is being moved anywhere. For it is not diversified by reason of the diverse mobiles, but by reason of the diverse parts of the same motion. For which reason a prior time and a later time are not the same. Why? Because the first and present motion, of which time is primarily and principally the number, is one; but one part of this motion has already taken place and is past, and another will be in the future. Hence there is one time which is past, and another time which is future. This is so because time is not number absolutely but the number of something numbered; namely, of the “before” and “after” in motion. And this number always varies and is “before” and “after,” because the “now’s,” as before and after, are always other. But if time were number absolutely, then the time corresponding to the change which is past and the time corresponding to the change which is to come would be the same, for number absolutely is one and the same of different things counted as, for example, in the case of 100 horses and 100 men. But number numbered varies with different things. For 100 horses are not the same as 100 men. Since time is the number of “before’s and “after” in motion; and since the “before” and “after” of a past motion are not the same as those of that which follow, therefore the past time and the future time are other and other.

          <td>597. Then [423] he shows how the same time returns in a certain respect. And he says that in the same way that one and the same motion may be repeated, so may one and the same time. For one and the same motion can be duplicated specifically, but not numerically; for it is from the same sign of the Ram that the sun first moves [at the vernal equinox] and later will move the following year; therefore, just as there has been winter or spring or summer or fall, so also there will be, not, indeed, the same one in number, but in species.

          <td>598. Then [424] he shows that just as we know motion from time, so also time from motion. First, by reason of number and the thing numbered; Secondly, from the likeness existing between magnitude and motion, at no. 599.

Percipimus enim interdum quantitatem temporis ex motu, utpote cum dicimus tempus esse multum vel paucum, secundum mensuram motus nobis certam: quia et ipsum numerum aliquando per numerabilia cognoscimus, et e converso. Cognoscimus enim numero equorum multitudinem, et iterum uno equo cognoscimus numerum equorum. Non enim sciremus quot sunt milliaria, nisi sciremus quid est milliare.

Quia cum est nobis certa quantitas temporis, quantitas autem motus ignota, tunc tempore mensuramus motum; e converso autem, quando motus est notus et tempus ignotum.
          <td>He says therefore first that we not only measure time by motion but motion by time, because each is defined in terms of the other. For one must take the quantity of the one according to the quantity of the other. Now that time should determine motion comes about because it is the number of motion; but conversely, as to us, motion determines time. For we sometimes perceive a quantity of time by means of motion, as when we declare a time to be long or short according to a measure of motion, certain to us; because sometimes we know a number through the things that can be counted, and conversely. For we know by this number a multitude of horses and likewise by one horse we know the number of horses. For we would not know how many thousands there were unless we know what a thousand was. The same holds for time and motion. For when a quantity of time is certain to us, but the quantity of motion unknown, then by the time we measure the motion; but we do the opposite when the motion is known and the time unknown.

Mensuramus autem et magnitudinem per motum, et motum per magnitudinem. Dicimus enim multam esse viam, quando percipimus motum nostrum fuisse multum: et e converso, quando consideramus magnitudinem viae, dicimus motum nostrum fuisse multum. Et ita etiam est de tempore et motu, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>599. Then [425] he shows the same thing by comparing motion and magnitude. And he says that what has been just said of time and motion happens reasonably because just as motion imitates magnitude in quantity and continuity and divisibility, so also does time imitate motion; for the latter [quantity, continuity and divisibility] are found in motion on account of their presence in magnitude, and they are found in time on account of their presence in motion. For we measure magnitude by means of motion, and motion by means of magnitude. For we say that a road is long when we notice that our motion over it was long; and conversely, when we consider the magnitude of the road, we say that our motion was long. The same holds when relating time and motion, “ we said above.

'To be in time' is one of two things: (1) to exist when time exists, (2) as we say of some things that they are 'in number'. The latter means either what is a part or mode of number—in general, something which belongs to number—or that things have a number. Now, since time is number, the 'now' and the 'before' and the like are in time, just as 'unit' and 'odd' and 'even' are in number, i.e. in the sense that the one set belongs to number, the other to time. But things are in time as they are in number. If this is so, they are contained by time as things in place are contained by place. Plainly, too, to be in time does not mean to co-exist with time, any more than to be in motion or in place means to co-exist with motion or place. For if 'to be in something' is to mean this, then all things will be in anything, and the heaven will be in a grain; for when the grain is, then also is the heaven. But this is a merely incidental conjunction, whereas the other is necessarily involved: that which is in time necessarily involves that there is time when it is, and that which is in motion that there is motion when it is.

            <td>Plainly, then, neither will everything that does not exist be in time, i.e. those non-existent things that cannot exist, as the diagonal cannot be commensurate with the side. Generally, if time is directly the measure of motion and indirectly of other things, it is clear that a thing whose existence is measured by it will have its existence in rest or motion. Those things therefore which are subject to perishing and becoming—generally, those which at one time exist, at another do not—are necessarily in time: for there is a greater time which will extend both beyond their existence and beyond the time which measures their existence. Of things which do not exist but are contained by time some were, e.g. Homer once was, some will be, e.g. a future event; this depends on the direction in which time contains them; if on both, they have both modes of existence. As to such things as it does not contain in any way, they neither were nor are nor will be. These are those nonexistents whose opposites always are, as the incommensurability of the diagonal always is—and this will not be in time. Nor will the commensurability, therefore; hence this eternally is not, because it is contrary to what eternally is. A thing whose contrary is not eternal can be and not be, and it is of such things that there is coming to be and passing away.

          <td>601. In regard to the first, note that motion is related to time in a way different from the way other things are related to it. For motion is measured by time both as to what it is and as to its duration i.e., its existence. But other things, such as a man or a stone, are measured by time as to their existence or their duration insofar as they have a changeable existence; but as to what they are in themselves, they are not measured by time; rather it is the “now” of time that here corresponds, as was said above (L. 18).

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Mensurat autem tempus motum per hoc, quod tempore determinatur aliqua pars motus, quae mensurat totum. Et hoc necessarium est; quia unumquodque mensuratur per aliquid sui generis, ut dicitur in X metaphysicae. Et hoc apparet in mensuris magnitudinum. Cubitus enim mensurat totam longitudinem alicuius panni vel alicuius viae, per hoc quod determinat aliquam partem illius longitudinis, quae metitur totum. Et similiter per partem motus tempus mensurat totum motum: per motum enim unius horae mensuratur motus totius diei, et per motum diurnum mensuratur motus annuus. Quia igitur motus mensuratur tempore, nihil est aliud motum esse in tempore, quam mensurari a tempore, et secundum id quod est, et secundum suam durationem: quia secundum utrumque mensuratur a tempore, ut dictum est.
          <td>Now time measures motion by a certain part of the motion’s being determined by time, which part then measures the whole motion. And this is necessary, because each thing is measured by something of the same genus, as is said in <i>Metaphysics</i> X. This is evident in the measures of lengths. For a cubit can measure the entire length of a piece of cloth or of a road, because the cubit determines some part of the length—which part then measures the whole. Likewise by means of a part of motion, time measures an entire motion: for by means of the motion of one hour, the motion of a whole day is measured, and by means of the daily motion the yearly motion is measured. Therefore, since motion is measured by times, for motion to be in time is, nothing more than for it to be measured by time, both as to what it is and as to its duration—because according to both aspects it is measured by time, as was said.

And this latter also has two meanings: for in a number something is present (1) as a part, as 2 is in 4; and as a property, such as even and odd, or whatever else that belongs to number; or (2) it can be there, not because it is anything pertaining to number, but because number belongs to it as numbered, as men may be said to be in such and such a number.

(Dicitur autem numerus perfectus, qui constat ex partibus mensurantibus ipsum; sicut numerus senarius, quem mensurant unitas, binarius et ternarius, quae simul iuncta constituunt senarium. Numerus autem superfluus dicitur, cuius partes mensurantes ipsum excedunt totum; sicut duodenarius, qui mensuratur unitate, binario, ternario, quaternario et senario, quae simul iuncta consurgunt in sexdecim). Et per hunc modum sunt aliqua in tempore, inquantum sunt aliquid temporis. Sed res quae non sunt aliquid temporis, dicuntur esse in tempore sicut numerata in numero. Unde oportet quod ea quae sunt in tempore, contineantur sub tempore sicut sub numero; sicut ea quae sunt in loco continentur sub loco sicut sub mensura.
          <td>But because time is a number something can be present in time in both ways. For the “now,” and “before” and “after,” and things of this sort, exist in time as unity exists in number, of which it is a part, and as do even and odd, which are properties of number, and as do “superfluous” and “perfect.” ( A number is called “perfect,” if the sum of the parts measuring it equals the number; for example, six is measured by one, two, and three, which, added together, equal six. A number is called “superfluous” if its divisors total up to a number which exceeds it: for example, 12 is measured by one, two, three, four, and six, which, when added together equal 16.) And that is the way in which some things exist in time, namely, as being something of time. But things that are not something of time are said to be in time as things numbered exist in number. Consequently these latter things that are in time must be contained under time as under a number, just as things in place are contained under place as under a measure.

The first of these [428] is that, when something is in time as the numbered is in a number, then necessarily there is some time that can be taken larger than everything that exists in that time, just as it is possible to take a number larger than everything that is numbered. Consequently, all things that exist in time are of necessity contained under time and comprehended under it just as things in place are comprehended under place.

          <td>Secundum ponit ibi: et pati iam aliquid sub tempore etc.; et est quod omne quod est in tempore, aliquid patitur sub tempore, secundum quod passio pertinet ad defectum.

          <td>604. The second thing is then mentioned [429] and it is that whatever exists in time suffers something under time in the sense of “suffering” (passio) which pertains to defect. And he proves this from the way people ordinarily speak. For we are wont to say that length of time “wastes things away,” i.e., decays and corrupts them, and again that on account of time all things that exist in time grow old, and that on account of time forgetting occurs - for things we have recently learned remain in the memory but with length of time they slip away.

          <td>Complementing his statement that forgetting occurs on account of time, he add-s that no one learns on account of time; for if a person should neglect study for a long time, he does not on that account learn, while he does on account of time forget.

          <td>Contra illud vero quod dixerat, quod tempus tabefacit, subdit, quod tempus non facit bonum, idest integrum et perfectum, sed magis tabidum et corruptum. Et huius causa est, quia ex tempore aliqua corrumpuntur, etiam si non appareat aliquid aliud manifeste corrumpens: quod ex ipsa ratione temporis apparet. Est enim tempus numerus motus: de ratione autem motus est quod faciat distare id quod est, a dispositione in qua prius erat. Unde cum tempus sit numerus primi motus, ex quo in omnibus causatur mutabilitas, sequitur quod propter diuturnitatem temporis, omnia quae sunt in tempore removeantur a sua dispositione.
          <td>To match his statement that time wastes things away, he adds that time does not make a thing good, i.e., whole, and perfect, but rather wasted and decayed. The reason for this is that time corrupts things even when there is no other manifest corrupting agents. All this is due to the very nature of time: for time is the number of motion—and it is of the nature of motion to put a distance between what now is and the condition it was in previously. Consequently, since time is the number of the first motion, which causes mutability in all things, it follows that length of time causes all things that exist to time to be removed from their former condition.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: quare manifestum est etc., concludit propositum ex praemissis: et primo ex primo prius proposito.

Sed hoc verum est secundum quod sunt semper. Corpora enim caelestia sunt semper secundum esse substantiae eorum, non autem secundum ubi; et ideo duratio eorum non mensuratur tempore, sed motus localis ipsorum tempore mensuratur.
          <td>605. Then [430] he concludes to his proposition from the foregoing premises, and first of all, from the first. For it has been shown that whatever exists in time is contained under time while whatever things are always, are not contained under time as exceeding time. Neither is the being, i.e., the duration, of such things measured under time, since they endure to infinity, and the infinite cannot be measured. Therefore those things that exist forever, are not in time. But this is true insofar as they exist always. For the heavenly bodies exist forever according to the being of their substance, but not in regard to “where” they are; consequently, their duration is not measured by time, yet their local motion is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: signum autem huius etc., probat idem ex secundo prius positorum.

Non enim tabescunt, neque senescunt, sicut dictum est de illis quae sunt in tempore.
          <td>Secondly [431] he proves the same point from the second of the points laid down before. And he says that a sign that those things which exist forever do not exist in time is that they do not suffer from time, as though not existing in time. For they neither waste away nor grow old, as was said of things that exist in time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: quoniam autem tempus etc., quia ostenderat quod ea quae sunt semper non sunt in tempore, ea autem quae quiescunt, eodem modo se habent; posset aliquis credere quod quiescentia, inquantum huiusmodi, non mensurarentur tempore. Et ideo ad hoc excludendum, ostendit quod tempus est etiam quietis mensura. Et circa hoc quinque facit.
          <td>606. Then [432], because he had shown that those things which exist forever do not exist in time, while those things which are at rest also remain the same way someone might think that things at rest are, as such, not measured by time. Therefore to obviate this, he shows that time is also the measure of rest. And in regard to this he does five things:
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Primo enim proponit quod intendit: et dicit quod quia tempus est mensura motus per se, erit etiam et per accidens mensura quietis; quia omnis quies est in tempore, sicut et omnis motus.
          <td>First he proposes what he intends, and says that because time is the measure of motion <i>per se</i> , it will also be <i>per accidens</i> the measure of rest; for all rest is in time just as all motion is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: non enim sicut etc., excludit quoddam, per quod videri posset quod quies non mensuretur tempore. Quia enim tempus est mensura motus, posset aliquis credere quod quiescens, quia non est in motu, non sit in tempore. Et ideo ad hoc excludendum dicit, quod non est necesse moveri omne quod est in tempore, sicut necesse est moveri omne quod est in motu: quia tempus non est motus, sed numerus motus. Contingit autem esse in numero motus non solum quod movetur, sed etiam quod quiescit.
          <td>607. Secondly [433] he excludes something that might lead one to think that rest is not measured by time. For since time is the measure of motion, someone might suppose that a thing at rest, because it is not in motion, is not in time. Consequently, to exclude this, he says that not everything in time need be in motion, in the same way that everything in motion has necessarily to be moved. For time is not a motion but the number of motion. Now it occurs that not only what is being moved, but also what is at rest, may be in the number of motion.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio ibi: non enim omne immobile etc., probat propositum, scilicet quod quiescens sit in numero motus, ita quod tempore mensuretur. Et ad hoc probandum inducit, quod non omne immobile, idest non omne quod non movetur, quiescit; sed quiescens est privatum motu, quod tamen aptum natum est moveri; sicut supra dictum est in tertio, quod movetur illud cuius immobilitas quies est; quies enim non est negatio motus, sed privatio ipsius. Et sic patet quod esse quiescentis est esse rei mobilis. Unde cum esse rei mobilis sit in tempore et mensuretur tempore, esse etiam rei quiescentis tempore mensuratur. Hic autem dicimus esse in tempore aliquid sicut in numero, quia est aliquis numerus ipsius rei, et quia esse ipsius mensuratur numero temporis. Unde manifestum est quod quiescens est in tempore, et mensuratur tempore, non inquantum est quiescens, sed inquantum est mobile. Et propter hoc praemisit quod tempus est mensura motus per se, quietis autem per accidens.
          <td>608. Thirdly [434] he proves the proposition that a thing at rest is in the number of motion, as to be measured by time. To do this, he adduces that not every immobile thing, i.e., not every thing that is not in motion, is at rest; rather, a thing at rest is something deprived of motion, but which is nevertheless by nature disposed to be moved, as it was said above in Book III that that is moved whose immobility is rest—for rest is not the negation of motion, but its privation. Consequently, it is evident that the being [existence] of a thing at rest is the being of a mobile being. Hence, since the being [existence] of a mobile being is in time and is measured by time, the being of a thing at rest is measured by time. Now here we are saying that a thing is in time as in a number, because there is some number for that thing, and because its existence is measured by the number of time. Thus it is clear that a thing at rest exists in time and is measured by time, no insofar as it is rest but insofar as it is a mobile being. That is why he said in the beginning that time is <i>per se</i> a measure of motion but <i>per accidens</i> a measure of rest.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quarto ibi: mensurabit autem tempus etc., ostendit secundum quid mobile et quiescens mensurantur a tempore. Et dicit quod tempus mensurat illud quod movetur et quiescit, non inquantum est lapis vel homo, sed inquantum est motum et quiescens. Mensuratio enim proprie debetur quantitati: cuius ergo quantitas tempore mensuratur, illud proprie tempore mensuratur. Ex mensuratione autem temporis cognoscitur quantus sit motus, et quanta sit quies; non autem quantum sit id quod movetur. Unde quod movetur, non simpliciter mensuratur tempore secundum propriam quantitatem, sed secundum quantitatem sui motus. Ex quo patet quod tempus proprie sit mensura motus et quietis: sed motus per se, quietis autem per accidens.
          <td>609. Fourthly, [435] he shows in what sense a mobile and a thing at rest are measured by time. And he says that time measures what is moved and at rest not insofar as it is a stone or a man, but insofar as it is in motion and at rest. For measuring is properly due to quantity; therefore, time is properly the measure of that whose quantity is measured by time. Now, from the measuring done by time, are known both the quantity of motion and the quantity of rest, but not the quantity of the thing in motion. Hence the thing in motion is not measured by time according to its own proper quantity, but according to the quantity of its motion. From this it is clear that time properly is the measure of motion and of rest—of motion <i>per se</i> , but of rest <i>per accidens</i> .
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quinto ibi: quare quaecumque neque moventur etc., inducit quoddam corollarium ex praemissis. Si enim nihil mensuratur tempore nisi secundum quod movetur et quiescit, sequitur quod quaecumque non moventur neque quiescunt, ut substantiae separatae, non sunt in tempore: quia hoc est esse in tempore, mensurari a tempore. Tempus autem est mensura motus et quietis, ut ex dictis patet.
          <td>610. Fifthly, [436], he adduces a certain corollary from the foregoing. For if nothing is measured by time except insofar as it is in motion or at rest, it follows that whatsoever things are neither in motion nor at rest, e.g., the separated substances, are not in time; for this is to be in time, namely, to be measured by time. But time is the measure of motion and of rest, as is clear from the foregoing.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: manifestum igitur quoniam etc., ostendit quod non omnia non entia sunt in tempore. Et dicit manifestum esse ex praemissis, quod neque etiam omne non ens est in tempore, sicut ea quae non contingit aliter esse, ut diametrum esse commensurabilem lateri quadrati: hoc enim est impossibile, quia nunquam contingit esse verum. Huiusmodi autem non mensurantur tempore. Et hoc sic probat. Tempus primo et per se est mensura motus, alia autem non mensurantur nisi per accidens: quaecumque ergo mensurantur tempore, eis contingit moveri et quiescere. Unde et generabilia et corruptibilia et omnia quae quandoque sunt et quandoque non sunt, quia sunt in moveri et quiescere, sunt in tempore: quia quoddam tempus est maius eis, quod excellit durationem ipsorum, et propter hoc mensurat substantias eorum, non secundum id quod sunt, sed secundum esse vel durationem ipsorum.
          <td>611. Then [473] he shows that not all non-beings are in time. He says it is clear from the foregoing that neither is every non-being in time, as in the case of things that cannot be otherwise [whose contradictory cannot be], e.g., that a diagonal be commensurate with the side of a square: for this is impossible, because it can never be true. Now such things are not measured by time. And he proves it in this way: Time is primarily and <i>per se</i> the measure of motion, and anything else is measured by time only <i>per accidens</i> . Consequently whatever is measured by time must be capable of motion and rest. Hence things generable and corruptible, and all things that sometimes exist and sometimes do not, since they are “in motion and rest,” exist in time, for same time can be found that is greater than they are and which exceeds their duration, and for that reason measures their substances, not in regard to the nature of the substances, but in regard to their existence or duration.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sed inter ea quae non sunt, et tamen continentur a tempore, quaedam aliquando erant, ut Homerus; quaedam aliquando erunt, ut aliquod futurum; vel si continentur a tempore praeterito et futuro, erunt et erant. Ea vero quae nullo modo continentur a tempore, neque sunt neque fuerunt neque erunt. Et talia sunt ea quae semper non sunt, et quorum opposita semper sunt; sicut diametrum esse incommensurabilem lateri, semper est; unde non mensuratur tempore. Et propter hoc neque contrarium eius, quod est diametrum esse symmetrum, idest commensurabilem lateri, mensuratur tempore: ideo enim semper non est, quia est contrarium ei quod semper est.
          <td>But among things that do not exist but are nevertheless contained by time, some things existed at one time, as Homer; others will exist, as some future event; or, if they are contained both by past and present time, they both will be and were. But things that are in no way contained by time neither are, nor were, nor will be. Such are things that forever are not, and whose opposites forever are; for example, that a diagonal be not commensurable to the side, forever is; whence it is not measured by time. And for this reason neither is its contrary measured by time, i.e. that the diagonal is symmetrical, i.e., commensurable. The reason why it forever is not, is that it is the contrary of what forever is.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Quorumcumque autem contrarium non semper est, haec possunt esse et non esse, et habent generationem et corruptionem: et talia mensurantur tempore.
          <td>But of whatever things the contrary does not always exist, such things can exist and not exist, and are subject to generation and corruption; such things are measured by time.

Is time then always different or does the same time recur? Clearly time is, in the same way as motion is. For if one and the same motion sometimes recurs, it will be one and the same time, and if not, not. Since the 'now' is an end and a beginning of time, not of the same time however, but the end of that which is past and the beginning of that which is to come, it follows that, as the circle has its convexity and its concavity, in a sense, in the same thing, so time is always at a beginning and at an end. And for this reason it seems to be always different; for the 'now' is not the beginning and the end of the same thing; if it were, it would be at the same time and in the same respect two opposites. And time will not fail; for it is always at a beginning.

          <td>Postquam philosophus ostendit quomodo se habeat tempus ad ea quae sunt in tempore, hic ostendit quomodo per comparationem ad nunc diversimode aliqua secundum tempus nominantur. Et circa hoc duo facit: primo ponit significationem ipsius nunc; secundo quorumdam aliorum quae determinantur secundum nunc, ibi: ipsum autem tunc et cetera.
          <td>612. After showing how time is related to things that exist in time, the Philosopher here shows how, in virtue of their relations to the “now,” certain words derived various meanings with respect to time. About this he does two things: First he explains the meaning of “now”; Secondly, the meaning of certain other words that are determined by the “now, “ at no. 615.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum duo facit: primo ponit propriam et principalem significationem ipsius nunc; secundo ponit secundariam significationem, ibi: aliud autem et cetera.
          <td>As to the first be does two things: First be gives the proper and principal meaning of “now”; Secondly, be gives a secondary meaning, at no. 614.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Circa primum tria dicit de nunc. Quorum primum est, quod nunc continuat tempus praeteritum futuro, inquantum est terminus temporis, principium quidem futuri, finis autem praeteriti: licet hoc non sit sic manifestum in nunc, sicut in puncto. Nam punctum stans est; et ideo potest bis accipi, semel ut principium et semel ut finis: quod non accidit in nunc, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>613. In regard to the first be says three things about “now.” The first of these [438] is that the “now” joins past time to the future, insofar as it is the boundary of time—the beginning of the future and the end of the past, although this is not so evident in the “now” as in a point. For a point is stationary and therefore can be considered twice: once as a beginning, and once as an end. But this does not occur with the “now,” as was said above.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundo ibi: dividit autem potentia etc., dicit quod tempus etiam dividitur secundum nunc, sicut et linea dividitur secundum punctum. Sed tamen nunc dividit tempus inquantum consideratur ut multa in potentia: prout scilicet accipitur seorsum ut principium huius temporis, et seorsum ut finis alterius. Et inquantum sic accipitur, accipitur ut alterum et alterum nunc: sed secundum quod accipitur ut copulans tempus et continuans, accipitur ut idem. Et hoc manifestat per simile in lineis mathematicis, in quibus magis est manifestum. Non enim in lineis mathematicis punctum quod signatur in medio lineae, semper intelligitur ut idem: quia secundum quod dividitur linea, intelligitur aliud punctum quod est ultimum unius lineae, et aliud secundum quod est ultimum alterius; quia lineae secundum quod sunt divisae actu, intelliguntur ut contiguae, contigua autem sunt quorum ultima sunt simul. Sed secundum quod punctum continuat partes lineae, sic est unum et idem: quia continua sunt quorum terminus est idem. Et sic est etiam de nunc respectu temporis: quia uno modo potest accipi ut divisio temporis secundum potentiam; alio modo secundum quod est terminus communis duorum temporum, uniens et continuans ea.
          <td>Secondly [439], he says that time is divided according to the “now” as a line is divided according to the point. But yet the “now” divides time insofar as it, the “now,” is considered to be many in potency, i.e., as it is, namely, taken separately as the beginning of this time, and separately as the end of that time. And insofar as it is taken in this way, the “now” is taken as other and other; but insofar as it is taken as linking time and giving it continuity, it to taken as one and the same. And he shows this from a similar situation in mathematical lines, in which it is more evident. For in mathematical lines the point in the middle of a line is not always taken as the same: for insofar as the line is divided, there is understood one point which is the end of one line, and one point which is the end of the other. For lines, insofar as they are actually divided, are considered as contiguous—and contiguous things are those whose boundaries are together. But insofar as the point continues the parts of the line, it is one and the same—for continuous things are those whose boundary is the same. And this is the situation with the “now” in respect of time: for it can be taken in one way as potentially dividing time; in another way, as the common boundary of two times, uniting them, and making them continuous.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Tertio ibi: est autem idem etc., dicit quod nunc dividens et continuans tempus est unum et idem subiecto, sed differt ratione, ut ex dictis patet. Uno igitur modo sic dicitur nunc.
          <td>Thirdly [440], he says that the “now” that divides and continues time is one and the same as to subject, though differing in conception, as the foregoing has made clear. So much for the first meaning of “now.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: aliud autem, etc., ponit secundariam significationem ipsius nunc. Et dicit quod alio modo dicitur nunc, non terminus temporis continuans praeteritum futuro, sed ipsum tempus propinquum praesenti nunc, sive sit praeteritum sive sit futurum: sicut dicimus veniet nunc, quia veniet hodie, et veniet nunc, quia venit hodie. Sed non dicimus quod bellum Troianum sit factum nunc, neque quod diluvium factum sit nunc: quia licet totum tempus sit continuum, non tamen est propinquum praesenti nunc.
          <td>614. Then [441] he gives a secondary meaning of “now,” saying that “now” has another meaning, for it can be taken, not as the boundary of time continuing the past with the future, but as the time near to the present “now,” whether that time is past or future, as when we say, “He will come not,” because he will come today, or when we say, “He has come now,” because he came today. But we do not say that the Trojan war has happened “now,” nor that the Flood took place “now,” because, although the whole of the time is continuous [with the present] nevertheless it is not close to the present “now.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: ipsum autem tunc etc., exponit quaedam quae determinantur per nunc. Et primo quid significet ipsum tunc. Circa quod duo facit: primo ponit significationem eius; secundo movet quaestionem, ibi: si vero neque tempus et cetera.
          <td>615. Then [442] he explains certain things that are determined by the “now.” And first, what “then” signifies. About this he does two things: First he gives its meaning; Secondly, he raises a difficulty, at no. 616.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod hoc quod dico tunc, significat tempus determinatum per aliquod prius nunc, sive propinquum sive remotum. Possumus enim dicere quod tunc destructa est Troia, et tunc factum est diluvium. Oportet enim quod id quod dicitur factum tunc, includatur ad aliquod nunc vel instans praecedens. Oportebit enim dicere quod sit aliquod tempus determinatae quantitatis ab hoc tempore praesenti in illud nunc, quod erat in praeterito. Et sic patet quod hoc quod dico tunc, differt a secunda significatione nunc in duobus: quia tunc semper est ad praeteritum, et indifferenter se habet ad propinquum et remotum; sed nunc se habet ad propinquum, sed indifferenter ad praeteritum et futurum.
          <td>He says therefore first (442) that “then” signifies a time determined by some previous “now,” whether near or remote. For we can say that Troy was destroyed “then,” and that the Deluge took place “then.” For what is said to have taken place “then” must be included between some preceding “now” or instant [and the present]. For it will be necessary to say that there is a time period of definite quantity from the present time to that “now” which was in the past. In this wise it to evident that “then” differs from the second meaning of “now” in two ways: first, because “then” always refers to the past and it matters not whether it to the near past or the remote past; but “now” refers to the near, and it matters not whether it be past or future.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: si vero neque tempus est etc., movet quandam dubitationem ex praemissis, et solvit eam. Dixerat enim quod tempus quod dicitur tunc, includitur intra praeteritum nunc et praesens: unde omne tempus quod dicitur tunc oportet esse finitum: sed non est aliquod tempus, quod non possit dici tunc: ergo omne tempus erit finitum. Sed omne tempus finitum deficit: videtur ergo dicendum quod tempus deficiat. Sed si semper est motus, et tempus est numerus motus, sequitur quod tempus non deficiat. Oportebit igitur dicere, si omne tempus est finitum, quod vel semper sit aliud et aliud tempus, vel quod idem tempus multoties reiteretur. Et hoc oportet esse in tempore, sicut est in motu. Si enim unus sit semper et idem motus, oportebit unum et idem tempus esse. Si autem non est unus et idem motus, non erit unum et idem tempus.
          <td>616. Then [443] he raises a difficulty in the light of the foregoing and solves it. For he had said that the time which is called “then” is included within a past “now” and the present: hence all time called “then” must be finite. But there is no time which cannot be called “then.” Therefore all time is finite. Now all finite time runs out. It seems therefore that one must say that time runs out. But if motion is always and time is the measure of motion, it follows that time will not run out. Therefore, we shall be forced to say, if all time is finite, either that time is always other and other, or that the same time is repeated over and over. And this situation must exist in time just as it is in notion. For if there is some eternally one and the same motion, then there will have to be one and the same time; but if there is not one and the same motion, there will not be one and the same time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundum igitur opinionem eius, motus nunquam incepit, neque deficiet, ut in octavo patebit; et ita reiteratur quidem unus et idem motus specie, sed non numero. Non enim eadem est circulatio quae nunc est, cum illa quae fuit, numero, sed specie. Et tamen totus motus est unus continuitate, quia una circulatio continuatur alteri, ut in octavo probabitur. Et similiter oportet esse de tempore sicut de motu.
          <td>617. According to his opinion, as will be clear in Book VIII, motion never had a beginning, and will never end. Thus one and the same motion is being repeated, not numerically but specifically. For it is not numerically the same revolution that is taking place now and which took place in the past, but it is specifically the same one. Nevertheless, the whole notion is one in continuity, because one revolution is continuous with the next, as will be proved in Book VIII. And what was said of motion must also apply to time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Unde consequenter ostendit quod tempus nunquam deficiet. Patet enim ex praemissis, quod nunc est principium et finis, sed non respectu eiusdem; sed finis respectu praeteriti, et principium respectu futuri. Unde sic se habet de nunc, sicut se habet de circulo, in quo concavum et convexum sunt idem subiecto, sed differunt ratione per respectum ad diversa. Nam convexum circuli attenditur secundum comparationem ad exteriora, concavum autem per respectum ad interiora. Et quia nihil est accipere de tempore nisi nunc, ut supra dictum est, sequitur quod tempus semper sit in principio et in fine. Et propter hoc tempus videtur esse alterum et alterum: quia nunc non est principium et finis eiusdem temporis, sed diversorum temporum; alioquin opposita inessent eidem secundum idem. Principium enim et finis habent oppositas rationes: si ergo idem esset principium et finis respectu eiusdem, opposita inessent eidem secundum idem.
          <td>From this he shows that time will never fail. For it is evident from the foregoing that the “now” is both a beginning and an end, although not in relation to the same thing; but it is an end with respect to the past and a beginning with respect to the future. Accordingly, the situation with respect to the “now” is like that of the circle, in which its concavity and convexity are the same thing in reality, but differ according as they are related to diverse things. For convexity is had in a circle with respect to things outside it, and concavity with respect to things inside it. And because nothing of time can be taken but the “now” (as was said above) it follows that time is always at a beginning and at an end. And for this reason time seems to be other and other, for the “now” is not the beginning and end of the same time, but of different times; otherwise, opposite things would be true of the same thing according to the same aspect. For “beginning” and “end” have opposite notions; consequently, if the same thing were a beginning and an end with respect to the same, opposites would exist in the same thing according to the same aspect.

          <td>Ulterius concludit ex praemissis, quod quia nunc est principium et finis temporis, tempus nunquam deficiet: quia tempus non potest accipi sine nunc, ut supra dictum est, et nunc est principium temporis: unde tempus semper est in sui principio. Quod autem est in sui principio non deficit: unde tempus non deficiet. Et eadem ratione potest probari quod tempus non incepit secundum quod nunc est finis temporis.
          <td>He further concludes from the foregoing that since the “now” is both a beginning and an end of time, time will never fail: for time cannot be understood without a “now,” and the “now” is the beginning of a time: hence time is always existing in a beginning of itself. But what is at its beginning is not failing; therefore time will not fail. By the same reasoning it can be proved that time did not commence from the point of view of the “now” which is the end of time.

Sed de hoc magis inquiretur in octavo.
          <td>But this reasoning proceeds on the supposition that motion is always, as he says. On this supposition, one would have to say that any “now” of time is a beginning and an end. But if it be said that motion had a beginning, or that it will cease, it follows that some “now” will be a beginning of a period of time and not an end, and some “now” will be an end but not a beginning, as happens also in a line. For if there were an infinite line, any point designated in it would be a beginning and an and. But if the line is finite, some point in it is a beginning only, or an end only. But this will be investigated more in detail in Book VIII.

It refers to a part of the future, when I say: “When will he leave?” “Presently”—because the time in which this will take place is close. It refers to the past when I say “When are you going?” and it is answered,—“I have just gone”. However in regard to events that are distant, we do not say “presently” or “just”; for example, we do not say that Troy has “just” been destroyed, because this is very remote from the present “now.”

But we say “long ago”, when the time past is far from the present. Finally, we say that something occurs “suddenly”, when the time in which it takes place is imperceptibly small.

          <td>620. After comparing time and the “now” to things that exist in time, the Philosopher here explains some things that were touched upon above. First, how corruption is attributed to time; Secondly, how every motion and change exist in time, at no. 623.

        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Dicit ergo primo quod omnis mutatio de sui ratione removet rem quae mutatur, a naturali dispositione sua: sed tam generatio quam corruptio fit in tempore. Et ideo quidam attribuebant generationes rerum tempori, ut disciplinam et huiusmodi, dicentes tempus esse sapientissimum, propter hoc quod generatio scientiae fit in tempore. Sed quidam philosophus, Paro nomine, de secta Pythagoricorum, posuit e converso, quod tempus est penitus indisciplinabile, quia scilicet per longitudinem temporis accidit oblivio. Et in hoc rectius dixit: quia, ut prius dictum est, tempus per se magis est causa corruptionis quam generationis. Et hoc ideo, quia tempus est numerus motus: mutatio autem per se est destructiva et corruptiva. Sed causa generationis et ipsius esse non est nisi per accidens. Ex hoc enim ipso quod aliquid movetur, recedit a dispositione quam prius habebat. Sed quod perveniat ad aliquam dispositionem, hoc non importatur in ratione motus inquantum est motus, sed inquantum est finitus et perfectus: quam quidem perfectionem habet motus ex intentione agentis, quod movet ad determinatum finem. Et ideo corruptio magis potest attribui mutationi et tempori: sed generatio et esse agenti et generanti.
          <td>621. He says therefore first [446] that every change of its very nature removes from its natural disposition the thing that is changed: but both generation and corruption take place in time. And therefore some attributed generations in things to time, as in the case of learning and the like, saying that time is “very wise” because the generation of science takes place in time. But a certain philosopher by the name of Parus, a Pythagorean, claimed on the contrary that time was “wholly unteachable,” because with length of time comes forgetfulness. And he was more right: for, as was said above, time <i>per se</i> is more a cause of corruption than of generation. The reason is that time is the number of motion, and change is <i>per se</i> destructive and corruptive. It does not cause generation and existence except <i>per accidens</i> . For from the fact that something is moved, it departs from the state in which it was. But that it arrive at some disposition is not implied in the notion of motion insofar as it is motion but insofar as it is finished and perfect. And this perfection is brought about by motion on account of the intention of the agent which moves to a predetermined end. Therefore corruption is attributed rather to change and time, whereas generation and being attributed to the agent and generator.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: signum autem sufficiens etc., manifestat idem per signum: et dicit signum sufficiens esse eius quod dictum est, quod nihil invenitur fieri, nisi appareat aliquid agens et movens ipsum; sed tamen aliquid corrumpitur, cum non appareat manifeste aliquid quod moveat ipsum ad corruptionem. Et talem corruptionem solemus attribuere tempori, sicut cum aliquis senio deficit ex causa intrinseca corrumpente non manifesta: cum autem aliquis occiditur gladio, corruptio eius non attribuitur tempori. In generatione autem semper est generans manifestum, quia nihil a seipso generatur: et ideo generatio non attribuitur tempori, sicut corruptio. Non tamen corruptio sic attribuitur tempori, quod tempus faciat ipsam: sed quia fit in tempore, et corrumpens latet.
          <td>622. Then [447] he explains the same point with a sign, and he says that a sufficient sign of his claim is that nothing is found to come into being independently of an agent and a mover, but that a thing can corrupt without any mover in evidence. And such corruption we are accustomed to attribute to time, as when someone fails through old age from a corrupting internal cause that is not apparent; but when someone is killed with a sword, his corruption is not attributed to time. However, in generation the generator is always evident, because nothing is generated by itself. That is why generation is not attributed to time, as is corruption. Nevertheless, corruption is not laid to time in such a way as that time should cause it; but rather as occurring in time, while the corrupting influence is latent.

          <td>Finally [448], he asserts in a summary way that it has been explained that time exists, and what it is, and how “now” is used in various senses, and what are the meanings of “then” and “just now” and “presently” and “long ago” and “suddenly.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Deinde cum dicit: his autem nobis sic determinatis etc., ostendit quod omnis mutatio sit in tempore, duabus rationibus. Quarum prima talis est. In omni mutatione invenitur velocius et tardius: haec autem determinantur tempore; quia velocius dicitur mutari, quod transmutatur prius ad determinatum terminum secundum idem spatium. Ita tamen quod eadem sit regula utriusque motus, ut in loci mutatione sit utraque mutatio circularis, aut utraque recta. Si autem una esset circularis et alia recta, non propter hoc velocius moveretur quod prius veniret ad terminum. Et similiter intelligendum in aliis generibus mutationum. Sequitur igitur quod omnis mutatio sit in tempore.
          <td>623. Then [449] he above by two arguments that all change occurs in time. The first of these is that in every change is found the distinction of “faster” and “slower.” But these are determined by time—because that is said to be changed “faster,” which is changed first to a designated term, over a same distance, provided that both motions are subject to the same rule; e.g., in the case of local motion, if both motions are circular, or both in a straight line. But if one were along a circle and the other straight, the fact that one reached its terminus before the other would be no reason for saying that one moved “faster” than the other. And the same is to be understood of other types of change. It follows, therefore, that every change exists in time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Secundam rationem ponit ibi: at vero prius in tempore est etc.; et ad hoc probandum utitur tali propositione: prius et posterius sunt in tempore. Quod quidem manifestat hoc modo. Prius et posterius dicitur aliquid per distantiam ad ipsum nunc, quod est terminus praeteriti et futuri: sed ipsa nunc sunt in tempore: ergo et prius et posterius sunt in tempore; quia in eodem oportet quod sit nunc et distantia ipsius nunc, sicut in eodem est punctum et distantia quae accipitur per respectum ad punctum; utrumque enim est in linea.
          <td>624. He then gives a second reason [450], but in this proof he makes use of the proposition that “before” and “after” exist in time. He manifests this proposition in the following way. “Before” and “after” are said according to the distance from the “now,” which is the boundary of the past and of the future. Both “now’s” exist in time; therefore both “before” and “after” exist in time, because that in which the “now” is, and that in which the distance from the “now” is, must be the same; just as it is in the same thing that there are a point and the distance taken in relation to that point, for both are in a line.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et quia dixerat quod prius et posterius determinantur per distantiam ad ipsum nunc, ostendit quomodo hoc sit e converso in praeteritis et futuris: quia in praeterito dicitur prius quod est remotius ab ipso nunc, posterius autem quod est propinquius; in futuro autem est e converso. Si ergo prius et posterius sunt in tempore, ad omnem autem motum sequitur prius et posterius, necesse est quod omnis motus sit in tempore.
          <td>And because he had said that “before” and “after” are determined by the distance to the “now,” he shows how this occurs in a contrary manner with the past and the future. For in the past, that is “before” which is farther from the “now” but “after” which is nearer; but in the future it is just the opposite. If therefore “before” and “after” exist in time, and “before” and “after” follow upon every motion, then necessarily every motion exists in time.

And this opinion again is held because time is the measure of this kind of locomotion and is itself measured by such. So that to say that the things that come into being form a circle is to say that there is a circle of time; and this is to say that it is measured by the circular movement; for apart from the measure nothing else to be measured is observed; the whole is just a plurality of measures.

For things are called the same so-and-so if they do not differ by a differentia of that thing, but not if they do; e.g. triangle differs from triangle by a differentia of triangle, therefore they are different triangles; but they do not differ by a differentia of figure, but are in one and the same division of it.

Now all bodies are mobile, if not with other motions, at least with respect to local motion, because all things are in place.

Quaecumque enim sunt possibilia moveri et non moventur actu, quiescunt. Tempus autem non solum mensurat motum, sed etiam quietem, ut supra dictum est.

          <td>And because someone could say that although they are mobile, they are not all being moved, but some are at rest, and thus time does not seem to be in all, to counter this he adds that time accompanies motion, whether motion be actual or potential. For things that are capable of motion, and are not actually being moved, are at rest. But time measures not only motion but rest as well, as was said above. Hence, wherever there is motion either actually or potentially, there time is.

          <td>Secundo ibi: impossibile enim cum sit etc., obiicit ad ostendendum quod non. Quia si impossibile esset esse aliquod potens numerare, impossibile esset esse aliquod numerabile, potens scilicet numerari. Sed si non est numerabile, non est numerus; quia numerus non est nisi in eo quod numeratur actu, vel quod est numerabile in potentia. Relinquitur ergo quod si non est aliquod potens numerare, quod non sit numerus. Sed nihil aliud natum est numerare quam anima, et inter partes animae non alia quam intellectus; quia numeratio fit per collationem numeratorum ad unam primam mensuram, conferre autem rationis est.

          <td>628. Secondly, [454] he objects, to say it would not. For if it were impossible for something able to count to exist, it would be impossible for some thing countable to exist, i.e., able to be counted. But if there is nothing countable, then there is no number, because number does not exist except in that which is being actually counted or which is potentially countable. Consequently, if there is no one able to count, there is no number. But only the soul is disposed by nature for counting, and among the parts of the soul only the intellect; for counting consists in comparing the things counted with one primary measure, and comparing is a function of reason. Consequently, if there is no intellective soul, there is no number. But time is a number, an was said. If therefore, there is no intellective soul, there is no time.

          <td>629. Then [455] he answers the question. And he says that it is necessary to say either that time is not, if the soul is not; or to say what is truer, that time is still some sort of being even without the soul’s existing, similar to motion’s existing without the soul’s existing. For as motion is posited, so is it also necessary to posit time, because “before” and “after” exist in motion, and it is these things, namely, the “before” and “after” in motion, insofar as they are numberable, that are time.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Ad evidentiam autem huius solutionis considerandum est, quod positis rebus numeratis, necesse est poni numerum. Unde sicut res numeratae dependent a numerante, ita et numerus earum. Esse autem rerum numeratarum non dependet ab intellectu, nisi sit aliquis intellectus qui sit causa rerum, sicut est intellectus divinus: non autem dependet ab intellectu animae. Unde nec numerus rerum ab intellectu animae dependet: sed solum ipsa numeratio, quae est actus animae, ab intellectu animae dependet. Sicuti ergo possunt esse sensibilia sensu non existente, et intelligibilia intellectu non existente, ita possunt esse numerabilia et numerus, non existente numerante.
          <td>To make this solution more evident it must be considered that once a series of numbered things is posited, it is necessary to posit number. Hence just as counted things depend on someone’s counting, so also their count [or number]. However, the existence of counted things does not depend on an intellect, unless it be an intellect which is the cause of things, as is the divine intellect, It does not depend on the intellect of the same. Hence neither does the number of things depend on the intellect in the human soul; only the counting of them, which counting is an act of the soul, depends on the intellect in the soul. Consequently, just as there can be things perceptible to sense even though no sense exists, and intelligible even though no intelligence exists, so there can exist both numberable [countable] things, and number even though no counter exist.

Si enim est sensibile, potest sentiri, et si potest sentiri, potest esse aliquod sentiens; licet non sequatur quod si est sensibile, quod sit sentiens. Et similiter sequitur quod si est aliquid numerabile, quod possit esse aliquid numerans. Unde si impossibile est esse aliquod numerans, impossibile est esse aliquid numerabile: non tamen sequitur quod si non est numerans, quod non sit numerabile, ut obiectio philosophi procedebat.
          <td>But perhaps the conditional he first mentioned is true, namely, that if no counter could exist, nothing countable could exist, just as the proposition is true that if there could be no one to sense, there could be nothing sensible. For if there is something sensible, it can be sensed, and if it can be sensed, there can be something to sense it—although it does not follow that if there is something sensible, there is something sensing. In like manner, it follows that if there is something countable, there can be someone to count. Consequently, if no one to count could exist, nothing countable could exist. However, it does not follow that if there is no one counting, there is nothing countable, which is the objection raised by the Philosopher.

          <td>Si ergo motus haberet esse fixum in rebus, sicut lapis vel equus, posset absolute dici quod sicut etiam anima non existente est numerus lapidum, ita etiam anima non existente esset numerus motus, qui est tempus. Sed motus non habet esse fixum in rebus, nec aliquid actu invenitur in rebus de motu, nisi quoddam indivisibile motus, quod est motus divisio: sed totalitas motus accipitur per considerationem animae, comparantis priorem dispositionem mobilis ad posteriorem. Sic igitur et tempus non habet esse extra animam, nisi secundum suum indivisibile: ipsa autem totalitas temporis accipitur per ordinationem animae numerantis prius et posterius in motu, ut supra dictum est. Et ideo signanter dicit philosophus quod tempus, non existente anima, est utcumque ens, idest imperfecte; sicut et si dicatur quod motum contingit esse sine anima imperfecte.
          <td>Therefore, if motion had a fixed existence in reality, as a stone or a horse has, one could say unqualifiedly that, just as with no soul existing there exists a number of stones, so also with no soul existing, there would exist a number of motion, which is time. However, motion does not have a fixed existence in reality, nor is anything actual of motion found in things but a certain indivisible of motion which divides motion; indeed, the totality of motion comes to be on account of the mind considering and comparing a previous state of the mobile to a subsequent state. According to this, then, time also has no existence outside the soul except according to its indivisible; while the totality of time is had by an ordering process of the mind enumerating the prior and subsequent in motion [i.e., “before” and “after”], as was said above. And therefore the Philosopher said significantly that with no soul existing time is a being “of a sort,” i.e., imperfectly; this is similar to the statement that motion exists imperfectly without a soul existing.

          <td>631. The first solution, therefore, is that time is the number of any motion whatsoever. To prove this he brings up that every motion exists in time; namely, generation, and increase, and alteration, and local motion. Now what is found in every motion belongs to motion as such. But to exist in time is to be numbered by time. Consequently, it seems that every motion as such has a number; hence, since time is the number of motion, it seems to follow that time is the number of each and every continuous motion and not of some definite motion.

Duo autem tempora inaequalia simul esse, non est admirabile, ut diem et horam.
          <td>632. Then [458] he disproves this solution. For let us assume two things that are moving together: if, therefore, time to the number of any motion at all, it will follow that of two simultaneous motions each will have its own time, and so it will further follow that two equal times exist at once—e.g., two days or two hours. Now it is not strange for two unequal times to exist at once, e.g., a day and an hour.

          <td>633. Then [459] he shows that it is impossible for two equal times to exist at once. For every time that is simultaneous and similar , i.e., equal, is one; but time that is not simultaneous is not numerically one, although it is one in species, as day with day and year with year.

Sed tempus est idem, si alterationis et loci mutationis sit aequalis numerus, supposito quod sint simul.

          <td>And he explains this by a similarity in other things that are numbered. For if there are seven horses and seven dogs, there is no difference so far as the number is concerned, but the difference is due to the species of the things counted. In like manner, for all motions which have simultaneous terms both as to their beginning and as to their end, there is the same time; yet the motions differ according to their proper notions, in that, perchance, one is fast and the other slow, one is local motion and the other alteration. But the time is the same if the number of the alteration and of the local motion is the same, supposing, of course, that they are simultaneous. Consequently, motions must be distinct from one another, but the time in all of them is the same— because there is one and the same number for all those that are equal and simultaneous, no matter where they occur.

The first of these is that among motions, the first and more simple and regular is local motion, and among these, circular motion, as will be proved in Book VIII. The second is that each thing is numbered by something near it, i.e., by something homogeneous with it, as units by a unit and horses by a horse, as is clear in <i>Metaphysics</i> X; hence time must be measured by some definite time, as we see that all times are measured by the day. The third presupposition is that time is measured by motion, and motion by time, as was said above. This is so because it is in terms of some definite motion and some definite time that the quantity of any motion and time is measured.

Sed in loci mutatione inveniri potest regularitas, quia potest esse aliquis motus localis continuus et uniformis; et talis est solus motus circularis, ut in octavo probabitur.
          <td>635. Then [461] he concludes from the foregoing that if something that is first is the measure of all things that are near it, i.e., of all the things in its genus, it is necessary that circular motion, which is regular above all, be the measure of all motions. Now a motion is called “regular,” if it is one and uniform. But such regularity cannot be found in alteration and growth, because they are not incessantly continuous or of equal [constant] speed. But regularity can be found in change of place, because there can be a local motion that is continuous and uniform, and the only such motion is circular motion, as will be proved in Book VIII.

          <td>Et inter alios motus circulares, maxime uniformis et regularis est primus motus, qui revolvit totum firmamentum motu diurno: unde illa circulatio, tanquam prima et simplicior et regularior, est mensura omnium motuum. Oportet autem motum regularem esse mensuram seu numerum aliorum, quia omnis mensura debet esse certissima; et talia sunt quae uniformiter se habent. Ex hoc igitur colligere possumus, quod si prima circulatio mensurat omnem motum, et motus mensurantur a tempore, inquantum mensurantur quodam motu; necesse est dicere quod tempus sit numerus primae circulationis, secundum quam mensuratur tempus, et ad quem mensurantur omnes alii motus temporis mensuratione.
          <td>Now among circular motions the most uniform and regular is the first motion which turns the whole firmament in a daily cycle; hence that revolution, as being the first and simplest and most regular, is the measure of all motions. But a regular motion must be the measure and number of the others, because every measure ought to be most certain—and those that are uniform are such. Consequently, from this we can gather that if the first circular motion measures every motion, and motions are measured by time insofar as they are measured by some motion, it has to be said that time is the number of the first circular motion, according to which time is measured, and in relation to which are measured all other motions that are timed.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: unde et videtur tempus etc., approbat praedictam solutionem per opiniones aliorum. Et primo per opinionem errantium, qui moti fuerunt ad dicendum quod motus sphaerae caelestis sit tempus, propter hoc quod hoc motu mensurantur omnes alii motus, et tempus mensuratur hoc motu: manifestum est enim quod dicimus diem vel annum completum, attendentes ad motum caeli.
          <td>636. Then [462] he corroborates his solution by appealing to the opinions of others, and first of all by the opinion of those who were led to assert that the movement of the heavenly sphere is time, on the ground that all other motions, and time itself, are measured by that movement; for it is evident that we speak of a complete day or year by reckoning from the motion of the heavens.

          <td>Secundo ex usu communiter loquentium, ibi: propter hoc autem et cetera. Et dicit quod propter hoc, scilicet quod tempus est numerus circulationis primae, accidit quod consuevit dici, scilicet quod quidam circulus sit in rebus humanis, et in aliis quae moventur naturaliter et generantur et corrumpuntur. Quod ideo est, quia omnia huiusmodi mensurantur tempore, et accipiunt principium et finem in tempore, ac si tempus secundum quandam circulationem sit: quia et ipsum tempus videtur esse quidam circulus. Et hoc iterum videtur propter hoc, quod est mensura circulationis, et etiam a tali circulatione mensuratur. Et ideo dicere quod eorum quae fiunt in tempore, est quidam circulus, nihil est aliud quam dicere temporis esse quendam circulum; quod accidit propter hoc quod tempus mensuratur circulatione. Illud enim quod mensuratur, non videtur esse aliud quam mensura: sed multae mensurae videntur facere unum totum, sicut multae unitates unum numerum, et multae mensurae panni unam quantitatem panni. Et hoc verum est, quando accipitur mensura unius generis.
          <td>Secondly [463] from a common saying. And he says that because of this, namely, that time is the number of the first circular movement, it comes about that people are want to say that there is a cycle in human affairs, and in other things that move naturally and come into being and pass away. This is so because all such things are measured by time, and have a beginning and an end in time, as if time moved in a circle, because time itself seems to be a certain circle. And this again seems to be so because time is a measure of circular movement and is also measured by such a circular movement. And therefore, to say that of things which take place in time there is a certain circle, is nothing other than to say that time is a certain circle—which occurs because time is measured by a circular movement. For that which is measured is not seen to be different from its measure: but rather many measures are seen to make one whole, as many units make one number, and many measures of cloth one quantity of cloth. And this is true when a homogeneous measure is taken.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Sic igitur patet quod tempus primo mensurat et numerat primum motum circularem, et per eum mensurat omnes alios motus. Unde est unum tempus tantum propter unitatem primi motus; et tamen quicumque sentit quemcumque motum, sentit tempus, eo quod ex primo motu causatur mutabilitas in omnibus mobilibus, ut supra dictum est.
          <td>From all this it is clear that time first measures and numbers the first circular motion and through it measures all other motions. Consequently, there is but one time, due to the oneness of the first motion; and yet whoever perceives any motion whatever, perceives time, because from the first motion there is caused, mutability in all mobile- things, as was said above.

          <td>Deinde cum dicit: dicitur autem recte etc., manifestat quoddam, quod supra dixerat, qualiter sit intelligendum. Dixerat enim quod idem est numerus septem canum et septem equorum. Quomodo ergo hoc sit verum ostendit: et dicit quod recte potest dici, si aequalis est numerus aliquarum rerum diversarum, puta ovium et canum, quod idem sit numerus utrorumque, ut puta si tam oves quam canes sint decem. Sed non potest dici quod hoc ipsum quod est esse decem, sit idem canum et ovium: non enim eadem decem sunt decem canes et decem oves. Et hoc ideo, quia genus potest cum additione unitatis vel identitatis praedicari de pluribus individuis existentibus in una specie, et similiter genus remotum de pluribus speciebus existentibus sub uno genere propinquo; neque tamen species de individuis, neque genus propinquum de speciebus diversis potest praedicari cum additione unitatis vel identitatis.
          <td>637. Then [464] he explains how something he mentioned above is to be understood. For he said that the number of seven dogs and seven horses is the same number. How this is true he now explains. And he says that it is correct to say, if the number of certain different things is equal, for example, of sheep and dogs, that the number is the same—for example, if the sheep and the dogs are both 10. But it cannot be said that to be 10 is the same for the dogs and sheep, for 10 dogs are not the same 10 as 10 sheep. The reason for this is that a genus can be predicated, with the addition of unity or identity [i.e., as “one genus” or “the same genus”], of several individuals of the same species; and in like manner, the remote genus can be predicated of several species existing under one proximate genus; but neither can the species be predicated of individuals, nor the proximate genus of diverse species, with the addition of unity or identity.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et huius consequenter ponit exemplum. Sunt enim duae species trianguli, scilicet aequilaterus, idest habens tria latera aequalia, et gradatus, idest habens tria latera inaequalia; figura autem est genus trianguli. Non ergo possumus dicere quod aequilaterus et gradatus sit idem triangulus; sed possumus dicere quod sunt eadem figura, quia utrumque continetur sub triangulo, qui est una species figurae. Et huius assignat rationem: quia cum idem et diversum seu differens opponantur, ibi possumus identitatem dicere, ubi differentia non invenitur; sed non possumus dicere identitatem, ubi invenitur differentia. Manifestum est autem quod aequilaterus et gradatus differunt ad invicem differentia trianguli, idest quae est proprie trianguli divisiva; et hoc ideo quia sunt diversae species trianguli. Sed aequilaterus et gradatus non differunt secundum differentiam figurae, sed sub una et eadem differentia divisiva figurae continentur.
          <td>And he then gives an example of what he means. For there are two species of triangle, equilateral, i.e., having three equal sides, and scalene, i.e., having three unequal sides. Now “figure” is the genus for “triangle.” We therefore can not say that equilateral and scalene are the same “triangle,” but we can say that they are the same “figure,” because both are contained under “triangle” which is one species of “figure.” He gives the reason for this, which is that since “identical,” and “diverse” or “different,” are opposed, we can speak of identity whenever no difference is found, but we cannot speak of identity where there is a difference. But it is clear that equilateral and scalene differ mutually by reason of a difference that divides “triangle,” because they are diverse species of triangle. But “equilateral” and “scalene” do not differ in respect of the difference “figure”; rather, they are contained under one and the same difference that divides “figure.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et hoc sic patet. Si enim dividamus figuram in suas species, quae per differentias constituuntur, invenietur quod alia erit circulus, et alia triangulus, et sic de aliis speciebus figurae; sed si dividamus triangulum, inveniemus quod alia species eius est aequilaterus, et alia gradatus. Manifestum est igitur quod aequilaterus et gradatus sunt una figura, quia continentur sub una specie figurae, quae est triangulus: sed non sunt unus triangulus, quia sunt diversae trianguli species.
          <td>And this is clear thus. If we divide “figure” into its species which are brought about by differences, it will be found that one species is a circle, another a triangle, and so on for the other species of figure. But if we divide “triangle,” we will find that one species is “equilateral,” another “scalene.” It is clear, therefore, that equilateral and scalene are one “figure,” because they are contained under the one species of “figure,” the species “triangle,” but they are not one “triangle,” because they are diverse species of “triangle.”
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Et similiter est in proposito. Numerus enim dividitur in diversas species, quarum una est decem. Omnia ergo quae sunt decem, dicuntur habere unum numerum; quia non differunt ad invicem secundum speciem numeri, cum contineantur sub una numeri specie. Sed non potest dici quod sint eadem decem; quia ea quibus applicatur numerus denarius, differunt, cum quaedam horum sint canes et quaedam equi.
          <td>The same thing applies to our proposition. For number is divided into diverse species, one of which is 10. Therefore all things that are 10 are said to have one number, because they do not differ from the other in regard to the species of their number, since they are contained under one and the same species of number. But we cannot say that they are the same 10, because the things being called “10” are different, since some are dogs and some horses.
        <tr style="text-align:justify" valign="top">
          <td>Videtur autem hoc introduxisse Aristoteles, ne aliquis ad sustinendam unitatem temporis sit contentus eo quod dicitur unum numerum esse aequalium numero, licet diversorum: quia licet sit idem denarius vel ternarius propter unitatem speciei, non tamen est idem denarius vel ternarius propter diversitatem quae est secundum numerum ex parte materiae. Unde secundum istam rationem sequeretur quod tempus esset unum specie, sed non numero. Et ideo ad accipiendam veram temporis unitatem, oportet recurrere ad unitatem primi motus, qui primo mensuratur tempore, et quo etiam mensuratur tempus.
          <td>Aristotle seems to have brought up this point so that no one, in trying to uphold the unity of time, would be content with saying that there is one number for things that are equal in number, even though the things be diverse; for although one might have a same 10 or 3 on account of a unity of species, yet it is not the same 10 or 3 on account of the diversity in number as based on matter. Hence, according to this reasoning, it would follow that time would be specifically, but not numerically, one. Therefore to get at the true unity of time, we must have recourse to the unity of the first motion, which is the first thing measured by time, and by which time itself is measured.
