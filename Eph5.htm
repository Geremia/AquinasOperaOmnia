  var WPFootnote2 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The etymology of Aquinas is correct, although the Romans transferred the use of &#8220;fornix&#8221; from\
 designating arches or vaults to brothels which were situated in underground vaults. The quotation\
 from Prov. 20:26 is as given in the Piana-Cai edition; although far from the true reading of v. 26\
 it seems to fit the context. The Parma gives the correct Vulgate reading: &#8220;incurvat super eos\
 fornicem.&#8221; If St. Thomas actually quoted it in this way, he may have taken it to mean that the\
 king built an arch near a place of fornication. It seems more probable, however, that he quoted\
 the verse as the Piana-Cai gives it since &#8220;fornicam&#8221; here means &#8220;wheel.&#8221; The Confraternity\
 translates the verse as: &#8220;A wise king winnows the wicked, and threshes them under the\
 cartwheel.&#8221;<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote3 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The text of Col. 2:8 has &#8220;philosophy&#8221; and not &#8220;prophecy&#8221;: St. Thomas&#8217; commentary on\
 Colossians, Ch. 2, Lect. 2, has the correct reading. Perhaps the syllogism he was about to give\
 distracted him or a copyist. It could be schematized as follows: major: God punishes whoever\
 sins gravely; minor: But those who commit carnal vices are punished by God; conclusion:\
 Therefore carnal vices are gravely sinful.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote4 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas takes &#8220;<i>diffidentiae<\/i>&#8221; in the sense of &#8220;despair&#8221; rather than &#8220;unbelief.&#8221; The Greek term\
 <i>apeitheia<\/i> means &#8220;disobedience,&#8221; especially (in the N.T.) against God. Hence the connotation of\
 &#8220;disbelief&#8217; in the proclamation of his gospel, or &#8220;distrust&#8221; in the salvation he gives.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote5 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>The City of God, 1, 9 and note 42. &#8220;If anyone forbears to reprove and find fault with those who\
 are doing wrong, because be seeks a more seasonable opportunity, or because he fears they may\
 be made worse by his rebuke, or that other weak persons may be disheartened from endeavouring\
 to lead a good and pious life, and may be driven from the faith; this man&#8217;s omission seems to be\
 occasioned not by covetousness, but by a charitable consideration. But what is blameworthy is,\
 that they who themselves revolt from the conduct of the wicked... spare those faults... because\
 they fear to give offense, lest they should injure their interests... that is to say, their\
 non-intervention is the result of selfishness, and not of love. Accordingly, this seems to me to be\
 one principal reason why the good are chastised along with the wicked, when God is pleased to\
 visit with temporal punishments the profligate manners of a community.&#8221; St. Thomas&#8217; reference\
 to losing &#8220;your benefices&#8221; (<i>beneficia tua<\/i>) may indicate that he had clergy in mind. A benefice\
 was an ecclestiastical position or function to which a stipend or salary was attached. This\
 naturally put the clerical recipient in an embarrassing position if he had to disagree or reprimand\
 the &#8220;benefactors&#8221; supporting him.<\/p>\

  var WPFootnote6 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Jerome, <i>Epistula<\/i> 22, (P.L. 23, 423). The following reference is to 3 Esdras, i.e., the\
 apocryphal third book.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote7 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas&#8217; reflections on choral chant in S.T. II-II, 91 follow from his general analysis of\
 external expressions in man&#8217;s religious worship (cf. references in note 114 above). &#8220;We use\
 language with God, not to manifest our thoughts to him, for he is the searcher of hearts, but to\
 induce reverence in ourselves and others who hear. Hence vocal praise is not necessary on God&#8217;s\
 account, but for the one who praises him.&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 1c). A possible consequence of this is that\
 &#8220;Doctrinal instruction and preaching are nobler than chant as methods of rousing men to\
 devotion&#8221; (<i>ibid.<\/i>, 2 ad 3). The reference to the &#8220;illiterates&#8221; must be taken within this context;\
 Aquinas&#8217; own experience probably led him to conclude that good theological teaching and\
 preaching did the educated more spiritual good than listening to Gregorian chant.<\/p>\
<\/span>';

  var WPFootnote8 =
    '<span class="WPNormal"><p>St. Thomas&#8217; use of &#8220;<i>exemplum<\/i>&#8221; here should not be taken simply in the sense of an &#8220;illustration.&#8221;\
 It also has the meaning of &#8220;exemplar&#8221; as in Lecture I of this chapter. The union of persons which\
 is the very essence or formal cause of matrimony (S.T. III, 29, 2c; Suppl. 44, 1c) was raised to\
 the dignity of a sacrament by Christ so that it conforms to the union of love he has for his spouse,\
 the Church (Suppl. 42, 1 ad 3). Cf. St. Thomas&#8217; comments on Eph. 5:32 below.<\/p>\

              because this is indispensable even if it is difficult. “What is
              man, said I, that he can follow the King his maker?” (Eccl. 2:12).
              Nonetheless, human nature would never achieve its end except in
              union with God. “My foot has followed his steps: I have kept his
              way, and have not declined from it” (Job 23:11). He must be
              imitated insofar as it is possible for us to do so-a son must
              imitate his father. Thus he adds as children since he is our
              father through creation: “Is he not your father, who possessed
              you, and made you, and created you?” (Deut. 32:6). He puts in most
              dear because God chose us to share in what is his very own.

              The charity of God has made us his most dear children: “For you
              have not received the spirit of bondage again in fear; but you
              have received the spirit of adoption of sons, whereby we cry:
              Abba, Father. For the Spirit himself gives testimony to our spirit
              that we are the sons of God” (Rom. 8:15-16). Certainly we ought to
              follow him in love. He says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">walk</span>
              to signify “you must always advance” as in Genesis 17 (1): ‘Walk
              before me and be perfect.” This should be in love since love is so
              good that man ought always to make further progress in it, and is
              that kind of a debt which man always has to pay. “Owe no man any
              thing, but to love one another” (Rom. 13:8). Or in love may mean
              the way in which God is followed more closely: “And I show you yet
              a more excellent way. If I speak with the tongues of men, and of
              angels, and have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a
              tinkling symbol” (1 Cor. 12:31-13:1). “Above all these things have
              charity, which is the bond of perfection” (Col. 3:14). This must
              be done according to Christ’s example, whence he adds as
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Christ also has loved us</span>.
              Jesus “having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them
              unto the end” (Jn. 13:1).

              This death was both advantageous and necessary for us, thus he
              says an
              <span style="font-weight: bold">oblation and a sacrifice</span>.
              Here the Apostle is speaking in the way the Old Law does. In it,
              as Leviticus 4 indicates, when someone sinned he was obliged to
              offer, because of it, the sacrifice and oblation which was
              designated for the sin. Then too, when someone gave thanks to God,
              or wished to obtain some favor, he had to offer a victim of peace,
              as prescribed in Leviticus 3 (9), which was of a most sweet savour
              to the Lord (v. 16). These, however, are all accomplished through
              Christ who, in order that we might be cleansed from sin and attain
              to glory,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">delivered himself for us</span>,
              an oblation through the actions he performed during his life: “He
              was offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his
              mouth” (Is. 53:7); and [he died as] a sacrifice to God for sin.

              hinting at what is said in Leviticus 3 (5 ff.). But certainly the
              odour described there was not pleasing to God in itself but
              according to its signification, inasmuch as it symbolized the
              sweet-smelling oblation of the body of Christ, the Son of God.
              “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a plentiful field”
              (Gen. 27:27). “Draw me, we will run after you to the odour of thy
              ointments” (Cant. 1:3). In this way also we ought to offer
              spiritual sacrifices to God: “A sacrifice to God is an afflicted
              spirit” (Ps. 50:19).

              patet sic. In peccato sunt duo, scilicet obiectum peccati, et

              et delectatio est spiritualis, sicut ira. Nam vindicta, quae est

              similiter inanis gloria. Quaedam vero sunt omnino carnalia et

              medium, quia eius obiectum est carnale, scilicet pecunia, sed
              delectatio est spiritualis, quia animo quiescit quis in pecunia.
              Et ideo connumeratur avaritia cum peccatis carnalibus ratione
              obiecti, cum spiritualibus vero ratione delectationis. Hebr. ult.:

              Thirdly, he bans avarice in mentioning
              <span style="font-weight: bold">covetousness</span>. But why this?
              Is it to be classed with carnal sins? I reply that it is neither
              identified with, nor completely separate from, carnal sin but
              midway between the spiritual and carnal sins. It can be explained
              this way. Sin contains two elements, the object of the sin and the
              gratification the object affords. Thus with certain sins both the
              object and the gratification are spiritual, such as anger. Both
              revenge, which is the objective of anger, and its gratification,
              are spiritual; the same holds true for vainglory. Other sins,
              however, are completely carnal both in their objects and their
              gratification; such as gluttony and voluptuousness. But
              covetousness is between each of these because its object is
              carnal, namely money, whereas its gratification is spiritual
              inasmuch as the mind finds rest in the possession of money.
              Therefore, covetousness is enumerated among The carnal sins by
              reason of its object, and among the spiritual ones by reason of
              the gratification it affords. “Let your manners be without
              covetousness” (Heb. 13:5).

              Or it might be answered that covetousness is opposed to justice

              The latter is the unjust use of another man’s woman and

              <span style="font-weight: bold">obscenity</span>
              which consists in impure touches, embraces and lustful kisses.
              “But he who is an adulterer, for the folly of his heart shall
              destroy his own soul. He gathers to himself shame and dishonor”
              (Prov. 6:32-33). Then there is
              <span style="font-weight: bold">foolish talking</span>
              which is words provocative of evil. “For her conversation,” that
              is, of an evil woman, “burns as fire” (Sirach 9:11). Finally there
              is
              <span style="font-weight: bold">scurrility</span>
              consisting in jocose words with which some attempt to please
              others. “But I say to you that for every idle word that men shall
              speak, they shall render an account on the day of judgment” (Mt.
              12:36). All of these are grave insofar as they are said or done in
              connection with mortal sins; for anything, even if it is generally
              good, becomes mortal to the degree that it is ordered toward
              mortal sins.

              Notice that he calls covetousness idolatry, for idolatry happens
              when the honor due God alone is given to creatures. Now there is a
              twofold honor due God; we must establish him as the goal of our
              life and we must put our trust of reaching the goal in him. Hence,
              whoever places these ‘in creatures is guilty of idolatry. A
              covetous person commits this when he fixes his end in a created
              reality as well as putting all his trust in it. “Of their silver
              and their gold they have made idols to themselves, that they might
              perish” (Os. 8:4). This happens since, as Proverbs 11 (28)
              affirms: “He that trusteth in his riches shall fall.”

              idololatra? Respondeo. Idololatrare est aliquid exterius indebite
              colere. Nunc autem in aliis peccatis ponitur finis in interioribus
              quasi in propria exaltatione. Sed qui ponit finem in divitiis,

              sunt idololatrae, et per se? Dico quod non, quia in moralibus
              actus seu opera iudicantur ex fine. Ille ergo per se est

              However, since in the other sins a man also puts his goal in a
              creature, chnging to it by love, why are not they termed idolatry
              too? I reply that idolatry consists in giving an illegitimate
              worship to some external object. Whereas in the other sins one’s
              end is deorientated interiorly, as though it consisted in one’s
              own exaltation. Whoever places his end in riches, on the other
              hand, fixes it in an external object as an idol. Does that mean
              that covetous persons, giving the honor due God to creatures, are
              really and essentially idolators? I hold that they are not,
              because in moral issues acts or deeds are judged by their end.
              Therefore, only those are essentially idolators who intend to
              really offer worship to a creature. A covetous person does not
              really (<i>per se</i>) intend to do this, be only happens (<i
                >per accidens</i

              It might be asked: If the inheritance is God himself who is
              indivisible and inseparable, why does he say
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >in the kingdom of Christ and of God</span
              >, dividing the two as if the inheritance could be severed? I
              reply. Our inheritance consists in the enjoyment of God. But God
              enjoys himself in a way different from that in which we shall
              enjoy him. God perfectly delights in himself since he perfectly
              knows and totally loves himself inasmuch as he is knowable and
              lovable. Not so with us, even though we shall perfectly know him
              in heaven and, as a consequence, love him. For someone may indeed
              grasp a simple reality and know the whole of it, while still not
              [knowing it] totally. For example, if the light of the sun were as
              small as a point, the human eye could perceive the whole of it,
              although not fully, whereas the eagle’s eye would grasp it
              totally.” Similarly, even if we know God perfectly in heaven and
              love him perfectly, nevertheless we do not totally comprehend him.
              Hence it seems that there is a certain imperfection and
              individuality there. Therefore he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">of Christ and of God</span>
              conjointly, as though setting one part with another part, since it
              is through Christ and none other that the inheritance is had.

              Notice that only in reference to carnal vices does he teach them
              to avoid being deceived. For from the beginning men have
              rationalized to find reasons why fornication and other venereal
              sins were not really sins so that they might indulge their
              cupidity without restraint. Hence he states vain words since words
              that claim these are not sins and do not exclude one from the
              kingdom of God and of Christ are irrational. “Beware lest any man
              cheat you by prophecy and vain deceit” (Col. 2:8).”

              He demonstrates that such men are deceivers and their words
              fallacious since, if carnal sins were not sins, they would not be
              punished by God; God is just and does not impose a penalty where
              there is no offense. But such acts are punished by God and

              He says the
              <span style="font-weight: bold">children of despair</span>
              because those who sin in this way despair of eternal life. If they
              acted this way and still hoped for eternal life, it would rather
              be presumption than hope, which is the certain expectation of
              obtaining future beatitude meritoriously. So he mentioned
              previously (Eph. 4:19): “Who, despairing, have given themselves up
              to lasciviousness unto the working of all uncleanness, unto
              covetousness.” “Let no meadow escape our riot. Let none of us go
              without his part in luxury,” and near the end of the same chapter
              “For they hoped not for the wages of justice, nor esteemed the
              honor of holy souls” (Wis. 2:8 & 22). Hence he states that
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >upon the children of despair</span
              >

              <span style="font-weight: bold">of despair</span>
              signifies those of whom we cannot be confident of as far as their
              merits are concerned.

      Should you refrain from reprimanding out of a fear of charity, namely,
      lest the sinner fall into greater evil and begin to afflict those who are
      good, you shall not sin. But if you do this from a fear that has its
      source in greed, lest the sinner grow indignant and you lose your
      benefices, then you do sin.

              also comes from sin: “The way of the wicked is darksome; they know
              not where they fall” (Prov. 4:19). But observe that be does not

              of the light,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">but the fruit of the light</span>
              is actions which are fruitful and resplendent. “And my flowers are
              the fruit of honour and riches” (Sirach 24:23). This is
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in all goodness</span>. Whence it
              must be recalled that every act of virtue is reduced to three
              relationships. For it is necessary that the agent be ordered
              within himself, to his neighbor, and to God. Within himself, that
              he be good in himself; and on this account he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in all goodness</span>. “Teach me
              goodness and discipline and knowledge” (Ps. 118:66). He must be
              ordered to his fellow man by justice; whence he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">and justice</span>. “I have done
              judgment and justice” (Ps. 118:121). While he is ordered to God
              through knowledge and a confession of the truth; so he adds
              <span style="font-weight: bold">and truth</span>. “Only love ye

              They are unfruitful since they only possess a momentary delight
              which disappears very quickly. “What fruit therefore had you then
              in those things of which you are now ashamed?” (Rom. 6:21). “Trees
              of the autumn, unfruitful, twice dead, plucked up by the roots,

              wandering stars, to whom the storm of darkness is reserved for
              ever” (Jude 1:12). Moreover, they seek out places of darkness for
              their depravity where they have the companionship of beasts. “The
              eye of the adulterer observes darkness, saying: No eye shall see
              me. And he will cover his face. He digs through houses in the
              dark, as in the day they had appointed for themselves; and they
              have not known the light” (Job. 24:15-16). With these, therefore,

              consenting to them. “What fellowship hath a holy man with a dog?”

              peccamus si non reprehendimus? Respondet Augustinus: quod enim non
              reprehendis ex timore charitatis, ne scilicet peior efficiatur et
              scandalizatus affligat bonos, non peccas. Si autem ex timore

              But clearly this is not enough; you must also reprehend them
              since, as Augustine remarks, God sometimes punishes innocent
              companions because those who are good do not reprimand the evil
              ones. “And he gave every one of them commandment concerning his
              neighbor” (Sirach 17:12). Hence he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">but rather reprove them</span>.
              “Reprove, entreat, rebuke in all patience and doctrine” (2 Tim.
              4:2). But do we always sin if we do not reprove those who sin?

              Quantum ergo ad primum, vult probare quod eos deceat delinquentes
              arguere, et hoc probat sic: quidquid ostenditur malum esse
              redarguitur, omnis enim redargutio manifestatio quaedam est; sed
              omnis manifestatio fit per lumen, vos autem estis lux; ergo decet

              arguere, quia, ut dicitur I Cor. II, 15:
              <i>spiritualis iudicat omnia, et ipse a nemine iudicatur</i>. Unde
              Glossa sic exponit: <i>omnia</i>, scilicet peccata
              <i>quae arguuntur a lumine</i>, id est, a bonis et sanctis
              hominibus, qui sunt filii lucis, <i>manifestantur</i>, scilicet
              per confessionem. Prov. XXVIII, 13:
              <i
                >qui autem confessus fuerit et reliquerit ea, misericordiam
                consequetur. Omne autem</i

              Regarding the first, he wants to prove that it is fitting for them
              to reprimand delinquents. He proves it this way: Whatever is shown
              to be evil is to be reproved, for every reproof is a certain
              manifestation; but every manifestation occurs through the light,
              and you are the light; hence it is fitting for you to reprove and
              reveal those who are evil. He expresses the major of this
              reasoning at
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >But all things that are reproved are made manifest by the
                light</span
              >. And the minor is expressed in
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >for all that is made manifest is light</span
              >. As though he said: For this reason it is fitting for you to
              reprimand them because, as 1 Corinthians 2 (15) puts it, “the
              spiritual man judgeth all things; and he himself is judged of no
              man.” Thus a Gloss offers the following interpretation:
              <span style="font-weight: bold">All</span>
              sins
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >that are reproved by the light</span
              >
              that is, by the good and holy men who are the children of the
              light,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">are made manifest</span>
              through a confession. “But he that shall confess and forsake them
              [his sins], shall obtain mercy” (Prov. 28:13).
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >For all evil that is made manifest</span
              >
              through confession,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">is light</span>, that is, is
              turned into light.

              Next, he verifies this by an authority (v. 14) which a Gloss
              interprets: In order that light might prevail he—the Holy
              Spirit—says: Rise you who sleep and arise from the dead and Christ
              shall enlighten you. But this is not customary for Paul. Hence it
              must be said that the Apostle is introducing the image found in
              Isaiah 60 (1): “Arise, be enlightened, O Jerusalem; for your light
              has come, and the glory of the Lord has risen upon you.” Thus
              <span style="font-weight: bold">wherefore it says</span>
              refers to Scripture.
              <span style="font-weight: bold">Rise</span>
              from a neglect of good works,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">you who sleep</span>. “How long
              will you sleep, O sluggard?” (Prov. 6:9). “Shall he that sleepeth
              rise again no more?” (Ps. 40:9).
              <span style="font-weight: bold">And arise from the dead</span>,
              that is, from dead or destructive actions. Christ “will cleanse
              our conscience from dead works” (Heb. 9:14). “Your dead men shall
              live, my slain shall rise again” (Is. 26:19). Rise therefore
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >and Christ shall enlighten you</span
              >. “The Lord is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear?”
              (Ps. 26:1). “Enlighten my eyes that I never sleep in death” (Ps.
              12:4).

              Yet are not we capable of rising from sin ourselves since it says:
              Rise... and Christ shall enlighten you? I reply. Two things are
              requisite for the justification of a sinner, namely, a free
              decision cooperating in the act of rising [from sin] and grace
              itself. And certainly the free decision itself is had from
              prevenient grace, while the meritorious actions that follow are
              from subsequent grace. Hence the last chapter of Lamentations (v.
              21) says: “Convert us, O Lord, to you, and we shall be converted.”

              avoids hindrances in accomplishing what he has to do. Everyone
              ought to possess this caution. “Let thy eyes look straight on and

              who do not know how to avoid the obstacles. “All the foolish of

              been set to thrust men into sin. It was not that way in the state
              of innocence when it was unnecessary for a man to abstain from
              anything which was licit, since there was nothing in his will
              driving him to sin. But now we have to redeem the time,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">because the days are evil</span>;
              we.must avoid the depravity of the days, and “beware beforehand of
              the evil day,” as Ecclesiastes 7 (15) expresses it. To do this we
              must renounce even certain things which are lawful: “All things
              are lawful for me; but all things do not edify” (I Cor. 10:23). In
              this way a person is said to redeem a grievance he caused since he
              permits something that is rightfully his to be forfeited.

              There is another interpretation of

              sometimes happens that a person lives a great part of his life in
              sin, and this is time lost. But how is he to redeem it when man is
              incapable of paying his debts? I reply that he ought to devote
              himself to good works to an even greater degree than be bad
              previously pursued sinful ones. “For the time past is sufficient
              to have fulfilled the will. of the Gentiles, for them who have
              walked in riotousness, lusts, excesses of wine, revellings,
              banquetings, and unlawful worshipping of idols” (1 Pet. 4:3). The
              first interpretation, however, is better.

              Notice that there is a difference between wisdom and prudence. For
              prudence is a certain type of wisdom, but not the whole of wisdom.
              “Wisdom is prudence to a man” (Prov. 10:23). That man is called
              wise in an absolute sense who puts everything into perspective;
              but a man is wise only in a certain respect when he puts in order
              only those things about which he is well informed. “As a wise
              architect I have laid the foundation” (1 Cor. 3:10). For the role
              of the wise man is to put things in order, as the First Book of
              the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>
              states.

              Quia sapientis est ordinare, ut dicitur I methaphysicae. Omnis
              autem ordinator respicit finem; ille ergo simpliciter est sapiens,
              qui cognoscit finem, vel qui agit propter finem universalem,
              scilicet Deum. Deut. IV, 6:
              <i>haec est enim sapientia vestra</i>, et cetera. Sapientia enim
              est divinarum rerum cognitio, ut dicit Augustinus, IV de
              Trinitate. Prudentia vero est particularis rei providentia, quando
              scilicet quis ordinat facta sua. Et ideo
              <i>sapientia est viro prudentia</i>. Propter hoc ergo dicit:
              <i>nolite fieri imprudentes, sed intelligentes</i>, et cetera.

              in operabilibus. Istud autem primum principium, per quod debemus
              iudicare omnia et regulare, est voluntas Dei; et ideo intellectus
              in moralibus et divinis debet habere pro principio voluntatem Dei,

              c. XXXII, 29: <i>utinam saperent et intelligerent</i>, et cetera.
              Hoc autem docuit dominus, Matth. c. XXVI, 42:

              Everyone who sets things in perspective considers their end; hence
              he is wise in an absolute sense who knows and acts for the
              universal end, God. “For this is your wisdom, and understanding in
              the sight of nations” (Deut. 4:6). For wisdom, as Augustine
              mentions in the Fourth Book on the Trinity, is the knowledge of
              divine realities. Prudence, on the other hand, is the directive
              care of particular things, as when a person regulates his actions.
              Thus, wisdom is prudence to man. For this reason he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >become not imprudent, but understanding what is the will of
                God</span
              >. For just as speculative reason puts whatever is to be done in
              perspective and judges it—it is necessary to have conclusions and
              to judge them by principles—so likewise in the field of
              performance. Now the first principle through which we ought to
              judge and regulate everything is the will of God. Hence the
              intellect, in moral matters and those which lead to God, must have
              the will of God for its principle. If it does, then the intellect
              becomes prudent. “O that they would be wise and would understand,
              and would provide for their last end” (Deut. 32:29). Our Lord
              taught this: “Thy will be done” (Mt. 26:42).

              The first effect of the Holy Spirit is a holy meditation, and the
              second is a spiritual exultation; from frequent meditation the
              fire of charity is enkindled in the heart. “My heart grew hot
              within me: and in my meditation a fire shall flame out” (Ps.
              38:4). And from this a spiritual joy is born within the heart;

              good works. I will sing with the spirit, I will sing also with the
              understanding” (1 Cor. 14:15). “In all wisdom teaching and
              admonishing one another in psalms, hymns, and spiritual canticles,
              singing in grace in your hearts to God” (Col. 3:16).

              Ex hoc error haereticorum confunditur dicentium quod vanum est

              hoc aliquis commoveatur ad dissolutionem, vel in gloriam inanem,
              hoc est contra intentionem Ecclesiae. Item, propter alios, quia
              per hoc rudes efficiuntur devotiores. IV Reg. III, 15:

              This refutes the error of those heretics who claim that it is
              useless to sing vocal canticles to the Lord; that only spiritual
              ones matter. In the praises of the Church there is an essential
              element to consider, what the Apostle refers to as
              <span style="font-weight: bold">in your hearts</span>. Yet there
              is another element [the external expression in song] which has a
              twofold purpose. One is that it is for us, to stimulate our minds
              to an interior devotion. If someone is rather moved to frivolity
              or vain glory by it, this is contrary to the Church’s intention.
              Its second purpose is for others, since by it the illiterate
              become more devout: “And when the minstrel played, the hand of the
              Lord came upon him” (2 Kgs. 3:15).”

              Tertius effectus est gratiarum actio: quia ex hoc quod aliquis sic
              affectus est ad Deum, recognoscit se omnia habere a Deo. Quanto
              enim aliquis magis afficitur ad Deum, et ipsum cognoscit, tanto
              videt eum maiorem et se minorem; imo prope nihil, in comparatione
              ad Deum. Iob XLII, 5:
              <i>oculus meus videt te, idcirco me reprehendo</i>, et cetera. Et
              ideo dicit <i>gratias agentes semper pro omnibus</i>, scilicet
              donis, vel prosperis, vel adversis. Ps. XXXIII, 1:
              <i>benedicam dominum in omni tempore</i>, et cetera. Quia haec
              etiam sunt nobis dona in via. Iac. I, 2:
              <i>omne gaudium existimate</i>, etc., Act. V, 41:
              <i>ibant apostoli gaudentes</i>, et cetera. I Thess. V, 18:
              <i>in omnibus gratias agite</i>.
            </td>
            <td>
              The third effect is thanksgiving because, when someone is
              influenced in these ways toward God, he recognizes that everything
              he has is from God. For the more a person is affected by his
              relation to God and knows him, the more does he see God as greater
              while he himself becomes smaller, indeed almost nothing, in
              comparison with God. “Now my eye seeth you. Therefore do I
              reprehend myself, and do penance in dust and ashes” (Job 42:5-6).
              So he declares
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >giving thanks always for all things</span
              >, for all his gifts, whether of prosperity or adversity. “I will
              bless the Lord at all times; his praise shall be always in my
              mouth” (Ps. 33:1). For adversities are also gifts to us on the
              way: “Count it all joy when you shall fall into divers
              temptations” (Jas. 1:2). And the Apostles “indeed went from the
              presence of the council, rejoicing that they were accounted worthy
              to suffer reproach for the name of Jesus” (Ac. 5:41). “In all
              things give thanks” (1 Thess. 5:18).

              faith into this grace” (Rom. 5:1-2). Yet he adds

              <span style="font-weight: bold">and the Father</span>

                22 Let women be subject to their husbands as to a lord; 23
                Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the
                head of the church. He is the saviour of his body. 24 Therefore,
                as the church is subject to Christ, so also let the wives be to
                their husbands in all things. 25 Husbands, ldve your wives, as
                Christ also loved the church and delivered himself up for it; 26
                That he might sanctify it, cleansing it by the laver of water mi
                the word of life; 27 That he might present it to himself, a
                glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing,
                but that it should be holy and without blemish. 28a So also
                ought men to love their wives as their own bodies.

              Up until now the Apostle has set down general precepts applicable
              to everyone (4:17), at this point he expresses those which pertain
              to particular persons or classes. According to the Philosopher in
              his <i>Politics</i>, a home must possess three relationships if it
              is to be complete, namely, that of the husband and wife, of the
              father and the children, and that between the master and his
              servants. Hence these three are dealt with when the Apostle
              instructs:

                >Let women be subject to their husbands</span
              >
              because “a woman, if she have superiority, is contrary to her
              husband” as Ecclesiasticus 25 (30) affirms. So he especially warns
              them about subjection. This is
              <span style="font-weight: bold">as to a lord</span>
              since the relation of a husband to his wife is, in a certain way,
              like that of a master to his servant, insofar as the latter ought
              to be governed by the commands of his master. The difference
              between these two relationships is that the master employs his
              servants in whatever is profitable to himself; but a husband
              treats his wife and children in reference to the common good. Thus
              he mentions
              <span style="font-weight: bold">as to a lord</span>; the husband
              is not really a lord, but is as a lord. “Let wives be subject to
              their husbands” (1 Pet. 3:1).

              <i>sapientis oculi in capite eius</i>, et ideo vir debet gubernare

            <td>
              The reason for this subjection is that the husband is the bead of
              the wife, and the sense of sight is localized in the head—“The
              eyes of a wise man are in his head” (Eccl. 2:14)—and hence a
              husband ought to govern his wife as her head. “The head of the
              woman is the man” (1 Cor. 11:3). Then he brings in his example
              when he says:
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >as Christ is the head of the church</span
              >. God “has made him head over all the church, which is his body”
              (Eph. 1:22-23). This is not for his own utility, but for that of
              the Church since
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >he is the saviour of his body</span
              >. “For there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby
              we must be saved” (Ac. 4:12). “Behold, God is my saviour; I will
              deal confidently and will not fear” (Is. 12:2).

                >as the church is subject to Christ</span

              walk in love, as Christ also hath loved us and hath delivered
              himself for us” (Eph. 5:1-2). The sign of Christ’s love for the
              church is that
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >he delivered himself up for it</span

              (Gal. 2:20). “He hath delivered his soul unto death” (Is. 53:12).
              And for what?
              <span style="font-weight: bold">That he might sanctify it</span>:
              Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own
              blood, suffered without the gate” (Heb. 13:12). “Sanctify them in
              truth” (Jn. 17:17); that is the effect of Christ’s death.

              for the washing of the sinner and of the unclean woman” (Zach.

              The reason is as follows. A husband and wife are somehow one;

              husband; but no one ever held his own flesh in contempt, therefore
              neither should anyone his wife. Whence he states
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >He who loves his wife loves himself</span
              >. “Therefore, now they are not two, but one flesh” (Mt. 19:6).
              just as a man sins against nature in hating himself, so does he
              who hates his wife. ‘With three things my spirit is pleased, which
              are approved before God and men: the concord of brethren, and the
              love of neighbors, and man and wife that agree well together”

              se autem debet homo diligere infra Deum; sic ergo uxorem debet
              diligere, scilicet infra Deum. Dicit autem

              esset peccatum mortale praecipere, sed praecipit eam ita ut se

              But is not this contrary to Luke 14 (26): “If any man come to me,
              and hate not his father and mother and wife and children and
              brethren and sisters, yes and his own life also, he cannot be my
              disciple?” I reply. The Apostle affirms that a man ought to love
              his wife as he does himself; but he must love himself less than
              God; hence he should also love his wife less than God. In stating
              “he who does not hate his wife,” he is not commanding that she be
              hated—which would be to command a mortal sin—but that she be loved
              as the man loves himself. Now love in a lesser degree is like a
              certain hatred in comparison with whatever is loved most or to a
              greater degree, in this case, God.

              carne separari. Rom. VII, 24:

              >

              affligit quod diligit, sed sancti affligunt carnem suam in hoc
              mundo. I Cor. IX, 27: <i>castigo corpus meum</i>, et cetera.

              Likewise,

              he never wants nor desires to be separated from it. Yet the saints
              wanted to be separated from the flesh. “Unhappy man that I am, who
              shall deliver me from the body of this death?” (Rom. 7:24),
              “having a desire to be dissolved and to be with Chrisf’ (Phil.
              1:23). Besides, nobody afflicts what he loves, but the saints
              punished their flesh while they were in this world. “I chastise my
              body and bring it into subjection” (1 Cor. 9:27). Moreover, some
              people even kill themselves, as is frequently heard of. Judas did
              it.

              I reply. The flesh, when considered in itself, is not held in
              contempt, but everyone naturally wants it to exist and nourishes
              it for this end. On the other hand ‘ the flesh can be considered
              as an obstacle to what we will, and thus, through circumstance
              (per accidens), it can be detested in a certain way. For
              everything that we will is either good or evil. If good, it may be
              the ultimate end, eternal life, from which we are held back by the
              flesh. “While we are in the body we are absent from the Lord” (2
              Cor. 5:6). And since we naturally desire our fulfillment and
              well-being—nor can we enjoy these while we are in the flesh—we
              will to discard it, not as an evil held in contempt, but as a good
              we love less than the greater good it impedes. The authoritative
              texts quoted above, and others like them, are to be explained in
              this way.

              Or, we may will a good that is not the end, but disposes for the
              end; for example, virtuous habits. But this type of good is
              opposed by the immoral tendencies of the flesh. On this account do
              the saints discipline and punish their flesh in order that it
              might submit to the spirit for the curbing of sensual desires.
              For, in desiring such, the flesh blocks our acquisition of the
              virtues which dispose us for the ultimate good. Therefore, whoever
              punishes his flesh that it might submit to his spirit does not
              hate it, but rather obtains its own good which is that it be
              subject to the spirit-just as the good of man is to be subject to
              God: “it is good for me to adhere to my God” (Ps. 72:28). “I
              chastise my body...” and similar passages are to be understood in
              this way. This would not have been necessary in the state of
              innocence as long as man was subject to God, and the flesh totally
              submissive to the spirit; the gift of original justice consisted
              precisely in this mutual submission.

              It should be noted that in the above mentioned authority a
              threefold union of a man and wife is designated. The first union
              is through the devotion of their love, for it is strong enough in
              each that they both left their fathers behind. “So a man loves his
              wife better than his father or mother. Many have lost their heads
              completely for their wives” (3 Esd. 4:25-26), and much more
              concerning this is stated there [in 3 Esd. 4]. But this is
              natural, for natural desires fit in harmoniously with actions that
              must be performed. It is evident that a desire exists in all
              higher agents that they administer to, and communicate with, lower
              agents. Thus a natural love for the lower is present in them. Now
              a man is an inferior in relation to his father and mother, he is
              not higher than they; hence he is naturally more drawn towards his
              wife and children, to whom he is superior, than to his parents.
              And also because his wife is intimately united to him in the act
              of procreation.

              He goes on to interpret this mystically, and he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold">This is a great sacrament</span>,
              it is the symbol of a sacred reality, namely, the union of Christ
              and the Church. “I will not hide from you the mysteries of God”
              (Wis. 6:24).

              Notandum est hic, quod quatuor sacramenta dicuntur magna, scilicet
              Baptismus ratione effectus, quia delet culpam et aperit ianuam
              Paradisi; confirmatio ratione ministri, quia solum a pontificibus
              et non ab aliis confertur; Eucharistia ratione continentiae, quia
              totum Christum continet; item matrimonium ratione significationis,
              quia significat coniunctionem Christi et Ecclesiae. Et ideo si
              mystice exponatur, debet sic exponi littera praecedens: propter
              hoc relinquet homo, scilicet Christus, patrem et matrem. Reliquit,
              inquam, patrem, inquantum est missus in mundum et incarnatus. Io.
              XVI, v. 28:
              <i>exivi a patre, et veni in mundum</i>, et cetera. Et matrem,
              scilicet synagogam. Ier. XII, 7:
              <i>reliqui domum meam, et dimisi haereditatem meam</i>, et cetera.
              Et adhaerebit uxori suae, Ecclesiae. Matth. ult.:
              <i>ecce vobiscum sum omnibus diebus</i>, et cetera.

              Notice here that four Sacraments are termed great. Baptism by
              reason of its effect, since it blots out sin and opens the gate of
              paradise; Confirmation by reason of its minister, it is conferred
              only by bishops and not by others; the Eucharist because of what
              it contains, the Whole Christ; and Matrimony by reason of its
              signification, for it symbolizes the union of Christ and the
              Church. If, therefore, the text is mystically interpreted, the
              preceding passage should be explained as follows:
              <span style="font-weight: bold">For this cause shall a man</span>,
              namely, Christ,
              <span style="font-weight: bold">leave his father and mother</span
              >. I say <span style="font-weight: bold">leave his father</span>,
              because he was sent into the world and became incarnate—“I came
              forth from the Father and am come into the world” (Jn. 16:28)—
              <span style="font-weight: bold">and his mother</span>
              who was the synagogue—“I have forsaken my house, I have left my
              inheritance, I have given my dear soul into the hand of her
              enemies” (Jer. 12:7).
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >And he shall cleave to his wife</span
              >, the Church. “Behold, I am with you all days, even to the
              consummation of the world” (Mt. 28:20).

              Consequenter argumentatur secundum sensum litteralem exponendo
              praedictum exemplum. Quaedam enim sunt in sacra Scriptura veteris
              testamenti, quae tantum dicuntur de Christo, sicut illud Ps. XXI,
              17:
              <i>foderunt manus meas</i>, etc.; et illud Is. VII, 14:
              <i>ecce virgo concipiet</i>, et cetera. Quaedam vero de Christo et
              aliis exponi possunt, sed de Christo principaliter, de aliis vero
              in figura Christi, sicut praedictum exemplum.

            <td>
              Next, the point is argued by interpreting the above example
              according to its literal meaning. For there are certain passages
              in the Old Testament which can be said only of Christ. For
              instance, Psalm 21 (17): “They have dug my hands and feet: they
              have numbered all my bones”; or Isaias 7 (14): “Behold, a virgin
              shall conceive, and bear a son; and his name shall be called
              Emmanuel.” Other passages, however, can be explained as referring
              to Christ and others; to Christ principally, and to others as they
              were types of Christ. The above example (Gen. 2:24) is of this
              category.

              Et ideo primo exponendum est de Christo et postea de aliis. Et
              ideo dicit
              <i>verumtamen et vos singuli, unusquisque uxorem suam diligat</i>,
              quasi dicat: de Christo dicitur principaliter et si non
              singulariter, quia exponendum et implendum est in aliis in figura
              Christi. Dicit autem <i>sicut semetipsum</i>, quia sicut
              unusquisque se diligit in ordine ad Deum, ita debet uxorem
              diligere, non inquantum trahit ad peccatum. Lc. XIV, 26:
              <i
                >si quis venit ad me, et non odit patrem et matrem, et uxorem
                suam</i
              >, etc., sequitur: <i>non potest meus esse discipulus</i>. Sed
              quid de uxore? <i>Uxor autem virum suum timeat</i>, scilicet
              timore reverentiae et subiectionis, quia debet ei esse subiecta.

              Thus it must first be interpreted in reference to Christ, and
              afterwards concerning others. Hence he says
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >Nevertheless, let every one of you in particular love his
                wife</span
              >, as though he asserted: The above example is principally related
              of Christ, but not only about him since it must be interpreted and
              fulfilled in other persons as types of Christ.” He states
              <span style="font-weight: bold">as himself</span>
              because, just as everyone loves himself in relation to God, so he
              ought to love his wife in this way, and not inasmuch as she draws
              him into sin. “If any man come to me, and hate not his father and
              mother and wife... he cannot be my disciple” (Lk. 14:26). But what
              about the wife?
              <span style="font-weight: bold"
                >And let the wife fear her husband</span
              >, with the fear of reverence and submission since she must be
              subject to him.
