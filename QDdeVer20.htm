              1. Knowledge is a perfection of the one who knows. But every
              perfection is more noble than the subject of perfectibility.
              Therefore, if Christ knows by reason of some created knowledge,
              something created will be more noble than the soul of Christ. But
              this seems unfitting.

              2. Activity is not attributed to the nature, but to the

              and individuals. But, for the person of Christ to understand,
              uncreated knowledge is sufficient. Therefore, it is superfluous to
              ascribe created knowledge to Christ.

              3. The more noble a thing is, the more it is like God. But the
              soul of Christ is more noble than physical heat. Therefore, since
              physical heat acts without a medium, and in this is like God, who
              acts without a medium, it seems that, with much greater reason,
              the soul of Christ should understand without the mediation of any
              created knowledge.

              cognoscitiva non solum est receptio, sed iudicium de receptis.
              Quamvis autem receptio sit ab exteriori, iudicium tamen ab

              4. It was said that the activity of heat proceeds from within, but
              the activity of knowledge, from without, since it is according to
              the movement from things to the soul. Hence, they are not
              alike.—On the contrary, in the activity of knowing there is not
              only reception, but also judgment about the things received. And,
              although reception is from without, judgment proceeds from within.
              Therefore, the activity of knowledge is not entirely from without.

              5. Christ, the Son of God, did not assume any imperfection unless
              it aided our redemption. But imperfection of knowledge does not
              aid our redemption. Therefore, He did not assume imperfection of
              knowledge. But all created knowledge is imperfect in some degree
              by the very fact that it is created. Therefore, He did not assume
              created knowledge.

              6. Anyone who is always engaged in the act of thinking according
              to the most perfect knowledge does not need any less perfect
              knowledge, because he would never use it, and so would have it to
              no purpose. But Christ is always engaged in the act of thinking
              according to the most perfect knowledge, namely, uncreated
              knowledge. Therefore, we should not ascribe another, that is,
              created knowledge to Him.

              knowledge. Therefore, He did not become wise by means of created
              knowledge.

              8. According to the first Epistle to the Corinthians (13:10):
              “When that which is perfect is come, that which is in part shall
              be put away.” But created knowledge, in comparison with uncreated
              knowledge, is more imperfect than vision in the mirror [of
              creatures], in comparison with vision of [God’s] essence.
              Therefore, if the vision of faith is removed because of its
              imperfection when vision of [God’s] essence arrives, with much
              greater reason created knowledge will be excluded from Christ in
              whom there was uncreated knowledge.

              9. The Word united to His soul is much more intimate to it than
              our understanding is to our soul, since the Word is united to it
              not only through its essence, presence, and power, as in other
              souls, and through grace, as in the just, but also in unity of
              person. But our soul understands through its intellective power.
              Therefore, Christ’s soul could be wise with the wisdom of the
              Word, and so it did not need created knowledge.

              10. If Christ had created knowledge, it was not given to Him
              except for His perfection. But the soul of Christ, united to the
              Word and having created knowledge, is not more noble that if it
              were united to the Word alone without created knowledge. For
              something created added to God does not increase His goodness,
              just as a point added to a fine does not make it longer.
              Therefore, we should not ascribe created knowledge to Christ.

              say that there are two kinds of knowledge: created and uncreated.
              But some heretics have said that there is only uncreated knowledge
              in Christ.

              To see the source of this error we must bear in mind that some3
              have understood that the union of the divine and human natures
              takes place in the way in which the soul is united to the body.
              Thus, as the soul is the form of the body, so in Christ the
              divinity would be the form of the humanity. Therefore, some have
              thought that if the Word were united to Christ’s body as the soul
              is to our body, it could give life to Him just as our soul gives
              life to our body. Hence, they said that there were only two
              substances in Christ, body and divinity, and the latter in place
              of the soul gave life to the body. This was the error of Eunomius
              and his followers.

              However, some, perceiving that it would be unworthy for the
              divinity to be united to the body as that which gives it life,
              said that Christ had a soul which gives life and sensation, that
              is to say, a vegetative and a sensitive soul, but did not have an
              intellectual soul. They said that in Christ the Word Himself took
              the place of the intellectual soul. This was the error of
              Apollinaris and his followers. And, granted this error, it is
              plain that there is only uncreated knowledge in Christ.

              But this manner of understanding the union in Christ leads one to
              believe that the divine and human natures are combined into a
              single nature, just as the union of body and soul results in not
              only one substantial subject but also one nature. Furthermore, it
              follows from this that the true reality of each nature is
              destroyed. For, since it is essential to the divine nature to have
              its being separate from all things, if we make it the act of any
              body, it loses its proper nature. In the same way, if the soul or
              the understanding or anything integral to human nature is taken
              away from it, there will no longer remain the true reality of the
              specific nature, since, as is said in the
              <i>Metaphysics</i>, the specific natures are similar to numbers,
              in which the species of the number is changed when unity is added
              or subtracted. Therefore, according to the foregoing error, Christ
              was neither true God nor true man.

              Therefore, for Christ to be true God and true man, He must have
              within him all that pertains to the divine nature, and, also, as a
              distinct nature in the same person, all that constitutes the
              specific nature of man. And for him to be not only a true man, but
              a perfect man, he must have everything which we need to be
              perfect, such as habits of the sciences and of the virtues.
              However, just as divinity cannot be an act of a body, in such a
              way that by it the body formally has life, or becomes a rational
              creature, so also it cannot be the act of the rational soul, so
              that by it the soul formally has knowledge or virtue in the way in
              which we have them through a habit of virtue or knowledge.
              Therefore, we must hold that there is created knowledge and virtue

              2. Although activity is ascribed to the substantial subject as
              agent, it is ascribed to the nature as the source of activity. And
              activity does not receive its specification from the agent but
              from the source of the activity. Hence, there can be specifically
              different activities in one agent because of the diversity of the
              principles of operation, as sight and hearing in man. Therefore,
              although in Christ there is only one substantial subject, in Him
              there are two natures and, so, two activities. Furthermore, Christ
              must have the perfection of both activities. Thus, He has not only
              uncreated knowledge, which is sufficient for the activity of the
              uncreated nature, but also created knowledge, which is needed for
              the perfect activity of the created nature.

              Word, or according to its own nature. But, in so far as it is
              united to the Word, it does not befit it to see the Word through
              the medium of a habit, since it is not united to the Word through
              the medium of a habit. Likewise, this does not befit it by reason
              of its proper nature, for, just as every whole is greater than the
              part, so every whole is better and more perfect than any of its
              parts. But a part of the soul, the agent intellect, carries on its
              activity without the mediation of a habit, and this seems to
              pertain to the nobility of the agent intellect. So, with much
              greater reason, the whole soul engages in activity without the
              mediation of a habit. Therefore, the soul of Christ does not in

              A power needs something for its activity because of its nature,
              for example, when the activity is such that it is beyond the
              capacity and condition of the nature. In this way, to love God
              with the love of fellowship, as a sharer in His inheritance, is
              beyond the condition of human nature. Hence, our affective power
              needs the habit of charity for this activity. A power needs
              something by reason of the power itself, however, when it is
              ordained to objects of such a nature that it can in no wise of
              itself perfectly possess their act. Thus, the power of sight is
              ordained to knowledge of all colors, but it was not possible for
              all colors actually to exist in the organ of sight. Therefore,
              things were ordained differently, namely, that the power of sight
              could be given the likeness of any color and so proceed to the act
              of sight.

              naturae, hoc multo excellentius animae Christi fuit collatum ex
              plenitudine gratiae, ut omnium rerum species inditas in se haberet
              a sui creatione. Sed mediantibus his speciebus non cognoscebat

              By reason of the power, however, the intellect of the human soul
              is in potency to all things. However, it is impossible for any
              created being to be perfectly the act and likeness of all beings,
              for, thus, it would possess the nature of being in an infinite
              manner. Hence, only God can understand all things by Himself and
              without any addition. But every created intellect understands
              through some species given it, either acquired by it, as happens
              with us, or given in creation or infused, as in the angels. And
              what belongs to angels by reason of the state of their nature,
              that is to say, to have the species of all things infused in them
              from their creation, was conferred on the soul of Christ in a much
              more excellent way by reason of the fullness of grace. But through
              the mediation of these species it did not know the Word, but only
              created things.

              intelligible, as happens in us with the light of the agent
              intellect, but as that through which the created understanding
              would be elevated to that which is above it. But, for knowledge of
              other creatures, it had the habit which is the aggregate of the
              species ordained to knowledge.

              3. According to Dionysius, the situation is not the same in
              participations and participants, for, the more simple
              participations are, the more noble they are, as to exist than to
              live, and to live than to understand, if by our understanding we
              separate existence and life in order to compare them. But, among
              participants, the more composed a thing is (not, of course, with
              material composition, but by reason of reception of more
              participations), the more noble it is, because it is like God in
              so many more things. This kind of assimilation can come only from
              something received from God. Hence, also, the soul which besides
              its nature has habits perfecting it is more noble.

              immateriality.” And he calls essential that which never leaves the

              5. The union in Christ does not terminate in activity but in
              existence. Therefore, in so far as the soul is united to the Word,
              speaking of what is immediate, it is not entitled to sight of the
              Word or any other activity, but to this only, namely, existence in
              the person of the Word. However, its activities belong to it by
              reason of its powers and its nature. And, although the whole soul
              is more perfect than the agent intellect, no other power of the
              soul is more noble than the agent intellect. Hence, the fact that
              the agent intellect does not need a habit does not mean that the
              possible intellect must not need one. For the agent intellect
              needs no habit for its activity, because it does not receive
              anything from intelligible things, but gives its own form to them
              by making them actually intelligible. The possible intellect,
              however, has just the opposite relation to intelligible things.

              in themselves is in part, as we read in that same passage.
              Therefore, when the perfect knowledge of glory comes, our present
              knowledge will be put away, as the Apostle expressly seems to
              mean. But, in Christ, from the first moment of His conception
              there was the knowledge of glory, that is to say, that knowledge
              by which He knew things in the Word. Therefore, He had no other
              knowledge of things.

              sees by inquiry and dependence on phantasms.—On the contrary, this
              mode is of the essence of knowledge. And, if something essential
              is taken away, the substance, of the thing cannot remain.
              Therefore, if that mode leaves, the knowledge cannot remain in its
              substance.

              proceed by making comparisons. Therefore, knowledge like this can

              5. Knowledge is ascribed to the soul of Christ because of its
              perfection. But, since the soul of Christ sees things in the Word
              and sees the Word itself, it is not more or less perfect whether
              it has other knowledge or not. Therefore, we should not ascribe
              any other knowledge to Him. I prove the minor premise from
              Augustine, who says: “Unhappy the man who knows all those things
              [creatures], and does not know You. Blessed the man who knows You,
              even if he does not know those things. However, one who knows both
              You and them is not more blessed because of them, but only blessed
              because of You.”

              Christus fuit Angelis perfectior, ut probat apostolus, Hebr., I, 4

              1. Christ was more perfect than the angels, as the Apostle proves
              (Heb. 1:4 ff.). But, besides knowledge of things which they have
              in the Word, angels have knowledge of things in their own nature,
              as is clear from Augustine. Therefore, with much greater reason
              the soul of Christ knew things in their own nature besides knowing
              them in the Word.

              this kind of knowledge of things.

              Responsio. Dicendum, quod, sicut prius dictum est, perfectio
              supernaturaliter conveniens Christo non excludit naturalem eius
              perfectionem, sicut vita increata non excludit animam
              vivificantem. Cognitio autem qua anima Christi cognoscit verbum et
              res in verbo, est supernaturalis, ut dictum est, art. praeced.,
              unde per hoc non excluditur quin anima Christi habeat omnem
              perfectionem naturalem. Cuiuslibet autem existentis in potentia
              perfectio naturalis est ut in actum educatur. Intellectus autem
              possibilis naturaliter est in potentia ad intelligibilia: unde
              antequam in actum reducatur, est imperfectus; perficitur autem cum
              in actum reducitur, ut rerum notitiam habeat. Et ideo quidam
              philosophi attendentes perfectionem naturalem hominis, dixerunt
              ultimam felicitatem hominis in hoc consistere quod in anima
              hominis describatur ordo totius universi.
            </td>
            <td>
              As we said before, the perfection which belongs to Christ
              supernaturally does not exclude His natural perfection, just as
              uncreated life does not exclude a soul which gives life. But the
              knowledge by which the soul of Christ knows the Word and things in
              the Word is supernatural, as has been said. Hence, this does not
              prevent the soul of Christ from having every natural perfection.
              However, to be reduced to act is the natural perfection of
              anything which is existing in potency. But the possible intellect
              is naturally in potency to intelligible things. Consequently,
              before it is reduced to act, it is imperfect, and it is made
              perfect when it is reduced to act and so has knowledge of things.
              Therefore, some philosophers,” looking at man’s natural
              perfection, have said that the ultimate happiness of man consists
              in the delineation of the order of the whole universe in the soul
              of man.

              Ad primum igitur dicendum, quod circa scientiam est duplex opinio.
              Una quod scientia hic acquisita remaneat quantum ad essentiam

              conversionem ad phantasmata: quod quidem Christo proprium est, ut
              scilicet utrumque hunc modum habeat, cui competit esse
              comprehensorem et viatorem simul.<br />
              Alia vero opinio est, quod etiam secundum essentiam habitus
              scientia hic acquisita evacuetur: et secundum hanc (quamvis non
              credam eam esse veram) potest responderi, quod anima Christi non
              habuit scientiam a sensibus acquisitam, sed infusam, qualem Angeli
              habent per species concreatas; et talem scientiam constat etiam in
              Angelis remanere cum gloriae visione.
            </td>

            <td>
              1. There are two opinions about knowledge. One says that science
              acquired here remains as far as the essence of the habit is
              concerned, but the mode in which we use science in this life is
              taken away. The subsumption in the [second] difficulty proceeds
              according to this opinion. Nevertheless, we must add that, since
              Christ was a wayfarer and a possessor of the term, He had both
              modes of thinking, one in which He was like the angels, in that He
              knew things without discursive thought, and the other through
              which He knew by turning to phantasms. And it is proper to Christ
              to have both modes of knowledge, for it belongs to Him
              simultaneously to be a wayfarer and possessor of the term.<br />
              The other opinion, however, holds that knowledge acquired here
              will be taken away in so far as the essence of the habit is
              concerned. According to this (although I do not believe it is
              true), one could answer that the soul of Christ did not have
              knowledge acquired from the senses but infused knowledge such as
              the angels have through species created with them. It is clear
              that such knowledge remains in angels along with the vision of
              glory.

              Ad secundum dicendum, quod modus iste cognoscendi non est
              essentialis scientiae ex parte sui, sed ex parte subiecti, cui
              secundum statum viae talis modus intelligendi competit. Hoc autem
              per se solum essentiale est scientiae secundum seipsam, ut per eam
              scibilia cognoscantur. Et ideo quando variatur status subiecti,

              2. This mode of knowing is not essential because of itself, but by
              reason of its subject, for which this is the normal mode of
              understanding according to the state of this life. But all that is
              essential to knowledge in itself is that through it things which
              can be known are known. Therefore, when the condition of the
              subject is changed, the mode of knowing is changed, although the
              habit of knowledge is not.

              Ad tertium dicendum, quod unus actus potest dici similis alteri
              dupliciter. Uno modo quantum ad speciem actus, quam trahit a
              materia circa quam est. Et sic habitus acquisitus semper reddit
              actum similem illi actui a quo generatus est; sicut fortia
              faciendo efficitur aliquis fortis, et fortis effectus fortia
              facit. Alio modo quantum ad modum qui sequitur dispositionem
              subiecti: et sic non oportet actus praedictos esse similes.
              Constat enim quod actus ex quibus fortitudo politica acquiritur,
              sunt actus cum tristitia et sine delectatione effecti; actus autem
              qui sequuntur habitum, sunt faciliores, et cum delectatione, vel
              saltem sine tristitia. Ita etiam videmus in scientia, quod homo
              considerando aliqua acquirit scientiam illorum, et sciens illa
              potest eadem considerare, tamen alio modo quam ante, quia iam non
              inquirit, sed contemplatur quod prius inquisiverat. Et sic etiam
              nihil prohibet, actus qui redduntur ab habitibus in statu gloriae,
              habere alium modum.
            </td>
            <td>
              3. An act can be like another act in two ways. In one way, they
              are alike in the species of the act which it derives from the
              matter it concerns. According to this, an acquired habit always
              produces an act similar to the act by which it was generated.
              Thus, one becomes brave by doing brave deeds, and, when he has
              become brave, does brave deeds. In the other way, they are alike
              according to the mode which follows the disposition of the
              subject. And, according to this, it is not necessary for the acts
              in question to be alike. For it is clear that the acts by which we
              acquire political bravery are performed with sadness and without
              pleasure. But acts which follow a habit are rather easy and are
              accompanied by pleasure, or at least are without sadness. Hence,
              in knowledge we see that man acquires knowledge of things by
              considering some things, and can consider these same things once
              he knows them. Nevertheless, he does this in a different way than
              he did before, for he no longer investigates but looks at what he
              has investigated. Thus, there is nothing to prevent acts which are
              produced by habits in the state of glory from having a different
              mode.

              that it sees in the Word, it can form for itself likenesses of the
              things it sees, as one who sees something in a mirror sees the
              thing through the form of the mirror. We have discussed this more

              the soul of Christ received knowledge of an infinite multitude of

              is more like the manner in which effects are in a cause and
              conclusions in a principle, than like the manner in which forms
              are in a mirror. Therefore, one who sees the Word does not have to
              see everything which the Word sees in Himself, as some9 have said,
              using the example of forms which are seen in a mirror when one
              sees the mirror. For the Word has comprehensive knowledge of
              Himself, so that, seeing Himself, He knows all the things which
              are in Him virtually and in unity.

              The reason for this is that there is a double relation of God to
              creatures, since He is the principle and end of all things. We
              have one of these in so far as all things proceed from God into
              being, and the other in so far as they are ordained to God as to
              their end. Some, as the irrational creatures, are thus ordained
              only by assimilation; others, however, are thus ordained both by
              assimilation and also by attaining the divine essence itself. For
              it is innate in every creature proceeding from God to strive for
              the good by its activity. But a creature is assimilated to God in
              attaining any good whatsoever. But, beyond this, rational
              creatures by their activity can attain to knowledge and love of
              God. Consequently, they, beyond other creatures, have a capacity
              for beatitude.

              And, just as creatures would be imperfect if they proceeded from

              in God and from God. But Christ stands above every creature also
              according to the gifts of grace, since “of his fullness we all
              have received, and grace for grace” (John 1:16). Therefore, He

              1. The common answer to this objection is that God knows some
              things with the knowledge of vision, namely, present, past, and
              future things. And granted that the world has a beginning and an
              end, these are not infinite. We say that God sees only these
              because vision concerns things which exist in themselves outside
              the understanding of the one who sees them. However, He knows some
              things with the knowledge of simple intelligence, namely, those
              which He can make, but which will never exist. These things are
              infinite. And we say that God understands these things by means of
              the representation which His understanding can use to form
              quiddities of things which do not exist outside of Him.
              Accordingly, the soul of Christ sees all things, present, past,
              and future, in the Word; nevertheless, it does not see everything
              which God can make, and thus it does not follow that it knows an
              infinite multitude of things.

              Sed ista responsio non solvit vim rationis. Supposito enim quod

              posset), constat quod infiniti homines essent futuri, et omnes
              Deus cognosceret scientia visionis. Unde si anima Christi sciret
              omnia quae Deus scit scientia visionis, sequeretur quod sciret
              infinita quamvis non cognosceret omnia quae Deus facere potest:
              specierum finitarum potest facere infinitas alias species, et in

              But that answer does not meet the force of the difficulty. For, if
              we grant that generation might continue to infinity in the future,
              as God could so make it, it is evident that there would be an
              infinite multitude of men, and God would know them all by
              knowledge of vision. Hence, if the soul of Christ knew everything
              that God knows with the knowledge of vision, it would follow that
              it would know an infinite multitude of things, although it would
              not know everything which God can do. For, besides an infinite
              multitude of individuals of these finite species, God can make an
              infinite multitude of different species and an infinite multitude
              of individuals in each species, as is clear especially in the
              ratios of numbers.

              For, if we take the individuals in one species of ratio, they will

              is the ratio of two to one, four to two, six to three, and so on
              to infinity. And again, besides the ratio of doubling, there is
              another species, that of triple, and also of quadruple, and
              quintuple, and so on to infinity. Yet each of these contains
              potentially an infinite multitude of individuals. Consequently, if
              generation were to continue to infinity according to these species
              which are now finite, God could still make more, because He could
              make new species, and this to infinity. It is clear from this that
              it does not mean the same thing to say that the soul of Christ
              knows an infinite multitude of things and that it knows all that

              quia cognoscit omnia quae potest facere, et potest in infinitum
              novas species facere. Et praeter hoc, cum aliquid secundum hoc
              agat quod est actu, sicut esse Dei est infinitum, ita et eius

              Therefore, in so far as a thing is infinite, it is related to the
              infinite by its activity. For that which is infinite both because
              of its existence and its immateriality, namely God, is related to
              infinity through its operation by reason both of its matter, or
              quantity, and of its specific or generic nature. Consequently, God
              can know an infinite multitude of individuals and an infinite
              multitude of species because He knows all that He can do, and He
              can make new species to infinity. Besides this, since a thing acts
              in so far as it is in act, just as God’s being is infinite, so
              also His activity is infinitely efficacious.

              infinite according to species. This is evident in sight, which is
              a material power and, accordingly, cannot know any species
              whatever, but a determined species, color. Nor can it know an
              infinite number of things except successively. For, since it is

              are numerically infinite according to continuous or discrete
              quantity, and this is material infinity. It does this in the way
              in which they are infinite, that is to say, materially, numbering
              part after part. Therefore, it can never arrive at knowledge of an
              infinite number of individuals. And since our understanding in the
              present state receives from sense, neither can it know an infinite
              number of things in this way.

              There have been different opinions on this matter. For some have
              said that not only the soul of Christ, but every soul, sees in the
              Word whatever can be seen there. This includes not only what is,
              will be, or has been, but whatever God can make. But these people
              were mistaken in this because they thought the mode of seeing
              things in the Word was like the mode of seeing things in a
              material mirror, in which images of things are reflected as many
              and diverse. But the natures of things exist in God in unity and
              simplicity, as Dionysius says. However, if they existed there as
              many and diverse, then everything that could be known in God would
              be known once He was seen. Thus, all who saw God through His
              essence would see everything that God can make, since all these
              things could be known in God.

              But, since it does not seem fitting to ascribe an infinite
              activity to a finite creature, and since to see all that God can
              make requires an infinite activity, others have said that the soul
              of Christ does not see all the things which God can make in actual
              knowledge, but still does see them in habitual knowledge. For it
              knows the Word so perfectly that by turning to the Word it
              receives in the Word knowledge of whatever it wants to know,
              although it does not always actually consider everything that it
              can know in the Word. But this does not seem to be true. For the
              soul of Christ, and any of the blessed, in so far as they have the
              beatific vision, by which they see the Word and things in the
              Word, do not have succession in their acts of understanding. For,
              according to Augustine: “Thoughts will not come and go in heaven.”
              Hence, we must say that in the Word the soul of Christ sees in
              actual knowledge all that it sees there in habitual knowledge.
              This agrees with what the Philosopher says, when he says that
              happiness is had according to act, and not only according to
              habit. Furthermore, as it is not fitting to say that there is a
              created activity which extends to all that God can make, so it is
              also not fitting to say that there is a created habit with an
              ordination to these same things.

              Therefore, we must say with others that the soul of Christ does
              not know all that God can make. The reason for this is that two
              elements must be considered in knowledge: that which is known and
              the manner in which it is known. It sometimes happens that some
              agree in one of these who differ in the other, as when one and the
              same thing is known by different subjects, less by one and more by
              the other. That which in itself is presented to be known pertains
              to that which is known; that, however, which is known in something
              else pertains to the manner of knowing of that in which it is
              known. Thus, if one knows some principle and in it acquires
              knowledge of some conclusions, the knowledge of those conclusions
              depends on the manner of knowing the principle.

              For, the more perfectly one knows a principle, the more

              principle is, the substance of that principle always remains known
              to him. Therefore, his knowledge of it does not involve any
              determinate way of knowing, as the knowledge of conclusions which
              are known in the principle involves a determinate way of knowing.
              Hence it is that all who are presented with one principle know the
              substance of the principle but do not know the same conclusions or

              6. We have to answer this difficulty in the way in which we
              answered the difficulties about predestination. For, although it
              is possible for one who is predestined to be damned, still, as
              soon as we say he is damned, we say that he was not predestined,
              since these two, to be predestined and to be damned, cannot stand
              together. Similarly, I say that when the soul of Christ knows
              everything which God foresees that He will do, as soon as it is
              true that God does something else, it is true that God foresaw
              that He would do it, and the soul of Christ knew it. Thus, it is
              not necessary to say that there is ignorance of anything in the
              soul of Christ, or that He learned anything anew.

              soul of Christ did not have knowledge of these things through that
              mode of knowledge, but knew them in the Word. It did not know them
              by the knowledge of prophecy, since prophecy is an imperfect
              participation of that sight by which things are seen in the Word.
              And, since this knowledge was perfect in Christ, the imperfection
              of prophecy had no place there.

              Patet etiam quod Christus hanc scientiam habuit pleniorem quam
              Adam: quia Adam per hanc scientiam non cognoscebat substantias
              separatas creatas, anima vero Christi cognoscebat: ad hoc enim se
              extendit naturalis cognitio animae separatae, non autem coniunctae

              It is also clear that Christ had this knowledge more fully than
              Adam, since through this knowledge Adam did not know created
              separated substances, and the soul of Christ did. For the natural
              knowledge of the separated soul extends to this, although the
              knowledge of the soul joined to a corruptible body does not.

              1. The capacity of the human soul extends to a determined class of

              Ad secundum dicendum, quod intellectus possibilis est in potentia
              ad omnia intelligibilia recipienda, quae possunt fieri per
              intellectum agentem, de quo etiam philosophus dicit quod
              intellectus agens est quo est omnia facere. Haec autem sunt quae a
              phantasmatibus abstrahuntur, et in quorum cognitionem devenire
              possumus per principia naturaliter cognita. Et ideo ad haec tantum
              intellectus possibilis est in potentia naturali. Horum autem
              omnium secundum hanc scientiam Christus notitiam habuit; unde in
              eius intellectu nulla imperfectio fuit.

              2. The possible intellect is in potency to receive all
              intelligible things which can become such through the agent
              intellect. Of this the Philosopher says that the agent intellect
              is that “by which one makes all things [intelligible].” But these
              are the things which are abstracted from phantasms and which we
              can come to know through naturally known principles. Therefore,
              the possible intellect is in natural potency only to these things.
              But Christ knew all these through this knowledge. Hence, there was
              no imperfection in His understanding.

              Ad tertium dicendum, quod pro tanto Christus etiam in hac scientia
              quantum ad habitum proficere non potuit, quia talis scientia
              secundum rationem sui generis ad plura se extendere non potest
              quam Christus per eam sciret; dicitur tamen in Evangelio sapientia
              profecisse quantum ad experientiam eorum quae habitu sciebat.

              3. For that matter, even in this knowledge Christ could not
              advance in so far as the habit is concerned, since such knowledge
              by the nature of its genus cannot extend to more things than
              Christ knew through it. But in the Gospel it is said that He
              “advanced in wisdom” with reference to experience of those things
              which He knew in the habit.
