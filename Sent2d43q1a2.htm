            (person) is distinguished from the incontinent, where the first has
            the habit to sin through choice, while the second has it through

            ><i>Response:</i> As was previously said, the sin against the Holy
            Spirit is due to a definite malice, intention or choice, which
            amount to the same thing. The fact that someone chooses a sinful act
            by way of definite deliberation, and not by some impulse of passion,
            can occur in two ways. First, by way of one's position (or
            disposition) in choosing by reason of which one is inclined to a
            particular kind of act as it is similar (in kind) to oneself (or
            rather to one's disposition). For every person having a habit,
            either of sin or of virtue, is inclined to actions similar to these
            habits, the reason being that the natural appetite of a thing is for
            that which is similar to (the appetite). In this way, whatever has
            the habit of intemperance, chooses intemperate activity, and
            likewise with the other sins. Secondly, a sin is chosen through
            definite deliberation when the will rejects that by which one could
            be withdrawn from sin. For example, someone abstains from sin on
            account of the expectation of future reward. Therefore, if someone
            voluntarily throws off the hope of future reward, or something of
            this kind, he withdraws (from this future reward) on account of sin.
            He chooses that which will be pleasing to him according to the
            flesh, as if it were good <i>per se</i>. And in this way, he will
            sin by reason of definite malice.</font

            >By taking the first way of sin through choice, something is not
            denominated as a particular kind of sin, but rather as a
            circumstance of sin, namely as an act proceeding from a habit, which
            happens in every kind of sin. But the second way of sin through
            choice is denominated as a particular sin. For a particular sin is
            so called by reason of a particular object. This, however, is the
            particular object of the will, in which it (the will) sins, namely
            that one was born to withdraw from sin, with which the will
            disagrees, pulling back from it spontaneously. The sin against the
            Holy Spirit is not properly said to be that which arises in the
            first way from choice, but proceeds, rather, from the second way of
            choice. For sins are specified and denominated by their objects, and
            the object of this sin (i.e., against the Holy Spirit) is what
            withdraws one from sin, and this is a particular goodness (that one
            is born with, i.e., a natural abhorrence of sin just spoken of
            above), or some characteristic effect of the Holy Spirit. For this
            reason, the sin against the Holy Spirit denominates a particular
            kind of sin.</font

            ><i>Response to Objection 1:</i> When someone sins by way of choice
            in the second way, which is properly referred to as the sin against
            the Holy Spirit, there are two acts that are considered, each one of
            which is a sin, and the first is the cause of the second. For
            example, someone despises eternal rewards in one act of the will,
            throwing aside the hope of them for himself. In this very way, he
            sins, and because he despairs of this reward, he falls (for example)
            into an act of fornication. This act occurs by reason of a definite
            choice on account of the preceding act. Hence it is clear that when
            a sin is designated by reason of intention, this very intention,
            which is denoted to be the cause of sin, is a sin and is a
            particular kind of sin. This properly is the sin against the Holy
            Spirit. But weakness and ignorance are not designated as sins, but
            rather only as penalties. For this reason a particular kind of sin
            is not designated with respect to them.</font

            not said to be the second act which is caused by the first, except
            perhaps in so far as the power of the first act remains in (the
            second act). The first act itself is properly called the sin against
            the Holy Spirit, for which reason it is not inappropriate that from
            one definite kind of sin all sins are able to arise, as was said

            ><i>Response to Objection 4:</i> Those things contrary to grace
            happen in two ways. First, directly in themselves. And this comes to
            be when someone actually despises grace, or something pertaining to
            grace. And in this way the sin against the Holy Spirit is opposed to
            grace. Second, indirectly and, as it were, by consequence. And in
            this way, every mortal sin is opposed to grace, since there is
            something sought through mortal sin which cannot exist concomitantly
            with grace.</font

            ><i>Response to Objection 5:</i> Mortal sin in one way is likened
            unto death, and in another way to sickness. In so far as it
            separates one from God, Who is life, it has a likeness to death. And
            this is the first death (mentioned in the objection). However, in so
            far as there still remains the possibility of returning to life, it
            has a likeness to sickness, of drawing one towards the death of
            condemnation (which is the second death (mentioned) in the
            objection, which wholly withdraws from its likeness unto death),
            while through it man is separated from God and has not returned to
            the life of possible grace. Just as some sicknesses of the body are
            curable, while some are not (according to the nature of disease, the
            latter are called infirmities unto death), so too with respect to
            sins, so far as mortal sins are in themselves unforgivable, they are
            said to be 'unto death'. Therefore a sin is said to be mortal from
            the first death (mentioned in the objection), but leading to death
            according to the second (mention of) death.</font
