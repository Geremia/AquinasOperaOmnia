    OF THE QUALITY OF SOULS WHO EXPIATE ACTUAL SIN OR ITS PUNISHMENT IN
    PURGATORY (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next treat of the souls which after this life expiate the punishment
    of their actual sins in the fire of Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under this head there are six points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the pain of Purgatory
    surpasses all the temporal pains of this life?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether that punishment is
    voluntary?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the souls in Purgatory are
    punished by the demons?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether venial sin as regards its
    guilt is expiated by the pains of Purgatory?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the fire of Purgatory frees
    from the debt of punishment?
  </p>
  <p>

    punishment sooner than another?

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the pains of Purgatory surpass all the temporal pains of this
    life?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the pains of Purgatory do not
    surpass all the temporal pains of this life. Because the more passive a
    thing is the more it suffers if it has the sense of being hurt. Now the body
    is more passive than the separate soul, both because it has contrariety to a
    fiery agent, and because it has matter which is susceptive of the agent's
    quality: and this cannot be said of the soul. Therefore the pain which the
    body suffers in this world is greater than the pain whereby the soul is
    cleansed after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the pains of Purgatory are directly
    ordained against venial sins. Now since venial sins are the least grievous,
    the lightest punishment is due to them, if the measure of the stripes is
    according to the measure of the fault. Therefore the pain of Purgatory is
    the lightest of all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since the debt of punishment is an
    effect of sin, it does not increase unless the sin increases. Now sin cannot
    increase in one whose sin is already remitted. Therefore if a mortal sin has
    been remitted in a man who has not fully paid the debt of punishment, this
    debt does not increase when he dies. But while he lived he was not in debt
    to the extent of the most grievous punishment. Therefore the pain that he
    will suffer after this life will not be more grievous to him than all other
    pains of this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in a sermon (xli De Sanctis):
    "This fire of Purgatory will be more severe than any pain that can be felt,
    seen or conceived in this world."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the more universal a pain is the greater it is. Now the whole
    separate soul is punished, since it is simple: which is not the case with
    the body. Therefore this, being the punishment of the separate soul, is
    greater than any pain suffered by the body.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In Purgatory there will be a twofold pain; one
    will be the pain of loss, namely the delay of the divine vision, and the
    pain of sense, namely punishment by corporeal fire. With regard to both the
    least pain of Purgatory surpasses the greatest pain of this life. For the
    more a thing is desired the more painful is its absence. And since after
    this life the holy souls desire the Sovereign Good with the most intense
    longing---both because their longing is not held back by the weight of the
    body, and because, had there been no obstacle, they would already have
    gained the goal of enjoying the Sovereign Good---it follows that they grieve
    exceedingly for their delay. Again, since pain is not hurt, but the sense of
    hurt, the more sensitive a thing is, the greater the pain caused by that
    which hurts it: wherefore hurts inflicted on the more sensible parts cause
    the greatest pain. And, because all bodily sensation is from the soul, it
    follows of necessity that the soul feels the greatest pain when a hurt is
    inflicted on the soul itself. That the soul suffers pain from the bodily
    fire is at present taken for granted, for we shall treat of this matter
    further on [*Cf. XP, Question [70], Article [3]]. Therefore it follows that
    the pain of Purgatory, both of loss and of sense, surpasses all the pains of
    this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, prove this from the fact that the whole soul is punished, and
    not the body. But this is to no purpose, since in that case the punishment
    of the damned would be milder after the resurrection than before, which is
    false.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the soul is less passive than
    the body, it is more cognizant of actual suffering [passionis]: and where
    the sense of suffering is greater, there is the greater pain, though the
    suffering be less.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The severity of that punishment is not
    so much a consequence of the degree of sin, as of the disposition of the
    person punished, because the same sin is more severely punished then than
    now. Even so a person who has a better temperament is punished more severely
    by the same sentence than another; and yet the judge acts justly in
    condemning both for the same crimes to the same punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.</p>

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether this punishment is voluntary?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this punishment is voluntary.
    For those who are in Purgatory are upright in heart. Now uprightness in
    heart is to conform one's will to God's, as Augustine says (Serm. i in Ps.
    32). Therefore, since it is God's will that they be punished, they will
    suffer that punishment voluntarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every wise man wills that without which
    he cannot obtain the end he has in view. Now those who are in Purgatory know
    that they cannot obtain glory, unless they be punished first. Therefore they
    are punished willingly.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No one asks to be freed from a punishment
    that he suffers willingly. Now those who are in Purgatory ask to be set
    free, as appears from many incidents related in the Dialogue of Gregory (iv,
    40,65). Therefore they will not undergo that punishment voluntarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be voluntary in two ways.
    First, by an absolute act of the will; and thus no punishment is voluntary,
    because the very notion of punishment is that it be contrary to the will.
    Secondly, a thing is said to be voluntary by a conditional act of the will:
    thus cautery is voluntary for the sake of regaining health. Hence a
    punishment may be voluntary in two ways. First, because by being punished we
    obtain some good, and thus the will itself undertakes a punishment, as
    instanced in satisfaction, or when a man accepts a punishment gladly, and
    would not have it not to be, as in the case of martyrdom. Secondly, when,
    although we gain no good by the punishment, we cannot obtain a good without
    being punished, as in the case of natural death: and then the will does not
    undertake the punishment, and would be delivered from it; but it submits to
    it, and in this respect the punishment is said to be voluntary. In this
    latter sense the punishment of Purgatory is said to be voluntary.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some, however, say that it is not voluntary in any way, because the souls in
    Purgatory are so replete with suffering, that they know not that they are
    being cleansed by their pains, and deem themselves damned. But this is
    false, for did they not know that they will be set free, they would not ask
    for prayers, as they often do.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.</p>

    Whether the soul in Purgatory are punished by the demons?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the souls in Purgatory are
    punished by the demons; for, according to the Master, "they will have for
    torturers in their pains, those who were their tempters in sin." Now the
    demons tempt us to sin, not only mortal, but also venial when they fail in
    the former. Therefore in Purgatory also they will torture souls on account
    of venial sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the just are competent to be cleansed
    from sin both in this life and afterwards. Now, in this life, they are
    cleansed by pains inflicted by the devil, as was the case with Job.
    Therefore after this life also, those who have to be cleansed will be
    punished by the demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It were unjust that he who has triumphed over
    someone, should be subjected to him after victory. Now those who are in
    Purgatory have triumphed over the demons, since they died without mortal
    sin. Therefore they will not be subjected to them through being punished by
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As after the Judgment day the Divine justice
    will kindle the fire with which the damned will be punished for ever, even
    so now the elect are cleansed after this life by the Divine justice alone,
    and neither by the ministry of the demons whom they have vanquished, nor by
    the ministry of the angels who would not inflict such tortures on their
    fellow-citizens. It is, however, possible that they take them to the place
    of punishment: also that even the demons, who rejoice in the punishment of
    man, accompany them and stand by while they are being cleansed, both that
    they may be sated with their pains, and that when these leave their bodies,
    they may find something of their own in them. But in this life, while there
    is yet time for the combat, men are punished both by the wicked angels as
    foes, as instanced in Job, and by the good angels, as instanced in Jacob,
    the sinew of whose thigh shrank at the angel's touch [*Gn. 32:25]. Moreover,
    Dionysius says explicitly that the good angels sometimes inflict
    punishment.<br />
  </p>

    Whether venial sin is expiated by the pains of Purgatory as regards the
    guilt?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin is not expiated by
    the pains of Purgatory as regards the guilt. For a gloss [*St. Gregory,
    Moral. xvi, 28] on 1 Jn. 5:16, "There is a sin unto death," etc. says: "It
    is vain to ask pardon after death for what was not amended in this life."
    Therefore no sin is remitted as to guilt after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same subject is freed from sin as
    falls into sin. But after death the soul cannot sin venially. Therefore
    neither can it be loosed from venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says [*Dial. iv, 39] that every
    man will be at the judgment as he was when he left the body, because "the
    tree... wheresoever it shall fall, there shall it be" [*Eccles. 11:3]. If,
    then, a man go forth from this life with venial sin, he will be with venial
    sin at the judgment: and consequently one does not atone for venial sin in
    Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it has been stated (<a href="../XP.html"
      >XP</a
    >, <a href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that actual sin is
    not blotted out save by contrition. But there will be no contrition after
    this life, because it is a meritorious act. For then there will be neither
    merit nor demerit since, according to the Damascene [*De Fide Orth. ii, 4],
    "death is to men what the fall was to the angels." Therefore, after this
    life, venial sin is not remitted in Purgatory as to its guilt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, venial sin is not in us except on
    account of the fomes. Wherefore in the original state Adam would not have
    sinned venially, as was stated (Sent. ii, D, xxi, 2). Now after this life
    there will be no sensuality; because the fomes will cease when the soul is
    separated, since it is called the "law of the flesh" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7"
      >Rm. 7</a
    >). Hence there will be no venial sin then, and consequently it cannot be
    expiated by the fire of Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory [*Dial. iv, 39] and Augustine [*De
    vera et falsa poenit. iv, xviii, by some other author] say that certain
    slight sins will be remitted in the life to come. Nor can this be understood
    of the punishment: because thus all sins, however grave they be, are
    expiated by the fire of Purgatory, as regards the debt of punishment.
    Therefore venial sins are cleansed by the fire of Purgatory as to their
    guilt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, wood, hay, stubble (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 3:12</a
    >) denote venial sins, as we have said (<a href="../FS.html">FS</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS089.html#FSQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS089.html#FSQ89A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now wood, hay,
    stubble are consumed in Purgatory. Therefore venial sins are remitted after
    this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have asserted that no sin is remitted
    after this life, as regards the guilt: that if a man die with mortal sin, he
    is damned and incapable of being forgiven; and that it is not possible for a
    man to die with a venial sin and without mortal sin, since the final grace
    washes the venial sin away. They assign as reason for this that venial sin
    is excessive love of a temporal thing, in one who has his foundation in
    Christ, which excess results from the corruption of concupiscence. Wherefore
    if grace entirely overcome the corruption of concupiscence, as in the
    Blessed Virgin, there is no room for venial sin. Hence, since this
    concupiscence is altogether abated and removed, the powers of the soul are
    wholly subject to grace, and venial sin is cast out. But this opinion is
    nonsensical in itself and in its proof. In itself, because it is opposed to
    the statements of holy men and of the Gospel, which cannot be expounded as
    referring to the remission of venial sins as to their punishment, as the
    Master says in the text [*Sentent. iv, D, xxi] because in this way both
    light and grave sins are remitted in the life to come: while Gregory [*Dial.
    iv, 39] declares that light sins alone are remitted after this life. Nor
    does it suffice for them to say, that this is said expressly of light sins,
    lest we should think that we shall suffer nothing grievous on their account:
    because the remission of sin diminishes punishment rather than aggravates
    it. As to the proof, it is shown to be worthless, since bodily defect, such
    as obtains at the last moment of life, does not remove the corruption of
    concupiscence; nor does it diminish it in its root but in its act, as
    instanced in those who lie dangerously ill; nor again does it calm the
    powers of the soul, so as to subject them to grace, because tranquillity of
    the powers, and their subjection to grace, is effected when the lower powers
    obey the higher which delight together in God's law. But this cannot happen
    in that state, since the acts of both kinds of powers are impeded; unless
    tranquillity denote the absence of combat, as occurs even in those who are
    asleep; and yet sleep is not said, for this reason, to diminish
    concupiscence, or to calm the powers of the soul, or to subject them to
    grace. Moreover, granted that the aforesaid defect diminish concupiscence
    radically, and that it subject the powers to grace, it would still be
    insufficient to wash away venial sin already committed, although it would
    suffice in order to avoid it in the future. Because actual sin, even if it
    be venial, is not remitted without an actual movement of contrition, as
    stated above (<a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), however much the
    latter be in the habitual intention. Now it happens sometimes that a man
    dies in his sleep, being in a state of grace and yet having a venial sin
    when he went to sleep: and such a man cannot make an act of contrition for
    his venial sin before he dies. Nor may we say, as they do, that if he
    repented neither by act nor by intention, neither in general nor in
    particular, his venial sin becomes mortal, for that "venial becomes mortal
    when it is an object of complacency"; because not all complacency in venial
    sin makes it mortal (else all venial sin would be mortal, since every venial
    sin pleases for as much as it is voluntary), but only that complacency which
    amounts to enjoyment, wherein all human wickedness consists, in that "we
    enjoy what we should use," as Augustine says [*De Trin. x, 10]. Hence the
    complacency which makes a sin mortal is actual complacency, for every mortal
    sin consists in an act. Now it may happen that a man, after committing a
    venial sin, has no actual thought of being forgiven or of remaining in that
    sin, but thinks perhaps about a triangle having its three angles equal to
    two right angles, and while engaged in this thought falls asleep, and
    dies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It is therefore clear that this opinion is utterly unreasonable: and
    consequently we must say with others that venial sin in one who dies in a
    state of grace, is remitted after this life by the fire of Purgatory:
    because this punishment so far as it is voluntary, will have the power, by
    virtue of grace, to expiate all such guilt as is compatible with grace.
    [*St. Thomas expresses himself differently, De Malo, Question [7], Article
    [2], ad 9,17: "Guilt is not remitted by punishment, but venial sin as to its
    guilt is remitted in Purgatory by virtue of grace, not only as existing in
    the habit, but also as proceeding to the act of charity in detestation of
    venial sin."]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gloss refers to mortal sin. Or it
    may be replied that although, in this life, it is not amended in itself, it
    is amended in merits, because a man merited here that his punishment should
    be meritorious to him there.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Venial sin arises from the corruption of
    the fomes, which will no longer be in the separate soul that is in
    Purgatory, wherefore this soul cannot sin venially. On the other hand, the
    remission of venial sin proceeds from the will informed by grace, which will
    be in the separate soul in Purgatory. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Venial sins do not alter a man's state,
    for they neither destroy nor diminish charity, according to which the amount
    of the soul's gratuitous goodness is measured. Hence the soul remains such
    as it was before, notwithstanding the remission or commission of venial
    sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> After this life there can be no merit in
    respect of the essential reward, but there can be in respect of some
    accidental reward, so long as man remains in the state of the way, in a
    sense. Consequently in Purgatory there can be a meritorious act in respect
    of the remission of venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although venial sin arises from the
    proneness of the fomes, sin results in the mind; wherefore even when the
    fomes is no more, sin can still remain.<br />

    Whether the fire of Purgatory delivers from the debt of punishment?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fire of Purgatory does not
    deliver from the debt of punishment. For every cleansing is in respect of
    some uncleanness. But punishment does not imply uncleanness. Therefore the
    fire of Purgatory does not deliver from punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a contrary is not cleansed save by its
    contrary. But punishment is not contrary to punishment. Therefore one is not
    cleansed from the debt of punishment by the punishment of Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on 1 Cor. 3:15, "He shall be
    saved, yet so," etc. says: "This fire is the trial of tribulation of which
    it is written (Ecclus. 27:6): The furnace tries the potter's vessels," etc.
    Therefore man expiates every punishment by the pains of this world, at least
    by death, which is the greatest punishment of all, and not by the fire of
    Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The pains of Purgatory are more grievous than
    all the pains of this world, as stated above (<a
      href="X1002.html#X1Q2A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >). Now the satisfactory punishment which one undergoes in this life atones
    for the debt of punishment. Much more therefore is this effected by the
    punishment of Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whosoever is another's debtor, is freed from
    his indebtedness by paying the debt. And, since the obligation incurred by
    guilt is nothing else than the debt of punishment, a person is freed from
    that obligation by undergoing the punishment which he owed. Accordingly the
    punishment of Purgatory cleanses from the debt of punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the debt of punishment does not
    in itself imply uncleanness, it bears a relation to uncleanness by reason of
    its cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although punishment is not contrary to
    punishment, it is opposed to the debt of punishment, because the obligation
    to punishment remains from the fact that one has not undergone the
    punishment that was due.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Many meanings underlie the same words of
    Holy Writ. Hence this fire may denote both the present tribulation and the
    punishment to come, and venial sins can be cleansed from both of these. That
    natural death is not sufficient for this, has been stated above (Sent. iv,
    D, 20).<br />

    Whether one person is delivered from this punishment sooner than another?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one person is not delivered
    from this punishment sooner than another. For the more grievous the sin, and
    the greater the debt, the more severely is it punished in Purgatory. Now
    there is the same proportion between severer punishment and graver fault, as
    between lighter punishment and less grievous fault. Therefore one is
    delivered from this punishment as soon as another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in point of duration unequal merits
    receive equal retribution both in heaven and in hell. Therefore seemingly it
    is the same in Purgatory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> is the comparison of the Apostle, who denotes
    the differences of venial sins by wood, hay, and stubble. Now it is clear
    that wood remains longer in the fire than hay and stubble. Therefore one
    venial sin is punished longer in Purgatory than another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some venial sins cling more persistently than
    others, according as the affections are more inclined to them, and more
    firmly fixed in them. And since that which clings more persistently is more
    slowly cleansed, it follows that some are tormented in Purgatory longer than
    others, for as much as their affections were steeped in venial sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Severity of punishment corresponds
    properly speaking to the amount of guilt: whereas the length corresponds to
    the firmness with which sin has taken root in its subject. Hence it may
    happen that one may be delayed longer who is tormented less, and "vice
    versa."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mortal sin which deserves the punishment
    of hell, and charity which deserves the reward of heaven, will, after this
    life, be immovably rooted in their subject. Hence as to all there is the
    same duration in either case. It is otherwise with venial sin which is
    punished in Purgatory, as stated above (<a href="X1002.html#X1Q2A6THEP1"
      >Article [6]</a
    >).<br />
