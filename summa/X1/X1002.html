<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next treat of the souls which after this life expiate the 
punishment of their actual sins in the fire of Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under this head there are six points of inquiry:

this life?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="X1002.html#X1Q2A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether that punishment is voluntary?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="X1002.html#X1Q2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the souls in Purgatory are punished by the demons?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="X1002.html#X1Q2A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether venial sin as regards its guilt is expiated by the pains of 
Purgatory?<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the pains of Purgatory surpass all the temporal pains of this life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the pains of Purgatory do not surpass all the 
temporal pains of this life. Because the more passive a thing is the more 
it suffers if it has the sense of being hurt. Now the body is more 
passive than the separate soul, both because it has contrariety to a 
fiery agent, and because it has matter which is susceptive of the agent's 
quality: and this cannot be said of the soul. Therefore the pain which 
the body suffers in this world is greater than the pain whereby the soul 
is cleansed after this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the pains of Purgatory are directly ordained against 
venial sins. Now since venial sins are the least grievous, the lightest 
punishment is due to them, if the measure of the stripes is according to 
the measure of the fault. Therefore the pain of Purgatory is the lightest 
of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since the debt of punishment is an effect of sin, it 
does not increase unless the sin increases. Now sin cannot increase in 
one whose sin is already remitted. Therefore if a mortal sin has been 
remitted in a man who has not fully paid the debt of punishment, this 
debt does not increase when he dies. But while he lived he was not in 
debt to the extent of the most grievous punishment. Therefore the pain 
that he will suffer after this life will not be more grievous to him than 
all other pains of this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says in a sermon (xli De Sanctis): "This fire 
of Purgatory will be more severe than any pain that can be felt, seen or 
conceived in this world."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the more universal a pain is the greater it is. Now the whole 
separate soul is punished, since it is simple: which is not the case with 
the body. Therefore this, being the punishment of the separate soul, is 
greater than any pain suffered by the body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In Purgatory there will be a twofold pain; one will be 
the pain of loss, namely the delay of the divine vision, and the pain of 
sense, namely punishment by corporeal fire. With regard to both the least 
pain of Purgatory surpasses the greatest pain of this life. For the more 
a thing is desired the more painful is its absence. And since after this 
life the holy souls desire the Sovereign Good with the most intense 
longing---both because their longing is not held back by the weight of 
the body, and because, had there been no obstacle, they would already 
have gained the goal of enjoying the Sovereign Good---it follows that 
they grieve exceedingly for their delay. Again, since pain is not hurt, 
but the sense of hurt, the more sensitive a thing is, the greater the 
pain caused by that which hurts it: wherefore hurts inflicted on the more 
sensible parts cause the greatest pain. And, because all bodily sensation 
is from the soul, it follows of necessity that the soul feels the 
greatest pain when a hurt is inflicted on the soul itself. That the soul 
suffers pain from the bodily fire is at present taken for granted, for we 
shall treat of this matter further on [*Cf. XP, Question [70], Article [3]]. Therefore 
it follows that the pain of Purgatory, both of loss and of sense, 
surpasses all the pains of this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, however, prove this from the fact that the whole soul is punished, 
and not the body. But this is to no purpose, since in that case the 
punishment of the damned would be milder after the resurrection than 
before, which is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the soul is less passive than the body, it is more 
cognizant of actual suffering [passionis]: and where the sense of 
suffering is greater, there is the greater pain, though the suffering be 
less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The severity of that punishment is not so much a 
consequence of the degree of sin, as of the disposition of the person 
punished, because the same sin is more severely punished then than now. 
Even so a person who has a better temperament is punished more severely 
by the same sentence than another; and yet the judge acts justly in 
condemning both for the same crimes to the same punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Third Objection.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether this punishment is voluntary?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this punishment is voluntary. For those who 
are in Purgatory are upright in heart. Now uprightness in heart is to 
conform one's will to God's, as Augustine says (Serm. i in Ps. 32). 
Therefore, since it is God's will that they be punished, they will suffer 
that punishment voluntarily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every wise man wills that without which he cannot obtain 
the end he has in view. Now those who are in Purgatory know that they 
cannot obtain glory, unless they be  punished first. Therefore they are 
punished willingly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No one asks to be freed from a punishment that he 
suffers willingly. Now those who are in Purgatory ask to be set free, as 
appears from many incidents related in the Dialogue of Gregory (iv, 
40,65). Therefore they will not undergo that punishment voluntarily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing is said to be voluntary in two ways. First, by an 
absolute act of the will; and thus no punishment is voluntary, because 
the very notion of punishment is that it be contrary to the will. 
Secondly, a thing is said to be voluntary by a conditional act of the 
will: thus cautery is voluntary for the sake of regaining health. Hence a 
punishment may be voluntary in two ways. First, because by being punished 
we obtain some good, and thus the will itself undertakes a punishment, as 
instanced in satisfaction, or when a man accepts a punishment gladly, and 
would not have it not to be, as in the case of martyrdom. Secondly, when, 
although we gain no good by the punishment, we cannot obtain a good 
without being punished, as in the case of natural death: and then the 
will does not undertake the punishment, and would be delivered from it; 
but it submits to it, and in this respect the punishment is said to be 
voluntary. In this latter sense the punishment of Purgatory is said to be 
voluntary.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, however, say that it is not voluntary in any way, because the 
souls in Purgatory are so replete with suffering, that they know not that 
they are being cleansed by their pains, and deem themselves damned. But 
this is false, for did they not know that they will be set free, they 
would not ask for prayers, as they often do.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the soul in Purgatory are punished by the demons?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the souls in Purgatory are punished by the 
demons; for, according to the Master, "they will have for torturers in 
their pains, those who were their tempters in sin." Now the demons tempt 
us to sin, not only mortal, but also venial when they fail in the former. 
Therefore in Purgatory also they will torture souls on account of venial 
sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the just are competent to be cleansed from sin both in 
this life and afterwards. Now, in this life, they are cleansed by pains 
inflicted by the devil, as was the case with Job. Therefore after this 
life also, those who have to be cleansed will be punished by the demons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It were unjust that he who has triumphed over someone, 
should be subjected to him after victory. Now those who are in Purgatory 
have triumphed over the demons, since they died without mortal sin. 
Therefore they will not be subjected to them  through being punished by 
them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As after the Judgment day the Divine justice will kindle 
the fire with which the damned will be punished for ever, even so now the 
elect are cleansed after this life by the Divine justice alone, and 
neither by the ministry of the demons whom they have vanquished, nor by 
the ministry of the angels who would not inflict such tortures on their 
fellow-citizens. It is, however, possible that they take them to the 
place of punishment: also that even the demons, who rejoice in the 
punishment of man, accompany them and stand by while they are being 
cleansed, both that they may be sated with their pains, and that when 
these leave their bodies, they may find something of their own in them. 
But in this life, while there is yet time for the combat, men are 
punished both by the wicked angels as foes, as instanced in Job, and by 
the good angels, as instanced in Jacob, the sinew of whose thigh shrank 
at the angel's touch [*Gn. 32:25]. Moreover, Dionysius says explicitly 
that the good angels sometimes inflict punishment.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether venial sin is expiated by the pains of Purgatory as regards the guilt?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that venial sin is not expiated by the pains of 
Purgatory as regards the guilt. For a gloss [*St. Gregory, Moral. xvi, 
28] on 1 Jn. 5:16, "There is a sin unto death," etc. says: "It is vain to 
ask pardon after death for what was not amended in this life." Therefore 
no sin is remitted as to guilt after this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same subject is freed from sin as falls into sin. 
But after death the soul cannot sin venially. Therefore neither can it be 
loosed from venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Gregory says [*Dial. iv, 39] that every man will be at 
the judgment as he was when he left the body, because "the tree . . . 
wheresoever it shall fall, there shall it be" [*Eccles. 11:3]. If, then, 
a man go forth from this life with venial sin, he will be with venial sin 
at the judgment: and consequently one does not atone for venial sin in 
Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it has been stated (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that actual sin is 
not blotted out save by contrition. But there will be no contrition after 
this life, because it is a meritorious act. For then there will be 
neither merit nor demerit since, according to the Damascene [*De Fide 
Orth. ii, 4], "death is to men what the fall was to the angels." 
Therefore, after this life, venial sin is not remitted in Purgatory as to 
its guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, venial sin is not in us except on account of the fomes. 
Wherefore in the original state Adam would not have sinned venially, as 
was stated (Sent. ii, D, xxi, 2). Now after  this life there will be no 
sensuality; because the fomes will cease when the soul is separated, 
since it is called the "law of the flesh" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7">Rm. 7</a>). Hence there will be no 
venial sin then, and consequently it cannot be expiated by the fire of 
Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory [*Dial. iv, 39] and Augustine [*De vera et 
falsa poenit. iv, xviii, by some other author] say that certain slight 
sins will be remitted in the life to come. Nor can this be understood of 
the punishment: because thus all sins, however grave they be, are 
expiated by the fire of Purgatory, as regards the debt of punishment. 
Therefore venial sins are cleansed by the fire of Purgatory as to their 
guilt.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, wood, hay, stubble (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++3:12">1 Cor. 3:12</a>) denote venial sins, as we have 
said (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS089.html#FSQ89OUTP1">Question [89]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS089.html#FSQ89A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now wood, hay, stubble are consumed in Purgatory. 
Therefore venial sins are remitted after this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have asserted that no sin is remitted after this 
life, as regards the guilt: that if a man die with mortal sin, he is 
damned and incapable of being forgiven; and that it is not possible for a 
man to die with a venial sin and without mortal sin, since the final 
grace washes the venial sin away. They assign as reason for this that 
venial sin is excessive love of a temporal thing, in one who has his 
foundation in Christ, which excess results from the corruption of 
concupiscence. Wherefore if grace entirely overcome the corruption of 
concupiscence, as in the Blessed Virgin, there is no room for venial sin. 
Hence, since this concupiscence is altogether abated and removed, the 
powers of the soul are wholly subject to grace, and venial sin is cast 
out. But this opinion is nonsensical in itself and in its proof. In 
itself, because it is opposed to the statements of holy men and of the 
Gospel, which cannot be expounded as referring to the remission of venial 
sins as to their punishment, as the Master says in the text [*Sentent. 
iv, D, xxi] because in this way both light and grave sins are remitted in 
the life to come: while Gregory [*Dial. iv, 39] declares that light sins 
alone are remitted after this life. Nor does it suffice for them to say, 
that this is said expressly of light sins, lest we should think that we 
shall suffer nothing grievous on their account: because the remission of 
sin diminishes punishment rather than aggravates it. As to the proof, it 
is shown to be worthless, since bodily defect, such as obtains at the 
last moment of life, does not remove the corruption of concupiscence; nor 
does it diminish it in its root but in its act, as instanced in those who 
lie dangerously ill; nor again does it calm the powers of the soul, so as 
to subject them to grace, because tranquillity of the powers, and their 
subjection to grace, is effected when the lower powers obey the higher 
which delight together in God's law. But this cannot happen in that 
state, since the acts of both kinds of powers are impeded; unless 
tranquillity denote the absence of combat, as occurs even in those who 
are asleep; and yet sleep is not said, for this reason, to diminish 
concupiscence, or to calm the powers of the soul, or to subject them to 
grace. Moreover, granted that the aforesaid defect diminish concupiscence 
radically, and that it subject the powers to grace, it would still be  
insufficient to wash away venial sin already committed, although it would 
suffice in order to avoid it in the future. Because actual sin, even if 
it be venial, is not remitted without an actual movement of contrition, 
as stated above (<A Href="../XP.html">XP</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="../XP/XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), however much the latter be in the 
habitual intention. Now it happens sometimes that a man dies in his 
sleep, being in a state of grace and yet having a venial sin when he went 
to sleep: and such a man cannot make an act of contrition for his venial 
sin before he dies. Nor may we say, as they do, that if he repented 
neither by act nor by intention, neither in general nor in particular, 
his venial sin becomes mortal, for that "venial becomes mortal when it is 
an object of complacency"; because not all complacency in venial sin 
makes it mortal (else all venial sin would be mortal, since every venial 
sin pleases for as much as it is voluntary), but only that complacency 
which amounts to enjoyment, wherein all human wickedness consists, in 
that "we enjoy what we should use," as Augustine says [*De Trin. x, 10]. 
Hence the complacency which makes a sin mortal is actual complacency, for 
every mortal sin consists in an act. Now it may happen that a man, after 
committing a venial sin, has no actual thought of being forgiven or of 
remaining in that sin, but thinks perhaps about a triangle having its 
three angles equal to two right angles, and while engaged in this thought 
falls asleep, and dies.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It is therefore clear that this opinion is utterly unreasonable: and 
consequently we must say with others that venial sin in one who dies in a 
state of grace, is remitted after this life by the fire of Purgatory: 
because this punishment so far as it is voluntary, will have the power, 
by virtue of grace, to expiate all such guilt as is compatible with 
grace. [*St. Thomas expresses himself differently, De Malo, Question [7], Article [2], 
ad 9,17: "Guilt is not remitted by punishment, but venial sin as to its 
guilt is remitted in Purgatory by virtue of grace, not only as existing 
in the habit, but also as proceeding to the act of charity in detestation 
of venial sin."]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The gloss refers to mortal sin. Or it may be replied that 
although, in this life, it is not amended in itself, it is amended in 
merits, because a man merited here that his punishment should be 
meritorious to him there.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Venial sin arises from the corruption of the fomes, which 
will no longer be in the separate soul that is in Purgatory, wherefore 
this soul cannot sin venially. On the other hand, the remission of venial 
sin proceeds from the will informed by grace, which will be in the 
separate soul in Purgatory. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Venial sins do not alter a man's state, for they neither 
destroy nor diminish charity, according to which the amount of the soul's 
gratuitous goodness is measured. Hence the soul remains such as it was 
before, notwithstanding the remission or commission of venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> After this life there can be no merit in respect of the 
essential reward, but there can be in respect of some accidental reward, 
so long as man remains in the state of the way, in a sense. Consequently 
in Purgatory there can be a meritorious act in respect of the remission 
of venial sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[4] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Although venial sin arises from the proneness of the fomes, 
sin results in the mind; wherefore even when the fomes is no more, sin 
can still remain.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fire of Purgatory does not deliver from 
the debt of punishment. For every cleansing is in respect of some 
uncleanness. But punishment does not imply uncleanness. Therefore the 
fire of Purgatory does not deliver from punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a contrary is not cleansed save by its contrary. But 
punishment is not contrary to punishment. Therefore one is not cleansed 
from the debt of punishment by the punishment of Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a gloss on 1 Cor. 3:15, "He shall be saved, yet so," 
etc. says: "This fire is the trial of tribulation of which it is written 
(Ecclus. 27:6): The furnace tries the potter's vessels," etc. Therefore 
man expiates every punishment by the pains of this world, at least by 
death, which is the greatest punishment of all, and not by the fire of 
Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The pains of Purgatory are more grievous than all the 
pains of this world, as stated above (<A Href="X1002.html#X1Q2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Now the satisfactory 
punishment which one undergoes in this life atones for the debt of 
punishment. Much more therefore is this effected by the punishment of 
Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Whosoever is another's debtor, is freed from his 
indebtedness by paying the debt. And, since the obligation incurred by 
guilt is nothing else than the debt of punishment, a person is freed from 
that obligation by undergoing the punishment which he owed. Accordingly 
the punishment of Purgatory cleanses from the debt of punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the debt of punishment does not in itself imply 
uncleanness, it bears a relation to uncleanness by reason of its cause.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although punishment is not contrary to punishment, it is 
opposed to the debt of punishment, because the obligation to punishment 
remains from the fact that one has not undergone the punishment that was 
due.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Many meanings underlie the same words of Holy  Writ. Hence 
this fire may denote both the present tribulation and the punishment to 
come, and venial sins can be cleansed from both of these. That natural 
death is not sufficient for this, has been stated above (Sent. iv, D, 20).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one person is delivered from this punishment sooner than another?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one person is not delivered from this 
punishment sooner than another. For the more grievous the sin, and the 
greater the debt, the more severely is it punished in Purgatory. Now 
there is the same proportion between severer punishment and graver fault, 
as between lighter punishment and less grievous fault. Therefore one is 
delivered from this punishment as soon as another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in point of duration unequal merits receive equal 
retribution both in heaven and in hell. Therefore seemingly it is the 
same in Purgatory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> is the comparison of the Apostle, who denotes the 
differences of venial sins by wood, hay, and stubble. Now it is clear 
that wood remains longer in the fire than hay and stubble. Therefore one 
venial sin is punished longer in Purgatory than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some venial sins cling more persistently than others, 
according as the affections are more inclined to them, and more firmly 
fixed in them. And since that which clings more persistently is more 
slowly cleansed, it follows that some are tormented in Purgatory longer 
than others, for as much as their affections were steeped in venial sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Severity of punishment corresponds properly speaking to the 
amount of guilt: whereas the length corresponds to the firmness with 
which sin has taken root in its subject. Hence it may happen that one may 
be delayed longer who is tormented less, and "vice versa."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP App. 1 Q[2] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Mortal sin which deserves the punishment of hell, and 
charity which deserves the reward of heaven, will, after this life, be 
immovably rooted in their subject. Hence as to all there is the same 
duration in either case. It is otherwise with venial sin which is 
punished in Purgatory, as stated above (<A Href="X1002.html#X1Q2A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>).<br>
