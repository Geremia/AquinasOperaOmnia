  <h3 align="left">Whether heresy is a species of unbelief?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that heresy is not a species of
    unbelief. For unbelief is in the understanding, as stated above (<a
      href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1"
      >Question [10]</a
    >, <a href="SS010.html#SSQ10A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now heresy would seem
    not to pertain to the understanding, but rather to the appetitive power; for
    Jerome says on Gal. 5:19: [*Cf. Decretals xxiv, qu. iii, cap. 27] "The works
    of the flesh are manifest: Heresy is derived from a Greek word meaning
    choice, whereby a man makes choice of that school which he deems best." But
    choice is an act of the appetitive power, as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore heresy
    is not a species of unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, vice takes its species chiefly from its
    end; hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. v, 2) that "he who commits adultery
    that he may steal, is a thief rather than an adulterer." Now the end of
    heresy is temporal profit, especially lordship and glory, which belong to
    the vice of pride or covetousness: for Augustine says (De Util. Credendi i)
    that "a heretic is one who either devises or follows false and new opinions,
    for the sake of some temporal profit, especially that he may lord and be
    honored above others." Therefore heresy is a species of pride rather than of
    unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since unbelief is in the understanding,
    it would seem not to pertain to the flesh. Now heresy belongs to the works
    of the flesh, for the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++5%3A19"
      >Gal. 5:19</a
    >): "The works of the flesh are manifest, which are fornication,
    uncleanness," and among the others, he adds, "dissensions, sects," which are
    the same as heresies. Therefore heresy is not a species of unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Falsehood is contrary to truth. Now a heretic
    is one who devises or follows false or new opinions. Therefore heresy is
    opposed to the truth, on which faith is founded; and consequently it is a
    species of unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The word heresy as stated in the first
    objection denotes a choosing. Now choice as stated above (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13OUTP1">Question [13]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS013.html#FSQ13A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) is about things
    directed to the end, the end being presupposed. Now, in matters of faith,
    the will assents to some truth, as to its proper good, as was shown above
    (<a href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="SS004.html#SSQ4A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>): wherefore that which is
    the chief truth, has the character of last end, while those which are
    secondary truths, have the character of being directed to the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now, whoever believes, assents to someone's words; so that, in every form of
    unbelief, the person to whose words assent is given seems to hold the chief
    place and to be the end as it were; while the things by holding which one
    assents to that person hold a secondary place. Consequently he that holds
    the Christian faith aright, assents, by his will, to Christ, in those things
    which truly belong to His doctrine.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Accordingly there are two ways in which a man may deviate from the rectitude
    of the Christian faith. First, because he is unwilling to assent to Christ:
    and such a man has an evil will, so to say, in respect of the very end. This
    belongs to the species of unbelief in pagans and Jews. Secondly, because,
    though he intends to assent to Christ, yet he fails in his choice of those
    things wherein he assents to Christ, because he chooses not what Christ
    really taught, but the suggestions of his own mind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Therefore heresy is a species of unbelief, belonging to those who profess
    the Christian faith, but corrupt its dogmas.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Choice regards unbelief in the same way
    as the will regards faith, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Vices take their species from their
    proximate end, while, from their remote end, they take their genus and
    cause. Thus in the case of adultery committed for the sake of theft, there
    is the species of adultery taken from its proper end and object; but the
    ultimate end shows that the act of adultery is both the result of the theft,
    and is included under it, as an effect under its cause, or a species under
    its genus, as appears from what we have said about acts in general (<a
      href="../FS.html"
      >FS</a
    >, <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS018.html#FSQ18A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>). Wherefore, as to
    the case in point also, the proximate end of heresy is adherence to one's
    own false opinion, and from this it derives its species, while its remote
    end reveals its cause, viz. that it arises from pride or covetousness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as heresy is so called from its
    being a choosing [*From the Greek {airein} [hairein], to cut off], so does
    sect derive its name from its being a cutting off [secando], as Isidore
    states (Etym. viii, 3). Wherefore heresy and sect are the same thing, and
    each belongs to the works of the flesh, not indeed by reason of the act
    itself of unbelief in respect of its proximate object, but by reason of its
    cause, which is either the desire of an undue end in which way it arises
    from pride or covetousness, as stated in the second objection, or some
    illusion of the imagination (which gives rise to error, as the Philosopher
    states in Metaph. iv; Ed. Did. iii, 5), for this faculty has a certain
    connection with the flesh, in as much as its act is independent on a bodily
    organ.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether heresy is properly about matters of faith?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that heresy is not properly about
    matters of faith. For just as there are heresies and sects among Christians,
    so were there among the Jews, and Pharisees, as Isidore observes (Etym.
    viii, 3,4,5). Now their dissensions were not about matters of faith.
    Therefore heresy is not about matters of faith, as though they were its
    proper matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the matter of faith is the thing
    believed. Now heresy is not only about things, but also about works, and
    about interpretations of Holy Writ. For Jerome says on Gal. 5:20 that
    "whoever expounds the Scriptures in any sense but that of the Holy Ghost by
    Whom they were written, may be called a heretic, though he may not have left
    the Church": and elsewhere he says that "heresies spring up from words
    spoken amiss." [*St. Thomas quotes this saying elsewhere, in Sent. iv, D,
    13, and TP, Question [16], Article [8], but it is not to be found in St.
    Jerome's works.] Therefore heresy is not properly about the matter of
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we find the holy doctors differing even
    about matters pertaining to the faith, for example Augustine and Jerome, on
    the question about the cessation of the legal observances: and yet this was
    without any heresy on their part. Therefore heresy is not properly about the
    matter of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says against the Manichees [*Cf. De
    Civ. Dei xviii, 51]: "In Christ's Church, those are heretics, who hold
    mischievous and erroneous opinions, and when rebuked that they may think
    soundly and rightly, offer a stubborn resistance, and, refusing to mend
    their pernicious and deadly doctrines, persist in defending them." Now
    pernicious and deadly doctrines are none but those which are contrary to the
    dogmas of faith, whereby "the just man liveth" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A17"
      >Rm. 1:17</a
    >). Therefore heresy is about matters of faith, as about its proper
    matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We are speaking of heresy now as denoting a
    corruption of the Christian faith. Now it does not imply a corruption of the
    Christian faith, if a man has a false opinion in matters that are not of
    faith, for instance, in questions of geometry and so forth, which cannot
    belong to the faith by any means; but only when a person has a false opinion
    about things belonging to the faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now a thing may be of the faith in two ways, as stated above (<a
      href="../FP.html"
      >FP</a
    >, <a href="../FP/FP032.html#FPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>,

    <a href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>,
    <a href="../FS/FS002.html#FSQ2A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>), in one way,
    directly and principally, e.g. the articles of faith; in another way,
    indirectly and secondarily, e.g. those matters, the denial of which leads to
    the corruption of some article of faith; and there may be heresy in either
    way, even as there can be faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the heresies of the Jews and
    Pharisees were about opinions relating to Judaism or Pharisaism, so also
    heresies among Christians are about matter touching the Christian faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man is said to expound Holy Writ in
    another sense than that required by the Holy Ghost, when he so distorts the
    meaning of Holy Writ, that it is contrary to what the Holy Ghost has
    revealed. Hence it is written (Ezech. 13:6) about the false prophets: "They
    have persisted to confirm what they have said," viz. by false
    interpretations of Scripture. Moreover a man professes his faith by the
    words that he utters, since confession is an act of faith, as stated above
    (<a href="SS003.html#SSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="SS003.html#SSQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Wherefore inordinate
    words about matters of faith may lead to corruption of the faith; and hence
    it is that Pope Leo says in a letter to Proterius, Bishop of Alexandria:
    "The enemies of Christ's cross lie in wait for our every deed and word, so
    that, if we but give them the slightest pretext, they may accuse us
    mendaciously of agreeing with Nestorius."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As Augustine says (Ep. xliii) and we
    find it stated in the Decretals (xxiv, qu. 3, can. Dixit Apostolus): "By no
    means should we accuse of heresy those who, however false and perverse their
    opinion may be, defend it without obstinate fervor, and seek the truth with
    careful anxiety, ready to mend their opinion, when they have found the
    truth," because, to wit, they do not make a choice in contradiction to the
    doctrine of the Church. Accordingly, certain doctors seem to have differed
    either in matters the holding of which in this or that way is of no
    consequence, so far as faith is concerned, or even in matters of faith,
    which were not as yet defined by the Church; although if anyone were
    obstinately to deny them after they had been defined by the authority of the
    universal Church, he would be deemed a heretic. This authority resides
    chiefly in the Sovereign Pontiff. For we read [*Decret. xxiv, qu. 1, can.
    Quoties]: "Whenever a question of faith is in dispute, I think, that all our
    brethren and fellow bishops ought to refer the matter to none other than
    Peter, as being the source of their name and honor, against whose authority
    neither Jerome nor Augustine nor any of the holy doctors defended their
    opinion." Hence Jerome says (Exposit. Symbol [*Among the supposititious
    works of St. Jerome]): "This, most blessed Pope, is the faith that we have
    been taught in the Catholic Church. If anything therein has been incorrectly
    or carelessly expressed, we beg that it may be set aright by you who hold
    the faith and see of Peter. If however this, our profession, be approved by
    the judgment of your apostleship, whoever may blame me, will prove that he
    himself is ignorant, or malicious, or even not a catholic but a heretic."<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether heretics ought to be tolerated?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that heretics ought to be tolerated. For
    the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++2%3A24,25"
      >2 Tim. 2:24,25</a
    >): "The servant of the Lord must not wrangle... with modesty admonishing
    them that resist the truth, if peradventure God may give them repentance to
    know the truth, and they may recover themselves from the snares of the
    devil." Now if heretics are not tolerated but put to death, they lose the
    opportunity of repentance. Therefore it seems contrary to the Apostle's
    command.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whatever is necessary in the Church
    should be tolerated. Now heresies are necessary in the Church, since the
    Apostle says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++11%3A19"
      >1 Cor. 11:19</a
    >): "There must be... heresies, that they... who are reproved, may be
    manifest among you." Therefore it seems that heretics should be
    tolerated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Master commanded his servants (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++13%3A30"
      >Mt. 13:30</a
    >) to suffer the cockle "to grow until the harvest," i.e. the end of the
    world, as a gloss explains it. Now holy men explain that the cockle denotes
    heretics. Therefore heretics should be tolerated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Titus+3%3A10,11"
      >Titus 3:10,11</a
    >): "A man that is a heretic, after the first and second admonition, avoid:
    knowing that he, that is such an one, is subverted."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> With regard to heretics two points must be
    observed: one, on their own side; the other, on the side of the Church. On
    their own side there is the sin, whereby they deserve not only to be
    separated from the Church by excommunication, but also to be severed from
    the world by death. For it is a much graver matter to corrupt the faith
    which quickens the soul, than to forge money, which supports temporal life.
    Wherefore if forgers of money and other evil-doers are forthwith condemned
    to death by the secular authority, much more reason is there for heretics,
    as soon as they are convicted of heresy, to be not only excommunicated but
    even put to death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the part of the Church, however, there is mercy which looks to the
    conversion of the wanderer, wherefore she condemns not at once, but "after
    the first and second admonition," as the Apostle directs: after that, if he
    is yet stubborn, the Church no longer hoping for his conversion, looks to
    the salvation of others, by excommunicating him and separating him from the
    Church, and furthermore delivers him to the secular tribunal to be
    exterminated thereby from the world by death. For Jerome commenting on Gal.
    5:9, "A little leaven," says: "Cut off the decayed flesh, expel the mangy
    sheep from the fold, lest the whole house, the whole paste, the whole body,
    the whole flock, burn, perish, rot, die. Arius was but one spark in
    Alexandria, but as that spark was not at once put out, the whole earth was
    laid waste by its flame."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This very modesty demands that the
    heretic should be admonished a first and second time: and if he be unwilling
    to retract, he must be reckoned as already "subverted," as we may gather
    from the words of the Apostle quoted above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The profit that ensues from heresy is
    beside the intention of heretics, for it consists in the constancy of the
    faithful being put to the test, and "makes us shake off our sluggishness,
    and search the Scriptures more carefully," as Augustine states (De Gen.
    cont. Manich. i, 1). What they really intend is the corruption of the faith,
    which is to inflict very great harm indeed. Consequently we should consider
    what they directly intend, and expel them, rather than what is beside their
    intention, and so, tolerate them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Decret. (xxiv, qu. iii,
    can. Notandum), "to be excommunicated is not to be uprooted." A man is
    excommunicated, as the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++5%3A5"
      >1 Cor. 5:5</a
    >) that his "spirit may be saved in the day of Our Lord." Yet if heretics be
    altogether uprooted by death, this is not contrary to Our Lord's command,
    which is to be understood as referring to the case when the cockle cannot be
    plucked up without plucking up the wheat, as we explained above (<a

    Whether the Church should receive those who return from heresy?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Church ought in all cases
    to receive those who return from heresy. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++3%3A1"
      >Jer. 3:1</a
    >) in the person of the Lord: "Thou hast prostituted thyself to many lovers;
    nevertheless return to Me saith the Lord." Now the sentence of the Church is
    God's sentence, according to Dt. 1:17: "You shall hear the little as well as
    the great: neither shall you respect any man's person, because it is the
    judgment of God." Therefore even those who are guilty of the prostitution of
    unbelief which is spiritual prostitution, should be received all the
    same.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Our Lord commanded Peter (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++18%3A22"
      >Mt. 18:22</a
    >) to forgive his offending brother "not" only "till seven times, but till
    seventy times seven times," which Jerome expounds as meaning that "a man
    should be forgiven, as often as he has sinned." Therefore he ought to be
    received by the Church as often as he has sinned by falling back into
    heresy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, heresy is a kind of unbelief. Now other
    unbelievers who wish to be converted are received by the Church. Therefore
    heretics also should be received.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The Decretal Ad abolendam (De Haereticis,
    cap. ix) says that "those who are found to have relapsed into the error
    which they had already abjured, must be left to the secular tribunal."
    Therefore they should not be received by the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In obedience to Our Lord's institution, the
    Church extends her charity to all, not only to friends, but also to foes who
    persecute her, according to Mt. 5:44: "Love your enemies; do good to them
    that hate you." Now it is part of charity that we should both wish and work
    our neighbor's good. Again, good is twofold: one is spiritual, namely the
    health of the soul, which good is chiefly the object of charity, since it is
    this chiefly that we should wish for one another. Consequently, from this
    point of view, heretics who return after falling no matter how often, are
    admitted by the Church to Penance whereby the way of salvation is opened to
    them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The other good is that which charity considers secondarily, viz. temporal
    good, such as life of the body, worldly possessions, good repute,
    ecclesiastical or secular dignity, for we are not bound by charity to wish
    others this good, except in relation to the eternal salvation of them and of
    others. Hence if the presence of one of these goods in one individual might
    be an obstacle to eternal salvation in many, we are not bound out of charity
    to wish such a good to that person, rather should we desire him to be
    without it, both because eternal salvation takes precedence of temporal
    good, and because the good of the many is to be preferred to the good of
    one. Now if heretics were always received on their return, in order to save
    their lives and other temporal goods, this might be prejudicial to the
    salvation of others, both because they would infect others if they relapsed
    again, and because, if they escaped without punishment, others would feel
    more assured in lapsing into heresy. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++8%3A11"
      >Eccles. 8:11</a
    >): "For because sentence is not speedily pronounced against the evil, the
    children of men commit evils without any fear."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    For this reason the Church not only admits to Penance those who return from
    heresy for the first time, but also safeguards their lives, and sometimes by
    dispensation, restores them to the ecclesiastical dignities which they may
    have had before, should their conversion appear to be sincere: we read of
    this as having frequently been done for the good of peace. But when they
    fall again, after having been received, this seems to prove them to be
    inconstant in faith, wherefore when they return again, they are admitted to
    Penance, but are not delivered from the pain of death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In God's tribunal, those who return are
    always received, because God is a searcher of hearts, and knows those who
    return in sincerity. But the Church cannot imitate God in this, for she
    presumes that those who relapse after being once received, are not sincere
    in their return; hence she does not debar them from the way of salvation,
    but neither does she protect them from the sentence of death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Our Lord was speaking to Peter of sins
    committed against oneself, for one should always forgive such offenses and
    spare our brother when he repents. These words are not to be applied to sins
    committed against one's neighbor or against God, for it is not left to our
    discretion to forgive such offenses, as Jerome says on Mt. 18:15, "If thy
    brother shall offend against thee." Yet even in this matter the law
    prescribes limits according as God's honor or our neighbor's good
    demands.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When other unbelievers, who have never
    received the faith are converted, they do not as yet show signs of
    inconstancy in faith, as relapsed heretics do; hence the comparison
    fails.<br />
