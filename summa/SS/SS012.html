  <h3 align="center">OF APOSTASY (TWO ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider apostasy: about which there are two points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS012.html#SSQ12A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether apostasy pertains to
    unbelief?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="SS012.html#SSQ12A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether, on account of apostasy
    from the faith, subjects are absolved from allegiance to an apostate
    prince?<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether apostasy pertains to unbelief?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that apostasy does not pertain to
    unbelief. For that which is the origin of all sins, does not, seemingly,
    pertain to unbelief, since many sins there are without unbelief. Now
    apostasy seems to be the origin of every sin, for it is written (Ecclus.
    10:14): "The beginning of the pride of man is apostasy [Douay: 'to fall
    off'] from God," and further on, (Ecclus. 10:15): "Pride is the beginning of
    all sin." Therefore apostasy does not pertain to unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, unbelief is an act of the understanding:
    whereas apostasy seems rather to consist in some outward deed or utterance,
    or even in some inward act of the will, for it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A12-14"
      >Prov. 6:12-14</a
    >): "A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man walketh with a perverse
    mouth. He winketh with the eyes, presseth with the foot, speaketh with the
    finger. With a wicked heart he deviseth evil, and at all times he soweth
    discord." Moreover if anyone were to have himself circumcised, or to worship
    at the tomb of Mahomet, he would be deemed an apostate. Therefore apostasy
    does not pertain to unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, heresy, since it pertains to unbelief,
    is a determinate species of unbelief. If then, apostasy pertained to
    unbelief, it would follow that it is a determinate species of unbelief,
    which does not seem to agree with what has been said (<a
      href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1"
      >Question [10]</a
    >, <a href="SS010.html#SSQ10A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore apostasy
    does not pertain to unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++6%3A67"
      >Jn. 6:67</a
    >): "Many of his disciples went back," i.e. apostatized, of whom Our Lord
    had said previously (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++6%3A65"
      >Jn. 6:65</a
    >): "There are some of you that believe not." Therefore apostasy pertains to
    unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Apostasy denotes a backsliding from God. This
    may happen in various ways according to the different kinds of union between
    man and God. For, in the first place, man is united to God by faith;
    secondly, by having his will duly submissive in obeying His commandments;
    thirdly, by certain special things pertaining to supererogation such as the
    religious life, the clerical state, or Holy Orders. Now if that which
    follows be removed, that which precedes, remains, but the converse does not
    hold. Accordingly a man may apostatize from God, by withdrawing from the
    religious life to which he was bound by profession, or from the Holy Order
    which he had received: and this is called "apostasy from religious life" or
    "Orders." A man may also apostatize from God, by rebelling in his mind
    against the Divine commandments: and though man may apostatize in both the
    above ways, he may still remain united to God by faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    But if he give up the faith, then he seems to turn away from God altogether:
    and consequently, apostasy simply and absolutely is that whereby a man
    withdraws from the faith, and is called "apostasy of perfidy." In this way
    apostasy, simply so called, pertains to unbelief.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection refers to the second kind
    of apostasy, which denotes an act of the will in rebellion against God's
    commandments, an act that is to be found in every mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It belongs to faith not only that the
    heart should believe, but also that external words and deeds should bear
    witness to the inward faith, for confession is an act of faith. In this way
    too, certain external words or deeds pertain to unbelief, in so far as they
    are signs of unbelief, even as a sign of health is said itself to be
    healthy. Now although the authority quoted may be understood as referring to
    every kind of apostate, yet it applies most truly to an apostate from the
    faith. For since faith is the first foundation of things to be hoped for,
    and since, without faith it is "impossible to please God"; when once faith
    is removed, man retains nothing that may be useful for the obtaining of
    eternal salvation, for which reason it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++6%3A12"
      >Prov. 6:12</a
    >): "A man that is an apostate, an unprofitable man": because faith is the
    life of the soul, according to Rm. 1:17: "The just man liveth by faith."
    Therefore, just as when the life of the body is taken away, man's every
    member and part loses its due disposition, so when the life of justice,
    which is by faith, is done away, disorder appears in all his members. First,
    in his mouth, whereby chiefly his mind stands revealed; secondly, in his
    eyes; thirdly, in the instrument of movement; fourthly, in his will, which
    tends to evil. The result is that "he sows discord," endeavoring to sever
    others from the faith even as he severed himself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The species of a quality or form are not
    diversified by the fact of its being the term "wherefrom" or "whereto" of
    movement: on the contrary, it is the movement that takes its species from
    the terms. Now apostasy regards unbelief as the term "whereto" of the
    movement of withdrawal from the faith; wherefore apostasy does not imply a
    special kind of unbelief, but an aggravating circumstance thereof, according
    to 2 Pt. 2:21: "It had been better for them not to know the truth [Vulg.:
    'the way of justice'], than after they had known it, to turn back."<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether a prince forfeits his dominion over his subjects, on account of
    apostasy from the faith, so that they no longer owe him allegiance?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a prince does not so forfeit
    his dominion over his subjects, on account of apostasy from the faith, that
    they no longer owe him allegiance. For Ambrose [*St. Augustine, Super Ps.
    124:3] says that the Emperor Julian, though an apostate, nevertheless had
    under him Christian soldiers, who when he said to them, "Fall into line for
    the defense of the republic," were bound to obey. Therefore subjects are not
    absolved from their allegiance to their prince on account of his
    apostasy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an apostate from the faith is an
    unbeliever. Now we find that certain holy men served unbelieving masters;
    thus Joseph served Pharaoh, Daniel served Nabuchodonosor, and Mardochai
    served Assuerus. Therefore apostasy from the faith does not release subjects
    from allegiance to their sovereign.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as by apostasy from the faith, a
    man turns away from God, so does every sin. Consequently if, on account of
    apostasy from the faith, princes were to lose their right to command those
    of their subjects who are believers, they would equally lose it on account
    of other sins: which is evidently not the case. Therefore we ought not to
    refuse allegiance to a sovereign on account of his apostatizing from the
    faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory VII says (Council, Roman V): "Holding
    to the institutions of our holy predecessors, we, by our apostolic
    authority, absolve from their oath those who through loyalty or through the
    sacred bond of an oath owe allegiance to excommunicated persons: and we
    absolutely forbid them to continue their allegiance to such persons, until
    these shall have made amends." Now apostates from the faith, like heretics,
    are excommunicated, according to the Decretal [*Extra, De Haereticis, cap.
    Ad abolendam]. Therefore princes should not be obeyed when they have
    apostatized from the faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="SS010.html#SSQ10OUTP1"
      >Question [10]</a
    >, <a href="SS010.html#SSQ10A10THEP1">Article [10]</a>), unbelief, in
    itself, is not inconsistent with dominion, since dominion is a device of the
    law of nations which is a human law: whereas the distinction between
    believers and unbelievers is of Divine right, which does not annul human
    right. Nevertheless a man who sins by unbelief may be sentenced to the loss
    of his right of dominion, as also, sometimes, on account of other sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Now it is not within the competency of the Church to punish unbelief in
    those who have never received the faith, according to the saying of the
    Apostle (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++5%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 5:12</a
    >): "What have I to do to judge them that are without?" She can, however,
    pass sentence of punishment on the unbelief of those who have received the
    faith: and it is fitting that they should be punished by being deprived of
    the allegiance of their subjects: for this same allegiance might conduce to
    great corruption of the faith, since, as was stated above (<a
      href="SS012.html#SSQ12A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >, Objection [2]), "a man that is an apostate... with a wicked heart
    deviseth evil, and... soweth discord," in order to sever others from the
    faith. Consequently, as soon as sentence of excommunication is passed on a
    man on account of apostasy from the faith, his subjects are "ipso facto"
    absolved from his authority and from the oath of allegiance whereby they
    were bound to him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> At that time the Church was but recently
    instituted, and had not, as yet, the power of curbing earthly princes; and
    so she allowed the faithful to obey Julian the apostate, in matters that
    were not contrary to the faith, in order to avoid incurring a yet greater
    danger.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As stated in the article, it is not a
    question of those unbelievers who have never received the faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Apostasy from the faith severs man from
    God altogether, as stated above (<a href="SS012.html#SSQ12A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >), which is not the case in any other sin.<br />
