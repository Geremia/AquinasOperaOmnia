          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod mors non sit poena peccati
          primorum parentum. Illud enim quod est homini naturale, non potest

          Mors autem est homini naturalis, quod patet ex hoc quod corpus eius ex
          contrariis componitur; et ex hoc etiam quod mortale ponitur in

          cannot be called a punishment of sin, because sin does not perfect
          nature but vitiates it. Now death is natural to man: and this is
          evident both from the fact that his body is composed of contraries,

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If any one, on account of his fault, be
          deprived of a favor bestowed on him the privation of that favor is a
          punishment of that fault. Now as we stated in the FP, Question [95],
          Article [1]; FP, Question [97], Article [1], God bestowed this favor
          on man, in his primitive state, that as long as his mind was subject
          to God, the lower powers of his soul would be subject to his rational
          mind, and his body to his soul. But inasmuch as through sin man's mind
          withdrew from subjection to God, the result was that neither were his
          lower powers wholly subject to his reason, whence there followed so
          great a rebellion of the carnal appetite against the reason: nor was
          the body wholly subject to the soul; whence arose death and other
          bodily defects. For life and soundness of body depend on the body
          being subject to the soul, as the perfectible is subject to its
          perfection. Consequently, on the other hand, death, sickness, and all
          defects of the body are due to the lack of the body's subjection to
          the soul.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>
          A thing is said to be natural if it proceeds from the principles of
          nature. Now the essential principles of nature are form and matter.
          The form of man is his rational soul, which is, of itself, immortal:
          wherefore death is not natural to man on the part of his form. The
          matter of man is a body such as is composed of contraries, of which
          corruptibility is a necessary consequence, and in this respect death
          is natural to man. Now this condition attached to the nature of the
          human body results from a natural necessity, since it was necessary
          for the human body to be the organ of touch, and consequently a mean
          between objects of touch: and this was impossible, were it not
          composed of contraries, as the Philosopher states (De Anima ii, 11).
          On the other hand, this condition is not attached to the adaptability
          of matter to form because, if it were possible, since the form is
          incorruptible, its matter should rather be incorruptible. In the same
          way a saw needs to be of iron, this being suitable to its form and
          action, so that its hardness may make it fit for cutting. But that it
          be liable to rust is a necessary result of such a matter and is not
          according to the agent's choice; for, if the craftsman were able, of
          the iron he would make a saw that would not rust. Now God Who is the
          author of man is all-powerful, wherefore when He first made man, He
          conferred on him the favor of being exempt from the necessity
          resulting from such a matter: which favor, however, was withdrawn
          through the sin of our first parents. Accordingly death is both
          natural on account of a condition attaching to matter, and penal on
          account of the loss of the Divine favor preserving man from death

          Ad quartum dicendum quod aliquis defectus ex peccato consequitur
          dupliciter. Uno modo, per modum poenae taxatae a iudice. Et talis
          defectus aequalis debet esse in his ad quos aequaliter pertinet
          peccatum. Alius autem defectus est qui ex huiusmodi poena per accidens

          via. Et talis defectus culpae non proportionatur, nec ab homine iudice

          poena taxata pro primo peccato, proportionaliter ei respondens, fuit

          futurorum eventuum, ex dispensatione divinae providentiae huiusmodi
          poenalitates diversimode in diversis inveniuntur, non quidem propter
          aliqua merita praecedentia hanc vitam, ut Origenes posuit (hoc enim
          est contra id quod dicitur Rom. IX, cum nondum aliquid boni aut mali
          egissent; est etiam contra hoc quod in primo ostensum est, quod anima
          non est creata ante corpus); sed vel in poenam paternorum peccatorum,
          inquantum filius est quaedam res patris, unde frequenter parentes
          puniuntur in prole; vel etiam propter remedium salutis eius qui
          huiusmodi poenalitatibus subditur, ut scilicet per hoc a peccatis

          A twofold defect arises from sin. One is by way of a punishment
          appointed by a judge: and such a defect should be equal in those to
          whom the sin pertains equally. The other defect is that which results
          accidentally from this punishment; for instance, that one who has been
          deprived of his sight for a sin he has committed, should fall down in
          the road. Such a defect is not proportionate to the sin, nor does a
          human judge take it into account, since he cannot foresee chance
          happenings. Accordingly, the punishment appointed for the first sin
          and proportionately corresponding thereto, was the withdrawal of the
          Divine favor whereby the rectitude and integrity of human nature was
          maintained. But the defects resulting from this withdrawal are death
          and other penalties of the present life. Wherefore these punishments
          need not be equal in those to whom the first sin equally appertains.
          Nevertheless, since God foreknows all future events, Divine providence
          has so disposed that these penalties are apportioned in different ways
          to various people. This is not on account of any merits or demerits
          previous to this life, as Origen held [*Peri Archon ii, 9]: for this
          is contrary to the words of Rm. 9:11, "When they... had not done any
          good or evil"; and also contrary to statements made in the FP,
          Question [90], Article [4]; FP, Question [118], Article [3], namely
          that the soul is not created before the body: but either in punishment
          of their parents' sins, inasmuch as the child is something belonging
          to the father, wherefore parents are often punished in their children;
          or again it is for a remedy intended for the spiritual welfare of the
          person who suffers these penalties, to wit that he may thus be turned
          away from his sins, or lest he take pride in his virtues, and that he
          may be crowned for his patience.<br />

          Death may be considered in two ways. First, as an evil of human
          nature, and thus it is not of God, but is a defect befalling man
          through his fault. Secondly, as having an aspect of good, namely as
          being a just punishment, and thus it is from God. Wherefore Augustine
          says (Retract. i, 21) that God is not the author of death, except in

          Death may be considered in two ways. First, as the privation of life,
          and thus death cannot be felt, since it is the privation of sense and
          life. In this way it involves not pain of sense but pain of loss.
          Secondly, it may be considered as denoting the corruption which ends
          in the aforesaid privation. Now we may speak of corruption even as of
          generation in two ways: in one way as being the term of alteration,
          and thus in the first instant in which life departs, death is said to
          be present. In this way also death has no pain of sense. In another
          way corruption may be taken as including the previous alteration: thus
          a person is said to die, when he is in motion towards death; just as a
          thing is said to be engendered, while in motion towards the state of
          having been engendered: and thus death may be painful.<br />

          without pain to the bearer. Likewise the "subjection of woman to man"
          results from the perfection of the male, and the imperfection of the

          As stated in the foregoing Article, on account of their sin, our first
          parents were deprived of the Divine favor, whereby the integrity of
          human nature was maintained in them, and by the withdrawal of this
          favor human nature incurred penal defects. Hence they were punished in
          two ways. In the first place by being deprived of that which was
          befitting the state of integrity, namely the place of the earthly
          paradise: and this is indicated (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A23"
            >Gn. 3:23</a
          >) where it is stated that "God sent him out of the paradise of
          pleasure." And since he was unable, of himself, to return to that
          state of original innocence, it was fitting that obstacles should be
          placed against his recovering those things that were befitting his
          original state, namely food (lest he should take of the tree of life)
          and place; for "God placed before... paradise... Cherubim, and a
          flaming sword." Secondly, they were punished by having appointed to
          them things befitting a nature bereft of the aforesaid favor: and this
          as regards both the body and the soul. With regard to the body, to

          These punishments affect all somewhat. For any woman who conceives
          must needs suffer sorrows and bring forth her child with pain: except
          the Blessed Virgin, who "conceived without corruption, and bore
          without pain" [*St. Bernard, Serm. in Dom. inf. oct. Assum. B. V. M.],
          because her conceiving was not according to the law of nature,
          transmitted from our first parents. And if a woman neither conceives
          nor bears, she suffers from the defect of barrenness, which outweighs
          the aforesaid punishments. Likewise whoever tills the soil must needs
          eat his bread in the sweat of his brow: while those who do not
          themselves work on the land, are busied with other labors, for "man is

          Apart from the mysteries of the spiritual interpretation, this place
          would seem to be inaccessible, chiefly on account of the extreme heat
          in the middle zone by reason of the nighness of the sun. This is
          denoted by the "flaming sword," which is described as "turning every
          way," as being appropriate to the circular movement that causes this
          heat. And since the movements of corporal creatures are set in order
          through the ministry of the angels, according to Augustine (De Trin.
          iii, 4), it was fitting that, besides the sword turning every way,
          there should be cherubim "to keep the way of the tree of life." Hence
          Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 40): "It is to be believed that even
