        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod accipere usuram pro pecunia
          mutuata non sit peccatum. Nullus enim peccat ex hoc quod sequitur
          exemplum Christi. Sed dominus de seipso dicit, Luc. XIX, ego veniens
          cum usuris exegissem illam, scilicet pecuniam mutuatam. Ergo non est
          peccatum accipere usuram pro mutuo pecuniae.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not a sin to take
          usury for money lent. For no man sins through following the example of
          Christ. But Our Lord said of Himself (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++19%3A23"
            >Lk. 19:23</a
          >): "At My coming I might have exacted it," i.e. the money lent, "with
          usury." Therefore it is not a sin to take usury for lending money.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, sicut dicitur in Psalm., lex domini immaculata, quia
              scilicet peccatum prohibet. Sed in lege divina conceditur aliqua
              usura, secundum illud Deut. XXIII, non faenerabis fratri tuo ad
              usuram pecuniam, nec fruges nec quamlibet aliam rem, sed alieno.
              Et, quod plus est, etiam in praemium repromittitur pro lege
              servata, secundum illud Deut. XXVIII, faenerabis gentibus multis;
              et ipse a nullo faenus accipies. Ergo accipere usuram non est
              peccatum.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Ps. 18:8, "The
              law of the Lord is unspotted," because, to wit, it forbids sin.
              Now usury of a kind is allowed in the Divine law, according to Dt.
              23:19,20: "Thou shalt not fenerate to thy brother money, nor corn,
              nor any other thing, but to the stranger": nay more, it is even
              promised as a reward for the observance of the Law, according to
              Dt. 28:12: "Thou shalt fenerate* to many nations, and shalt not
              borrow of any one." [*'Faeneraberis'—'Thou shalt lend upon usury.'
              The Douay version has simply 'lend.' The objection lays stress on
              the word 'faeneraberis': hence the necessity of rendering it by
              'fenerate.'] Therefore it is not a sin to take usury.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, in rebus humanis determinatur iustitia per leges
                  civiles. Sed secundum eas conceditur usuras accipere. Ergo
                  videtur non esse illicitum.
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in human affairs justice
                  is determined by civil laws. Now civil law allows usury to be
                  taken. Therefore it seems to be lawful.<br />

                    <td style="text-align: justify">
                      Praeterea, praetermittere consilia non obligat ad
                      peccatum. Sed Luc. VI inter alia consilia ponitur, date
                      mutuum, nihil inde sperantes. Ergo accipere usuram non est
                      peccatum.

                    <td style="text-align: justify">
                      <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the counsels are not
                      binding under sin. But, among other counsels we find (<a
                        href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++6%3A35"
                        >Lk. 6:35</a
                      >): "Lend, hoping for nothing thereby." Therefore it is
                      not a sin to take usury.<br />

                          non tenetur, non videtur esse secundum se peccatum.
                          Sed non in quolibet casu tenetur pecuniam habens eam
                          proximo mutuare. Ergo licet ei aliquando pro mutuo
                          accipere pretium.
                        </td>
                        <td style="text-align: justify">
                          <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it does not seem
                          to be in itself sinful to accept a price for doing
                          what one is not bound to do. But one who has money is
                          not bound in every case to lend it to his neighbor.
                          Therefore it is lawful for him sometimes to accept a
                          price for lending it.<br />
                          <tr valign="top">

                              formatum, non differt specie. Sed licet accipere
                              pretium pro vasis argenteis accommodatis. Ergo
                              etiam licet accipere pretium pro mutuo argenti
                              monetati. Usura ergo non est secundum se peccatum.

                              <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, silver made
                              into coins does not differ specifically from
                              silver made into a vessel. But it is lawful to
                              accept a price for the loan of a silver vessel.
                              Therefore it is also lawful to accept a price for
                              the loan of a silver coin. Therefore usury is not
                              in itself a sin.<br />

                                          secundum se iniustum, quia venditur id
                                          quod non est, per quod manifeste
                                          inaequalitas constituitur, quae
                                          iustitiae contrariatur. Ad cuius

                                          res sunt quarum usus est ipsarum rerum
                                          consumptio, sicut vinum consumimus eo
                                          utendo ad potum, et triticum
                                          consumimus eo utendo ad cibum. Unde in

                                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To take
                                          usury for money lent is unjust in
                                          itself, because this is to sell what
                                          does not exist, and this evidently
                                          leads to inequality which is contrary
                                          to justice. In order to make this
                                          evident, we must observe that there
                                          are certain things the use of which
                                          consists in their consumption: thus we
                                          consume wine when we use it for drink
                                          and we consume wheat when we use it
                                          for food. Wherefore in such like
                                          things the use of the thing must not
                                          be reckoned apart from the thing
                                          itself, and whoever is granted the use
                                          of the thing, is granted the thing
                                          itself and for this reason, to lend
                                          things of this kin is to transfer the
                                          ownership. Accordingly if a man wanted
                                          to sell wine separately from the use
                                          of the wine, he would be selling the
                                          same thing twice, or he would be
                                          selling what does not exist, wherefore
                                          he would evidently commit a sin of
                                          injustice. In like manner he commits
                                          an injustice who lends wine or wheat,
                                          and asks for double payment, viz. one,
                                          the return of the thing in equal
                                          measure, the other, the price of the
                                          use, which is called usury.<br />

                                              On the other hand, there are

                                              to use a house is to dwell in it,
                                              not to destroy it. Wherefore in
                                              such things both may be granted:
                                              for instance, one man may hand
                                              over to another the ownership of
                                              his house while reserving to
                                              himself the use of it for a time,
                                              or vice versa, he may grant the
                                              use of the house, while retaining
                                              the ownership. For this reason a
                                              man may lawfully make a charge for
                                              the use of his house, and, besides
                                              this, revendicate the house from
                                              the person to whom he has granted

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one may ask for some
          other kind of consideration for money lent. For everyone may lawfully
          seek to indemnify himself. Now sometimes a man suffers loss through
          lending money. Therefore he may lawfully ask for or even exact
          something else besides the money lent.<br />

              Praeterea, unusquisque tenetur ex quodam debito honestatis aliquid
              recompensare ei qui sibi gratiam fecit, ut dicitur in V Ethic. Sed
              ille qui alicui in necessitate constituto pecuniam mutuat, gratiam
              facit, unde et gratiarum actio ei debetur. Ergo ille qui recipit
              tenetur naturali debito aliquid recompensare. Sed non videtur esse
              illicitum obligare se ad aliquid ad quod quis ex naturali iure
              tenetur. Ergo non videtur esse illicitum si aliquis, pecuniam
              alteri mutuans, in obligationem deducat aliquam recompensationem.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as stated in Ethic. v, 5, one
              is in duty bound by a point of honor, to repay anyone who has done
              us a favor. Now to lend money to one who is in straits is to do
              him a favor for which he should be grateful. Therefore the
              recipient of a loan, is bound by a natural debt to repay
              something. Now it does not seem unlawful to bind oneself to an
              obligation of the natural law. Therefore it is not unlawful, in
              lending money to anyone, to demand some sort of compensation as
              condition of the loan.<br />

                  lingua, et ab obsequio, ut dicit Glossa Isaiae XXXIII, beatus
                  qui excutit manus suas ab omni munere. Sed licet accipere
                  servitium, vel etiam laudem, ab eo cui quis pecuniam mutuavit.
                  Ergo, pari ratione, licet quodcumque aliud munus accipere.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as there is real
                  remuneration, so is there verbal remuneration, and
                  remuneration by service, as a gloss says on Is. 33:15,
                  "Blessed is he that shaketh his hands from all bribes [*Vulg.:
                  'Which of you shall dwell with everlasting burnings?... He
                  that shaketh his hands from all bribes.']." Now it is lawful
                  to accept service or praise from one to whom one has lent
                  money. Therefore in like manner it is lawful to accept any

                                          tacit or express agreement, in return

                                          that is consumed by being used, so
                                          also is it a like sin, by tacit or

                                          Yet there would be no sin in receiving
                                          something of the kind, not as exacting

                                                  he incurs of something he
                                                  ought to have, for this is not
                                                  to sell the use of money but
                                                  to avoid a loss. It may also
                                                  happen that the borrower
                                                  avoids a greater loss than the
                                                  lender incurs, wherefore the
                                                  borrower may repay the lender
                                                  with what he has gained. But
                                                  the lender cannot enter an
                                                  agreement for compensation,
                                                  through the fact that he makes
                                                  no profit out of his money:
                                                  because he must not sell that
                                                  which he has not yet and may
                                                  be prevented in many ways from

                                                      according to the favor
                                                      received. Wherefore the
                                                      borrower of money or any

                                                      than he received in loan:
                                                      and consequently it is

          restore whatever profits he has made out of money gotten by usury. For
          the Apostle says (<a

            >Rm. 11:16</a

          the root be rotten so are the branches. But the root was infected with
          usury. Therefore whatever profit is made therefrom is infected with
          usury. Therefore he is bound to restore it.<br />

              accruing from usury must be sold, and the price repaid to the
              persons from whom the usury was extorted." Therefore, likewise,

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod non liceat pecuniam accipere
          mutuo sub usura. Dicit enim apostolus, Rom. I, quod digni sunt morte
          non solum qui faciunt peccata, sed etiam qui consentiunt facientibus.
          Sed ille qui accipit pecuniam mutuo sub usuris consentit usurario in
          suo peccato, et praebet ei occasionem peccandi. Ergo etiam ipse

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not lawful to
          borrow money under a condition of usury. For the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++1%3A32"
            >Rm. 1:32</a
          >) that they "are worthy of death... not only they that do" these
          sins, "but they also that consent to them that do them." Now he that
          borrows money under a condition of usury consents in the sin of the
          usurer, and gives him an occasion of sin. Therefore he sins also.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, pro nullo commodo temporali debet aliquis alteri

              rationem scandali activi, quod semper est peccatum, ut supra
              dictum est. Sed ille qui petit mutuum ab usurario expresse dat ei
              occasionem peccandi. Ergo pro nullo commodo temporali excusatur.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, for no temporal advantage
              ought one to give another an occasion of committing a sin: for
              this pertains to active scandal, which is always sinful, as stated
              above (<a href="SS043.html#SSQ43OUTP1">Question [43]</a>,
              <a href="SS043.html#SSQ43A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now he that
              seeks to borrow from a usurer gives him an occasion of sin.
              Therefore he is not to be excused on account of any temporal
              advantage.<br />

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it seems no less necessary

                  from him. Now it seems altogether unlawful to deposit one's

                  one's sword with a madman, a maiden with a libertine, or food

                      stated in the same book (ch. 5). Now a usurer sins by

                          of another's sin for a good end, since even God uses
                          all sin for some good, since He draws some good from
                          every evil as stated in the Enchiridion (xi). Hence

                          use of an oath taken by a man swearing by false gods

                          them) Augustine (Ep. xlvii) answered that he who uses,
                          not for a bad but for a good purpose, the oath of a
                          man that swears by false gods, is a party, not to his
                          sin of swearing by demons, but to his good compact
                          whereby he kept his word. If however he were to induce
                          him to swear by false gods, he would sin.<br />

                                          habenti alias unde usuras exerceret;
                                          vel hac intentione committeret ut inde
                                          copiosius per usuram lucraretur; daret
                                          materiam peccanti. Unde et ipse esset
                                          particeps culpae. Si autem aliquis
                                          usurario alias habenti unde usuras
                                          exerceat, pecuniam suam committat ut
                                          tutius servetur, non peccat, sed
                                          utitur homine peccatore ad bonum.
