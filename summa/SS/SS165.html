          appointed to the angels' sin and to man's, according to Mt. 25:41, "Go
          [Vulg.: 'Depart from Me'] you cursed into everlasting fire, which was
          prepared for the devil and his angels." Now the angels' first sin did
          not follow a temptation from without. Therefore neither should man's

          Respondeo dicendum quod divina sapientia disponit omnia suaviter, ut
          dicitur Sap. VIII, inquantum scilicet sua providentia singulis
          attribuit quae eis competunt secundum suam naturam; quia, ut Dionysius
          dicit, IV cap. de Div. Nom., providentiae non est naturam corrumpere,
          sed salvare. Hoc autem pertinet ad conditionem humanae naturae, ut ab
          aliis creaturis iuvari vel impediri possit. Unde conveniens fuit ut
          Deus hominem in statu innocentiae et tentari permitteret per malos
          Angelos, et iuvari eum faceret per bonos. Ex speciali autem beneficio
          gratiae hoc erat ei collatum, ut nulla creatura exterior ei posset
          nocere contra propriam voluntatem, per quam etiam tentationi Daemonis
          resistere poterat.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God's wisdom "orders all things sweetly"
          (Wis. 8:1), inasmuch as His providence appoints to each one that which
          is befitting it according to its nature. For as Dionysius says (Div.
          Nom. iv), "it belongs to providence not to destroy, but to maintain,
          nature." Now it is a condition attaching to human nature that one
          creature can be helped or impeded by another. Wherefore it was fitting
          that God should both allow man in the state of innocence to be tempted
          by evil angels, and should cause him to be helped by good angels. And
          by a special favor of grace, it was granted him that no creature
          outside himself could harm him against his own will, whereby he was
          able even to resist the temptation of the demon.<br />

          in qua potest malum culpae inveniri, non autem supra naturam
          angelicam. Tentare autem inducendo ad malum, non est nisi iam
          depravati per culpam. Et ideo conveniens fuit ut homo per Angelum
          malum tentaretur ad peccandum, sicut etiam, secundum naturae ordinem,
          per Angelum bonum promovetur ad perfectionem. Angelus autem a suo
          superiori, scilicet a Deo, in bono perfici potuit, non autem ad

          another that admits of the possibility of the evil of fault: but there
          is not above the angelic nature. Now only one that is already become
          evil through sin can tempt by leading another into evil. Hence it was
          fitting that by an evil angel man should be tempted to sin, even as
          according to the order of nature he is moved forward to perfection by
          means of a good angel. An angel could be perfected in good by
          something above him, namely by God, but he could not thus be led into
          sin, because according to James 1:13, "God is not a tempter of
          evils."<br />

          conditio naturae ipsius, ut propriae voluntati relinqueretur, secundum
          illud Eccli. XV, Deus reliquit hominem in manu consilii sui. Unde
          Augustinus dicit, XI super Gen. ad Litt., non mihi videtur magnae
          laudis futurum fuisse hominem, si propterea posset bene vivere quia

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as God knew that man, through
          being tempted, would fall into sin, so too He knew that man was able,
          by his free will, to resist the tempter. Now the condition attaching
          to man's nature required that he should be left to his own will,
          according to Ecclus. 15:14, "God left" man "in the hand of his own
          counsel." Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. xi, 4): "It seems to me
          that man would have had no prospect of any special praise, if he were
          able to lead a good life simply because there was none to persuade him
          to lead an evil life; since both by nature he had the power, and in
          his power he had the will, not to consent to the persuader."<br />

          principale agens, sed mulier assumebatur quasi instrumentum
          tentationis ad deiiciendum virum. Tum quia mulier erat infirmior viro,
          unde magis seduci poterat. Tum etiam, propter coniunctionem eius ad
          virum, maxime per eam Diabolus poterat virum seducere. Non autem est
          eadem ratio principalis agentis et instrumenti. Nam principale agens
          oportet esse potius, quod non requiritur in agente instrumentali.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the act of tempting the devil
          was by way of principal agent; whereas the woman was employed as an
          instrument of temptation in bringing about the downfall of the man,
          both because the woman was weaker than the man, and consequently more
          liable to be deceived, and because, on account of her union with man,
          the devil was able to deceive the man especially through her. Now
          there is no parity between principal agent and instrument, because the
          principal agent must exceed in power, which is not requisite in the
          instrumental agent.<br />

          Ad secundum dicendum quod suggestio qua spiritualiter Diabolus aliquid
          homini suggerit, ostendit Diabolus plus habere potestatis in homine
          quam suggestio exterior, quia per suggestionem interiorem immutatur a
          Diabolo saltem hominis phantasia, sed per suggestionem exteriorem
          immutatur sola exterior creatura. Diabolus autem minimum potestatis
          habebat in homine ante peccatum et ideo non potuit eum interiori
          suggestione, sed solum exteriori tentare.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A suggestion whereby the devil
          suggests something to man spiritually, shows the devil to have more
          power against man than outward suggestion has, since by an inward
          suggestion, at least, man's imagination is changed by the devil [*Cf.
          FP, Question [91], Article [3]]; whereas by an outward suggestion, a
          change is wrought merely on an outward creature. Now the devil had a
          minimum of power against man before sin, wherefore he was unable to
          tempt him by inward suggestion, but only by outward suggestion.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b>
          According to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. xi, 29), "the serpent is
          described as most prudent or subtle, on account of the cunning of the
          devil, who wrought his wiles in it: thus, we speak of a prudent or
          cunning tongue, because it is the instrument of a prudent or cunning
          man in advising something prudently or cunningly. Nor indeed (Gen. ad
          lit. xi, 28) did the serpent understand the sounds which were conveyed
          through it to the woman; nor again are we to believe that its soul was
          changed into a rational nature, since not even men, who are rational
          by nature, know what they say when a demon speaks in them. Accordingly
          (Gen. ad lit. xi, 29) the serpent spoke to man, even as the ass on
          which Balaam sat spoke to him, except that the former was the work of
          a devil, whereas the latter was the work of an angel. Hence (Gen. ad
          lit. xi, 36) the serpent was not asked why it had done this, because
          it had not done this in its own nature, but the devil in it, who was
          already condemned to everlasting fire on account of his sin: and the
          words addressed to the serpent were directed to him who wrought
          through the serpent."<br />

          Et sicut Augustinus dicit, in libro super Gen. contra Manichaeos, nunc
          quidem eius poena, idest Diaboli, dicitur qua nobis cavendus est, non
          ea quae ultimo iudicio reservatur. Per hoc enim quod ei dicitur,
          maledictus es inter omnia animantia et bestias terrae, pecora illi
          praeponuntur, non in potestate, sed in conservatione naturae suae,
          quia pecora non amiserunt beatitudinem aliquam caelestem, quam nunquam
          habuerunt, sed in sua natura quam acceperunt, peragunt vitam. Dicitur
          etiam ei, pectore et ventre repes, secundum aliam litteram. Ubi nomine
          pectoris significatur superbia, quia ibi dominatur impetus animae,
          nomine autem ventris significatur carnale desiderium, quia haec pars
          mollior sentitur in corpore. His autem rebus serpit ad eos quos vult
          decipere. Quod autem dicitur, terram comedes cunctis diebus vitae
          tuae, duobus modis intelligi potest. Vel, ad te pertinebunt quos
          terrena cupiditate deceperis, idest peccatores, qui terrae nomine
          significantur. Vel tertium genus tentationis his verbis figuratur,
          quod est curiositas, terram enim qui manducat, profunda et tenebrosa
          penetrat. Per hoc autem quod inimicitiae ponuntur inter ipsum et
          mulierem, ostenditur non posse nos a Diabolo tentari nisi per illam
          animalem partem quae quasi mulieris imaginem in homine ostendit. Semen
          autem Diaboli est perversa suggestio, semen mulieris, fructus boni
          operis, quod perversae suggestioni resistit. Et ideo observat serpens
          plantam mulieris, ut, si quando in illicita illabitur, delectatio
          illam capiat, et illa observat caput eius, ut eum in ipso initio malae
          suasionis excludat.

          Moreover, as again Augustine says (Super Gen. contra Manich. ii,
          17,18), "his, that is, the devil's, punishment mentioned here is that
          for which we must be on our guard against him, not that which is
          reserved till the last judgment. For when it was said to him: 'Thou
          art cursed among all cattle and beasts of the earth,' the cattle are
          set above him, not in power, but in the preservation of their nature,
          since the cattle lost no heavenly bliss, seeing that they never had
          it, but they continue to live in the nature which they received." It
          is also said to him: "'Upon thy breast and belly shalt thou creep,'"
          according to another version [*The Septuagint] "Here the breast
          signifies pride, because it is there that the impulse of the soul
          dominates, while the belly denotes carnal desire, because this part of
          the body is softest to the touch: and on these he creeps to those whom
          he wishes to deceive." The words, "'Earth shalt thou eat all the days
          of thy life' may be understood in two ways. Either 'Those shall belong
          to thee, whom thou shalt deceive by earthly lust,' namely sinners who
          are signified under the name of earth, or a third kind of temptation,
          namely curiosity, is signified by these words: for to eat earth is to
          look into things deep and dark." The putting of enmities between him
          and the woman "means that we cannot be tempted by the devil, except
          through that part of the soul which bears or reflects the likeness of
          a woman. The seed of the devil is the temptation to evil, the seed of
          the woman is the fruit of good works, whereby the temptation to evil
          is resisted. Wherefore the serpent lies in wait for the woman's heel,
          that if at any time she fall away towards what is unlawful, pleasure
          may seize hold of her: and she watches his head that she may shut him
          out at the very outset of the evil temptation."<br />
