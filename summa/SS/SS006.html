<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the cause of faith, under which head there are two 
points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS006.html#SSQ6A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether faith is infused into man by God?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="SS006.html#SSQ6A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?

<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that faith is not infused into man by God. For 
Augustine says (De Trin. xiv) that "science begets faith in us, and 
nourishes, defends and strengthens it." Now those things which science 
begets in us seem to be acquired rather than infused. Therefore faith 
does not seem to be in us by Divine infusion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that to which man attains by hearing and seeing, seems 
to be acquired by him. Now man attains to belief, both by seeing 
miracles, and by hearing the teachings of faith: for it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++4%3A53">Jn. 4:53</a>): "The father . . . knew that it was at the same hour, that Jesus 
said to him, Thy son liveth; and himself believed, and his whole house"; 
and (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++10%3A17">Rm. 10:17</a>) it is said that "faith is through hearing." Therefore man 
attains to faith by acquiring it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which depends on a man's will can be acquired by 
him. But "faith depends on the believer's will,"  according to Augustine 
(De Praedest. Sanct. v). Therefore faith can be acquired by man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Eph++2%3A8,9">Eph. 2:8,9</a>): "By grace you are saved 
through faith, and that not of yourselves . . . that no man may glory . . 
. for it is the gift of God."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Two things are requisite for faith. First, that the 
things which are of faith should be proposed to man: this is necessary in 
order that man believe anything explicitly. The second thing requisite 
for faith is the assent of the believer to the things which are proposed 
to him. Accordingly, as regards the first of these, faith must needs be 
from God. Because those things which are of faith surpass human reason, 
hence they do not come to man's knowledge, unless God reveal them. To 
some, indeed, they are revealed by God immediately, as those things which 
were revealed to the apostles and prophets, while to some they are 
proposed by God in sending preachers of the faith, according to Rm. 
10:15: "How shall they preach, unless they be sent?"<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; As regards the second, viz. man's assent to the things which are of 
faith, we may observe a twofold cause, one of external inducement, such 
as seeing a miracle, or being persuaded by someone to embrace the faith: 
neither of which is a sufficient cause, since of those who see the same 
miracle, or who hear the same sermon, some believe, and some do not. 
Hence we must assert another internal cause, which moves man inwardly to 
assent to matters of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Pelagians held that this cause was nothing else than man's 
free-will: and consequently they said that the beginning of faith is from 
ourselves, inasmuch as, to wit, it is in our power to be ready to assent 
to things which are of faith, but that the consummation of faith is from 
God, Who proposes to us the things we have to believe. But this is false, 
for, since man, by assenting to matters of faith, is raised above his 
nature, this must needs accrue to him from some supernatural principle 
moving him inwardly; and this is God. Therefore faith, as regards the 
assent which is the chief act of faith, is from God moving man inwardly 
by grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Science begets and nourishes faith, by way of external 
persuasion afforded by science; but the chief and proper cause of faith 
is that which moves man inwardly to assent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument again refers to the cause that proposes 
outwardly the things that are of faith, or persuades man to believe by 
words or deeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To believe does indeed depend on the will of the believer: 
but man's will needs to be prepared by God with grace, in order that he 
may be raised to things which are above his nature, as stated above (<A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="SS002.html#SSQ2A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).

<H3 Align="Left">Whether lifeless faith is a gift of God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that lifeless faith is not a gift of God. For it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++32%3A4">Dt. 32:4</a>) that "the works of God are perfect." Now lifeless 
faith is something imperfect. Therefore it is not the work of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as an act is said to be deformed through lacking 
its due form, so too is faith called lifeless [informis] when it lacks 
the form due to it. Now the deformed act of sin is not from God, as 
stated above (<A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS079.html#FSQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS079.html#FSQ79A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2). Therefore neither is lifeless faith 
from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whomsoever God heals, He heals wholly: for it is written 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++7%3A23">Jn. 7:23</a>): "If a man receive circumcision on the sabbath-day, that the 
law of Moses may not be broken; are you angry at Me because I have healed 
the whole man on the sabbath-day?" Now faith heals man from unbelief. 
Therefore whoever receives from God the gift of faith, is at the same 
time healed from all his sins. But this is not done except by living 
faith. Therefore living faith alone is a gift of God: and consequently 
lifeless faith is not from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on 1 Cor. 13:2 says that "the faith which lacks 
charity is a gift of God." Now this is lifeless faith. Therefore lifeless 
faith is a gift of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Lifelessness is a privation. Now it must be noted that 
privation is sometimes essential to the species, whereas sometimes it is 
not, but supervenes in a thing already possessed of its proper species: 
thus privation of the due equilibrium of the humors is essential to the 
species of sickness, while darkness is not essential to a diaphanous 
body, but supervenes in it. Since, therefore, when we assign the cause of 
a thing, we intend to assign the cause of that thing as existing in its 
proper species, it follows that what is not the cause of privation, 
cannot be assigned as the cause of the thing to which that privation 
belongs as being essential to its species. For we cannot assign as the 
cause of a sickness, something which is not the cause of a disturbance in 
the humors: though we can assign as cause of a diaphanous body, something 
which is not the cause of the darkness, which is not essential to the 
diaphanous body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the lifelessness of faith is not essential to the species of faith, 
since faith is said to be lifeless through lack of an extrinsic form, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="SS004.html#SSQ4A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Consequently the cause of lifeless faith is 
that which is the cause of faith strictly so called: and this is God, as 
stated above (<A Href="SS006.html#SSQ6A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). It follows, therefore, that lifeless faith is a gift 
of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Lifeless faith, though it is not simply perfect with the 
perfection of a virtue, is, nevertheless, perfect with a perfection that 
suffices for the essential notion of faith.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The deformity of an act is essential to the act's species, 
considered as a moral act, as stated above (<A Href="../FP.html">FP</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>, <A Href="../FP/FP048.html#FPQ48A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, 
Question [18], Article [5]): for an act is said to be deformed through being deprived of 
an intrinsic form, viz. the due commensuration of the act's 
circumstances. Hence we cannot say that God is the cause of a deformed 
act, for He is not the cause of its deformity, though He is the cause of 
the act as such.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We may also reply that deformity denotes not only privation of a due 
form, but also a contrary disposition, wherefore deformity is compared to 
the act, as falsehood is to faith. Hence, just as the deformed act is not 
from God, so neither is a false faith; and as lifeless faith is from God, 
so too, acts that are good generically, though not quickened by charity, 
as is frequently the case in sinners, are from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[6] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who receives faith from God without charity, is healed 
from unbelief, not entirely (because the sin of his previous unbelief is 
not removed) but in part, namely, in the point of ceasing from committing 
such and such a sin. Thus it happens frequently that a man desists from 
one act of sin, through God causing him thus to desist, without desisting 
from another act of sin, through the instigation of his own malice. And 
in this way sometimes it is granted by God to a man to believe, and yet 
he is not granted the gift of charity: even so the gift of prophecy, or 
the like, is given to some without charity.<br>
