<H3 Align="Left">Whether presumption trusts in God or in our own power?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that presumption, which is a sin against the Holy 
Ghost, trusts, not in God, but in our own power. For the lesser the 
power, the more grievously does he sin who trusts in it too much. But 
man's power is less than God's. Therefore it is a more grievous sin to 
presume on human power than to presume on the power of God. Now the sin 
against the Holy Ghost is most grievous. Therefore presumption, which is 
reckoned a species of sin against the Holy Ghost, trusts to human rather 
than to Divine power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, other sins arise from the sin against the Holy Ghost, 
for this sin is called malice which is a source from which sins arise. 
Now other sins seem to arise from the presumption whereby man presumes on 
himself rather than from the presumption whereby he presumes on God, 
since self-love is the origin of sin, according to Augustine (De Civ. Dei 
xiv, 28). Therefore it seems that presumption which is a sin against the 
Holy Ghost, relies chiefly on human power.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sin arises from the inordinate conversion to a mutable 
good. Now presumption is a sin. Therefore it arises from turning to human 
power, which is a mutable good, rather than from turning to the power of 
God, which is an immutable good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Just as, through despair, a man despises the Divine 
mercy, on which hope relies, so, through presumption, he despises the 
Divine justice, which punishes the sinner. Now justice is in God even as 
mercy is. Therefore, just as despair consists in aversion from God, so 
presumption consists in inordinate conversion to Him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Presumption seems to imply immoderate hope. Now the 
object of hope is an arduous possible good: and a thing is possible to a 
man in two ways: first by his own power; secondly, by the power of God 
alone. With regard to either hope there may be presumption owing to lack 
of moderation. As to the hope whereby a man relies on his own power, 
there is presumption if he tends to a good as though it were possible to 
him, whereas it surpasses his  powers, according to Judith 6:15: "Thou 
humblest them that presume of themselves." This presumption is contrary 
to the virtue of magnanimity which holds to the mean in this kind of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But as to the hope whereby a man relies on the power of God, there may 
be presumption through immoderation, in the fact that a man tends to some 
good as though it were possible by the power and mercy of God, whereas it 
is not possible, for instance, if a man hope to obtain pardon without 
repenting, or glory without merits. This presumption is, properly, the 
sin against the Holy Ghost, because, to wit, by presuming thus a man 
removes or despises the assistance of the Holy Spirit, whereby he is 
withdrawn from sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73OUTP1">Question [73]</a>, <A Href="../FS/FS073.html#FSQ73A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) a sin which 
is against God is, in its genus, graver than other sins. Hence 
presumption whereby a man relies on God inordinately, is a more grievous 
sin than the presumption of trusting in one's own power, since to rely on 
the Divine power for obtaining what is unbecoming to God, is to 
depreciate the Divine power, and it is evident that it is a graver sin to 
detract from the Divine power than to exaggerate one's own.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The presumption whereby a man presumes inordinately on God, 
includes self-love, whereby he loves his own good inordinately. For when 
we desire a thing very much, we think we can easily procure it through 
others, even though we cannot.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Presumption on God's mercy implies both conversion to a 
mutable good, in so far as it arises from an inordinate desire of one's 
own good, and aversion from the immutable good, in as much as it ascribes 
to the Divine power that which is unbecoming to it, for thus man turns 
away from God's power.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether presumption is a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that presumption is not a sin. For no sin is a 
reason why man should be heard by God. Yet, through presumption some are 
heard by God, for it is written (Judith 9:17): "Hear me a poor wretch 
making supplication to Thee, and presuming of Thy mercy." Therefore 
presumption on God's mercy is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, presumption denotes excessive hope. But there cannot be 
excess of that hope which is in God, since His power and mercy are 
infinite. Therefore it seems that presumption is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is a sin does not excuse from sin: for the 
Master says (Sent. ii, D, 22) that "Adam sinned less, because he sinned 
in the hope of pardon," which seems to indicate presumption. Therefore 
presumption is not a sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is reckoned a species of sin against the  Holy Ghost.
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) with regard to despair, 
every appetitive movement that is conformed to a false intellect, is evil 
in itself and sinful. Now presumption is an appetitive movement, since it 
denotes an inordinate hope. Moreover it is conformed to a false 
intellect, just as despair is: for just as it is false that God does not 
pardon the repentant, or that He does not turn sinners to repentance, so 
is it false that He grants forgiveness to those who persevere in their 
sins, and that He gives glory to those who cease from good works: and it 
is to this estimate that the movement of presumption is conformed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Consequently presumption is a sin, but less grave than despair, since, 
on account of His infinite goodness, it is more proper to God to have 
mercy and to spare, than to punish: for the former becomes God in 
Himself, the latter becomes Him by reason of our sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Presumption sometimes stands for hope, because even the 
right hope which we have in God seems to be presumption, if it be 
measured according to man's estate: yet it is not, if we look at the 
immensity of the goodness of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Presumption does not denote excessive hope, as though man 
hoped too much in God; but through man hoping to obtain from God 
something unbecoming to Him; which is the same as to hope too little in 
Him, since it implies a depreciation of His power; as stated above (<A Href="SS021.html#SSQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1).
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> To sin with the intention of persevering in sin and through 
the hope of being pardoned, is presumptuous, and this does not diminish, 
but increases sin. To sin, however, with the hope of obtaining pardon 
some time, and with the intention of refraining from sin and of repenting 
of it, is not presumptuous, but diminishes sin, because this seems to 
indicate a will less hardened in sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether presumption is more opposed to fear than to hope?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that presumption is more opposed to fear than to 
hope. Because inordinate fear is opposed to right fear. Now presumption 
seems to pertain to inordinate fear, for it is written (Wis. 17:10): "A 
troubled conscience always presumes [Douay: 'forecasteth'] grievous 
things," and (Wis. 17:11) that "fear is a help to presumption [*Vulg.: 
'Fear is nothing else but a yielding up of the succours from thought.']." 
Therefore presumption is opposed to fear rather than to hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contraries are most distant from one another. Now 
presumption is more distant from fear than from hope, because presumption 
implies movement to something, just as hope does, whereas fear denotes 
movement from a thing. Therefore presumption  is contrary to fear rather 
than to hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, presumption excludes fear altogether, whereas it does 
not exclude hope altogether, but only the rectitude of hope. Since 
therefore contraries destroy one another, it seems that presumption is 
contrary to fear rather than to hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> When two vices are opposed to one another they are 
contrary to the same virtue, as timidity and audacity are opposed to 
fortitude. Now the sin of presumption is contrary to the sin of despair, 
which is directly opposed to hope. Therefore it seems that presumption 
also is more directly opposed to hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine states (Contra Julian. iv, 3), "every virtue 
not only has a contrary vice manifestly distinct from it, as temerity is 
opposed to prudence, but also a sort of kindred vice, alike, not in truth 
but only in its deceitful appearance, as cunning is opposed to prudence." 
This agrees with the Philosopher who says (Ethic. ii, 8) that a virtue 
seems to have more in common with one of the contrary vices than with the 
other, as temperance with insensibility, and fortitude with audacity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly presumption appears to be manifestly opposed to fear, 
especially servile fear, which looks at the punishment arising from God's 
justice, the remission of which presumption hopes for; yet by a kind of 
false likeness it is more opposed to hope, since it denotes an inordinate 
hope in God. And since things are more directly opposed when they belong 
to the same genus, than when they belong to different genera, it follows 
that presumption is more directly opposed to hope than to fear. For they 
both regard and rely on the same object, hope inordinately, presumption 
inordinately.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as hope is misused in speaking of evils, and properly 
applied in speaking of good, so is presumption: it is in this way that 
inordinate fear is called presumption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Contraries are things that are most distant from one 
another within the same genus. Now presumption and hope denote a movement 
of the same genus, which can be either ordinate or inordinate. Hence 
presumption is more directly opposed to hope than to fear, since it is 
opposed to hope in respect of its specific difference, as an inordinate 
thing to an ordinate one, whereas it is opposed to fear, in respect of 
its generic difference, which is the movement of hope.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Presumption is opposed to fear by a generic contrariety, 
and to the virtue of hope by a specific contrariety. Hence presumption 
excludes fear altogether even generically, whereas it does not exclude 
hope except by reason of its difference, by excluding its ordinateness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether presumption arises from vainglory? <br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that presumption does not arise from vainglory. For 
presumption seems to rely most of all on the Divine mercy. Now mercy 
[misericordia] regards unhappiness [miseriam] which is contrary to glory. 
Therefore presumption does not arise from vainglory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, presumption is opposed to despair. Now despair arises 
from sorrow, as stated above (<A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20OUTP1">Question [20]</a>, <A Href="SS020.html#SSQ20A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 2). Since therefore 
opposites have opposite causes, presumption would seem to arise from 
pleasure, and consequently from sins of the flesh, which give the most 
absorbing pleasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the vice of presumption consists in tending to some 
impossible good, as though it were possible. Now it is owing to ignorance 
that one deems an impossible thing to be possible. Therefore presumption 
arises from ignorance rather than from vainglory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Moral. xxxi, 45) that "presumption of 
novelties is a daughter of vainglory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="SS021.html#SSQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), presumption is twofold; one 
whereby a man relies on his own power, when he attempts something beyond 
his power, as though it were possible to him. Such like presumption 
clearly arises from vainglory; for it is owing to a great desire for 
glory, that a man attempts things beyond his power, and especially 
novelties which call for greater admiration. Hence Gregory states 
explicitly that presumption of novelties is a daughter of vainglory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The other presumption is an inordinate trust in the Divine mercy or 
power, consisting in the hope of obtaining glory without merits, or 
pardon without repentance. Such like presumption seems to arise directly 
from pride, as though man thought so much of himself as to esteem that 
God would not punish him or exclude him from glory, however much he might 
be a sinner.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT SS Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.
