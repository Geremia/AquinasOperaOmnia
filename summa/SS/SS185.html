          seem to hide up the spiritual corn, if he shun the episcopal state,
          whereas by accepting the episcopal office he enters the state of a

          Respondeo dicendum quod in episcopatu tria possunt considerari. Quorum
          unum est principale et finale, scilicet episcopalis operatio, per quam
          utilitati proximorum intendit, secundum illud Ioan. ult., pasce oves
          meas. Aliud autem est altitudo gradus, quia episcopus super alios
          constituitur, secundum illud Matth. XXIV, fidelis servus et prudens,
          quem constituit dominus super familiam suam. Tertium autem est quod
          consequenter se habet ad ista, scilicet reverentia et honor, et
          sufficientia temporalium, secundum illud I ad Tim. V, qui bene
          praesunt presbyteri, duplici honore digni habeantur. Appetere igitur
          episcopatum ratione huiusmodi circumstantium bonorum, manifestum est
          quod est illicitum, et pertinet ad cupiditatem vel ambitionem. Unde
          contra Pharisaeos dominus dicit, Matth. XXIII, amant primos accubitus
          in cenis et primas cathedras in synagogis, salutationes in foro, et
          vocari ab hominibus, Rabbi. Quantum autem ad secundum, scilicet ad
          celsitudinem gradus, appetere episcopatum est praesumptuosum. Unde
          dominus, Matth. XX, arguit discipulos primatum quaerentes, dicens,
          scitis quia principes gentium dominantur eorum, ubi Chrysostomus dicit
          quod per hoc ostendit quod gentile est primatus cupere; et sic gentium
          comparatione eorum animam aestuantem convertit.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Three things may be considered in the
          episcopal office. One is principal and final, namely the bishop's
          work, whereby the good of our neighbor is intended, according to Jn.
          21:17, "Feed My sheep." Another thing is the height of degree, for a
          bishop is placed above others, according to Mt. 24:45, "A faithful and
          a wise servant, whom his lord hath appointed over his family." The
          third is something resulting from these, namely reverence, honor, and
          a sufficiency of temporalities, according to 1 Tim. 5:17, "Let the
          priests that rule well be esteemed worthy of double honor."
          Accordingly, to desire the episcopal office on account of these
          incidental goods is manifestly unlawful, and pertains to covetousness
          or ambition. Wherefore our Lord said against the Pharisees (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++23%3A6,7"
            >Mt. 23:6,7</a
          >): "They love the first places at feasts, and the first chairs in the
          synagogues, and salutations in the market-place, and to be called by
          men, Rabbi." As regards the second, namely the height of degree, it is
          presumptuous to desire the episcopal office. Hence our Lord reproved
          His disciples for seeking precedence, by saying to them (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++20%3A25"
            >Mt. 20:25</a
          >): "You know that the princes of the gentiles lord it over them."
          Here Chrysostom says (Hom. lxv in Matth.) that in these words "He
          points out that it is heathenish to seek precedence; and thus by
          comparing them to the gentiles He converted their impetuous soul."<br />

          Sed appetere proximis prodesse est secundum se laudabile et virtuosum.

          hoc quod subditis prosit, nisi manifesta necessitate imminente, sicut
          Gregorius dicit, in Pastoral., quod tunc laudabile erat episcopatum

          graviora pervenire, unde non de facili inveniebatur qui hoc onus

          On the other hand, to desire to do good to one's neighbor is in itself
          praiseworthy, and virtuous. Nevertheless, since considered as an
          episcopal act it has the height of degree attached to it, it would
          seem that, unless there be manifest and urgent reason for it, it would
          be presumptuous for any man to desire to be set over others in order
          to do them good. Thus Gregory says (Pastor. i, 8) that "it was
          praiseworthy to seek the office of a bishop when it was certain to
          bring one into graver dangers." Wherefore it was not easy to find a
          person to accept this burden, especially seeing that it is through the
          zeal of charity that one divinely instigated to do so, according to
          Gregory, who says (Pastor. i, 7) that "Isaias being desirous of
          profiting his neighbor, commendably desired the office of
          preacher."<br />

          dignum ad talia opera exequenda, ita quod opus bonum cadat sub
          desiderio, non autem primatus dignitatis. Unde Chrysostomus dicit,
          super Matth., opus quidem desiderare bonum, bonum est, primatum autem
          honoris concupiscere vanitas est. Primatus enim fugientem se

          Nevertheless, anyone may, without presumption, desire to do such like
          works if he should happen to be in that office, or to be worthy of
          doing them; so that the object of his desire is the good work and not
          the precedence in dignity. Hence Chrysostom* says: "It is indeed good
          to desire a good work, but to desire the primacy of honor is vanity.
          For primacy seeks one that shuns it, and abhors one that desires it."

          illo tempore hoc dixit apostolus quo ille qui plebibus praeerat,
          primus ad martyrii tormenta ducebatur, et sic nihil aliud erat quod in
          episcopatu appeti posset nisi bonum opus. Unde Augustinus dicit, XIX
          de Civ. Dei, quod apostolus dicens, qui episcopatum desiderat, bonum
          opus desiderat, exponere voluit quid sit episcopatus, quia nomen
          operis est, non honoris. Scopos quidem intentio est. Ergo episcopein,
          si velimus Latine superintendere possumus dicere, ut intelligat non se
          esse episcopum qui praeesse dilexerit, non prodesse. In actione enim,
          ut parum ante praemittit, non amandus est honor in hac vita sive
          potentia, quoniam omnia vana sunt sub sole, sed opus ipsum quod per
          eundem honorem vel potentiam fit. Et tamen, ut Gregorius dicit, in
          Pastoral., laudans desiderium, scilicet boni operis, in pavorem vertit
          protinus quod laudavit, cum subiungit, oportet autem episcopum
          irreprehensibilem esse, quasi dicat, laudo quod quaeritis, sed discite
          quid quaeratis.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Gregory says (Pastor. i, 8),
          "when the Apostle said this he who was set over the people was the
          first to be dragged to the torments of martyrdom," so that there was
          nothing to be desired in the episcopal office, save the good work.
          Wherefore Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19) that when the Apostle
          said, "'Whoever desireth the office of bishop, desireth a good work,'
          he wished to explain what the episcopacy is: for it denotes work and
          not honor: since {skopos} signifies 'watching.' Wherefore if we like
          we may render {episkopein} by the Latin 'superintendere' [to watch
          over]: thus a man may know himself to be no bishop if he loves to
          precede rather than to profit others." For, as he observed shortly
          before, "in our actions we should seek, not honor nor power in this
          life, since all things beneath the sun are vanity, but the work itself
          which that honor or power enables us to do." Nevertheless, as Gregory
          says (Pastor. i, 8), "while praising the desire" (namely of the good
          work) "he forthwith turns this object of praise into one of fear, when
          he adds: It behooveth... a bishop to be blameless," as though to say:

          Ad secundum dicendum quod non est eadem ratio de statu religionis et
          statu episcopali, propter duo. Primo quidem, quia ad statum
          episcopalem praeexigitur vitae perfectio, ut patet per hoc quod
          dominus a Petro exquisivit si plus eum ceteris diligeret, antequam ei
          committeret pastorale officium. Sed ad statum religionis non
          praeexigitur perfectio, sed est via in perfectionem unde et dominus,
          Matth. XIX, non dixit, si es perfectus, vade et vende omnia quae
          habes, sed, si vis esse perfectus. Et huius differentiae ratio est
          quia, secundum Dionysium, perfectio pertinet active ad episcopum,
          sicut ad perfectorem, ad monachum autem passive, sicut ad perfectum.
          Requiritur autem quod sit perfectus aliquis ad hoc quod possit alios
          ad perfectionem adducere, quod non praeexigitur ab eo qui debet ad
          perfectionem adduci. Est autem praesumptuosum quod aliquis perfectum
          se reputet, non autem quod aliquis ad perfectionem tendat. Secundo,
          quia ille qui statum religionis assumit, se aliis subiicit ad
          spiritualia capienda, et hoc cuilibet licet. Unde Augustinus dicit,
          XIX de Civ. Dei, a studio cognoscendae veritatis nemo prohibetur, quod
          ad laudabile pertinet otium. Sed ille qui transit ad statum
          episcopalem, sublimatur ad hoc quod aliis provideat. Et hanc
          sublimationem nullus debet sibi assumere, secundum illud Heb. V, nemo
          assumit sibi honorem, sed qui vocatur a Deo. Et Chrysostomus dicit,
          super Matth., primatum Ecclesiae concupiscere neque iustum est neque
          utile. Quis enim sapiens vult ultro se subiicere servituti et periculo
          tali ut det rationem pro omni Ecclesia, nisi forte qui non timet Dei
          iudicium, abutens primatu ecclesiastico saeculariter, ut scilicet
          convertat ipsum in saecularem?

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b>
          There is no parity between the religious and the episcopal state, for
          two reasons. First, because perfection of life is a prerequisite of
          the episcopal state, as appears from our Lord asking Peter if he loved
          Him more than the others, before committing the pastoral office to
          him, whereas perfection is not a prerequisite of the religious state,
          since the latter is the way to perfection. Hence our Lord did not say
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A21"
            >Mt. 19:21</a
          >): "If thou art perfect, go, sell all [Vulg.: 'what'] thou hast," but
          "If thou wilt be perfect." The reason for this difference is because,
          according to Dionysius (Eccl. Hier. vi), perfection pertains actively
          to the bishop, as the "perfecter," but to the monk passively as one
          who is "perfected": and one needs to be perfect in order to bring
          others to perfection, but not in order to be brought to perfection.
          Now it is presumptuous to think oneself perfect, but it is not
          presumptuous to tend to perfection. Secondly, because he who enters
          the religious state subjects himself to others for the sake of a
          spiritual profit, and anyone may lawfully do this. Wherefore Augustine
          says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "No man is debarred from striving for the
          knowledge of truth, since this pertains to a praiseworthy ease." On
          the other hand, he who enters the episcopal state is raised up in
          order to watch over others, and no man should seek to be raised thus,
          according to Heb. 5:4, "Neither doth any man take the honor to
          himself, but he that is called by God": and Chrysostom says: "To
          desire supremacy in the Church is neither just nor useful. For what
          wise man seeks of his own accord to submit to such servitude and
          peril, as to have to render an account of the whole Church? None save
          him who fears not God's judgment, and makes a secular abuse of his
          ecclesiastical authority, by turning it to secular uses."<br />

          The dispensing of spiritual corn is not to be carried on in an
          arbitrary fashion, but chiefly according to the appointment and
          disposition of God, and in the second place according to the
          appointment of the higher prelates, in whose person it is said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++4%3A1"
            >1 Cor. 4:1</a
          >): "Let a man so account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the
          dispensers of the mysteries of God." Wherefore a man is not deemed to
          hide spiritual corn if he avoids governing or correcting others, and
          is not competent to do so, neither in virtue of his office nor of his
          superior's command; thus alone is he deemed to hide it, when he
          neglects to dispense it while under obligation to do so in virtue of
          his office, or obstinately refuses to accept the office when it is
          imposed on him. Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xix, 19): "The love
          of truth seeks a holy leisure, the demands of charity undertake an
          honest labor. If no one imposes this burden upon us, we must devote
          ourselves to the research and contemplation of truth, but if it be
          imposed on us, we must bear it because charity demands it of us."<br />

          Jeremias who was fain to hold fast to the love of his Creator by

          by being unwilling to forgo better things in order to adhere to things
          that are not so good. Since then the love of God surpasses the love of
          our neighbor, and the contemplative life is preferable to the active,

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two things have to be considered in the
          acceptance of the episcopal office: first, what a man may fittingly
          desire according to his own will; secondly, what it behooves a man to
          do according to the will of another. As regards his own will it
          becomes a man to look chiefly to his own spiritual welfare, whereas
          that he look to the spiritual welfare of others becomes a man

          Hence just as it is a mark of an inordinate will that a man of his own
          choice incline to be appointed to the government of others, so too it
          indicates an inordinate will if a man definitively refuse the

          No one is bound to obey his superior by doing what is unlawful, as
          appears from what was said above concerning obedience (<a
            href="SS104.html#SSQ104OUTP1"
            >Question [104]</a
          >, <a href="SS104.html#SSQ104A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Accordingly it
          may happen that he who is appointed to the office of prelate perceive
          something in himself on account of which it is unlawful for him to
          accept a prelacy. But this obstacle may sometimes be removed by the
          very person who is appointed to the pastoral cure—for instance, if he
          have a purpose to sin, he may abandon it—and for this reason he is not
          excused from being bound to obey definitely the superior who has
          appointed him. Sometimes, however, he is unable himself to remove the
          impediment that makes the pastoral office unlawful to him, yet the
          prelate who appoints him can do so—for instance, if he be irregular or
          excommunicate. In such a case he ought to make known his defect to the
          prelate who has appointed him; and if the latter be willing to remove
          the impediment, he is bound humbly to obey. Hence when Moses had said
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++4%3A10"
            >Ex. 4:10</a
          >): "I beseech thee, Lord, I am not eloquent from yesterday, and the
          day before," the Lord answered (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++4%3A12"
            >Ex. 4:12</a
          >): "I will be in thy mouth, and I will teach thee what thou shalt
          speak." At other times the impediment cannot be removed, neither by
          the person appointing nor by the one appointed—for instance, if an
          archbishop be unable to dispense from an irregularity; wherefore a
          subject, if irregular, would not be bound to obey him by accepting the
          episcopate or even sacred orders.<br />

          It is not in itself necessary for salvation to accept the episcopal
          office, but it becomes necessary by reason of the superior's command.
          Now one may lawfully place an obstacle to things thus necessary for
          salvation, before the command is given; else it would not be lawful to
          marry a second time, lest one should thus incur an impediment to the
          episcopate or holy orders. But this would not be lawful in things
          necessary for salvation. Hence the Blessed Mark did not act against a
          precept by cutting off his finger, although it is credible that he did
          this by the instigation of the Holy Ghost, without which it would be
          unlawful for anyone to lay hands on himself. If a man take a vow not
          to accept the bishop's office, and by this intend to bind himself not
          even to accept it in obedience to his superior prelate, his vow is
          unlawful; but if he intend to bind himself, so far as it lies with
          him, not to seek the episcopal office, nor to accept it except under
          urgent necessity, his vow is lawful, because he vows to do what it
          becomes a man to do.<br />

          Quae quidem dispensari debent ad utilitatem Ecclesiae, secundum illud
          I ad Cor. XIV, ad aedificationem Ecclesiae quaerite ut abundetis, non

          meliorem quoad regimen Ecclesiae, qui scilicet possit Ecclesiam et

          amant, vel quorum sunt obsequiis deliniti, vel pro quibus maiorum

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In designating a man for the episcopal
          office, something has to be considered on the part of the person
          designate, and something on the part of the designator. For on the
          part of the designator, whether by election or by appointment, it is
          required that he choose such a one as will dispense the divine
          mysteries faithfully. These should be dispensed for the good of the
          Church, according to 1 Cor. 14:12, "Seek to abound unto the edifying
          of the Church"; and the divine mysteries are not committed to men for
          their own meed, which they should await in the life to come.
          Consequently he who has to choose or appoint one for a bishop is not
          bound to take one who is best simply, i.e. according to charity, but
          one who is best for governing the Church, one namely who is able to
          instruct, defend, and govern the Church peacefully. Hence Jerome,
          commenting on Titus 1:5, says against certain persons that "some seek
          to erect as pillars of the Church, not those whom they know to be more
          useful to the Church, but those whom they love more, or those by whose
          obsequiousness they have been cajoled or undone, or for whom some
          person in authority has spoken, and, not to say worse than this, have
          succeeded by means of gifts in being made clerics."<br />

          pastoral cure so long as he is able to procure the spiritual welfare
          of the subjects entrusted to his care: a matter which he must not
          neglect—neither for the sake of the quiet of divine contemplation,
          since the Apostle, on account of the needs of his subjects, suffered
          patiently to be delayed even from the contemplation of the life to
          come, according to Phil. 1:22-25, "What I shall choose I know not, but
          I am straitened between two, having a desire to be dissolved, and to

          At times, however, it happens in several ways that a bishop is
          hindered from procuring the spiritual welfare of his subjects.
          Sometimes on account of his own defect, either of conscience (for
          instance if he be guilty of murder or simony), or of body (for example
          if he be old or infirm), or of irregularity arising, for instance,
          from bigamy. Sometimes he is hindered through some defect in his
          subjects, whom he is unable to profit. Hence Gregory says (Dial. ii,
          3): "The wicked must be borne patiently, when there are some good who
          can be succored, but when there is no profit at all for the good, it
          is sometimes useless to labor for the wicked. Wherefore the perfect
          when they find that they labor in vain are often minded to go
          elsewhere in order to labor with fruit." Sometimes again this
          hindrance arises on the part of others, as when scandal results from a
          certain person being in authority: for the Apostle says (1 Cor. 8:13):
          "If meat scandalize my brother, I will never eat flesh": provided,
          however, the scandal is not caused by the wickedness of persons
          desirous of subverting the faith or the righteousness of the Church;
          because the pastoral cure is not to be laid aside on account of
          scandal of this kind, according to Mt. 15:14, "Let them alone," those
          namely who were scandalized at the truth of Christ's teaching, "they
          are blind, and leaders of the blind."<br />

          Nevertheless just as a man takes upon himself the charge of authority
          at the appointment of a higher superior, so too it behooves him to be
          subject to the latter's authority in laying aside the accepted charge
          for the reasons given above. Hence Innocent III says (Extra, de
          Renunt., cap. Nisi cum pridem): "Though thou hast wings wherewith thou
          art anxious to fly away into solitude, they are so tied by the bonds
          of authority, that thou art not free to fly without our permission."
          For the Pope alone can dispense from the perpetual vow, by which a man
          binds himself to the care of his subjects, when he took upon himself
          the episcopal office.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The perfection of religious and
          that of bishops are regarded from different standpoints. For it
          belongs to the perfection of a religious to occupy oneself in working
          out one's own salvation, whereas it belongs to the perfection of a
          bishop to occupy oneself in working for the salvation of others. Hence
          so long as a man can be useful to the salvation of his neighbor, he
          would be going back, if he wished to pass to the religious state, to
          busy himself only with his own salvation, since he has bound himself
          to work not only for his own but also for others' salvation. Wherefore
          Innocent III says in the Decretal quoted above that "it is more easily
          allowable for a monk to ascend to the episcopacy, than for a bishop to
          descend to the monastic life. If, however, he be unable to procure the

          enter the religious life, and may return to his bishopric should the
          obstacle cease, for instance by the correction of his subjects,
          cessation of the scandal, healing of his infirmity, removal of his
          ignorance by sufficient instruction. Again, if he owed his promotion
          to simony of which he was in ignorance, and resigning his episcopate
          entered the religious life, he can be reappointed to another bishopric
          [*Cap. Post translat., de Renunt.]. On the other hand, if a man be

          monastery that he may do penance, he cannot be reappointed to a

          injustice and robbery oppresses the faithful and the humble."
          Therefore if, on account of the persecution of a tyrant, a bishop

          On the other hand, if the salvation of his subjects can be
          sufficiently provided for by another person in the absence of the

          from his flock, either for the sake of some advantage to the Church,
          or on account of some danger to his person. Hence Augustine says (Ep.
          ccxxviii ad Honorat.): "Christ's servants may flee from one city to
          another, when one of them is specially sought out by persecutors: in
          order that the Church be not abandoned by others who are not so sought
          for. When, however, the same danger threatens all, those who stand in
          need of others must not be abandoned by those whom they need." For "if

          calm, how much more so when it is stormy," as Pope Nicholas I says

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> No one is bound to works of
          supererogation, unless he binds himself specially thereto by vow.
          Hence Augustine says (Ep. cxxvii ad Paulin. et Arment.): "Since you
          have taken the vow, you have already bound yourself, you can no longer
          do otherwise. Before you were bound by the vow, you were free to
          submit." Now it is evident that to live without possessing anything is
          a work of supererogation, for it is a matter not of precept but of
          counsel. Wherefore our Lord after saying to the young man: "If thou
          wilt enter into life, keep the commandments," said afterwards by way
          of addition: "If thou wilt be perfect go sell" all "that thou hast,
          and give to the poor" (<a

          live without possessions of their own; nor indeed does the pastoral
          office, to which they bind themselves, make it necessary for them to

          livelihood from those to whom they preached; wherefore He added: "For

          xvi, 3], we are to understand that our Lord laid these commands on His
          disciples in reference to the mission on which they were sent to
          preach to the Jews, so that they might be encouraged to trust in His
          power, seeing that He provided for their wants without their having
          means of their own. But it does not follow from this that they, or
          their successors, were obliged to preach the Gospel without having
          means of their own: since we read of Paul (<a

            >2 Cor. 11:8</a
          >) that he "received wages" of other churches for preaching to the
          Corinthians, wherefore it is clear that he possessed something sent to
          him by others. And it seems foolish to say that so many holy bishops
          as Athanasius, Ambrose, and Augustine would have disobeyed these
          commandments if they believed themselves bound to observe them.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that bishops sin mortally if
          they distribute not to the poor the ecclesiastical goods which they
          acquire. For Ambrose [*Basil, Serm. lxiv, de Temp., among the
          supposititious works of St. Jerome] expounding Lk. 12:16, "The land of
          a certain... man brought forth plenty of fruits," says: "Let no man
          claim as his own that which he has taken and obtained by violence from
          the common property in excess of his requirements"; and afterwards he
          adds: "It is not less criminal to take from him who has, than, when
          you are able and have plenty to refuse him who has not." Now it is a
          mortal sin to take another's property by violence. Therefore bishops
          sin mortally if they give not to the poor that which they have in
          excess.<br />

          is right that those clerics who receive no goods from their parents
          and relations should be supported from the funds of the Church. But
          those who have sufficient income from their parents and their own
          possessions, if they take what belongs to the poor, they commit and

          Sed ecclesiasticorum bonorum sunt dispensatores vel procuratores,
          dicit enim Augustinus, ad Bonifacium, si privatum possidemus quod
          nobis sufficiat, non illa nostra sunt, sed illorum quorum
          procurationem gerimus, non proprietatem nobis usurpatione damnabili
          vindicemus. Ad dispensatorem autem requiritur bona fides, secundum
          illud I ad Cor. IV, hic iam quaeritur inter dispensatores ut fidelis
          quis inveniatur. Sunt autem bona ecclesiastica non solum in usus
          pauperum, sed etiam ad cultum divinum et necessitates ministrorum
          expendenda. Unde dicitur XII, qu. II, de reditibus Ecclesiae vel
          oblatione fidelium, sola episcopo ex his una portio emittatur; duae
          ecclesiasticis fabricis et erogationi pauperum profuturae a
          presbytero, sub periculo sui ordinis, ministrentur; ultima clericis,
          pro singulorum meritis, dividatur. Si ergo distincta sint bona quae
          debent in usum episcopi cedere, ab his quae sunt pauperibus et
          ministris et cultui Ecclesiae eroganda; et aliquid sibi retinuerit
          episcopus de his quae sunt pauperibus eroganda, vel in usum
          ministrorum aut in cultum divinum expendenda, non est dubium quod
          contra fidem dispensationis agit, et mortaliter peccat, et ad

          On the other hand, they hold ecclesiastical goods as dispensers or
          trustees. For Augustine says (Ep. clxxxv ad Bonif.): "If we possess
          privately what is enough for us, other things belong not to us but to
          the poor, and we have the dispensing of them; but we can claim
          ownership of them only by wicked theft." Now dispensing requires good
          faith, according to 1 Cor. 4:2, "Here now it is required among the
          dispensers that a man be found faithful." Moreover ecclesiastical
          goods are to be applied not only to the good of the poor, but also to
          the divine worship and the needs of its ministers. Hence it is said
          (XII, qu. ii, can. de reditibus): "Of the Church's revenues or the
          offerings of the faithful only one part is to be assigned to the
          bishop, two parts are to be used by the priest, under pain of
          suspension, for the ecclesiastical fabric, and for the benefit of the
          poor; the remaining part is to be divided among the clergy according
          to their respective merits." Accordingly if the goods which are
          assigned to the use of the bishop are distinct from those which are
          appointed for the use of the poor, or the ministers, or for the
          ecclesiastical worship, and if the bishop keeps back for himself part
          of that which should be given to the poor, or to the ministers for
          their use, or expended on the divine worship, without doubt he is an
          unfaithful dispenser, sins mortally, and is bound to restitution.<br />

          As stated above the goods of the Church have to be employed not only

          long as he observes moderation, so, to wit, that they cease to be in
          want without becoming the richer thereby. Hence Ambrose says (De

          your kindred when you know them to be in want; yet not so as to wish

          necessity for helping the poor, he spends the surplus from the Church
          revenue, in buying property, or lays it by for some future use
          connected with the Church or the needs of the poor. But if there be a
          pressing need for helping the poor, to lay by for the future is a
          superfluous and inordinate saving, and is forbidden by our Lord Who
          said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++6%3A34"

    Whether religious who are raised to the episcopate are bound to religious

          Ad octavum sic proceditur. Videtur quod religiosi qui promoventur in
          episcopos, non teneantur ad observantias regulares. Dicitur enim
          XVIII, qu. I, quod monachum canonica electio a iugo regulae monasticae
          professionis absolvit, et sacra ordinatio de monacho episcopum facit.
          Sed observantiae regulares pertinent ad iugum regulae. Ergo religiosi
          qui in episcopum assumuntur, non tenentur ad observantias regulares.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that religious who are raised
          to the episcopate are not bound to religious observances. For it is
          said (XVIII, qu. i, can. Statutum) that a "canonical election loosens
          a monk from the yoke imposed by the rule of the monastic profession,
          and the holy ordination makes of a monk a bishop." Now the regular
          observances pertain to the yoke of the rule. Therefore religious who
          are appointed bishops are not bound to religious observances.<br />

          religious who are appointed bishops, are not bound to obey the

          are they bound to poverty, since according to the decree quoted above
          (Objection [1]) "when the holy ordination has made of a monk a bishop
          he enjoys the right, as the lawful heir, of claiming his paternal
          inheritance." Moreover they are sometimes allowed to make a will. Much

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, status religionis ad
          perfectionem pertinet quasi quaedam via in perfectionem tendendi,
          status autem episcopalis ad perfectionem pertinet tanquam quoddam
          perfectionis magisterium. Unde status religionis comparatur ad statum
          episcopalem sicut disciplina ad magisterium, et dispositio ad
          perfectionem. Dispositio autem non tollitur, perfectione adveniente,
          nisi forte quantum ad id in quo perfectioni repugnat; quantum autem ad
          id quod perfectioni congruit, magis confirmatur. Sicut discipulo, cum
          ad magisterium pervenerit, non congruit quod sit auditor, congruit
          tamen sibi quod legat et meditetur, etiam magis quam ante. Sic igitur
          dicendum est quod, si qua sunt in regularibus observantiis quae non
          impediant pontificale officium, sed magis valeant ad perfectionis
          custodiam, sicut est continentia, paupertas et alia huiusmodi, ad haec
          remanet religiosus, etiam factus episcopus, obligatus; et per

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
            href="SS185.html#SSQ185A1THEP1"
            >Article [1]</a
          >, ad 2) the religious state pertains to perfection, as a way of
          tending to perfection, while the episcopal state pertains to
          perfection, as a professorship of perfection. Hence the religious
          state is compared to the episcopal state, as the school to the
          professorial chair, and as disposition to perfection. Now the
          disposition is not voided at the advent of perfection, except as
          regards what perchance is incompatible with perfection, whereas as to
          that wherein it is in accord with perfection, it is confirmed the
          more. Thus when the scholar has become a professor it no longer
          becomes him to be a listener, but it becomes him to read and meditate
          even more than before. Accordingly we must assert that if there be
          among religious observances any that instead of being an obstacle to
          the episcopal office, are a safeguard of perfection, such as
          continence, poverty, and so forth, a religious, even after he has been
          made a bishop, remains bound to observe these, and consequently to
          wear the habit of his order, which is a sign of this obligation.<br />
