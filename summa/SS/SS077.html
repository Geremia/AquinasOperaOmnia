          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is lawful to sell a
          thing for more than its worth. In the commutations of human life,
          civil laws determine that which is just. Now according to these laws
          it is just for buyer and seller to deceive one another (Cod. IV, xliv,
          De Rescind. Vend. 8,15): and this occurs by the seller selling a thing
          for more than its worth, and the buyer buying a thing for less than
          its worth. Therefore it is lawful to sell a thing for more than its

          saying of a certain jester was accepted by all, "You wish to buy for a
          song and to sell at a premium," which agrees with the saying of Prov.
          20:14, "It is naught, it is naught, saith every buyer: and when he is
          gone away, then he will boast." Therefore it is lawful to sell a thing

          <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it does not seem unlawful if that
          which honesty demands be done by mutual agreement. Now, according to
          the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 13), in the friendship which is based on
          utility, the amount of the recompense for a favor received should
          depend on the utility accruing to the receiver: and this utility
          sometimes is worth more than the thing given, for instance if the
          receiver be in great need of that thing, whether for the purpose of
          avoiding a danger, or of deriving some particular benefit. Therefore,
          in contracts of buying and selling, it is lawful to give a thing in

          Tully says (De Offic. iii, 15): "Contracts should be entirely free
          from double-dealing: the seller must not impose upon the bidder, nor
          the buyer upon one that bids against him."<br />

          scilicet unus indiget re alterius et e converso, sicut patet per
          philosophum, in I Polit. Quod autem pro communi utilitate est
          inductum, non debet esse magis in gravamen unius quam alterius. Et
          ideo debet secundum aequalitatem rei inter eos contractus institui.
          Quantitas autem rerum quae in usum hominis veniunt mensuratur secundum
          pretium datum, ad quod est inventum numisma, ut dicitur in V Ethic. Et
          ideo si vel pretium excedat quantitatem valoris rei, vel e converso
          res excedat pretium, tolletur iustitiae aequalitas. Et ideo carius

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          But, apart from fraud, we may speak of buying and selling in two ways.
          First, as considered in themselves, and from this point of view,
          buying and selling seem to be established for the common advantage of
          both parties, one of whom requires that which belongs to the other,
          and vice versa, as the Philosopher states (Polit. i, 3). Now whatever
          is established for the common advantage, should not be more of a
          burden to one party than to another, and consequently all contracts
          between them should observe equality of thing and thing. Again, the
          quality of a thing that comes into human use is measured by the price
          given for it, for which purpose money was invented, as stated in
          Ethic. v, 5. Therefore if either the price exceed the quantity of the
          thing's worth, or, conversely, the thing exceed the price, there is no
          longer the equality of justice: and consequently, to sell a thing for
          more than its worth, or to buy it for less than its worth, is in
          itself unjust and unlawful.<br />
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Alio modo possumus loqui de emptione et venditione secundum quod per
          accidens cedit in utilitatem unius et detrimentum alterius, puta cum
          aliquis multum indiget habere rem aliquam, et alius laeditur si ea
          careat. Et in tali casu iustum pretium erit ut non solum respiciatur
          ad rem quae venditur, sed ad damnum quod venditor ex venditione
          incurrit. Et sic licite poterit aliquid vendi plus quam valeat
          secundum se, quamvis non vendatur plus quam valeat habenti. Si vero
          aliquis multum iuvetur ex re alterius quam accepit, ille vero qui
          vendidit non damnificatur carendo re illa, non debet eam supervendere.
          Quia utilitas quae alteri accrescit non est ex vendente, sed ex
          conditione ementis, nullus autem debet vendere alteri quod non est
          suum, licet possit ei vendere damnum quod patitur.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Secondly we may speak of buying and selling, considered as
          accidentally tending to the advantage of one party, and to the
          disadvantage of the other: for instance, when a man has great need of
          a certain thing, while an other man will suffer if he be without it.
          In such a case the just price will depend not only on the thing sold,
          but on the loss which the sale brings on the seller. And thus it will
          be lawful to sell a thing for more than it is worth in itself, though
          the price paid be not more than it is worth to the owner. Yet if the
          one man derive a great advantage by becoming possessed of the other
          man's property, and the seller be not at a loss through being without
          that thing, the latter ought not to raise the price, because the
          advantage accruing to the buyer, is not due to the seller, but to a
          circumstance affecting the buyer. Now no man should sell what is not
          his, though he may charge for the loss he suffers.<br />

          <a href="../FS/FS096.html#FSQ96A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) human law is
          given to the people among whom there are many lacking virtue, and it
          is not given to the virtuous alone. Hence human law was unable to
          forbid all that is contrary to virtue; and it suffices for it to
          prohibit whatever is destructive of human intercourse, while it treats
          other matters as though they were lawful, not by approving of them,
          but by not punishing them. Accordingly, if without employing deceit
          the seller disposes of his goods for more than their worth, or the
          buyer obtain them for less than their worth, the law looks upon this
          as licit, and provides no punishment for so doing, unless the excess
          be too great, because then even human law demands restitution to be
          made, for instance if a man be deceived in regard to more than half
          the amount of the just price of a thing [*Cod. IV, xliv, De Rescind.
          Vend. 2,8].<br />

          On the other hand the Divine law leaves nothing unpunished that is

          unlawful if the equality of justice be not observed in buying and
          selling: and he who has received more than he ought must make
          compensation to him that has suffered loss, if the loss be
          considerable. I add this condition, because the just price of things
          is not fixed with mathematical precision, but depends on a kind of
          estimate, so that a slight addition or subtraction would not seem to
          destroy the equality of justice.

          his experience of others, thought that all men are inclined to wish to
          buy for a song and sell at a premium. But since in reality this is
          wicked, it is in every man's power to acquire that justice whereby he
          may resist and overcome this inclination." And then he gives the
          example of a man who gave the just price for a book to a man who
          through ignorance asked a low price for it. Hence it is evident that
          this common desire is not from nature but from vice, wherefore it is
          common to many who walk along the broad road of sin.<br />

          In commutative justice we consider chiefly real equality. On the other

          usefulness, so that the recompense should depend on the usefulness

          subject to him, or when he is the only one who can assist him. Now the

          or danger, by the very fact that he offers him defective goods, if
          such defect may occasion loss or danger to the buyer—loss, if, by

          Chrysostom [*Hom. xxxviii in the Opus Imperfectum, falsely ascribed to
          St. John Chrysostom] says on Mt. 21:12: "He that buys a thing in order
          that he may sell it, entire and unchanged, at a profit, is the trader
          who is cast out of God's temple." Cassiodorus speaks in the same sense
          in his commentary on Ps. 70:15, "Because I have not known learning, or
          trading" according to another version [*The Septuagint]: "What is
          trade," says he, "but buying at a cheap price with the purpose of
          retailing at a higher price?" and he adds: "Such were the tradesmen
          whom Our Lord cast out of the temple." Now no man is cast out of the
          temple except for a sin. Therefore such like trading is sinful.<br />

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A tradesman is one whose business
          consists in the exchange of things. According to the Philosopher
          (Polit. i, 3), exchange of things is twofold; one, natural as it were,
          and necessary, whereby one commodity is exchanged for another, or
          money taken in exchange for a commodity, in order to satisfy the needs
          of life. Such like trading, properly speaking, does not belong to
          tradesmen, but rather to housekeepers or civil servants who have to
          provide the household or the state with the necessaries of life. The
          other kind of exchange is either that of money for money, or of any
          commodity for money, not on account of the necessities of life, but
          for profit, and this kind of exchange, properly speaking, regards
          tradesmen, according to the Philosopher (Polit. i, 3). The former kind
          of exchange is commendable because it supplies a natural need: but the
          latter is justly deserving of blame, because, considered in itself, it
          satisfies the greed for gain, which knows no limit and tends to
          infinity. Hence trading, considered in itself, has a certain
          debasement attaching thereto, in so far as, by its very nature, it
          does not imply a virtuous or necessary end. Nevertheless gain which is
          the end of trading, though not implying, by its nature, anything
          virtuous or necessary, does not, in itself, connote anything sinful or
          contrary to virtue: wherefore nothing prevents gain from being
          directed to some necessary or even virtuous end, and thus trading
          becomes lawful. Thus, for instance, a man may intend the moderate gain
          which he seeks to acquire by trading for the upkeep of his household,
          or for the assistance of the needy: or again, a man may take to trade
          for some public advantage, for instance, lest his country lack the
          necessaries of life, and seek gain, not as an end, but as payment for
          his labor.<br />

          praecipue videtur quando aliquis rem non immutatam carius vendit. Si
          enim rem immutatam carius vendat, videtur praemium sui laboris
          accipere. Quamvis et ipsum lucrum possit licite intendi, non sicut
          ultimus finis, sed propter alium finem necessarium vel honestum, ut
          dictum est.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The saying of Chrysostom refers to
          the trading which seeks gain as a last end. This is especially the
          case where a man sells something at a higher price without its
          undergoing any change. For if he sells at a higher price something
          that has changed for the better, he would seem to receive the reward
          of his labor. Nevertheless the gain itself may be lawfully intended,
          not as a last end, but for the sake of some other end which is
          necessary or virtuous, as stated above.<br />

          Ad secundum dicendum quod non quicumque carius vendit aliquid quam
          emerit, negotiatur, sed solum qui ad hoc emit ut carius vendat. Si
          autem emit rem non ut vendat, sed ut teneat, et postmodum propter
          aliquam causam eam vendere velit, non est negotiatio, quamvis carius
          vendat. Potest enim hoc licite facere, vel quia in aliquo rem
          melioravit; vel quia pretium rei est mutatum, secundum diversitatem
          loci vel temporis; vel propter periculum cui se exponit transferendo
          rem de loco ad locum, vel eam ferri faciendo. Et secundum hoc, nec
          emptio nec venditio est iniusta.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not everyone that sells at a
          higher price than he bought is a tradesman, but only he who buys that
          he may sell at a profit. If, on the contrary, he buys not for sale but
          for possession, and afterwards, for some reason wishes to sell, it is
          not a trade transaction even if he sell at a profit. For he may
          lawfully do this, either because he has bettered the thing, or because
          the value of the thing has changed with the change of place or time,
          or on account of the danger he incurs in transferring the thing from
          one place to another, or again in having it carried by another. In
          this sense neither buying nor selling is unjust.<br />

          Ad tertium dicendum quod clerici non solum debent abstinere ab his
          quae sunt secundum se mala, sed etiam ab his quae habent speciem mali.
          Quod quidem in negotiatione contingit, tum propter hoc quod est
          ordinata ad lucrum terrenum, cuius clerici debent esse contemptores;
          tum etiam propter frequentia negotiatorum vitia, quia difficiliter
          exuitur negotiator a peccatis labiorum, ut dicitur Eccli. XXVI. Est et
          alia causa, quia negotiatio nimis implicat animum saecularibus curis,
          et per consequens a spiritualibus retrahit, unde apostolus dicit, II
          ad Tim. II, nemo militans Deo implicat se negotiis saecularibus. Licet
          tamen clericis uti prima commutationis specie, quae ordinatur ad
          necessitatem vitae, emendo vel vendendo.

          Clerics should abstain not only from things that are evil in
          themselves, but even from those that have an appearance of evil. This
          happens in trading, both because it is directed to worldly gain, which
          clerics should despise, and because trading is open to so many vices,
          since "a merchant is hardly free from sins of the lips" [*'A merchant
          is hardly free from negligence, and a huckster shall not be justified
          from the sins of the lips'] (Ecclus. 26:28). There is also another
          reason, because trading engages the mind too much with worldly cares,
          and consequently withdraws it from spiritual cares; wherefore the
          Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Tim++2%3A4"
            >2 Tim. 2:4</a
          >): "No man being a soldier to God entangleth himself with secular
          businesses." Nevertheless it is lawful for clerics to engage in the
          first mentioned kind of exchange, which is directed to supply the
          necessaries of life, either by buying or by selling.<br />
