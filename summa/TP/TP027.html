      ST. THOMAS AND THE IMMACULATE CONCEPTION (EDITORIAL NOTE)
    </h3>
    <p>
      The privilege of the Virgin-Mother of God and the supreme prerogative of
      her Son may be seen from the following diagram:<br />
      THE LAW AND THE COURSE OF ORIGINAL SIN UNDER THE LAW... all descendants
      from Adam... spring from Adam materially and seminally... the body lies
      (not under the guilty, but) under the effects of original sin... the
      stricken body dispositively causes the soul to contract the guilt of
      original sin... all contract both debt and stain... all need a Redeemer to
      destroy the stain contracted PARTIALLY EXEMPT FROM THE LAW; PRIVILEGE OF
      IMMACULATE CONCEPTION... the Blessed Virgin... springs from Adam
      materially and seminally... the body lies (not under the guilt, but) under
      the effects of original sin... the stricken body would have dispositively
      caused the soul to contract the guilt of original sin... the soul at the
      moment of union with the body was prevented by the infusion of grace from
      contracting sin... Mary contracted the debt, but not the stain... Mary
      needed a Redeemer to prevent her from contracting the stain WHOLLY EXEMPT
      FROM THE LAW; MIRACULOUS CONCEPTION... Our Blessed Lord... springs from
      Adam materially, not seminally (<a href="TP031.html#TPQ31OUTP1">Q[31]</a>,
      <a href="TP031.html#TPQ31A1THEP1">A[1]</a>)... His body lay under neither
      guilt nor effects of original sin... the body being entirely free, could
      not transmit the stain to His soul... no preventive grace needed... Jesus
      Christ contracted neither debt nor stain... Jesus Christ is not redeemed,
      but the Redeemer<br />
    </p>

    <p>
      It will thus be seen how accurately St. Thomas speaks of the "flesh" or
      body of our Blessed Lady. For it should be remembered that, according to
      St. Thomas, the human body is animated in succession by (1) a vegetative,
      (2) a sensitive, and (3) a rational soul. Hence his assertion that "the
      flesh of the Blessed Virgin was conceived in original sin" (<a
        href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1"
        >Question [14]</a
      >, <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 1) means that the
      body of the Blessed Virgin, being descended from Adam both materially and
      seminally, contracted the bodily defects which are conveyed by seminal
      generation, and are the results of the privation of original justice (<a
        href="TP069.html#TPQ69OUTP1"
        >Question [69]</a
      >, <a href="TP069.html#TPQ69A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>, ad 3). Before
      animation, therefore the body of the Blessed Virgin would not be infected
      with the guilt of original sin, because privation of grace can only be in
      that which is the subject of grace, viz. the rational soul. Nevertheless,
      before animation the body of the Blessed Virgin, being seminally descended
      from Adam, was such that it would have been the means of transmitting the
      taint of original sin to the rational soul at the very first instant of
      animation, unless the grace of the Redeemer intervened and sanctified her
      soul "in that self-same instant," thus redeeming her and preventing her
      from contracting the guilt of original sin.<br />
      Why, then, does St. Thomas say that because the Blessed Virgin was not
      sanctified before animation, therefore she could be sanctified only after
      animation?<br />
      <br />
      Such a conclusion would hold if it were a question of the order of Nature:
      "a thing must be before it is such [prius est esse quam esse tale]"; and
      therefore the soul must be, before it is sanctified. But if St. Thomas
      held for a posteriority of time, no matter how short, we ask how it was
      that he did not perceive the fallacy of the argument, since it might be
      neither before nor after, but in the very instant of, animation.<br />
      <br />
      The question is answered thus: St. Thomas as a Doctor of the Church and in
      matters which were not then "de fide," is a witness to the expression of
      the faith of his time. Hence his line of argument coincides with, because
      it follows, that of St. Bernard, Peter Lombard, Alexander of Hales, Albert
      the Great, St. Bonaventure. It was not likely that St. Thomas would differ
      from the great masters of his time, who failed to understand that the
      grace of redemption might at the same time be one of preservation and
      prevention. Nor is it likely that St. Thomas had any reliable information
      about the movement* in progress at that time towards a belief in the
      Immaculate Conception. [*Principally in England, where, owing to the
      influence of St. Anselm (1109), the doctrine was maintained by Eadmer
      (1137). Nicolas of St. Albans (1175), Osbert of Clare (1170), Robert
      Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln (1253), William of Ware (1300), who was the
      master of Duns Scotus (1308)]. No doubt he knew something of it, but the
      names of its promoters would have weighed little with him as against those
      of Bernard, Albert, Peter, Alexander, and Bonaventure. And it must not be
      forgotten that among those who upheld the doctrine of the Immaculate
      Conception, not a few ascribed the privilege as being absolute and not one
      of preservation and Redemption. Hence it is that St. Thomas insists on two
      things: (1) that the Mother of God was redeemed, and (2) that the grace of
      her sanctification was a grace of preservation. And, be it remarked in
      conclusion, these two points, so much insisted on by St. Thomas, are at
      the very basis of the Catholic doctrine of the Immaculate Conception.<br />

          Him. This consideration will be fourfold. For we shall consider:

    Whether the Blessed Virgin was sanctified before her birth from the womb?<br />

          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod beata virgo non fuerit
          sanctificata ante nativitatem ex utero. Dicit enim apostolus, I Cor.
          XV, non prius quod spirituale est, sed quod animale, deinde quod est
          spirituale. Sed per gratiam sanctificantem nascitur homo spiritualiter
          in filium Dei, secundum illud Ioan. I, ex Deo nati sunt. Nativitas
          autem ex utero est nativitas animalis. Non ergo beata virgo fuit prius
          sanctificata quam ex utero nasceretur.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Blessed Virgin was
          not sanctified before her birth from the womb. For the Apostle says
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A46"
            >1 Cor. 15:46</a
          >): "That was not first which is spiritual but that which is natural;
          afterwards that which is spiritual." But by sanctifying grace man is
          born spiritually into a son of God according to Jn. 1:13: "(who) are
          born of God." But birth from the womb is a natural birth. Therefore
          the Blessed Virgin was not sanctified before her birth from the
          womb.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, in epistola ad Dardanum,
              sanctificatio, qua efficimur templum Dei, non nisi renatorum est.
              Nemo autem renascitur nisi prius nascatur. Ergo beata virgo non
              fuit prius sanctificata quam ex utero nasceretur.

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Ep. ad
              Dardan.): "The sanctification, by which we become temples of God,
              is only of those who are born again." But no one is born again,
              who was not born previously. Therefore the Blessed Virgin was not
              sanctified before her birth from the womb.<br />

                  Praeterea, quicumque est sanctificatus per gratiam, est
                  mundatus a peccato originali et actuali. Si ergo beata virgo
                  fuit sanctificata ante nativitatem ex utero, consequens est
                  quod fuerit tunc emundata ab originali peccato. Sed solum
                  originale peccatum poterat eam impedire ab introitu regni
                  caelestis. Si ergo tunc mortua fuisset, videtur quod ianuam
                  regni caelestis introisset. Quod tamen fieri non potuit ante
                  passionem Christi, iuxta illud apostoli, habemus enim fiduciam
                  in introitum sanctorum per sanguinem eius, ut dicitur Heb. X.
                  Videtur ergo quod beata virgo non fuerit sanctificata antequam
                  ex utero nasceretur.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever is sanctified by
                  grace is cleansed from sin, both original and actual. If,
                  therefore, the Blessed Virgin was sanctified before her birth
                  from the womb, it follows that she was then cleansed from
                  original sin. Now nothing but original sin could hinder her
                  from entering the heavenly kingdom. If therefore she had died
                  then, it seems that she would have entered the gates of
                  heaven. But this was not possible before the Passion of
                  Christ, according to the Apostle (<a
                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++10%3A19"
                    >Heb. 10:19</a
                  >): "We have [Vulg.: 'having'] therefore a confidence in the
                  entering into the Holies by His blood." It seems therefore
                  that the Blessed Virgin was not sanctified before her birth
                  from the womb.<br />

                      Praeterea, peccatum originale ex origine contrahitur,

                      actu peccandi, non potest a peccato actuali mundari. Ergo
                      etiam nec beata virgo a peccato originali mundari potuit
                      dum esset adhuc in ipso actu originis, in materno utero
                      existens.

                      <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, original sin is
                      contracted through the origin, just as actual sin is
                      contracted through an act. But as long as one is in the
                      act of sinning, one cannot be cleansed from actual sin.
                      Therefore neither could the Blessed Virgin be cleansed
                      from original sin as long as she was in the act of origin,
                      by existence in her mother's womb.<br />

                          not celebrate feasts except of those who are holy.
                          Therefore even in her birth the Blessed Virgin was
                          holy. Therefore she was sanctified in the womb.<br />

                              rationabiliter argumentatur quod cum corpore sit

                              tradit; ita etiam rationabiliter argumentari
                              possumus quod fuerit sanctificata in utero.
                              Rationabiliter enim creditur quod illa quae genuit

                              accepit, unde legitur, Luc. I, quod Angelus ei
                              dixit, ave, gratia plena.

                              <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing is handed
                              down in the canonical Scriptures concerning the
                              sanctification of the Blessed Mary as to her being
                              sanctified in the womb; indeed, they do not even
                              mention her birth. But as Augustine, in his
                              tractate on the Assumption of the Virgin, argues
                              with reason, since her body was assumed into
                              heaven, and yet Scripture does not relate this; so
                              it may be reasonably argued that she was
                              sanctified in the womb. For it is reasonable to
                              believe that she, who brought forth "the
                              Only-Begotten of the Father full of grace and
                              truth," received greater privileges of grace than
                              all others: hence we read (<a

                                  sanctified in the womb; for instance, to
                                  Jeremias, to whom it was said (<a

                                    >Jer. 1:5</a
                                  >): "Before thou camest forth out of the womb,
                                  I sanctified thee"; and again, to John the
                                  Baptist, of whom it is written (<a

                                      sanctified in the spirit.<br />

    Whether the Blessed Virgin was sanctified before animation?<br />

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod beata virgo sanctificata fuit
          ante animationem. Quia, ut dictum est, plus gratiae est collatum
          virgini matri Dei quam alicui sanctorum. Sed quibusdam videtur esse
          concessum quod sanctificarentur ante animationem. Quia dicitur Ierem.
          I, priusquam te formarem in utero, novi te, non autem infunditur anima
          ante corporis formationem. Similiter etiam de Ioanne Baptista dicit
          Ambrosius, super Luc., quod nondum inerat ei spiritus vitae, et iam
          inerat ei spiritus gratiae. Ergo multo magis beata virgo ante
          animationem sanctificari potuit.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Blessed Virgin was
          sanctified before animation. Because, as we have stated (<a
            href="TP027.html#TPQ27A1THEP1"
            >Article [1]</a
          >), more grace was bestowed on the Virgin Mother of God than on any
          saint. Now it seems to have been granted to some, to be sanctified
          before animation. For it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jer++1%3A5"
            >Jer. 1:5</a
          >): "Before I formed thee in the bowels of thy mother, I knew thee":
          and the soul is not infused before the formation of the body. Likewise
          Ambrose says of John the Baptist (Comment. in Luc. i, 15): "As yet the
          spirit of life was not in him and already he possessed the Spirit of
          grace." Much more therefore could the Blessed Virgin be sanctified
          before animation.<br />

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, conveniens fuit, sicut Anselmus dicit, in libro de
              conceptu virginali, ut illa virgo ea puritate niteret qua maior
              sub Deo nequit intelligi, unde et in Cant. IV dicitur, tota
              pulchra es, amica mea, et macula non est in te. Sed maior puritas
              fuisset beatae virginis si nunquam fuisset inquinata contagio
              originalis peccati. Ergo hoc ei praestitum fuit quod, antequam
              animaretur caro eius, sanctificaretur.

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as Anselm says (De Concep.
              Virg. xviii), "it was fitting that this Virgin should shine with
              such a purity that under God none greater can be imagined":
              wherefore it is written (Canticles 4:7): "Thou art all fair, O my
              love, and there is not a spot in thee." But the purity of the
              Blessed Virgin would have been greater, if she had never been
              stained by the contagion of original sin. Therefore it was granted
              to her to be sanctified before her flesh was animated.<br />

                  Praeterea, sicut dictum est, non celebratur festum nisi de
                  aliquo sancto. Sed quidam celebrant festum conceptionis beatae
                  virginis. Ergo videtur quod in ipsa sua conceptione fuerit
                  sancta. Et ita videtur quod ante animationem fuerit
                  sanctificata.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as it has been stated
                  above, no feast is celebrated except of some saint. But some
                  keep the feast of the Conception of the Blessed Virgin.
                  Therefore it seems that in her very Conception she was holy;
                  and hence that she was sanctified before animation.<br />

                              <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The sanctification of
                              the Blessed Virgin cannot be understood as having
                              taken place before animation, for two reasons.
                              First, because the sanctification of which we are
                              speaking, is nothing but the cleansing from
                              original sin: for sanctification is a "perfect
                              cleansing," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. xii). Now
                              sin cannot be taken away except by grace, the
                              subject of which is the rational creature alone.
                              Therefore before the infusion of the rational
                              soul, the Blessed Virgin was not sanctified.<br />

                                  Secundo quia, cum sola creatura rationalis sit
                                  susceptiva culpae, ante infusionem animae
                                  rationalis proles concepta non est culpae
                                  obnoxia. Et sic, quocumque modo ante
                                  animationem beata virgo sanctificata fuisset,
                                  nunquam incurrisset maculam originalis culpae,
                                  et ita non indiguisset redemptione et salute
                                  quae est per Christum, de quo dicitur Matth.

                                  eorum. Hoc autem est inconveniens, quod
                                  Christus non sit salvator omnium hominum, ut
                                  dicitur I Tim. IV. Unde relinquitur quod
                                  sanctificatio beatae virginis fuerit post eius
                                  animationem.

                                  Secondly, because, since the rational creature
                                  alone can be the subject of sin; before the
                                  infusion of the rational soul, the offspring
                                  conceived is not liable to sin. And thus, in
                                  whatever manner the Blessed Virgin would have
                                  been sanctified before animation, she could
                                  never have incurred the stain of original sin:
                                  and thus she would not have needed redemption
                                  and salvation which is by Christ, of whom it
                                  is written (<a

                                  sins." But this is unfitting, through implying
                                  that Christ is not the "Saviour of all men,"
                                  as He is called (<a

                                              If the soul of the Blessed Virgin
                                              had never incurred the stain of
                                              original sin, this would be
                                              derogatory to the dignity of
                                              Christ, by reason of His being the
                                              universal Saviour of all.
                                              Consequently after Christ, who, as
                                              the universal Saviour of all,
                                              needed not to be saved, the purity
                                              of the Blessed Virgin holds the
                                              highest place. For Christ did not
                                              contract original sin in any way
                                              whatever, but was holy in His very
                                              Conception, according to Lk. 1:35:
                                              "The Holy which shall be born of
                                              thee, shall be called the Son of
                                              God." But the Blessed Virgin did
                                              indeed contract original sin, but
                                              was cleansed therefrom before her
                                              birth from the womb. This is what
                                              is signified (<a

                                              night of original sin: "Let it
                                              expect light," i.e. Christ, "and
                                              not see it"---(because "no defiled

                                                  Although the Church of Rome

                                                      sanctification. This is
                                                      not transmitted to the
                                                      children begotten of the
                                                      flesh: because it does not
                                                      regard the flesh but the
                                                      mind. Consequently, though

          not cleansed from the infection of the fomes. For just as the fomes,

          a punishment of original sin; so also are death and other corporeal

                          Respondeo dicendum quod circa hoc sunt diversae
                          opiniones. Quidam enim dixerunt quod in ipsa
                          sanctificatione beatae virginis, qua fuit sanctificata
                          in utero, totaliter fuit ei fomes subtractus. Quidam
                          vero dicunt quod remansit fomes quantum ad hoc quod
                          facit difficultatem ad bonum, sublatus tamen fuit
                          quantum ad hoc quod facit pronitatem ad malum. Alii
                          vero dicunt quod sublatus fuit fomes inquantum
                          pertinet ad corruptionem personae, prout impellit ad
                          malum et difficultatem facit ad bonum, remansit tamen
                          inquantum pertinet ad corruptionem naturae, prout
                          scilicet est causa traducendi originale peccatum in
                          prolem. Alii vero dicunt quod in prima sanctificatione
                          remansit fomes secundum essentiam, sed ligatus fuit,
                          in ipsa autem conceptione filii Dei fuit totaliter
                          sublatus. Ad horum autem intellectum, oportet
                          considerare quod fomes nihil aliud est quam inordinata
                          concupiscentia sensibilis appetitus, habitualis tamen,
                          quia actualis concupiscentia est motus peccati.
                          Dicitur autem concupiscentia sensualitatis esse
                          inordinata, inquantum repugnat rationi, quod quidem
                          fit inquantum inclinat ad malum, vel difficultatem
                          facit ad bonum. Et ideo ad ipsam rationem fomitis

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> on this point there are
                          various opinions. For some have held that the fomes
                          was entirely taken away in that sanctification whereby
                          the Blessed Virgin was sanctified in the womb. Others
                          say that it remained as far as it causes a difficulty
                          in doing good, but was taken away as far as it causes
                          a proneness to evil. Others again, that it was taken
                          away as to the personal corruption, by which it makes
                          us quick to do evil and slow to do good: but that it
                          remained as to the corruption of nature, inasmuch as
                          it is the cause of transmitting original sin to the
                          offspring. Lastly, others say that, in her first
                          sanctification, the fomes remained essentially, but
                          was fettered; and that, when she conceived the Son of
                          God, it was entirely taken away. In order to
                          understand the question at issue, it must be observed
                          that the fomes is nothing but a certain inordinate,
                          but habitual, concupiscence of the sensitive appetite.
                          for actual concupiscence is a sinful motion. Now
                          sensual concupiscence is said to be inordinate, in so
                          far as it rebels against reason; and this it does by
                          inclining to evil, or hindering from good.
                          Consequently it is essential to the fomes to incline
                          to evil, or hinder from good. Wherefore to say that
                          the fomes was in the Blessed Virgin without an
                          inclination to evil, is to combine two contradictory
                          statements.<br />

                              ad corruptionem personae. Nam secundum Augustinum,
                              in libro de nuptiis et concupiscentia, libido est
                              quae peccatum originale transmittit in prolem.
                              Libido autem importat inordinatam concupiscentiam,
                              quae non totaliter subditur rationi. Et ideo, si
                              totaliter fomes subtraheretur inquantum pertinet
                              ad corruptionem personae, non posset remanere
                              inquantum pertinet ad corruptionem naturae.

                              In like manner it seems to imply a contradiction

                              corruption of nature, but not as to the personal
                              corruption. For, according to Augustine (De Nup.
                              et Concup. i.), it is lust that transmits original
                              sin to the offspring. Now lust implies inordinate
                              concupiscence, not entirely subject to reason: and
                              therefore, if the fomes were entirely taken away
                              as to personal corruption, it could not remain as
                              to the corruption of nature.

                                  carnem aliquis ab illa damnatione liberetur,
                                  non videtur fieri debuisse nisi post
                                  incarnationem eius in qua primo debuit
                                  immunitas damnationis apparere. Et ideo, sicut
                                  ante immortalitatem carnis Christi resurgentis
                                  nullus adeptus fuit carnis immortalitatem, ita
                                  inconveniens etiam videtur dicere quod ante
                                  carnem Christi, in qua nullum fuit peccatum,
                                  caro virginis matris eius, vel cuiuscumque

                                  It remains, therefore, for us to say, either

                                  that, by the abundance of grace bestowed on

                                  lower powers were never moved without the

                                  sin; as also was the case with Adam, before he
                                  sinned, by reason of original justice: so
                                  that, in this respect, the grace of
                                  sanctification in the Virgin had the force of
                                  original justice. And although this appears to
                                  be part of the dignity of the Virgin Mother,
                                  yet it is somewhat derogatory to the dignity
                                  of Christ, without whose power no one had been
                                  freed from the first sentence of condemnation.
                                  And though, through faith in Christ, some were
                                  freed from that condemnation, according to the
                                  spirit, before Christ's Incarnation, yet it
                                  does not seem fitting that any one should be
                                  freed from that condemnation, according to the
                                  flesh, except after His Incarnation, for it
                                  was then that immunity from condemnation was
                                  first to appear. Consequently, just as before

                                  so it seems unfitting to say that before
                                  Christ appeared in sinless flesh, His Virgin

                                      not indeed by an act of her reason, as in

                                      reason from the very first moment of her
                                      existence in her mother's womb, for this
                                      was the singular privilege of Christ: but
                                      by reason of the abundant grace bestowed
                                      on her in her sanctification, and still
                                      more perfectly by Divine Providence
                                      preserving her sensitive soul, in a
                                      singular manner, from any inordinate
                                      movement. Afterwards, however, at the
                                      conception of Christ's flesh, in which for
                                      the first time immunity from sin was to be

                                      from the Child to the Mother. This indeed

                                              to holy men an occasional cause of
                                              perfect virtue: but not the "sine
                                              qua non" of perfection: and it is
                                              quite enough to ascribe to the
                                              Blessed Virgin perfect virtue and
                                              abundant grace: nor is there any
                                              need to attribute to her every
                                              occasional cause of perfection.<br />

                                                  Blessed Virgin. The first was,
                                                  as it were, preparatory to
                                                  Christ's conception: which did
                                                  not cleanse her from the stain
                                                  of sin or fomes, but rather
                                                  gave her mind a unity of
                                                  purpose and disengaged it from
                                                  a multiplicity of things (Cf.
                                                  Dionysius, Div. Nom. iv),
                                                  since even the angels are said
                                                  to be purified, in whom there
                                                  is no stain, as Dionysius says
                                                  (Eccl. Hier. vi). The second
                                                  purification effected in her
                                                  by the Holy Ghost was by means
                                                  of the conception of Christ
                                                  which was the operation of the
                                                  Holy Ghost. And in respect of
                                                  this, it may be said that He
                                                  purified her entirely from the

    Whether by being sanctified in the womb the Blessed Virgin was preserved

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod per sanctificationem in utero
          non fuerit beata virgo praeservata ab omni peccato actuali. Quia, ut
          dictum est, post primam sanctificationem fomes peccati remansit in
          virgine. Motus autem fomitis, etiam si rationem praeveniat, est
          peccatum veniale, licet levissimum, ut Augustinus dicit, in libro de
          Trin. Ergo in beata virgine fuit aliquod peccatum veniale.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that by being sanctified in
          the womb the Blessed Virgin was not preserved from all actual sin.
          For, as we have already stated (<a href="TP027.html#TPQ27A3THEP1"
            >Article [3]</a
          >), after her first sanctification the fomes remained in the Virgin.
          Now the motion of the fomes, even if it precede the act of the reason,
          is a venial sin, albeit extremely slight, as Augustine says in his
          work De Trinitate [*Cf. Sent. ii, D, 24]. Therefore there was some
          venial sin in the Blessed Virgin.<br />

              Sed dubitare de fide est peccatum. Ergo beata virgo non fuit

              says that the Blessed Virgin "was troubled with wondering doubt at
              the death of our Lord." But doubt in matters of faith is a sin.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom (Hom. xlv in
                  Matth.) expounding the text: "Behold thy mother and thy
                  brethren stand without, seeking thee," says: "It is clear that
                  they did this from mere vain glory." Again, on Jn. 2:3: "They
                  have no wine," the same Chrysostom says that "she wished to do
                  them a favor, and raise herself in their esteem, by means of
                  her Son: and perchance she succumbed to human frailty, just as
                  did His brethren when they said: 'Manifest Thyself to the
                  world.'" And a little further on he says: "For as yet she did
                  not believe in Him as she ought." Now it is quite clear that
                  all this was sinful. Therefore the Blessed Virgin was not
                  preserved from all sin.<br />

                          it, according to 2 Cor. 3:6: "(Who) hath made us fit
                          ministers of the New Testament." Now the Blessed
                          Virgin was chosen by God to be His Mother. Therefore
                          there can be no doubt that God, by His grace, made her
                          worthy of that office, according to the words spoken
                          to her by the angel (<a

                          conceive," etc. But she would not have been worthy to
                          be the Mother of God, if she had ever sinned. First,
                          because the honor of the parents reflects on the
                          child, according to Prov. 17:6: "The glory of children
                          are their fathers": and consequently, on the other
                          hand, the Mother's shame would have reflected on her
                          Son. Secondly, because of the singular affinity
                          between her and Christ, who took flesh from her: and
                          it is written (2 Cor. 6:15): "What concord hath Christ
                          with Belial?" Thirdly, because of the singular manner
                          in which the Son of God, who is the "Divine Wisdom"
                          (<a

                          And it is written (Wis. 1:4): "Wisdom will not enter
                          into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to
                          sins."<br />

    Whether, by her sanctification in the womb, the Blessed Virgin received the

          Ad quintum sic proceditur. Videtur quod beata virgo per
          sanctificationem in utero non obtinuerit gratiae plenitudinem, sive
          perfectionem. Hoc enim videtur pertinere ad privilegium Christi,
          secundum illud Ioan. I, vidimus eum, quasi unigenitum a patre, plenum
          gratiae et veritatis. Sed ea quae sunt propria Christi, non sunt
          alteri attribuenda. Ergo beata virgo plenitudinem gratiarum non
          accepit in sanctificatione.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that, by her sanctification
          in the womb, the Blessed Virgin did not receive the fulness or
          perfection of grace. For this seems to be Christ's privilege,
          according to Jn. 1:14: "We saw Him [Vulg.: 'His glory'] as the
          Only-Begotten [Vulg.: 'as it were of the Only-Begotten'] full of grace
          and truth." But what is proper to Christ ought not to be ascribed to
          some one else. Therefore the Blessed Virgin did not receive the
          fulness of grace at the time of her sanctification.<br />

              Praeterea, ei quod est plenum et perfectum, non restat aliquid
              addendum, quia perfectum est cui nihil deest, ut dicitur in III
              Physic. Sed beata virgo postmodum additionem gratiae suscepit,
              quando Christum concepit, dictum est enim ei, Luc. I, spiritus
              sanctus superveniet in te. Et iterum, quando in gloriam est
              assumpta. Ergo videtur quod non habuerit in sua prima
              sanctificatione plenitudinem gratiarum.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing remains to be added to
              that which is full and perfect: for "the perfect is that which
              lacks nothing," as is said Phys. iii. But the Blessed Virgin
              received additional grace afterwards when she conceived Christ;
              for to her was it said (<a

              >): "The Holy Ghost shall come upon thee: and again, when she was
              assumed into glory." Therefore it seems that she did not receive
              the fulness of grace at the time of her first sanctification.<br />

                  been useless for her to have certain graces, for she would
                  never have put them to use: since we do not read that she
                  taught which is the act of wisdom; or that she worked
                  miracles, which is the act of one of the gratuitous graces.

                                              There is no doubt that the Blessed
                                              Virgin received in a high degree
                                              both the gift of wisdom and the
                                              grace of miracles and even of
                                              prophecy, just as Christ had them.
                                              But she did not so receive them,
                                              as to put them and such like
                                              graces to every use, as did
                                              Christ: but accordingly as it
                                              befitted her condition of life.
                                              For she had the use of wisdom in
                                              contemplation, according to Lk.
                                              2:19: "But Mary kept all these
                                              words, pondering them in her
                                              heart." But she had not the use of
                                              wisdom as to teaching: since this
                                              befitted not the female sex,
                                              according to 1 Tim. 2:12: "But I
                                              suffer not a woman to teach." The
                                              use of miracles did not become her
                                              while she lived: because at that
                                              time the Teaching of Christ was to
                                              be confirmed by miracles, and
                                              therefore it was befitting that
                                              Christ alone, and His disciples
                                              who were the bearers of His
                                              doctrine, should work miracles.
                                              Hence of John the Baptist it is
                                              written (<a

                                              in order that all might fix their
                                              attention on Christ. As to the use
                                              of prophecy, it is clear that she
                                              had it, from the canticle spoken
                                              by her: "My soul doth magnify the

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was proper for the
          Blessed Virgin, after Christ, to be sanctified in the womb. For it has
          been said (<a href="TP027.html#TPQ27A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) that the
          Blessed Virgin was sanctified in the womb, in order that she might be
          worthy to be the mother of God. But this is proper to her. Therefore
          she alone was sanctified in the womb.<br />

              Ieremias et Ioannes Baptista, qui dicuntur sanctificati in utero.
              Nam Christus specialiter dicitur filius David et Abraham, propter
              promissionem eis specialiter factam de Christo. Isaias etiam
              expressissime de Christo prophetavit. Apostoli etiam cum ipso

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, some men seem to have been
              more closely connected with Christ than Jeremias and John the
              Baptist, who are said to have been sanctified in the womb. For
              Christ is specially called the Son of David and of Abraham, by
              reason of the promise specially made to them concerning Christ.
              Isaias also prophesied of Christ in the most express terms. And
              the apostles were in converse with Christ Himself. And yet these
              are not mentioned as having been sanctified in the womb. Therefore
              it was not befitting that either Jeremias or John the Baptist

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Augustine (Ep. ad
                          Dardan.) seems to speak dubiously of their (Jeremias'
                          and John the Baptist's) sanctification in the womb.
                          For the leaping of John in the womb "might," as he
                          says, "signify the great truth," viz. that the woman
                          was the mother of God, "which was to be made known to
                          his elders, though as yet unknown to the infant. Hence
                          in the Gospel it is written, not that the infant in
                          her womb believed, but that it 'leaped': and our eyes
                          are witness that not only infants leap but also
                          cattle. But this was unwonted because it was in the
                          womb. And therefore, just as other miracles are wont
                          to be done, this was done divinely, in the infant; not
                          humanly by the infant. Perhaps also in this child the
                          use of reason and will was so far accelerated that
                          while yet in his mother's womb he was able to
                          acknowledge, believe, and consent, whereas in other
                          children we have to wait for these things till they
                          grow older: this again I count as a miraculous result
                          of the divine power."<br />
