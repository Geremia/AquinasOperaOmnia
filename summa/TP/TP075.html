          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod in hoc sacramento non sit
          corpus Christi secundum veritatem, sed solum secundum figuram, vel

          Quasi dicat, secundum expositionem Augustini, super quartum Psalmum,

          manducaturi estis, et bibituri illum sanguinem quem fusuri sunt qui me

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the body of Christ is not in

          is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++6%3A54"
            >Jn. 6:54</a
          >) that when our Lord had uttered these words: "Except you eat the
          flesh of the Son of Man, and drink His blood," etc., "Many of His
          disciples on hearing it said: 'this is a hard saying'": to whom He
          rejoined: "It is the spirit that quickeneth; the flesh profiteth
          nothing": as if He were to say, according to Augustine's exposition on
          Ps. 4 [*On Ps. 98:9]: "Give a spiritual meaning to what I have said.
          You are not to eat this body which you see, nor to drink the blood
          which they who crucify Me are to spill. It is a mystery that I put
          before you: in its spiritual sense it will quicken you; but the flesh
          profiteth nothing."<br />

          Praeterea, dominus dicit, Matth. ult., ecce, ego vobiscum sum omnibus
          diebus usque ad consummationem saeculi, quod exponens Augustinus
          dicit, donec saeculum finiatur, sursum est dominus, sed tamen et hic
          nobiscum est veritas dominus. Corpus enim in quo resurrexit, uno in
          loco esse oportet, veritas autem eius ubique diffusa est. Non ergo
          secundum veritatem est corpus Christi in hoc sacramento, sed solum
          sicut in signo.

            >Mt. 28:20</a
          >): "Behold I am with you all days even to the consummation of the
          world." Now in explaining this, Augustine makes this observation
          (Tract. xxx in Joan.): "The Lord is on high until the world be ended;
          nevertheless the truth of the Lord is here with us; for the body, in
          which He rose again, must be in one place; but His truth is spread
          abroad everywhere." Therefore, the body of Christ is not in this
          sacrament in very truth, but only as in a sign.<br />

          and it is in heaven. Consequently, it seems that it is not in very

          <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the Church's sacraments are

          certain Homily (xxviii in Evang.), the ruler is rebuked "for demanding
          Christ's bodily presence." Moreover the apostles were prevented from
          receiving the Holy Ghost because they were attached to His bodily
          presence, as Augustine says on Jn. 16:7: "Except I go, the Paraclete
          will not come to you" (Tract. xciv in Joan.). Therefore Christ is not
          in the sacrament of the altar according to His bodily presence.<br />

          now by our Lord's own declaring and by our faith His flesh is truly
          food, and His blood is truly drink." And Ambrose says (De Sacram. vi):

          auctoritati divinae innititur. Unde super illud Luc. XXII, hoc est
          corpus meum quod pro vobis tradetur, dicit Cyrillus, non dubites an

          blood in this sacrament cannot be detected by sense, nor
          understanding, but by faith alone, which rests upon Divine authority.
          Hence, on Lk. 22:19: "This is My body which shall be delivered up for
          you," Cyril says: "Doubt not whether this be true; but take rather the
          Saviour's words with faith; for since He is the Truth, He lieth

          Hoc autem conveniens est, primo quidem, perfectioni novae legis.
          Sacrificia enim veteris legis illud verum sacrificium passionis
          Christi continebant solum in figura, secundum illud Heb. X, umbram
          habens lex futurorum bonorum, non ipsam rerum imaginem. Et ideo
          oportuit ut aliquid plus haberet sacrificium novae legis a Christo
          institutum, ut scilicet contineret ipsum passum, non solum in
          significatione vel figura, sed etiam in rei veritate. Et ideo hoc
          sacramentum, quod ipsum Christum realiter continet, ut Dionysius
          dicit, III cap. Eccles. Hierar., est perfectivum omnium sacramentorum
          aliorum, in quibus virtus Christi participatur.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Now this is suitable, first for the perfection of the New Law. For,
          the sacrifices of the Old Law contained only in figure that true
          sacrifice of Christ's Passion, according to Heb. 10:1: "For the law
          having a shadow of the good things to come, not the very image of the
          things." And therefore it was necessary that the sacrifice of the New
          Law instituted by Christ should have something more, namely, that it
          should contain Christ Himself crucified, not merely in signification
          or figure, but also in very truth. And therefore this sacrament which
          contains Christ Himself, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), is
          perfective of all the other sacraments, in which Christ's virtue is
          participated.<br />

          Secundo, hoc competit caritati Christi, ex qua pro salute nostra
          corpus verum nostrae naturae assumpsit. Et quia maxime proprium
          amicitiae est, convivere amicis, ut philosophus dicit, IX Ethic., sui
          praesentiam corporalem nobis repromittit in praemium, Matth. XXIV, ubi
          fuerit corpus, illuc congregabuntur et aquilae. Interim tamen nec sua
          praesentia corporali in hac peregrinatione destituit, sed per
          veritatem corporis et sanguinis sui nos sibi coniungit in hoc
          sacramento. Unde ipse dicit, Ioan. VI, qui manducat meam carnem et
          bibit meum sanguinem, in me manet et ego in eo. Unde hoc sacramentum
          est maximae caritatis signum, et nostrae spei sublevamentum, ex tam

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Secondly, this belongs to Christ's love, out of which for our
          salvation He assumed a true body of our nature. And because it is the
          special feature of friendship to live together with friends, as the
          Philosopher says (Ethic. ix), He promises us His bodily presence as a
          reward, saying (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++24%3A28"
            >Mt. 24:28</a
          >): "Where the body is, there shall the eagles be gathered together."
          Yet meanwhile in our pilgrimage He does not deprive us of His bodily
          presence; but unites us with Himself in this sacrament through the
          truth of His body and blood. Hence (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++6%3A57"
            >Jn. 6:57</a
          >) he says: "He that eateth My flesh, and drinketh My blood, abideth
          in Me, and I in him." Hence this sacrament is the sign of supreme
          charity, and the uplifter of our hope, from such familiar union of
          Christ with us.<br />

          Thirdly, it belongs to the perfection of faith, which concerns His
          humanity just as it does His Godhead, according to Jn. 14:1: "You
          believe in God, believe also in Me." And since faith is of things
          unseen, as Christ shows us His Godhead invisibly, so also in this
          sacrament He shows us His flesh in an invisible manner.<br />

          From this authority the aforesaid heretics have taken occasion to err
          from evilly understanding Augustine's words. For when Augustine says:
          "You are not to eat this body which you see," he means not to exclude
          the truth of Christ's body, but that it was not to be eaten in this
          species in which it was seen by them. And by the words: "It is a
          mystery that I put before you; in its spiritual sense it will quicken
          you," he intends not that the body of Christ is in this sacrament
          merely according to mystical signification, but "spiritually," that
          is, invisibly, and by the power of the spirit. Hence (Tract. xxvii),
          expounding Jn. 6:64: "the flesh profiteth nothing," he says: "Yea, but
          as they understood it, for they understood that the flesh was to be
          eaten as it is divided piecemeal in a dead body, or as sold in the
          shambles, not as it is quickened by the spirit... Let the spirit draw
          nigh to the flesh... then the flesh profiteth very much: for if the
          flesh profiteth nothing, the Word had not been made flesh, that It
          might dwell among us."<br />

          a place, which by its dimensions is commensurate with the place; but
          in a special manner which is proper to this sacrament. Hence we say

          This argument holds good of Christ's bodily presence, as He is present
          after the manner of a body, that is, as it is in its visible
          appearance, but not as it is spiritually, that is, invisibly, after

          Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iv): "Since it is customary for men to
          eat bread and drink wine, God has wedded his Godhead to them, and made
          them His body and blood": and further on: "The bread of communication
          is not simple bread, but is united to the Godhead." But wedding
          together belongs to things actually existing. Therefore the bread and

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some have held that the substance of the
          bread and wine remains in this sacrament after the consecration. But
          this opinion cannot stand: first of all, because by such an opinion
          the truth of this sacrament is destroyed, to which it belongs that
          Christ's true body exists in this sacrament; which indeed was not
          there before the consecration. Now a thing cannot be in any place,
          where it was not previously, except by change of place, or by the
          conversion of another thing into itself; just as fire begins anew to
          be in some house, either because it is carried thither, or because it
          is generated there. Now it is evident that Christ's body does not
          begin to be present in this sacrament by local motion. First of all,
          because it would follow that it would cease to be in heaven: for what
          is moved locally does not come anew to some place unless it quit the
          former one. Secondly, because every body moved locally passes through
          all intermediary spaces, which cannot be said here. Thirdly, because
          it is not possible for one movement of the same body moved locally to
          be terminated in different places at the one time, whereas the body of
          Christ under this sacrament begins at the one time to be in several
          places. And consequently it remains that Christ's body cannot begin to
          be anew in this sacrament except by change of the substance of bread
          into itself. But what is changed into another thing, no longer remains
          after such change. Hence the conclusion is that, saving the truth of
          this sacrament, the substance of the bread cannot remain after the
          consecration.<br />

          Now the original matter into which mixed bodies can be dissolved is
          the four elements. For dissolution cannot be made into primary matter,
          so that a subject can exist without a form, since matter cannot exist
          without a form. But since after the consecration nothing remains under
          the sacramental species except the body and the blood of Christ, it
          will be necessary to say that the elements into which the substance of
          the bread and wine is dissolved, depart from thence by local motion,
          which would be perceived by the senses. In like manner also the
          substance of the bread or wine remains until the last instant of the
          consecration; but in the last instant of the consecration there is
          already present there the substance of the body or blood of Christ,
          just as the form is already present in the last instant of generation.
          Hence no instant can be assigned in which the original matter can be
          there. For it cannot be said that the substance of the bread or wine
          is dissolved gradually into the original matter, or that it
          successively quits the species, for if this began to be done in the
          last instant of its consecration, then at the one time under part of
          the host there would be the body of Christ together with the substance
          of bread, which is contrary to what has been said above (<a
            href="TP075.html#TPQ75A2THEP1"
            >Article [2]</a

          will then be a time in which under one part of the host there will be
          neither the substance of bread nor the body of Christ, which is not
          fitting. They seem indeed to have taken this into careful
          consideration, wherefore they formulated their proposition with an
          alternative viz. that (the substance) may be annihilated. But even
          this cannot stand, because no way can be assigned whereby Christ's
          true body can begin to be in this sacrament, except by the change of
          the substance of bread into it, which change is excluded the moment we
          admit either annihilation of the substance of the bread, or
          dissolution into the original matter. Likewise no cause can be
          assigned for such dissolution or annihilation, since the effect of the
          sacrament is signified by the form: "This is My body." Hence it is
          clear that the aforesaid opinion is false.<br />

          in potentiality is now in act. because as is said in Phys. iii:
          "motion is the act of a thing existing in potentiality." But no
          subject can be assigned for the substance of the bread and of the body
          of Christ, because it is of the very nature of substance for it "not
          to be in a subject," as it is said in Praedic. iii. Therefore it is
          not possible for the whole substance of the bread to be converted into

          <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the form of the thing into which
          another is converted, begins anew to inhere in the matter of the thing

          existing, the form of fire begins anew to be in the matter of the air;
          and in like manner when food is converted into non-pre-existing man,
          the form of the man begins to be anew in the matter of the food.
          Therefore, if bread be changed into the body of Christ, the form of
          Christ's body must necessarily begin to be in the matter of the bread,
          which is false. Consequently, the bread is not changed into the

          wills: a man is not wont to be born save of man and woman: see
          therefore that against the established law and order a man is born of
          a Virgin": and] [*The passage in the brackets is not in the Leonine

          then, do you look for nature's order in Christ's body, since the Lord
          Jesus was Himself brought forth of a Virgin beyond nature?" Chrysostom
          likewise (Hom. xlvii), commenting on Jn. 6:64: "The words which I have
          spoken to you," namely, of this sacrament, "are spirit and life,"
          says: i.e. "spiritual, having nothing carnal, nor natural consequence;

          For it is evident that every agent acts according as it is in act. But
          every created agent is limited in its act, as being of a determinate
          genus and species: and consequently the action of every created agent
          bears upon some determinate act. Now the determination of every thing
          in actual existence comes from its form. Consequently, no natural or
          created agent can act except by changing the form in something; and on
          this account every change made according to nature's laws is a formal
          change. But God is infinite act, as stated in the FP, Question [7],
          Article [1]; Question [26], Article [2]; hence His action extends to
          the whole nature of being. Therefore He can work not only formal
          conversion, so that diverse forms succeed each other in the same
          subject; but also the change of all being, so that, to wit, the whole
          substance of one thing be changed into the whole substance of another.
          And this is done by Divine power in this sacrament; for the whole
          substance of the bread is changed into the whole substance of Christ's
          body, and the whole substance of the wine into the whole substance of
          Christ's blood. Hence this is not a formal, but a substantial
          conversion; nor is it a kind of natural movement: but, with a name of
          its own, it can be called "transubstantiation."<br />

          Form cannot be changed into form, nor matter into matter by the power
          of any finite agent. Such a change, however, can be made by the power
          of an infinite agent, which has control over all being, because the

          Some of the operations of bread follow it by reason of the accidents,
          such as to affect the senses, and such operations are found in the
          species of the bread after the consecration on account of the

          between the instant that marks the close of rest, and another which
          marks the beginning of movement, there is no mid-time. But in this
          they are mistaken, because the unity of time and of instant, or even
          their plurality, is not taken according to movements of any sort, but
          according to the first movement of the heavens, which is the measure

          Accordingly others grant this of the time which measures movement

          by it, as was said in the FP, Question [53], Article [3] concerning
          the movements of the angels. Hence between two instants responding to
          those movements there is no mid-time. But this is not to the point,
          because although the change in question has no relation of itself to
          the movement of the heavens, still it follows the pronouncing of the
          words, which (pronouncing) must necessarily be measured by the
          movement of the heavens. And therefore there must of necessity be a

          of bread is there, but a last time can be assigned. And the same holds
          good in natural changes, as is evident from the Philosopher (Phys.
          viii).<br />

          In instantaneous changes a thing is "in becoming," and is "in being"
          simultaneously; just as becoming illuminated and to be actually

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that this proposition is false:
          "The body of Christ is made out of bread." For everything out of which
          another is made, is that which is made the other; but not conversely:
          for we say that a black thing is made out of a white thing, and that a
          white thing is made black: and although we may say that a man becomes
          black still we do not say that a black thing is made out of a man, as
          is shown in Phys. i. If it be true, then, that Christ's body is made
          out of bread, it will be true to say that bread is made the body of
          Christ. But this seems to be false, because the bread is not the
          subject of the making, but rather its term. Therefore, it is not said
          truly that Christ's body is made out of bread.<br />

          Again, this conversion has something in common with natural

          of all because in both, one of the extremes passes into the other, as
          bread into Christ's body, and air into fire; whereas non-being is not
          converted into being. But this comes to pass differently on the one
          side and on the other; for in this sacrament the whole substance of
          the bread passes into the whole body of Christ; whereas in natural
          transmutation the matter of the one receives the form of the other,
          the previous form being laid aside. Secondly, they have this in
          common, that on both sides something remains the same; whereas this
          does not happen in creation: yet differently; for the same matter or
          subject remains in natural transmutation; whereas in this sacrament

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          From these observations we can gather the various ways of speaking in
          such matters. For, because in no one of the aforesaid three things are
          the extremes coexistent, therefore in none of them can one extreme be
          predicated of the other by the substantive verb of the present tense:
          for we do not say, "Non-being is being" or, "Bread is the body of
          Christ," or, "Air is fire," or, "White is black." Yet because of the
          relationship of the extremes in all of them we can use the preposition
          "ex" [out of], which denotes order; for we can truly and properly say
          that "being is made out of non-being," and "out of bread, the body of
          Christ," and "out of air, fire," and "out of white, black." But
          because in creation one of the extremes does not pass into the other,
          we cannot use the word "conversion" in creation, so as to say that
          "non-being is converted into being": we can, however, use the word in
          this sacrament, just as in natural transmutation. But since in this
          sacrament the whole substance is converted into the whole substance,
          on that account this conversion is properly termed
          transubstantiation.<br />

          quae verificantur in conversione naturali ratione subiecti, non sunt
          concedenda in hac conversione. Et primo quidem, manifestum est quod
          potentia ad oppositum consequitur subiectum, ratione cuius dicimus

          non sit ita propria sicut prima, nam subiectum albi, in quo est

          Again, since there is no subject of this conversion, the things which
          are true in natural conversion by reason of the subject, are not to be
          granted in this conversion. And in the first place indeed it is
          evident that potentiality to the opposite follows a subject, by reason
          whereof we say that "a white thing can be black," or that "air can be
          fire"; although the latter is not so proper as the former: for the
          subject of whiteness, in which there is potentiality to blackness, is
          the whole substance of the white thing; since whiteness is not a part
          thereof; whereas the subject of the form of air is part thereof: hence
          when it is said, "Air can be fire," it is verified by synecdoche by
          reason of the part. But in this conversion, and similarly in creation,
          because there is no subject, it is not said that one extreme can be
          the other, as that "non-being can be being," or that "bread can be the
          body of Christ": and for the same reason it cannot be properly said
          that "being is made of [de] non-being," or that "the body of Christ is
          made of bread," because this preposition "of" [de] denotes a
          consubstantial cause, which consubstantiality of the extremes in
          natural transmutations is considered according to something common in
          the subject. And for the same reason it is not granted that "bread
          will be the body of Christ," or that it "may become the body of
          Christ," just as it is not granted in creation that "non-being will be
          being," or that "non-being may become being," because this manner of
          speaking is verified in natural transmutations by reason of the
          subject: for instance, when we say that "a white thing becomes black,"
          or "a white thing will be black."<br />

          in creatione, in qua hoc solum difficile est, quod aliquid fit ex
          nihilo, quod tamen pertinet ad proprium modum productionis primae
          causae, quae nihil aliud praesupponit. Sed in hac conversione non
          solum est difficile quod hoc totum convertitur in illud totum, ita
          quod nihil prioris remaneat, quod non pertinet ad communem modum
          productionis alicuius causae, sed etiam habet hoc difficile, quod
          accidentia remanent corrupta substantia, et multa alia, de quibus in
          sequentibus agetur. Tamen verbum conversionis recipitur in hoc
          sacramento, non autem in creatione, sicut dictum est.

          In this change there are many more difficulties than in creation, in
          which there is but this one difficulty, that something is made out of
          nothing; yet this belongs to the proper mode of production of the
          first cause, which presupposes nothing else. But in this conversion
          not only is it difficult for this whole to be changed into that whole,
          so that nothing of the former may remain (which does not belong to the
          common mode of production of a cause), but furthermore it has this
          difficulty that the accidents remain while the substance is destroyed,
          and many other difficulties of which we shall treat hereafter (<a
            href="TP077.html#TPQ77OUTP1"
            >Question [77]</a
          >). Nevertheless the word "conversion" is admitted in this sacrament,
          but not in creation, as stated above.<br />

          Ad quartum dicendum quod, sicut dictum est, potentia pertinet ad
          subiectum, quod non est accipere in hac conversione. Et ideo non
          conceditur quod panis possit esse corpus Christi, non enim haec
          conversio fit per potentiam passivam creaturae, sed per solam
          potentiam activam creatoris.

          As was observed above, potentiality belongs to the subject, whereas
          there is no subject in this conversion. And therefore it is not
          granted that bread can be the body of Christ: for this conversion does
          not come about by the passive potentiality of the creature, but solely
          by the active power of the Creator.<br />
