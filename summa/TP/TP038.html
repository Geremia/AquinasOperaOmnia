          hands... and when they come from the market, unless they be washed,

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for John to baptize, for
          four reasons: first, it was necessary for Christ to be baptized by
          John, in order that He might sanctify baptism; as Augustine observes,
          super Joan. (Tract. xiii in Joan.).<br />

          Ioan. I, ut manifestetur, scilicet Christus, in Israel, propterea veni
          ego in aqua baptizans. Concurrentibus enim turbis annuntiabat
          Christum, quod quidem facilius sic factum est quam si per singulos
          discurrisset, ut Chrysostomus dicit, super Ioan.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Secondly, that Christ might be manifested. Whence John himself says
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A31"
            >Jn. 1:31</a
          >): "That He," i.e. Christ, "may be made manifest in Israel, therefore
          am I come baptizing with water." For he announced Christ to the crowds
          that gathered around him; which was thus done much more easily than if
          he had gone in search of each individual, as Chrysostom observes,
          commenting on St. John (Hom. x in Matth.).<br />

          Tertio, ut suo Baptismo assuefaceret homines ad Baptismum Christi.

          ut, praecursionis suae ordinem servans, qui nasciturum dominum

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Thirdly, that by his baptism he might accustom men to the baptism of
          Christ; wherefore Gregory says in a homily (Hom. vii in Evang.) that
          therefore did John baptize, "that, being consistent with his office of
          precursor, as he had preceded our Lord in birth, so he might also by
          baptizing precede Him who was about to baptize."<br />

          Quarto ut, ad poenitentiam homines inducens, homines praepararet ad
          digne suscipiendum Baptismum Christi. Unde Beda dicit quod, quantum
          catechumenis nondum baptizatis prodest doctrina fidei, tantum profuit
          Baptisma Ioannis ante Baptisma Christi. Quia sicut ille praedicabat
          poenitentiam, et Baptismum Christi praenuntiabat, et in cognitionem
          veritatis quae mundo apparuit attrahebat; sic ministri Ecclesiae, qui

          Fourthly, that by persuading men to do penance, he might prepare men
          to receive worthily the baptism of Christ. Wherefore Bede [*Cf. Scot.
          Erig. in Joan. iii, 24] says that "the baptism of John was as
          profitable before the baptism of Christ, as instruction in the faith
          profits the catechumens not yet baptized. For just as he preached
          penance, and foretold the baptism of Christ, and drew men to the
          knowledge of the Truth that hath appeared to the world, so do the
          ministers of the Church, after instructing men, chide them for their
          sins, and lastly promise them forgiveness in the baptism of
          Christ."<br />

          baptized again, because they did not know of the Holy Ghost: as Jerome
          says on Joel 2:28 and in an epistle (lxix De Viro unius uxoris), and
          likewise Ambrose (De Spiritu Sancto). But some were baptized with
          John's baptism who had full knowledge of the Trinity. Therefore these

          because it is believed?" Whence it is clear that the virtue of baptism
          depends on faith. But the form of John's baptism signified the faith
          in which we are baptized; for Paul says (<a

          oportet totaliter innovari. Est autem de necessitate Baptismi Christi
          quod fiat non solum in aqua, sed etiam in spiritu sancto, secundum
          illud Ioan. III, nisi quis renatus fuerit ex aqua et spiritu sancto,
          non potest introire in regnum Dei. Unde illis qui tantum in aqua

          And this, indeed, is true as to the first part, and is confirmed by
          many authorities. But as to the second part, the assertion is
          altogether unreasonable. First, because John's baptism neither
          conferred grace nor imprinted a character, but was merely "in water,"
          as he says himself (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++3%3A11"
            >Mt. 3:11</a
          >). Wherefore the faith or hope which the person baptized had in
          Christ could not supply this defect. Secondly, because, when in a
          sacrament, that is omitted which belongs of necessity to the
          sacrament, not only must the omission be supplied, but the whole must
          be entirely renewed. Now, it belongs of necessity to Christ's baptism
          that it be given not only in water, but also in the Holy Ghost,
          according to Jn. 3:5: "Unless a man be born of water and the Holy
          Ghost, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Wherefore in the case
          of those who had been baptized with John's baptism in water only, not
          merely had the omission to be supplied by giving them the Holy Ghost
          by the imposition of hands, but they had to be baptized wholly anew
          "in water and the Holy Ghost."<br />

          not with him by whose ministry it is given." For the same reason those
          who were baptized by the deacon Philip, who gave the baptism of
          Christ, were not baptized again, but received the imposition of hands
