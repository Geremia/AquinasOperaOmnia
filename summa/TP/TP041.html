          conveniebat. Tentare enim est experimentum sumere. Quod quidem non fit
          nisi de re ignota. Sed virtus Christi erat nota etiam Daemonibus,

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not becoming for
          Christ to be tempted. For to tempt is to make an experiment, which is
          not done save in regard to something unknown. But the power of Christ
          was known even to the demons; for it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++4%3A41"
            >Lk. 4:41</a
          >) that "He suffered them not to speak, for they knew that He was
          Christ." Therefore it seems that it was unbecoming for Christ to be
          tempted.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ was come in order to

          purpose the Son of God appeared, that He might destroy the works of
          the devil." But it is not for the same to destroy the works of a
          certain one and to suffer them. Therefore it seems unbecoming that
          Christ should suffer Himself to be tempted by the devil.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod Christus tentari voluit, primo quidem, ut
          nobis contra tentationes auxilium ferret. Unde Gregorius dicit, in
          homilia, non erat indignum redemptori nostro quod tentari voluit, qui
          venerat et occidi, ut sic tentationes nostras suis tentationibus
          vinceret, sicut mortem nostram sua morte superavit.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ wished to be tempted; first that
          He might strengthen us against temptations. Hence Gregory says in a
          homily (xvi in Evang.): "It was not unworthy of our Redeemer to wish
          to be tempted, who came also to be slain; in order that by His
          temptations He might conquer our temptations, just as by His death He
          overcame our death."<br />

          Secundo, propter nostram cautelam, ut nullus, quantumcumque sanctus,
          se existimet securum et immunem a tentatione. Unde etiam post
          Baptismum tentari voluit, quia, sicut Hilarius dicit, super Matth., in
          sanctificatis maxime Diaboli tentamenta grassantur, quia victoria
          magis est ei exoptanda de sanctis. Unde et Eccli. II dicitur, fili,
          accedens ad servitutem Dei, sta in iustitia et timore, et praepara
          animam tuam ad tentationem.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Secondly, that we might be warned, so that none, however holy, may
          think himself safe or free from temptation. Wherefore also He wished
          to be tempted after His baptism, because, as Hilary says (Super
          Matth., cap. iii.): "The temptations of the devil assail those
          principally who are sanctified, for he desires, above all, to overcome
          the holy. Hence also it is written (Ecclus. 2): Son, when thou comest
          to the service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare thy
          soul for temptation."<br />

          Tertio, propter exemplum, ut scilicet nos instrueret qualiter Diaboli
          tentationes vincamus. Unde Augustinus dicit, in IV de Trin. quod
          Christus Diabolo se tentandum praebuit, ut ad superandas tentationes
          eius mediator esset, non solum per adiutorium, verum etiam per

          Thirdly, in order to give us an example: to teach us, to wit, how to
          overcome the temptations of the devil. Hence Augustine says (De Trin.
          iv) that Christ "allowed Himself to be tempted" by the devil, "that He
          might be our Mediator in overcoming temptations, not only by helping
          us, but also by giving us an example."<br />

          Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus dicit, in IX de Civ.
          Dei, Christus tantum innotuit Daemonibus quantum voluit, non per id
          quod est vita aeterna, sed per quaedam temporalia suae virtutis
          effecta, ex quibus quandam coniecturam habebant Christum esse filium
          Dei. Sed quia rursus in eo quaedam signa humanae infirmitatis
          videbant, non pro certo cognoscebant eum esse filium Dei. Et ideo eum
          tentare voluit. Et hoc significatur Matth. IV, ubi dicitur quod
          postquam esuriit, accessit tentator ad eum, quia, ut Hilarius dicit,
          tentare Christum Diabolus non fuisset ausus, nisi in eo, per
          esuritionis infirmitatem, quae sunt hominis recognosceret. Et hoc
          etiam patet ex ipso modo tentandi, cum dixit, si filius Dei es. Quod
          exponens Gregorius dicit, quid sibi vult talis sermonis exorsus, nisi
          quia cognoverat Dei filium esse venturum, sed venisse per infirmitatem
          corporis non putabat?
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei
          ix): "Christ was known to the demons only so far as He willed; not as
          the Author of eternal life, but as the cause of certain temporal
          effects," from which they formed a certain conjecture that Christ was
          the Son of God. But since they also observed in Him certain signs of
          human frailty, they did not know for certain that He was the Son of
          God: wherefore (the devil) wished to tempt Him. This is implied by the
          words of Mt. 4:2,3, saying that, after "He was hungry, the tempter"
          came "to Him," because, as Hilary says (Super Matth., cap. iii), "Had
          not Christ's weakness in hungering betrayed His human nature, the
          devil would not have dared to tempt Him." Moreover, this appears from
          the very manner of the temptation, when he said: "If Thou be the Son
          of God." Which words Ambrose explains as follows (In Luc. iv): "What
          means this way of addressing Him, save that, though he knew that the
          Son of God was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in the
          weakness of the flesh?"<br />

      </tr>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Ad secundum dicendum quod Christus venerat dissolvere opera Diaboli,
          non potestative agendo, sed magis ab eo et eius membris patiendo, ut
          sic Diabolum vinceret iustitia, non potestate, sicut Augustinus dicit,
          XIII de Trin., quod Diabolus non potentia Dei, sed iustitia superandus
          fuit. Et ideo circa tentationem Christi considerandum est quod propria
          voluntate fecit, et quod a Diabolo passus fuit. Quod enim tentatori se
          offerret, fuit propriae voluntatis. Unde dicitur Matth. IV, ductus est
          Iesus in desertum a spiritu, ut tentaretur a Diabolo, quod Gregorius
          intelligendum dicit de spiritu sancto, ut scilicet illuc eum spiritus
          suus duceret, ubi eum ad tentandum spiritus malignus inveniret. Sed a
          Diabolo passus est quod assumeretur vel supra pinnaculum templi, vel
          etiam in montem excelsum valde. Nec est mirum, ut Gregorius dicit, si
          se ab illo permisit in montem duci, qui se permisit a membris ipsius
          crucifigi. Intelligitur autem a Diabolo assumptus, non quasi ex
          necessitate, sed quia, ut Origenes dicit, super Luc., sequebatur eum
          ad tentationem quasi athleta sponte procedens.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b>
          Christ came to destroy the works of the devil, not by powerful deeds,
          but rather by suffering from him and his members, so as to conquer the
          devil by righteousness, not by power; thus Augustine says (De Trin.
          xiii) that "the devil was to be overcome, not by the power of God, but
          by righteousness." And therefore in regard to Christ's temptation we
          must consider what He did of His own will and what He suffered from
          the devil. For that He allowed Himself to be tempted was due to His
          own will. Wherefore it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++4%3A1"
            >Mt. 4:1</a
          >): "Jesus was led by the Spirit into the desert, to be tempted by the
          devil"; and Gregory (Hom. xvi in Evang.) says this is to be understood
          of the Holy Ghost, to wit, that "thither did His Spirit lead Him,
          where the wicked spirit would find Him and tempt Him." But He suffered
          from the devil in being "taken up" on to "the pinnacle of the Temple"
          and again "into a very high mountain." Nor is it strange, as Gregory
          observes, "that He allowed Himself to be taken by him on to a
          mountain, who allowed Himself to be crucified by His members." And we
          understand Him to have been taken up by the devil, not, as it were, by
          force, but because, as Origen says (Hom. xxi super Luc.), "He followed
          Him in the course of His temptation like a wrestler advancing of his
          own accord."<br />

          Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut apostolus dicit, Christus in omnibus

          potest esse sine peccato, quia fit per solam exteriorem suggestionem.
          Tentatio autem quae est a carne, non potest esse sine peccato, quia
          haec tentatio fit per delectationem et concupiscentiam; et, sicut
          Augustinus dicit, nonnullum peccatum est cum caro concupiscit adversus
          spiritum. Et ideo Christus tentari voluit ab hoste, sed non a carne.

          >), Christ wished to be "tempted in all things, without sin." Now
          temptation which comes from an enemy can be without sin: because it
          comes about by merely outward suggestion. But temptation which comes
          from the flesh cannot be without sin, because such a temptation is
          caused by pleasure and concupiscence; and, as Augustine says (De Civ.
          Dei xix), "it is not without sin that 'the flesh desireth against the
          spirit.'" And hence Christ wished to be tempted by an enemy, but not
          by the flesh.<br />

          ergo eius tentatio sit nostrum exemplum, videtur quod etiam alii
          debeant se ingerere ad tentationes suscipiendas. Quod tamen videtur

          <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom says (Hom. xii in
          Matth.): "Then most especially does the devil assail by tempting us,
          when he sees us alone. Thus did he tempt the woman in the beginning
          when he found her apart from her husband." Hence it seems that, by
          going into the desert to be tempted, He exposed Himself to temptation.
          Since, therefore, His temptation is an example to us, it seems that
          others too should take such steps as will lead them into temptation.
          And yet this seems a dangerous thing to do, since rather should we
          avoid the occasion of being tempted.<br />

          the devil, just as by His own free-will He submitted to be killed by
          His members; else the devil would not have dared to approach Him. Now

          was that Christ went out into the desert, as to a field of battle, to
          be tempted there by the devil. Hence Ambrose says on Lk. 4:1, that
          "Christ was led into the desert for the purpose of provoking the
          devil. For had he," i.e. the devil, "not fought, He," i.e. Christ,
          "would not have conquered." He adds other reasons, saying that "Christ
          in doing this set forth the mystery of Adam's delivery from exile,"
          who had been expelled from paradise into the desert, and "set an
          example to us, by showing that the devil envies those who strive for

          Another occasion of temptation is on the part of the devil, who always
          "envies those who strive for better things," as Ambrose says (In Luc.
          iv, 1). And such occasions of temptation are not to be avoided. Hence
          Chrysostom says (Hom. v in Matth. [*From the supposititious Opus
          Imperfectum]): "Not only Christ was led into the desert by the Spirit,
          but all God's children that have the Holy Ghost. For it is not enough
          for them to sit idle; the Holy Ghost urges them to endeavor to do
          something great: which is for them to be in the desert from the
          devil's standpoint, for no unrighteousness, in which the devil
          delights, is there. Again, every good work, compared to the flesh and
          the world, is the desert; because it is not according to the will of
          the flesh and of the world." Now, there is no danger in giving the
          devil such an occasion of temptation; since the help of the Holy
          Ghost, who is the Author of the perfect deed, is more powerful* than
          the assault of the envious devil. [*All the codices read 'majus.' One
          of the earliest printed editions has 'magis,' which has much to
          commend it, since St. Thomas is commenting the text quoted from St.
          Chrysostom. The translation would run thus: 'since rather is it (the
          temptation) a help from the Holy Ghost, who,' etc.].<br />

          shouldst give thyself up, not to luxury, but to fasting; for this

          These words of Mark may be understood as meaning that "He was in the
          desert forty days and forty nights," and that He fasted during that
          time: and the words, "and He was tempted by Satan," may be taken as
          referring, not to the time during which He fasted, but to the time
          that followed: since Matthew says that "after He had fasted forty days
          and forty nights, afterwards He was hungry," thus affording the devil
          a pretext for approaching Him. And so the words that follow, and the
          angels ministered to Him, are to be taken in sequence, which is clear
          from the words of Matthew (4:11): "Then the devil left Him," i.e.
          after the temptation, "and behold angels came and ministered to Him."
          And as to the words inserted by Mark, "and He was with the beasts,"
          according to Chrysostom (Hom. xiii in Matth.), they are set down in

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The temptation which comes from the enemy

          Now a suggestion cannot be made to everybody in the same way; it must
          arise from those things towards which each one has an inclination.
          Consequently the devil does not straight away tempt the spiritual man
          to grave sins, but he begins with lighter sins, so as gradually to
          lead him to those of greater magnitude. Wherefore Gregory (Moral.
          xxxi), expounding Job 39:25, "He smelleth the battle afar off, the
          encouraging of the captains and the shouting of the army," says: "The
          captains are fittingly described as encouraging, and the army as
          shouting. Because vices begin by insinuating themselves into the mind
          under some specious pretext: then they come on the mind in such

          forbidden fruit, saying (<a

          of paradise?" Secondly [he tempted him] to vainglory by saying: "Your
          eyes shall be opened." Thirdly, he led the temptation to the extreme
          height of pride, saying: "You shall be as gods, knowing good and
          evil." This same order did he observe in tempting Christ. For at first
          he tempted Him to that which men desire, however spiritual they may
          be---namely, the support of the corporeal nature by food. Secondly, he
          advanced to that matter in which spiritual men are sometimes found
          wanting, inasmuch as they do certain things for show, which pertains
          to vainglory. Thirdly, he led the temptation on to that in which no
          spiritual men, but only carnal men, have a part---namely, to desire
          worldly riches and fame, to the extent of holding God in contempt. And
          so in the first two temptations he said: "If Thou be the Son of God";
          but not in the third, which is inapplicable to spiritual men, who are
          sons of God by adoption, whereas it does apply to the two preceding

          To make use of what is needful for self-support is not the sin of
          gluttony; but if a man do anything inordinate out of the desire for
          such support, it can pertain to the sin of gluttony. Now it is

          to obtain food miraculously for mere bodily support. Hence the Lord

          where there was no means of obtaining food otherwise. And in like
          fashion Christ miraculously provided the crowds with food in the
          desert, when there was no other means of getting food. But in order to
          assuage His hunger, He could have done otherwise than work a miracle,
          as did John the Baptist, according to Matthew (3:4); or He could have
          hastened to the neighboring country. Consequently the devil esteemed
          that if Christ was a mere man, He would fall into sin by attempting to
          assuage His hunger by a miracle.<br />

          It often happens that a man seeks to derive glory from external
          humiliation, whereby he is exalted by reason of spiritual good. Hence
          Augustine says (De Serm. Dom. in Monte ii, 12): "It must be noted that
          it is possible to boast not only of the beauty and splendor of
          material things, but even of filthy squalor." And this is signified by
          the devil urging Christ to seek spiritual glory by casting His body
          down.<br />

          It is a sin to desire worldly riches and honors in an inordinate
          fashion. And the principal sign of this is when a man does something
          wrong in order to acquire such things. And so the devil was not
          satisfied with instigating to a desire for riches and honors, but he
          went so far as to tempt Christ, for the sake of gaining possession of
          these things, to fall down and adore him, which is a very great crime,
          and against God. Nor does he say merely, "if Thou wilt adore me," but
          he adds, "if, falling down"; because, as Ambrose says on Lk. 4:5:
          "Ambition harbors yet another danger within itself: for, while seeking
          to rule, it will serve; it will bow in submission that it may be
          crowned with honor; and the higher it aims, the lower it abases
          itself."<br />

          may be that the Evangelists set these things in different orders,

          When Christ had suffered the wrong of being tempted by the devil
          saying, "If Thou be the Son of God cast Thyself down," He was not

          himself the honor due to God, saying, "All these things will I give
