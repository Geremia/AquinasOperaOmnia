          Respondeo dicendum quod quidam posuerunt in Christo esse unam solam
          voluntatem, sed ad hoc ponendum diversimode moti esse videntur.
          Apollinaris enim non posuit animam intellectualem in Christo, sed quod
          verbum esset loco animae, vel etiam loco intellectus. Unde, cum
          voluntas sit in ratione, ut philosophus dicit, in III de anima,
          sequebatur quod in Christo non esset voluntas humana, et ita in eo non
          esset nisi una voluntas. Et similiter Eutyches, et omnes qui posuerunt
          unam naturam compositam in Christo, cogebantur ponere unam voluntatem
          in eo. Nestorius etiam, qui posuit unionem Dei et hominis esse factam
          solum secundum affectum et voluntatem, posuit unam voluntatem in
          Christo. Postmodum vero Macarius Antiochenus patriarcha, et Cyrus
          Alexandrinus, et Sergius Constantinopolitanus, et quidam eorum
          sequaces, posuerunt in Christo unam voluntatem, quamvis ponerent duas
          naturas in Christo secundum hypostasim unitas, quia opinabantur quod
          humana natura in Christo nunquam movebatur proprio motu, sed solum
          secundum quod erat mota a divinitate, ut patet in epistola synodica
          Agathonis Papae.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some placed only one will in Christ; but
          they seem to have had different motives for holding this. For
          Apollinaris did not hold an intellectual soul in Christ, but
          maintained that the Word was in place of the soul, or even in place of
          the intellect. Hence since "the will is in the reason," as the
          Philosopher says (De Anima iii, 9), it followed that in Christ there
          was no human will; and thus there was only one will in Him. So, too,
          Eutyches and all who held one composite nature in Christ were forced
          to place one will in Him. Nestorius, too, who maintained that the
          union of God and man was one of affection and will, held only one will
          in Christ. But later on, Macarius, Patriarch of Antioch, Cyrus of
          Alexandria, and Sergius of Constantinople and some of their followers,
          held that there is one will in Christ, although they held that in
          Christ there are two natures united in a hypostasis; because they
          believed that Christ's human nature never moved with its own motion,
          but only inasmuch as it was moved by the Godhead, as is plain from the
          synodical letter of Pope Agatho [*Third Council of Constantinople,
          Act. 4].<br />

          And hence in the sixth Council held at Constantinople [*Act. 18] it
          was decreed that it must be said that there are two wills in Christ,
          in the following passage: "In accordance with what the Prophets of old
          taught us concerning Christ, and as He taught us Himself, and the
          Symbol of the Holy Fathers has handed down to us, we confess two
          natural wills in Him and two natural operations." And this much it was
          necessary to say. For it is manifest that the Son of God assumed a
          perfect human nature, as was shown above (<a
            href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"

          <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Now the will
          pertains to the perfection of human nature, being one of its natural
          powers, even as the intellect, as was stated in the FP, Questions
          [79],80. Hence we must say that the Son of God assumed a human will,
          together with human nature. Now by the assumption of human nature the
          Son of God suffered no diminution of what pertains to His Divine
          Nature, to which it belongs to have a will, as was said in the FP,
          Question [19], Article [1]. Hence it must be said that there are two
          wills in Christ, i.e. one human, the other Divine.<br />

          Whatever was in the human nature of Christ was moved at the bidding of
          the Divine will; yet it does not follow that in Christ there was no
          movement of the will proper to human nature, for the good wills of
          other saints are moved by God's will, "Who worketh" in them "both to
          will and to accomplish," as is written Phil. 2:13. For although the
          will cannot be inwardly moved by any creature, yet it can be moved
          inwardly by God, as was said in the FP, Question [105], Article [4].
          And thus, too, Christ by His human will followed the Divine will
          according to Ps. 39:9; "That I should do Thy will, O my God, I have
          desired it." Hence Augustine says (Contra Maxim. ii, 20): "Where the
          Son says to the Father, 'Not what I will, but what Thou willest,' what
          do you gain by adding your own words and saying 'He shows that His
          will was truly subject to His Father,' as if we denied that man's will
          ought to be subject to God's will?"<br />

          be moved by the principal agent, yet diversely, according to the
          property of its nature. For an inanimate instrument, as an axe or a
          saw, is moved by the craftsman with only a corporeal movement; but an
          instrument animated by a sensitive soul is moved by the sensitive
          appetite, as a horse by its rider; and an instrument animated with a
          rational soul is moved by its will, as by the command of his lord the
          servant is moved to act, the servant being like an animate instrument,
          as the Philosopher says (Polit. i, 2,4; Ethic. viii, 11). And hence it
          was in this manner that the human nature of Christ was the instrument
          of the Godhead, and was moved by its own will.<br />

          The power of the will is natural, and necessarily follows upon the
          nature; but the movement or act of this power---which is also called
          will---is sometimes natural and necessary, e.g. with respect to
          beatitude; and sometimes springs from free-will and is neither
          necessary nor natural, as is plain from what has been stated in the
          FS, Question [10], Articles [1],[2] [*Cf. FP, Question [82], Article
          [2]]. And yet even reason itself, which is the principle of this
          movement, is natural. Hence besides the Divine will it is necessary to
          place in Christ a human will, not merely as a natural power, or a
          natural movement, but even as a rational movement.<br />

          When we say "to will in a certain way," we signify a determinate mode
          of willing. Now a determinate mode regards the thing of which it is
          the mode. Hence since the will pertains to the nature, "to will in a
          certain way" belongs to the nature, not indeed considered absolutely,
          but as it is in the hypostasis. Hence the human will of Christ had a
          determinate mode from the fact of being in a Divine hypostasis, i.e.
          it was always moved in accordance with the bidding of the Divine
          will.<br />

            >Article [1]</a
          >, ad 3), the will is sometimes taken for the power, and sometimes for
          the act. Hence if the will is taken for the act, it is necessary to
          place two wills, i.e. two species of acts of the will in Christ on the
          part of the reason. For the will, as was said in the FS, Question [8],
          Articles [2],3, regards both the end and the means; and is affected
          differently towards both. For towards the end it is borne simply and
          absolutely, as towards what is good in itself; but towards the means
          it is borne under a certain relation, as the goodness of the means
          depends on something else. Hence the act of the will, inasmuch as it
          is drawn to anything desired of itself, as health, which act is called
          by Damascene {thelesis}---i.e. simple will, and by the masters "will
          as nature," is different from the act of the will as it is drawn to
          anything that is desired only in order to something else, as to take
          medicine; and this act of the will Damascene calls {boulesis}---i.e.
          counseling will, and the masters, "will as reason." But this diversity
          of acts does not diversify the power, since both acts regard the one
          common ratio of the object, which is goodness. Hence we must say that
          if we are speaking of the power of the will, in Christ there is but
          one human will, essentially so called and not by participation; but if
          we are speaking of the will as an act, we thus distinguish in Christ a

          i.e. opinion, thinking or cogitation, and {proairesis}, i.e. choice,
          "cannot possibly be attributed to our Lord, if we wish to speak with
          propriety." But in the things of faith especially we must speak with
          propriety. Therefore there was no choice in Christ and consequently no

          drawn to anything willed in itself, which implies the nature of an
          end; the other whereby His will was drawn to anything willed on
          account of its being ordained to another---which pertains to the
          nature of means. Now, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii, 2) choice
          differs from will in this, that will of itself regards the end, while
          choice regards the means. And thus simple will is the same as the
          "will as nature"; but choice is the same as the "will as reason," and
          is the proper act of free-will, as was said in the FP, Question [83],

          Respondeo dicendum quod sicut dictum est, in Christo secundum humanam
          naturam ponitur multiplex voluntas, scilicet voluntas sensualitatis,
          quae participative voluntas dicitur; et voluntas rationalis, sive
          consideretur per modum naturae, sive per modum rationis. Dictum est
          autem supra quod, ex quadam dispensatione, filius Dei, ante suam
          passionem, permittebat carni agere et pati quae sunt ei propria. Et
          similiter permittebat omnibus viribus animae agere quae propria.
          Manifestum est autem quod voluntas sensualitatis refugit naturaliter
          dolores sensibiles et corporis laesionem. Similiter etiam voluntas ut
          natura repudiat ea quae naturae sunt contraria, et quae sunt secundum
          se mala, puta mortem et alia huiusmodi. Haec tamen quandoque voluntas

          et passiones et mortem pateretur, non quod ista essent a Deo volita

          viz. the will of sensuality, which is called will by participation,
          and the rational will, whether considered after the manner of nature,
          or after the manner of reason. Now it was said above (<a

          certain dispensation the Son of God before His Passion "allowed His
          flesh to do and suffer what belonged to it." And in like manner He
          allowed all the powers of His soul to do what belonged to them. Now it
          is clear that the will of sensuality naturally shrinks from sensible
          pains and bodily hurt. In like manner, the will as nature turns from
          what is against nature and what is evil in itself, as death and the
          like; yet the will as reason may at time choose these things in
          relation to an end, as in a mere man the sensuality and the will
          absolutely considered shrink from burning, which, nevertheless, the
          will as reason may choose for the sake of health. Now it was the will
          of God that Christ should undergo pain, suffering, and death, not that
          these of themselves were willed by God, but for the sake of man's
          salvation. Hence it is plain that in His will of sensuality and in His
          rational will considered as nature, Christ could will what God did
          not; but in His will as reason He always willed the same as God, which
          appears from what He says (<a

          that the Divine will should be fulfilled although He said that He

          Ad sextum sic proceditur. Videtur quod in Christo fuerit contrarietas
          voluntatum. Contrarietas enim voluntatum attenditur secundum
          contrarietatem obiectorum, sicut et contrarietas motuum attenditur
          secundum contrarietatem terminorum, ut patet per philosophum, in V
          Physic. Sed Christus secundum diversas voluntates contraria volebat,
          nam secundum voluntatem divinam volebat mortem, quam refugiebat
          secundum voluntatem humanam. Unde Athanasius dicit, in libro adversus
          Apollinarium, quando Christus dixit, pater si possibile est, transeat
          a me calix iste, et tamen non mea, sed tua voluntas fiat, et iterum,
          spiritus promptus est, caro autem infirma, duas voluntates hic
          ostendit, humanam, quae propter infirmitatem carnis refugiebat
          passionem; et divinam eius, promptam ad passionem. Ergo in Christo
          fuit contrarietas voluntatum.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was contrariety of
          wills in Christ. For contrariety of wills regards contrariety of
          objects, as contrariety of movements springs from contrariety of
          termini, as is plain from the Philosopher (Phys. v, text. 49, seq.).
          Now Christ in His different wills wished contrary things. For in His
          Divine will He wished for death, from which He shrank in His human
          will, hence Athanasius says [*De Incarnat. et Cont. Arianos, written
          against Apollinarius]: "When Christ says 'Father, if it be possible,
          let this chalice pass from Me; yet not My will, but Thine be done,'
          and again, 'The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh weak,' He
          denotes two wills---the human, which through the weakness of the flesh
          shrank from the passion---and His Divine will eager for the passion."
          Hence there was contrariety of wills in Christ.<br />

          spiritus concupiscit unum, et caro aliud. Sed hoc fuit in Christo, nam
          per voluntatem caritatis, quam spiritus sanctus in eius mente
          faciebat, volebat passionem, secundum illud Isaiae LIII, oblatus est
          quia ipse voluit; secundum autem carnem, passionem refugiebat. Ergo

          the flesh." Now when the spirit desires one thing, and the flesh
          another, there is contrariety of wills. But this was in Christ; for by
          the will of charity which the Holy Spirit was causing in His mind, He
          willed the passion, according to Is. 53:7: "He was offered because it
          was His own will," yet in His flesh He shrank from the passion.

          Respondeo dicendum quod contrarietas non potest esse nisi oppositio
          attendatur in eodem et secundum idem. Si autem secundum diversa, et in
          diversis existat diversitas, non sufficit hoc ad rationem
          contrarietatis, sicut nec ad rationem contradictionis, puta quod homo
          sit pulcher aut sanus secundum manum, et non secundum pedem. Ad hoc
          igitur quod sit contrarietas voluntatum in aliquo, requiritur, primo
          quidem, quod secundum idem attendatur diversitas voluntatum. Si enim
          unius voluntas sit de aliquo fiendo secundum quandam rationem
          universalem, et alterius voluntas sit de eodem non fiendo secundum
          quandam rationem particularem, non est omnino contrarietas voluntatum.
          Puta, si rex vult suspendi latronem in bonum reipublicae, et aliquis
          eius consanguineus velit eum non suspendi propter amorem privatum, non
          erit contrarietas voluntatis, nisi forte se in tantum extendat
          voluntas boni privati ut bonum publicum velit impedire ut conservetur
          bonum privatum; tunc enim secundum idem attenderetur repugnantia
          voluntatum.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Contrariety can exist only where there is
          opposition in the same and as regards the same. For if the diversity
          exists as regards diverse things, and in diverse subjects, this would
          not suffice for the nature of contrariety, nor even for the nature of
          contradiction, e.g. if a man were well formed or healthy as regards
          his hand, but not as regards his foot. Hence for there to be
          contrariety of wills in anyone it is necessary, first, that the
          diversity of wills should regard the same. For if the will of one
          regards the doing of something with reference to some universal
          reason, and the will of another regards the not doing the same with
          reference to some particular reason, there is not complete contrariety
          of will, e.g. when a judge wishes a brigand to be hanged for the good
          of the commonwealth, and one of the latter's kindred wishes him not to
          be hanged on account of a private love, there is no contrariety of
          wills; unless, indeed, the desire of the private good went so far as
          to wish to hinder the public good for the private good---in that case
          the opposition of wills would regard the same.

          Secundo autem requiritur ad contrarietatem voluntatis, quod sit circa
          eandem voluntatem. Si enim homo vult unum secundum appetitum
          intellectus, et aliud secundum appetitum sensitivum, non est hic
          aliqua contrarietas, nisi forte appetitus sensitivus in tantum
          praevaleat quod vel immutet vel saltem retardet appetitum rationis;
          sic enim iam ad ipsam voluntatem rationis perveniet aliquid de motu

          Secondly, for contrariety of wills it is necessary that it should be
          in the same will. For if a man wishes one thing with his rational
          appetite, and wishes another thing with his sensitive appetite, there
          is no contrariety, unless the sensitive appetite so far prevailed as
          to change or at least keep back the rational appetite; for in this
          case something of the contrary movement of the sensitive appetite
          would reach the rational will.<br />

          voluntatum. Primo quidem, quia neque voluntas eius naturalis, neque
          voluntas sensualitatis, repudiabat illam rationem secundum quam divina
          voluntas, et voluntas rationis humanae in Christo, passionem volebant.
          Volebat enim voluntas absoluta in Christo salutem humani generis, sed
          eius non erat velle hoc in ordine ad aliud. Motus autem sensualitatis
          ad hoc se extendere non valebat. Secundo, quia neque voluntas divina,
          neque voluntas rationis in Christo, impediebatur aut retardabatur per

          ipso et voluntas sensualitatis secundum ordinem suae naturae

          And hence it must be said that although the natural and the sensitive
          will in Christ wished what the Divine will did not wish, yet there was
          no contrariety of wills in Him. First, because neither the natural
          will nor the will of sensuality rejected the reason for which the
          Divine will and the will of the human reason in Christ wished the
          passion. For the absolute will of Christ wished the salvation of the
          human race, although it did not pertain to it to will this for the
          sake of something further; but the movement of sensuality could nowise
          extend so far. Secondly, because neither the Divine will nor the will
          of reason in Christ was impeded or retarded by the natural will or the
          appetite of sensuality. So, too, on the other hand, neither the Divine
          will nor the will of reason in Christ shrank from or retarded the
          movement of the natural human will and the movement of the sensuality
          in Christ. For it pleased Christ, in His Divine will, and in His will
          of reason, that His natural will and will of sensuality should be
          moved according to the order of their nature. Hence it is clear that
          in Christ there was no opposition or contrariety of wills.<br />

          The agony in Christ was not in the rational soul, in as far as it
          implies a struggle in the will arising from a diversity of motives, as
          when anyone, on his reason considering one, wishes one thing, and on
          its considering another, wishes the contrary. For this springs from
          the weakness of the reason, which is unable to judge which is the best
          simply. Now this did not occur in Christ, since by His reason He
          judged it best that the Divine will regarding the salvation of the
          human race should be fulfilled by His passion. Nevertheless, there was
          an agony in Christ as regards the sensitive part, inasmuch as it
          implied a dread of coming trial, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii,
          15; iii, 18,23).<br />
