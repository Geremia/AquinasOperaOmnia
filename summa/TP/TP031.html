          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod caro Christi non fuerit sumpta
          ex Adam. Dicit enim apostolus, I Cor. XV, primus homo de terra,
          terrenus, secundus homo de caelo, caelestis. Primus autem homo est
          Adam, secundus homo est Christus. Ergo Christus non est ex Adam, sed

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's flesh was not
          derived from Adam. For the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A47"
            >1 Cor. 15:47</a
          >): "The first man was of the earth, earthly: the second man, from
          heaven, heavenly." Now, the first man is Adam: and the second man is
          Christ. Therefore Christ is not derived from Adam, but has an origin
          distinct from him.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, conceptio Christi debuit esse maxime miraculosa. Sed
              maius est miraculum formare corpus hominis ex limo terrae quam ex
              materia humana, quae de Adam trahitur. Ergo videtur quod non fuit
              conveniens Christum ab Adam carnem assumpsisse. Ergo videtur quod
              corpus Christi non debuit formari de massa humani generis derivata
              ab Adam, sed de aliqua alia materia.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the conception of Christ
              should have been most miraculous. But it is a greater miracle to
              form man's body from the slime of the earth, than from human
              matter derived from Adam. It seems therefore unfitting that Christ
              should take flesh from Adam. Therefore the body of Christ should
              not have been formed from the mass of the human race derived from
              Adam, but of some other matter.<br />

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, peccatum in hunc mundum intravit per hominem unum,
                  scilicet Adam, quia omnes in eo gentes originaliter
                  peccaverunt, ut patet Rom. V. Sed si corpus Christi fuisset ab
                  Adam sumptum, ipse etiam in Adam originaliter fuisset quando
                  peccavit. Ergo peccatum originale contraxisset. Quod non
                  decebat Christi puritatem. Non ergo corpus Christi est
                  formatum de materia sumpta ab Adam.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by "one man sin entered
                  into this world," i.e. by Adam, because in him all nations
                  sinned originally, as is clear from Rm. 5:12. But if Christ's
                  body was derived from Adam, He would have been in Adam
                  originally when he sinned: therefore he would have contracted
                  original sin; which is unbecoming in His purity. Therefore the

                      Abrahae apprehendit. Semen autem Abrahae sumptum est ab

          de semine David. Matthaeus enim, genealogiam Christi texens, eam ad
          Ioseph perduxit. Ioseph autem non fuit pater Christi, ut supra

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not take
          flesh of the seed of David. For Matthew, in tracing the genealogy of
          Christ, brings it down to Joseph. But Joseph was not Christ's father,
          as shown above (<a href="TP028.html#TPQ28OUTP1">Question [28]</a>,
          <a href="TP028.html#TPQ28A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 1,2). Therefore
          it seems that Christ was not descended from David.

              autem, mater Christi, cognata dicitur Elisabeth, quae est filia
              Aaron, ut patet Luc. I. Cum ergo David de tribu Iuda fuerit, ut
              patet Matth. I, videtur quod Christus de semine David non
              descenderit.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Aaron was of the tribe of
              Levi, as related Ex. 6. Now Mary the Mother of Christ is called
              the cousin of Elizabeth, who was a daughter of Aaron, as is clear
              from Lk. 1:5,36. Therefore, since David was of the tribe of Juda,
              as is shown Mt. 1, it seems that Christ was not descended from
              David.<br />

                              A second reason is because Christ was to be king,
                              prophet, and priest. Now Abraham was a priest;
                              which is clear from the Lord saying unto him (<a

                                  beginning in Abraham: while in David God's
                                  election was most clearly made manifest,

                                      Faustus the Manichean argued thus, in the
                                      desire to prove that Christ is not the Son
                                      of David, because He was not conceived of
                                      Joseph, in whom Matthew's genealogy
                                      terminates. Augustine answered this
                                      argument thus (Contra Faust. xxii): "Since
                                      the same evangelist affirms that Joseph
                                      was Mary's husband and that Christ's
                                      mother was a virgin, and that Christ was
                                      of the seed of Abraham, what must we
                                      believe, but that Mary was not a stranger
                                      to the family of David: and that it is not
                                      without reason that she was called the
                                      wife of Joseph, by reason of the close
                                      alliance of their hearts, although not
                                      mingled in the flesh; and that the
                                      genealogy is traced down to Joseph rather
                                      than to her by reason of the dignity of
                                      the husband? So therefore we believe that
                                      Mary was also of the family of David:
                                      because we believe the Scriptures, which
                                      assert both that Christ was of the seed of
                                      David according to the flesh, and that
                                      Mary was His Mother, not by sexual
                                      intercourse but retaining her virginity."
                                      For as Jerome says on Mt. 1:18: "Joseph
                                      and Mary were of the same tribe: wherefore
                                      he was bound by law to marry her as she
                                      was his kinswoman. Hence it was that they
                                      were enrolled together at Bethlehem, as
                                      being descended from the same stock."<br />

                                          objection by saying that it happened
                                          by God's will, that the royal family
                                          was united to the priestly race, so
                                          that Christ, who is both king and
                                          priest, should be born of both
                                          according to the flesh. Wherefore
                                          Aaron, who was the first priest
                                          according to the Law, married a wife

                                          who was of the family of David, would

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, there seem to be

                  the commencement of his book, beginning from Abraham and
                  coming down to Joseph, enumerates forty-two generations.
                  Whereas Luke sets down Christ's genealogy after His Baptism,
                  and beginning from Christ traces the series of generations
                  back to God, counting in all seventy-seven generations, the
                  first and last included. It seems therefore that their
                  accounts of Christ's genealogy do not agree.<br />

                                      Jerome says on Mt. 1, Isaias speaks of the
                                      generation of Christ's Godhead. Whereas
                                      Matthew relates the generation of Christ
                                      in His humanity; not indeed by explaining
                                      the manner of the Incarnation, which is
                                      also unspeakable; but by enumerating
                                      Christ's forefathers from whom He was
                                      descended according to the flesh.<br />

                                          Various answers have been made by

                                          which was raised by Julian the
                                          Apostate; for some, as Gregory of
                                          Nazianzum, say that the people
                                          mentioned by the two evangelists are
                                          the same, but under different names,
                                          as though they each had two. But this
                                          will not stand: because Matthew
                                          mentions one of David's sons---namely,
                                          Solomon; whereas Luke mentions
                                          another---namely, Nathan, who
                                          according to the history of the kings

          noble than the female. But it was most suitable that Christ should
          assume that which is perfect in human nature. Therefore it seems that
          He should not have taken flesh from a woman but rather from man: just

              the narrow limits of the womb. Therefore it seems that He should

                          humana natura nobilitata est. Unde Augustinus dicit,
                          in libro octogintatrium quaest., hominis liberatio in
                          utroque sexu debuit apparere. Ergo, quia virum

                          conveniens erat ut feminei sexus liberatio hinc

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Although the Son of God
                          could have taken flesh from whatever matter He willed,
                          it was nevertheless most becoming that He should take
                          flesh from a woman. First because in this way the
                          entire human nature was ennobled. Hence Augustine says
                          (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 11): "It was suitable that
                          man's liberation should be made manifest in both
                          sexes. Consequently, since it behooved a man, being of
                          the nobler sex, to assume, it was becoming that the
                          liberation of the female sex should be manifested in
                          that man being born of a woman."<br />

                              Secundo, quia per hoc veritas incarnationis
                              adstruitur. Unde Ambrosius dicit, in libro de
                              incarnatione, multa secundum naturam invenies, et
                              ultra naturam. Secundum conditionem etenim naturae
                              in utero, feminei scilicet corporis, fuit; sed
                              supra conditionem virgo concepit, virgo generavit,
                              ut crederes quia Deus erat qui innovabat naturam;
                              et homo erat, qui secundum naturam nascebatur ex
                              homine. Et Augustinus dicit, in epistola ad
                              Volusianum, si omnipotens Deus hominem, ubicumque
                              formatum, non ex materno utero crearet, sed
                              repentinum inferret aspectibus, nonne opinionem
                              confirmaret erroris; nec hominem verum suscepisse
                              ullo modo crederetur; et, dum omnia mirabiliter
                              facit, auferret quod misericorditer fecit? Nunc
                              vero ita inter Deum et hominem mediator apparuit
                              ut, in unitate personae copulans utramque naturam,

                              Incarnation is made evident. Wherefore Ambrose
                              says (De Incarn. vi): "Thou shalt find in Christ
                              many things both natural, and supernatural. In
                              accordance with nature He was within the womb,"
                              viz. of a woman's body: "but it was above nature
                              that a virgin should conceive and give birth: that
                              thou mightest believe that He was God, who was
                              renewing nature; and that He was man who,
                              according to nature, was being born of a man." And
                              Augustine says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii): "If
                              Almighty God had created a man formed otherwise
                              than in a mother's womb, and had suddenly produced
                              him to sight... would He not have strengthened an
                              erroneous opinion, and made it impossible for us
                              to believe that He had become a true man? And
                              whilst He is doing all things wondrously, would He
                              have taken away that which He accomplished in
                              mercy? But now, He, the mediator between God and
                              man, has so shown Himself, that, uniting both
                              natures in the unity of one Person, He has given a
                              dignity to ordinary by extraordinary things, and
                              tempered the extraordinary by the ordinary."<br />

                                          Augustine thus (Contra Faust. xxiii)
                                          replies to Faustus, who urged this
                                          objection; "By no means," says he,
                                          "does the Catholic Faith, which
                                          believes that Christ the Son of God
                                          was born of a virgin, according to the
                                          flesh, suppose that the same Son of
                                          God was so shut up in His Mother's
                                          womb, as to cease to be elsewhere, as
                                          though He no longer continued to
                                          govern heaven and earth, and as though
                                          He had withdrawn Himself from the
                                          Father. But you, Manicheans, being of
                                          a mind that admits of nought but
                                          material images, are utterly unable to

                                          says (Ep. ad Volus. cxxxvii), "it

                                              this was not the case with Christ,

                                              "God saith, the Creator of man:
                                              What is it that troubles thee in
                                              My Birth? I was not conceived by
                                              lustful desire. I made Myself a

                                              much more can the Splendor of

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the flesh of Christ was
          not conceived of the Virgin's purest blood: For it is said in the
          collect (Feast of the Annunciation) that God "willed that His Word
          should take flesh from a Virgin." But flesh differs from blood.
          Therefore Christ's body was not taken from the Virgin's blood.<br />

              esse formata de sanguine viri, sed magis de carne et ossibus eius,
              secundum illud quod dicitur Gen. II, hoc nunc os ex ossibus meis,
              et caro de carne mea. Ergo videtur quod nec etiam corpus Christi

              man's blood, but rather from his flesh and bones, according to Gn.
              2:23: "This now is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh." It
              seems therefore that neither should Christ's body have been formed

                            >Article [4]</a
                          >), in Christ's conception His being born of a woman
                          was in accordance with the laws of nature, but that He
                          was born of a virgin was above the laws of nature.
                          Now, such is the law of nature that in the generation
                          of an animal the female supplies the matter, while the
                          male is the active principle of generation; as the
                          Philosopher proves (De Gener. Animal. i). But a woman
                          who conceives of a man is not a virgin. And
                          consequently it belongs to the supernatural mode of
                          Christ's generation, that the active principle of
                          generation was the supernatural power of God: but it
                          belongs to the natural mode of His generation, that
                          the matter from which His body was conceived is
                          similar to the matter which other women supply for the
                          conception of their offspring. Now, this matter,
                          according to the Philosopher (De Gener. Animal.), is
                          the woman's blood, not any of her blood, but brought
                          to a more perfect stage of secretion by the mother's
                          generative power, so as to be apt for conception. And
                          therefore of such matter was Christ's body
                          conceived.<br />

                              fitting that He should bring corruption or
                              diminution to the integrity of His Mother.
                              Therefore it was becoming that Christ's body
                              should be formed not from the flesh or bones of
                              the Virgin, but from her blood, which as yet is
                              not actually a part, but is potentially the whole,
                              as stated in De Gener. Animal. i. Hence He is said
                              to have taken flesh from the Virgin, not that the
                              matter from which His body was formed was actual
                              flesh, but blood, which is flesh potentially.<br />

                                  in the FP, Question [92], Article [3], ad 2,
                                  Adam, through being established as a kind of
                                  principle of human nature, had in his body a
                                  certain proportion of flesh and bone, which
                                  belonged to him, not as an integral part of
                                  his personality, but in regard to his state as
                                  a principle of human nature. And from this was
                                  the woman formed, without detriment to the
                                  man. But in the Virgin's body there was
                                  nothing of this sort, from which Christ's body
                                  could be formed without detriment to His
                                  Mother's body.<br />

                                      imperfectum in genere seminis, quod non

                                      repudiat, non formatur conceptus, sed hoc
                                      est purgamentum quoddam illius puri
                                      sanguinis qui digestione quadam est
                                      praeparatus ad conceptum, quasi purior et

                                      Woman's semen is not apt for generation,
                                      but is something imperfect in the seminal
                                      order, which, on account of the
                                      imperfection of the female power, it has
                                      not been possible to bring to complete
                                      seminal perfection. Consequently this
                                      semen is not the necessary matter of
                                      conception; as the Philosopher says (De
                                      Gener. Animal. i): wherefore there was
                                      none such in Christ's conception: all the
                                      more since, though it is imperfect in the
                                      seminal order, a certain concupiscence
                                      accompanies its emission, as also that of
                                      the male semen: whereas in that virginal
                                      conception there could be no
                                      concupiscence. Wherefore Damascene says
                                      (De Fide Orth. iii) that Christ's body was
                                      not conceived "seminally." But the
                                      menstrual blood, the flow of which is
                                      subject to monthly periods, has a certain
                                      natural impurity of corruption: like other
                                      superfluities, which nature does not heed,
                                      and therefore expels. Of such menstrual
                                      blood infected with corruption and
                                      repudiated by nature, the conception is
                                      not formed; but from a certain secretion
                                      of the pure blood which by a process of
                                      elimination is prepared for conception,
                                      being, as it were, more pure and more
                                      perfect than the rest of the blood.
                                      Nevertheless, it is tainted with the
                                      impurity of lust in the conception of
                                      other men: inasmuch as by sexual
                                      intercourse this blood is drawn to a place
                                      apt for conception. This, however, did not
                                      take place in Christ's conception: because
                                      this blood was brought together in the
                                      Virgin's womb and fashioned into a child
                                      by the operation of the Holy Ghost.
                                      Therefore is Christ's body said to be
                                      "formed of the most chaste and purest
                                      blood of the Virgin."<br />

          (Gen. ad lit. x) that the flesh of Christ was in Adam and Abraham "by
          way of a bodily substance." But bodily substance is something signate.

                      Therefore neither was Christ in Adam and Abraham according
                      to something signate; and, for the same reason, neither
                      was He in the other patriarchs.<br />

                          flesh and bones of the Blessed Virgin, nor anything
                          that was actually a part of her body, but her blood
                          which was her flesh potentially. Now, whatever was in
                          the Blessed Virgin, as received from her parents, was
                          actually a part of her body. Consequently that which
                          the Blessed Virgin received from her parents was not
                          the matter of Christ's body. Therefore we must say
                          that Christ's body was not in Adam and the other
                          patriarchs according to something signate, in the

                          flesh of other men. For Christ's body is related to
                          Adam and the other patriarchs through the medium of
                          His Mother's body. Consequently Christ's body was in

                  Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, X super Gen. ad Litt., quod

                  Sed id quod est infectum, non potest esse vulneris medicina,
                  sed magis ipsum indiget medicina. Ergo semper in natura humana

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Gen. ad
                  lit. x) that "human nature ever had, together with the wound,
                  the balm with which to heal it." But that which is infected
                  cannot heal a wound; rather does it need to be healed itself.
                  Therefore in human nature there was ever something preserved
                  from infection, from which afterwards Christ's body was
                  formed.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> When we say that Christ
                          or His flesh was in Adam and the other patriarchs, we
                          compare Him, or His flesh, to Adam and the other
                          patriarchs. Now, it is manifest that the condition of
                          the patriarchs differed from that of Christ: for the
                          patriarchs were subject to sin, whereas Christ was
                          absolutely free from sin. Consequently a twofold error
                          may occur on this point. First, by attributing to
                          Christ, or to His flesh, that condition which was in
                          the patriarchs; by saying, for instance, that Christ
                          sinned in Adam, since after some fashion He was in
                          him. But this is false; because Christ was not in Adam
                          in such a way that Adam's sin belonged to Christ:
                          forasmuch as He is not descended from him according to
                          the law of concupiscence, or according to seminal
                          virtue; as stated above (<a

                              carnis eius, ut scilicet, quia caro Christi,
                              secundum quod in Christo fuit, non fuit peccato
                              obnoxia, ita etiam in Adam et in aliis patribus
                              fuit aliqua pars corporis eius quae non fuit
                              peccato obnoxia, ex qua postmodum corpus Christi
                              formaretur; sicut quidam posuerunt. Quod quidem
                              esse non potest. Primo, quia caro Christi non fuit
                              secundum aliquid signatum in Adam et in aliis
                              patribus, quod posset distingui a reliqua eius

                              inficiatur ex hoc quod est per concupiscentiam
                              concepta, sicut tota caro alicuius hominis per
                              concupiscentiam concipitur, ita etiam tota peccato
                              inquinatur. Et ideo dicendum est quod tota caro
                              antiquorum patrum fuit peccato obnoxia, nec fuit
                              in eis aliquid a peccato immune, de quo postmodum
                              corpus Christi formaretur.

                              Secondly, error may occur by attributing the
                              condition of Christ or of His flesh to that which
                              was actually in the patriarchs: by saying, for
                              instance, that, because Christ's flesh, as
                              existing in Christ, was not subject to sin,
                              therefore in Adam also and in the patriarchs there
                              was some part of his body that was not subject to
                              sin, and from which afterwards Christ's body was
                              formed; as some indeed held. For this is quite
                              impossible. First, because Christ's flesh was not
                              in Adam and in the other patriarchs, according to
                              something signate, distinguishable from the rest
                              of his flesh, as pure from impure; as already
                              stated (<a href="TP031.html#TPQ31A6THEP1"
                                >Article [6]</a
                              >). Secondly, because since human flesh is
                              infected by sin, through being conceived in lust,
                              just as the entire flesh of a man is conceived
                              through lust, so also is it entirely defiled by
                              sin. Consequently we must say that the entire
                              flesh of the patriarchs was subjected to sin, nor
                              was there anything in them that was free from sin,
                              and from which afterwards Christ's body could be
                              formed.<br />

          Ad octavum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus fuerit in lumbis
          Abrahae decimatus. Dicit enim apostolus, ad Heb. VII, quod levi,
          pronepos Abrahae, decimatus fuit in Abraham, quia, eo decimas dante
          Melchisedech, adhuc levi erat in lumbis eius. Similiter Christus erat
          in lumbis Abrahae quando decimas dedit. Ergo ipse etiam Christus
          decimatus fuit in Abraham.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ "paid tithes" in
          Abraham's loins. For the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7%3A6-9"
            >Heb. 7:6-9</a
          >) that Levi, the great-grandson of Abraham, "paid tithes in Abraham,"
          because, when the latter paid tithes to Melchisedech, "he was yet in
          his loins." In like manner Christ was in Abraham's loins when the
          latter paid tithes. Therefore Christ Himself also paid tithes in
          Abraham.<br />

              Praeterea, Christus est ex semine Abrahae secundum carnem quam de

              Abraham according to the flesh which He received from His Mother.
              But His Mother paid tithes in Abraham. Therefore for a like reason
              did Christ.<br />

                  Curatione autem indigebat omnis caro peccato obnoxia. Cum ergo

                  levied on that which needed healing," as Augustine says (Gen.
                  ad lit. x). But all flesh subject to sin needed healing. Since
                  therefore Christ's flesh was the subject of sin, as stated
                  above (<a href="TP031.html#TPQ31A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), it
                  seems that Christ's flesh paid tithes in Abraham.<br />

                      Christi. Nihil enim prohibet, patre alicuius pontificis

                      maiorem esse simplici sacerdote. Licet ergo dicatur

                      be at all derogatory to Christ's dignity. For the fact
                      that the father of a bishop pays tithes to a priest does
                      not hinder his son, the bishop, from being of higher rank
                      than an ordinary priest. Consequently, although we may say
                      that Christ paid tithes when Abraham paid them to
                      Melchisedech, it does not follow that Christ was not
                      greater than Melchisedech.<br />

                              <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It behooves us to say
                              that the sense of the passage quoted from the
                              Apostle is that Christ did not pay tithes in
                              Abraham. For the Apostle proves that the
                              priesthood according to the order of Melchisedech
                              is greater than the Levitical priesthood, from the
                              fact that Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedech,
                              while Levi, from whom the legal priesthood was
                              derived, was yet in his loins. Now, if Christ had
                              also paid tithes in Abraham, His priesthood would
                              not have been according to the order of
                              Melchisedech, but of a lower order. Consequently
                              we must say that Christ did not pay tithes in
                              Abraham's loins, as Levi did.<br />

                                  autem a peccato est solius Christi, ipse enim
                                  est agnus qui tollit peccatum mundi, ut
                                  dicitur Ioan. I. Figuram autem eius gerebat
                                  Melchisedech, ut apostolus probat, Heb. VII.
                                  Per hoc ergo quod Abraham Melchisedech decimas
                                  dedit, praefiguravit se, velut in peccato
                                  conceptum, et omnes qui ab eo descensuri erant
                                  ea ratione ut peccatum originale contraherent,
                                  indigere curatione quae est per Christum.
                                  Isaac autem et Iacob et levi, et omnes alii,
                                  sic fuerunt in Abraham ut ex eo derivarentur
                                  non solum secundum corpulentam substantiam,
                                  sed etiam secundum rationem seminalem, per
                                  quam originale contrahitur. Et ideo omnes in

                                  Solus autem Christus sic fuit in Abraham ut ab
                                  eo derivaretur non secundum rationem
                                  seminalem, sed secundum corpulentam
                                  substantiam. Et ideo non fuit in Abraham sicut
                                  curatione indigens, sed magis sicut vulneris
                                  medicina. Et ideo non fuit in lumbis Abrahae

                                  For since he who pays a tithe keeps nine parts
                                  to himself, and surrenders the tenth to
                                  another, inasmuch as the number ten is the
                                  sign of perfection, as being, in a sort, the
                                  terminus of all numbers which mount from one
                                  to ten, it follows that he who pays a tithe
                                  bears witness to his own imperfection and to
                                  the perfection of another. Now, to sin is due
                                  the imperfection of the human race, which
                                  needs to be perfected by Him who cleanses from
                                  sin. But to heal from sin belongs to Christ
                                  alone, for He is the "Lamb that taketh away
                                  the sin of the world" (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A29"
                                    >Jn. 1:29</a
                                  >), whose figure was Melchisedech, as the
                                  Apostle proves (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++7"
                                    >Heb. 7</a
                                  >). Therefore by giving tithes to
                                  Melchisedech, Abraham foreshadowed that he, as
                                  being conceived in sin, and all who were to be
                                  his descendants in contracting original sin,
                                  needed that healing which is through Christ.
                                  And Isaac, Jacob, and Levi, and all the others
                                  were in Abraham in such a way so as to be
                                  descended from him, not only as to bodily
                                  substance, but also as to seminal virtue, by
                                  which original sin is transmitted.
                                  Consequently, they all paid tithes in Abraham,
                                  i.e. foreshadowed as needing to be healed by
                                  Christ. And Christ alone was in Abraham in
                                  such a manner as to descend from him, not by
                                  seminal virtue, but according to bodily
                                  substance. Therefore He was not in Abraham so
                                  as to need to be healed, but rather "as the
                                  balm with which the wound was to be healed."
                                  Therefore He did not pay tithes in Abraham's
                                  loins.<br />

                                          Because the Blessed Virgin was
                                          conceived in original sin, she was in
                                          Abraham as needing to be healed.
                                          Therefore she paid tithes in him, as
                                          descending from him according to
                                          seminal virtue. But this is not true

                                                  The levitical priesthood was
                                                  handed down through carnal
                                                  origin: wherefore it was not
                                                  less in Abraham than in Levi.
                                                  Consequently, since Abraham
                                                  paid tithes to Melchisedech as
                                                  to one greater than he, it
                                                  follows that the priesthood of
                                                  Melchisedech, inasmuch as he
                                                  was a figure of Christ, was
                                                  greater than that of Levi. But
                                                  the priesthood of Christ does
                                                  not result from carnal origin,
                                                  but from spiritual grace.
                                                  Therefore it is possible that
                                                  a father pay tithes to a
                                                  priest, as the less to the
                                                  greater, and yet his son, if
                                                  he be a bishop, is greater
                                                  than that priest, not through
                                                  carnal origin, but through the
                                                  spiritual grace which he has
                                                  received from Christ.<br />
