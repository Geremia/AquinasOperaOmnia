          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod non fuerit conveniens Christum
          mori. Illud enim quod est primum principium in aliquo genere, non
          disponitur per id quod est contrarium illi generi, sicut ignis, qui
          est principium caloris, nunquam potest esse frigidus. Sed filius Dei
          est principium et fons omnis vitae, secundum illud Psalmi, apud te est
          fons vitae. Ergo videtur quod non fuerit conveniens Christum mori.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that
          Christ should die. For a first principle in any order is not affected
          by anything contrary to such order: thus fire, which is the principle
          of heat, can never become cold. But the Son of God is the
          fountain-head and principle of all life, according to Ps. 35:10: "With
          Thee is the fountain of life." Therefore it does not seem fitting for
          Christ to die.<br />

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, maior est defectus mortis quam morbi, quia per morbum
              pervenitur ad mortem. Sed non fuit conveniens Christum aliquo
              morbo languescere, ut Chrysostomus dicit. Ergo etiam non fuit
              conveniens Christum mori.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, death is a greater defect than
              sickness, because it is through sickness that one comes to die.
              But it was not beseeming for Christ to languish from sickness, as
              Chrysostom [*Athanasius, Orat. de Incarn. Verbi] says.
              Consequently, neither was it becoming for Christ to die.<br />

                  oppositum. Ergo videtur quod non fuit conveniens Christum

                          Respondeo dicendum quod conveniens fuit Christum mori.
                          Primo quidem, ad satisfaciendum pro humano genere,
                          quod erat morti adiudicatum propter peccatum, secundum
                          illud Gen. II, quacumque die comederitis, morte
                          moriemini. Est autem conveniens satisfaciendi pro alio
                          modus cum aliquis se subiicit poenae quam alius
                          meruit. Et ideo Christus mori voluit, ut, moriendo,
                          pro nobis satisfaceret, secundum illud I Pet. III,
                          Christus semel pro peccatis nostris mortuus est.
                          Secundo, ad ostendendum veritatem naturae assumptae.
                          Sicut enim Eusebius dicit, si aliter, post
                          conversationem cum hominibus, evanescens subito
                          evolaret fugiens mortem, ab omnibus compararetur
                          phantasmati. Tertio ut, moriendo, nos a timore mortis
                          liberaret. Unde dicitur Heb. II, quod communicavit
                          carni et sanguini, ut per mortem destrueret eum qui
                          habebat mortis imperium, et liberaret eos qui timore
                          mortis per totam vitam obnoxii erant servituti. Quarto
                          ut, corporaliter moriendo similitudini peccati, idest
                          poenalitati, daret nobis exemplum moriendi
                          spiritualiter peccato. Unde dicitur Rom. VI, quod enim
                          mortuus est peccato, mortuus est semel, quod autem
                          vivit, vivit Deo. Ita et vos existimate mortuos esse
                          peccato, viventes autem Deo. Quinto ut, a mortuis
                          resurgendo, virtutem suam ostenderet, qua mortem
                          superavit, et nobis spem resurgendi a mortuis daret.
                          Unde apostolus dicit, I Cor. XV, si Christus
                          praedicatur quod resurrexit a mortuis, quomodo quidam
                          in vobis dicunt quod resurrectio mortuorum non erit?
                        </td>
                        <td style="text-align: justify">
                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for Christ
                          to die. First of all to satisfy for the whole human
                          race, which was sentenced to die on account of sin,
                          according to Gn. 2:17: "In what day soever ye shall
                          [Vulg.: 'thou shalt'] eat of it ye shall [Vulg.: 'thou
                          shalt'] die the death." Now it is a fitting way of
                          satisfying for another to submit oneself to the
                          penalty deserved by that other. And so Christ resolved
                          to die, that by dying He might atone for us, according
                          to 1 Pt. 3:18: "Christ also died once for our sins."
                          Secondly, in order to show the reality of the flesh
                          assumed. For, as Eusebius says (Orat. de Laud.
                          Constant. xv), "if, after dwelling among men Christ
                          were suddenly to disappear from men's sight, as though
                          shunning death, then by all men He would be likened to
                          a phantom." Thirdly, that by dying He might deliver us
                          from fearing death: hence it is written (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++2%3A14,15"
                            >Heb. 2:14,15</a
                          >) that He communicated "to flesh and blood, that
                          through death He might destroy him who had the empire
                          of death and might deliver them who, through the fear
                          of death, were all their lifetime subject to
                          servitude." Fourthly, that by dying in the body to the
                          likeness of sin---that is, to its penalty---He might
                          set us the example of dying to sin spiritually. Hence
                          it is written (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A10"
                            >Rm. 6:10</a
                          >): "For in that He died to sin, He died once, but in
                          that He liveth, He liveth unto God: so do you also
                          reckon that you are dead to sin, but alive unto God."
                          Fifthly, that by rising from the dead, and manifesting
                          His power whereby He overthrew death, He might instill
                          into us the hope of rising from the dead. Hence the
                          Apostle says (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A12"
                            >1 Cor. 15:12</a
                          >): "If Christ be preached that He rose again from the
                          dead, how do some among you say, that there is no
                          resurrection from the dead?"<br />
                          <tr valign="top">
                            <td style="text-align: justify">
                              Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus est fons
                              vitae secundum quod Deus, non autem secundum quod
                              homo. Mortuus autem est non secundum quod Deus,
                              sed secundum quod homo. Unde Augustinus dicit,
                              contra Felicianum, absit ut Christus sic senserit
                              mortem ut, quantum est in se vita, vitam
                              perdiderit. Si enim hoc ita esset, vitae fons

                              [*Vigilius Tapsensis] says against Felician: "Far
                              be it from us to suppose that Christ so felt death
                              that He lost His life inasmuch as He is life in
                              Himself; for, were it so, the fountain of life
                              would have run dry. Accordingly, He experienced
                              death by sharing in our human feeling, which of
                              His own accord He had taken upon Himself, but He
                              did not lose the power of His Nature, through
                              which He gives life to all things."<br />

    Whether the Godhead was separated from the flesh when Christ died?<br />

          separata divinitas a carne. Ut enim dicitur Matth. XXVII, dominus, in
          cruce pendens, clamavit, Deus, Deus meus, ut quid me dereliquisti?
          Quod exponens Ambrosius, dicit, clamat homo separatione divinitatis
          moriturus. Nam, cum divinitas morte libera sit, utique mors ibi esse
          non poterat nisi vita discederet, quia vita divinitas est. Et sic

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Godhead was
          separated from the flesh when Christ died. For as Matthew relates
          (27:46), when our Lord was hanging upon the cross He cried out: "My
          God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?" which words Ambrose,
          commenting on Lk. 23:46, explains as follows: "The man cried out when
          about to expire by being severed from the Godhead; for since the
          Godhead is immune from death, assuredly death could not be there,
          except life departed, for the Godhead is life." And so it seems that
          when Christ died, the Godhead was separated from His flesh.<br />

              since the soul was severed from the flesh by death, it seems that,
              in consequence, His Godhead was also separated from it.<br />

                      the attributes of human nature are predicated of the Son
                      of God only by reason of the union. But what belongs to
                      the body of Christ after death is predicated of the Son of
                      God---namely, being buried: as is evident from the Creed,
                      in which it is said that the Son of God "was conceived and
                      born of a Virgin, suffered, died, and was buried."
                      Therefore Christ's Godhead was not separated from the
                      flesh when He died.<br />

                          dicitur Rom. XI, quod sine poenitentia sunt dona Dei
                          et vocatio. Multo autem maior est gratia unionis, per
                          quam divinitas unita est carni Christi in persona,
                          quam gratia adoptionis, qua alii sanctificantur, et

                          ita et remansit unita post mortem, ut scilicet non

                          mortem, ut Damascenus dicit, in III libro.

                          God's grace is never withdrawn except through fault.
                          Hence it is written (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++11%3A29"
                            >Rm. 11:29</a
                          >): "The gifts and the calling of God are without
                          repentance." But the grace of union whereby the
                          Godhead was united to the flesh in Christ's Person, is
                          greater than the grace of adoption whereby others are
                          sanctified: also it is more enduring of itself,
                          because this grace is ordained for personal union,
                          whereas the grace of adoption is referred to a certain
                          affective union. And yet we see that the grace of
                          adoption is never lost without fault. Since, then
                          there was no sin in Christ, it was impossible for the
                          union of the Godhead with the flesh to be dissolved.
                          Consequently, as before death Christ's flesh was
                          united personally and hypostatically with the Word of
                          God, it remained so after His death, so that the
                          hypostasis of the Word of God was not different from
                          that of Christ's flesh after death, as Damascene says
                          (De Fide Orth. iii).<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was a severance in

            >Jn. 10:18</a
          >): "No man taketh away My soul from Me: but I lay it down of Myself,
          and I have power to lay it down, and I have power to take it up
          again." But it does not appear that the body can set the soul aside,
          by separating the soul from itself, because the soul is not subject to
          the power of the body, but rather conversely: and so it appears that
          it belongs to Christ, as the Word of God, to lay down His soul: but
          this is to separate it from Himself. Consequently, by death His soul
          was severed from the Godhead.<br />

              whom the Son of God took to Himself, after being assumed once more
              or delivered by Him, rose again from the dead on the third day."
              But the entire man could not be assumed again, unless the entire
              man was at one time separated from the Word of God: and the entire
              man is made of soul and body. Therefore there was a separation

                                  autem animam separatam non dico. Si vero
                                  dixerimus quod anima ipsa se ponat, sequitur
                                  quod ipsa a se separatur. Quod est
                                  absurdissimum. Relinquitur ergo quod ipsa caro
                                  animam suam ponit et iterum eam sumit, non
                                  potestate sua, sed potestate verbi
                                  inhabitantis carnem, quia, sicut supra dictum
                                  est, per mortem non est separata divinitas
                                  verbi a carne.

                                  (Tract. xlvii in Joan.), in commenting on the
                                  text of John, asks, since Christ is Word and
                                  soul and body, "whether He putteth down His
                                  soul, for that He is the Word? Or, for that He
                                  is a soul?" Or, again, "for that He is flesh?"
                                  And he says that, "should we say that the Word
                                  of God laid down His soul"... it would follow
                                  that "there was a time when that soul was
                                  severed from the Word"---which is untrue. "For
                                  death severed the body and soul... but that
                                  the soul was severed from the Word I do not
                                  affirm... But should we say that the soul laid
                                  itself down," it follows "that it is severed
                                  from itself: which is most absurd." It
                                  remains, therefore, that "the flesh itself
                                  layeth down its soul and taketh it again, not
                                  by its own power, but by the power of the Word
                                  dwelling in the flesh": because, as stated
                                  above (<a href="TP050.html#TPQ50A2THEP1"

                                  from the flesh in death.<br />

                                              was separated from the flesh: not
                                              one hypostasis divided into two:
                                              because both soul and body in the
                                              same respect had their existence
                                              from the beginning in the
                                              hypostasis of the Word; and in

                                              hypostasis of the Word was the
                                              hypostasis of the Word, of the
                                              soul, and of the body. For neither

                                              hypostasis of the Word: for there
                                              was always one hypostasis of the

          susceptio, quae Deum hominem faceret et hominem Deum. Sed illa

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was a man during
          the three days of His death, because Augustine says (De Trin. iii):
          "Such was the assuming [of nature] as to make God to be man, and man
          to be God." But this assuming [of nature] did not cease at Christ's
          death. Therefore it seems that He did not cease to be a man in
          consequence of death.<br />

              Praeterea, philosophus dicit, in IX Ethic., quod unusquisque homo

              alloquentes, dicimus, sancte Petre, ora pro nobis. Sed post mortem
              filius Dei non fuit separatus ab anima intellectuali. Ergo in illo

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Philosopher says (Ethic.
              ix) that "each man is his intellect"; consequently, when we
              address the soul of Peter after his death we say: "Saint Peter,
              pray for us." But the Son of God after death was not separated
              from His intellectual soul. Therefore, during those three days the

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is an article of faith
                          that Christ was truly dead: hence it is an error
                          against faith to assert anything whereby the truth of
                          Christ's death is destroyed. Accordingly it is said in
                          the Synodal epistle of Cyril [*Act. Conc. Ephes. P. I,
                          cap. xxvi]: "If any man does not acknowledge that the
                          Word of God suffered in the flesh, and was crucified
                          in the flesh and tasted death in the flesh, let him be
                          anathema." Now it belongs to the truth of the death of
                          man or animal that by death the subject ceases to be
                          man or animal; because the death of the man or animal
                          results from the separation of the soul, which is the
                          formal complement of the man or animal. Consequently,
                          to say that Christ was a man during the three days of
                          His death simply and without qualification, is
                          erroneous. Yet it can be said that He was "a dead man"
                          during those three days.<br />

                              However, some writers have contended that Christ
                              was a man during those three days, uttering words
                              which are indeed erroneous, yet without intent of
                              error in faith: as Hugh of Saint Victor, who (De
                              Sacram. ii) contended that Christ, during the
                              three days that followed His death, was a man,
                              because he held that the soul is a man: but this
                              is false, as was shown in the FP, Question [75],
                              Article [4]. Likewise the Master of the Sentences
                              (iii, D, 22) held Christ to be a man during the
                              three days of His death for quite another reason.
                              For he believed the union of soul and flesh not to
                              be essential to a man, and that for anything to be
                              a man it suffices if it have a soul and body,
                              whether united or separated: and that this is
                              likewise false is clear both from what has been
                              said in the FP, Question [75], Article [4], and
                              from what has been said above regarding the mode

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The expression "simply"
                          can be taken in two senses. In the first instance by
                          taking "simply" to be the same as "absolutely"; thus
                          "that is said simply which is said without addition,"
                          as the Philosopher put it (Topic. ii): and in this way
                          the dead and living body of Christ was simply
                          identically the same: since a thing is said to be
                          "simply" identically the same from the identity of the
                          subject. But Christ's body living and dead was
                          identical in its suppositum because alive and dead it
                          had none other besides the Word of God, as was stated

                              In another way "simply" is the same as
                              "altogether" or "totally": in which sense the body
                              of Christ, dead and alive, was not "simply" the
                              same identically, because it was not "totally" the
                              same, since life is of the essence of a living
                              body; for it is an essential and not an accidental
                              predicate: hence it follows that a body which
                              ceases to be living does not remain totally the
                              same. Moreover, if it were to be said that
                              Christ's dead body did continue "totally" the
                              same, it would follow that it was not
                              corrupted---I mean, by the corruption of death:
                              which is the heresy of the Gaianites, as Isidore
                              says (Etym. viii), and is to be found in the
                              Decretals (xxiv, qu. iii). And Damascene says (De
                              Fide Orth. iii) that "the term 'corruption'
                              denotes two things: in one way it is the
                              separation of the soul from the body and other
                              things of the sort; in another way, the complete
                              dissolving into elements. Consequently it is
                              impious to say with Julian and Gaian that the
                              Lord's body was incorruptible after the first
                              manner of corruption before the resurrection:
                              because Christ's body would not be consubstantial
                              with us, nor truly dead, nor would we have been
                              saved in very truth. But in the second way
                              Christ's body was incorrupt."<br />

          privatio vitae. Sed privatio, cum non sit res aliqua, non habet
          aliquam virtutem agendi. Ergo non potuit aliquid operari ad nostram

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's death did not
          conduce in any way to our salvation. For death is a sort of privation,
          since it is the privation of life. But privation has not any power of
          activity, because it is nothing positive. Therefore it could not work
          anything for our salvation.<br />

              separatur anima a corpore, quae est merendi principium. Ergo mors

              which is the principle of meriting. Consequently, Christ's death

                      body, "saved us from our two deaths," that is, of the soul

                          Respondeo dicendum quod de morte Christi dupliciter
                          loqui possumus, uno modo, secundum quod est in fieri;
                          alio modo, secundum quod est in facto esse. Dicitur
                          autem mors esse in fieri, quando aliquis per aliquam
                          passionem, vel naturalem vel violentam, tendit in
                          mortem. Et hoc modo, idem est loqui de morte Christi
                          et de passione ipsius. Et ita, secundum hunc modum,
                          mors Christi est causa salutis nostrae, secundum illud
                          quod de passione supra dictum est. Sed in facto esse
                          mors consideratur secundum quod iam facta est
                          separatio corporis et animae. Et sic nunc loquimur de
                          morte Christi. Hoc autem modo mors Christi non potest
                          esse causa salutis nostrae per modum meriti, sed solum
                          per modum efficientiae, inquantum scilicet nec per
                          mortem divinitas separata est a carne Christi, et ideo
                          quidquid contigit circa carnem Christi, etiam anima
                          separata, fuit nobis salutiferum virtute divinitatis
                          unitae. Consideratur autem proprie alicuius causae
                          effectus secundum similitudinem causae. Unde, quia
                          mors est quaedam privatio vitae propriae, effectus
                          mortis Christi attenditur circa remotionem eorum quae
                          contrariantur nostrae saluti, quae quidem sunt mors
                          animae et mors corporis. Et ideo per mortem Christi
                          dicitur esse destructa in nobis et mors animae, quae
                          est per peccatum, secundum illud Rom. IV, traditus
                          est, scilicet in mortem, propter delicta nostra; et
                          mors corporis, quae consistit in separatione animae,
                          secundum illud I Cor. XV, absorpta est mors in
                          victoria.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of Christ's
                          death in two ways, "in becoming" and "in fact." Death
                          is said to be "in becoming" when anyone from natural
                          or enforced suffering is tending towards death: and in
                          this way it is the same thing to speak of Christ's
                          death as of His Passion: so that in this sense
                          Christ's death is the cause of our salvation,
                          according to what has been already said of the Passion
                          (<a href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1">Question [48]</a>).
                          But death is considered in fact, inasmuch as the
                          separation of soul and body has already taken place:
                          and it is in this sense that we are now speaking of
                          Christ's death. In this way Christ's death cannot be
                          the cause of our salvation by way of merit, but only
                          by way of causality, that is to say, inasmuch as the
                          Godhead was not separated from Christ's flesh by
                          death; and therefore, whatever befell Christ's flesh,
                          even when the soul was departed, was conducive to
                          salvation in virtue of the Godhead united. But the
                          effect of any cause is properly estimated according to
                          its resemblance to the cause. Consequently, since
                          death is a kind of privation of one's own life, the
                          effect of Christ's death is considered in relation to
                          the removal of the obstacles to our salvation: and
                          these are the death of the soul and of the body. Hence
                          Christ's death is said to have destroyed in us both
                          the death of the soul, caused by sin, according to Rm.
                          4:25: "He was delivered up [namely unto death] for our
                          sins": and the death of the body, consisting in the
                          separation of the soul, according to 1 Cor. 15:54:
                          "Death is swallowed up in victory."<br />
