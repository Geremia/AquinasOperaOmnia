    Whether Christ was slain by another or by Himself?<br />

  <table cellpadding="12">

      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus non fuerit ab alio
          occisus, sed a seipso. Dicit enim ipse, Ioan. X, nemo a me tollit
          animam meam, sed ego pono eam. Ille autem dicitur aliquem occidere qui
          animam eius tollit. Non est ergo Christus ab aliis occisus, sed a
          seipso.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not slain by
          another, but by Himself. For He says Himself (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++10%3A18"
            >Jn. 10:18</a
          >): "No men taketh My life from Me, but I lay it down of Myself." But
          he is said to kill another who takes away his life. Consequently,
          Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, illi qui ab aliis occiduntur, paulatim, debilitata
              natura, deficiunt. Et maxime hoc apparet in crucifixis, ut enim
              dicit Augustinus, in IV de Trin., longa morte cruciabantur ligno
              suspensi. In Christo autem non hoc accidit, nam clamans voce magna
              emisit spiritum, ut dicitur Matth. XXVII. Non ergo Christus est ab
              aliis occisus, sed a seipso.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those slain by others sink
              gradually from exhausted nature, and this is strikingly apparent
              in the crucified: for, as Augustine says (De Trin. iv): "Those who
              were crucified were tormented with a lingering death." But this
              did not happen in Christ's case, since "crying out, with a loud
              voice, He yielded up the ghost" (<a
                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++27%3A50"
                >Mt. 27:50</a
              >). Therefore Christ was not slain by others, but by Himself.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, illi qui ab aliis occiduntur, per violentiam
                  moriuntur, et ita non voluntarie, quia violentum opponitur
                  voluntario. Sed Augustinus dicit, in IV de Trin., quod
                  spiritus Christi non deseruit carnem invitus, sed quia voluit,
                  quando voluit, et quomodo voluit. Non ergo Christus est ab
                  aliis occisus, sed a seipso.

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, those slain by others
                  suffer a violent death, and hence die unwillingly, because
                  violent is opposed to voluntary. But Augustine says (De Trin.
                  iv): "Christ's spirit did not quit the flesh unwillingly, but
                  because He willed it, when He willed it, and as He willed it."
                  Consequently Christ was not slain by others, but by
                  Himself.<br />

                          alicuius effectus dupliciter. Uno modo, directe ad
                          illud agendo. Et hoc modo persecutores Christi eum
                          occiderunt, quia sufficientem causam mortis ei
                          intulerunt, cum intentione occidendi ipsum et effectu
                          subsequente; quia scilicet ex illa causa est mors
                          subsecuta. Alio modo dicitur aliquis causa alicuius
                          indirecte, scilicet quia non impedit, cum impedire
                          possit, sicut si dicatur aliquis alium perfundere quia
                          non claudit fenestram, per quam imber ingreditur. Et
                          hoc modo ipse Christus fuit causa passionis et mortis.
                          Poterat enim suam passionem et mortem impedire. Primo
                          quidem, adversarios reprimendo, ut eum aut non
                          vellent, aut non possent interficere. Secundo, quia
                          spiritus eius habebat potestatem conservandi naturam
                          carnis suae, ne a quocumque laesivo inflicto
                          opprimeretur. Quod quidem habuit anima Christi quia
                          erat verbo Dei coniuncta in unitate personae, ut
                          Augustinus dicit, in IV de Trin. Quia ergo anima
                          Christi non repulit a proprio corpore nocumentum
                          illatum, sed voluit quod natura corporalis illi
                          nocumento succumberet, dicitur suam animam posuisse,
                          vel voluntarie mortuus esse.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A thing may cause an
                          effect in two ways: in the first instance by acting
                          directly so as to produce the effect; and in this
                          manner Christ's persecutors slew Him because they
                          inflicted on Him what was a sufficient cause of death,
                          and with the intention of slaying Him, and the effect
                          followed, since death resulted from that cause. In
                          another way someone causes an effect indirectly---that
                          is, by not preventing it when he can do so; just as
                          one person is said to drench another by not closing
                          the window through which the shower is entering: and
                          in this way Christ was the cause of His own Passion
                          and death. For He could have prevented His Passion and
                          death. Firstly, by holding His enemies in check, so
                          that they would not have been eager to slay Him, or
                          would have been powerless to do so. Secondly, because
                          His spirit had the power of preserving His fleshly
                          nature from the infliction of any injury; and Christ's
                          soul had this power, because it was united in unity of
                          person with the Divine Word, as Augustine says (De
                          Trin. iv). Therefore, since Christ's soul did not
                          repel the injury inflicted on His body, but willed His
                          corporeal nature to succumb to such injury, He is said
                          to have laid down His life, or to have died
                          voluntarily.<br />

                                  <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In order
                                  for Christ to show that the Passion inflicted
                                  by violence did not take away His life, He
                                  preserved the strength of His bodily nature,
                                  so that at the last moment He was able to cry
                                  out with a loud voice: and hence His death
                                  should be computed among His other miracles.
                                  Accordingly it is written (Mk. 15:39): "And
                                  the centurion who stood over against Him,
                                  seeing that crying out in this manner, He had
                                  given up the ghost, said: Indeed, this man was
                                  the Son of God." It was also a subject of
                                  wonder in Christ's death that He died sooner
                                  than the others who were tormented with the
                                  same suffering. Hence John says (19:32) that
                                  "they broke the legs of the first, and of the
                                  other that was crucified with Him," that they
                                  might die more speedily; "but after they were
                                  come to Jesus, when they saw that He was
                                  already dead, they did not break His legs."
                                  Mark also states (15:44) that "Pilate wondered
                                  that He should be already dead." For as of His
                                  own will His bodily nature kept its vigor to
                                  the end, so likewise, when He willed, He
                                  suddenly succumbed to the injury inflicted.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not die out
          of obedience. For obedience is referred to a command. But we do not

          out of obedience.<br />

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, charity is a more
                  excellent virtue than obedience. But we read that Christ
                  suffered out of charity, according to Eph. 5:2: "Walk in love,
                  as Christ also has loved us, and delivered Himself up for us."
                  Therefore Christ's Passion ought to be ascribed rather to

                          Christus ex obedientia pateretur. Primo quidem, quia
                          hoc conveniebat iustificationi humanae, ut, sicut per
                          unius hominis inobedientiam peccatores constituti sunt
                          multi, ita per unius hominis obedientiam iusti

                          fuit conveniens reconciliationi Dei ad homines,
                          secundum illud Rom. V, reconciliati sumus Deo per
                          mortem filii eius, inquantum scilicet ipsa mors
                          Christi fuit quoddam sacrificium acceptissimum Deo,
                          secundum illud Ephes., tradidit semetipsum pro nobis

                          Obedientia vero omnibus sacrificiis antefertur,
                          secundum illud I Reg. XV, melior est obedientia quam
                          victimae. Et ideo conveniens fuit ut sacrificium
                          passionis et mortis Christi ex obedientia procederet.
                          Tertio, hoc conveniens fuit eius victoriae, qua de
                          morte et auctore mortis triumphavit. Non enim miles
                          vincere potest nisi duci obediat. Et ita homo Christus
                          victoriam obtinuit per hoc quod Deo fuit obediens,
                          secundum illud Proverb. XXI, vir obediens loquitur
                          victorias.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was befitting that
                          Christ should suffer out of obedience. First of all,
                          because it was in keeping with human justification,
                          that "as by the disobedience of one man, many were
                          made sinners: so also by the obedience of one, many
                          shall be made just," as is written Rm. 5:19. Secondly,
                          it was suitable for reconciling man with God: hence it
                          is written (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A10"
                            >Rm. 5:10</a
                          >): "We are reconciled to God by the death of His
                          Son," in so far as Christ's death was a most
                          acceptable sacrifice to God, according to Eph. 5:2:
                          "He delivered Himself for us an oblation and a
                          sacrifice to God for an odor of sweetness." Now
                          obedience is preferred to all sacrifices. according to
                          1 Kgs. 15:22: "Obedience is better than sacrifices."
                          Therefore it was fitting that the sacrifice of
                          Christ's Passion and death should proceed from
                          obedience. Thirdly, it was in keeping with His victory
                          whereby He triumphed over death and its author;
                          because a soldier cannot conquer unless he obey his
                          captain. And so the Man-Christ secured the victory
                          through being obedient to God, according to Prov.
                          21:28: "An obedient man shall speak of victory."<br />

                              Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus mandatum
                              accepit a patre ut pateretur, dicitur enim Ioan.
                              X, potestatem habeo ponendi animam meam, et
                              potestatem habeo iterum sumendi eam, et hoc
                              mandatum accepi a patre meo, scilicet ponendi
                              animam et sumendi. Ex quo, ut Chrysostomus dicit,
                              non est intelligendum quod prius expectaverit
                              audire, et opus fuerit ei discere, sed voluntarium
                              monstravit processum, et contrarietatis ad patrem
                              suspicionem destruxit. Quia tamen in morte Christi
                              lex vetus consummata est, secundum illud quod ipse
                              moriens dixit, Ioan. XIX, consummatum est; potest
                              intelligi quod patiendo omnia veteris legis
                              praecepta implevit. Moralia quidem, quae in
                              praeceptis caritatis fundantur, implevit inquantum
                              passus est et ex dilectione patris, secundum illud
                              Ioan. XIV, ut cognoscat mundus quia diligo patrem,
                              et sicut mandatum dedit mihi pater sic facio,
                              surgite, eamus hinc, scilicet ad locum passionis,
                              et etiam ex dilectione proximi, secundum illud
                              Galat. II dilexit me, et tradidit semetipsum pro
                              me. Caeremonialia vero praecepta legis, quae ad
                              sacrificia et oblationes praecipue ordinantur,
                              implevit Christus sua passione inquantum omnia
                              antiqua sacrificia figurae fuerunt illius veri
                              sacrificii quod Christus obtulit moriendo pro
                              nobis. Unde dicitur Coloss. II, nemo vos iudicet
                              in cibo aut in potu, aut in parte diei festi aut
                              Neomeniae, quae sunt umbra futurorum, corpus autem
                              Christi, eo scilicet quod Christus comparatur ad
                              illa sicut corpus ad umbram. Praecepta vero
                              iudicialia legis, quae praecipue ordinantur ad
                              satisfaciendum iniuriam passis, implevit Christus

                              received a command from the Father to suffer. For
                              it is written (<a

                              >): "I have power to lay down My life, and I have
                              power to take it up again: (and) this commandment
                              have I received of My Father"---namely, of laying
                              down His life and of resuming it again. "From
                              which," as Chrysostom says (Hom. lix in Joan.), it
                              is not to be understood "that at first He awaited
                              the command, and that He had need to be told, but
                              He showed the proceeding to be a voluntary one,
                              and destroyed suspicion of opposition" to the
                              Father. Yet because the Old Law was ended by
                              Christ's death, according to His dying words, "It
                              is consummated" (<a
                                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++19%3A30"

                              >), it may be understood that by His suffering He
                              fulfilled all the precepts of the Old Law. He
                              fulfilled those of the moral order which are
                              founded on the precepts of charity, inasmuch as He
                              suffered both out of love of the Father, according
                              to Jn. 14:31: "That the world may know that I love
                              the Father, and as the Father hath given Me
                              commandment, so do I: arise, let us go
                              hence"---namely, to the place of His Passion: and
                              out of love of His neighbor, according to Gal.
                              2:20: "He loved me, and delivered Himself up for
                              me." Christ likewise by His Passion fulfilled the
                              ceremonial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly
                              ordained for sacrifices and oblations, in so far
                              as all the ancient sacrifices were figures of that
                              true sacrifice which the dying Christ offered for
                              us. Hence it is written (Col. 2:16,17): "Let no
                              man judge you in meat or drink, or in respect of a
                              festival day, or of the new moon, or of the
                              sabbaths, which are a shadow of things to come,
                              but the body is Christ's," for the reason that
                              Christ is compared to them as a body is to a
                              shadow. Christ also by His Passion fulfilled the
                              judicial precepts of the Law, which are chiefly
                              ordained for making compensation to them who have
                              suffered wrong, since, as is written Ps. 68:5: He
                              "paid that which" He "took not away," suffering
                              Himself to be fastened to a tree on account of the
                              apple which man had plucked from the tree against
                              God's command.<br />

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Judas is held to be guilty

                          eum exposuit, ut Augustinus dicit.

                          the Father. Hence in three respects God the Father did
                          deliver up Christ to the Passion. In the first way,
                          because by His eternal will He preordained Christ's
                          Passion for the deliverance of the human race,
                          according to the words of Isaias (53:6): "The Lord
                          hath laid on Him the iniquities of us all"; and again
                          (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A10"
                            >Is. 53:10</a
                          >): "The Lord was pleased to bruise Him in infirmity."
                          Secondly, inasmuch as, by the infusion of charity, He
                          inspired Him with the will to suffer for us; hence we
                          read in the same passage: "He was offered because it
                          was His own will" (<a

                          >). Thirdly, by not shielding Him from the Passion,
                          but abandoning Him to His persecutors: thus we read
                          (<a

                          out: "My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken Me?"
                          because, to wit, He left Him to the power of His
                          persecutors, as Augustine says (Ep. cxl).<br />

                              <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is indeed a
                              wicked and cruel act to hand over an innocent man
                              to torment and to death against his will. Yet God
                              the Father did not so deliver up Christ, but
                              inspired Him with the will to suffer for us. God's
                              "severity" (cf. Rm. 11:22) is thereby shown, for
                              He would not remit sin without penalty: and the
                              Apostle indicates this when (<a

                              man pay Him enough satisfaction: and the Apostle

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting that Christ should
          suffer at the hands of the Gentiles. For since men were to be freed
          from sin by Christ's death, it would seem fitting that very few should
          sin in His death. But the Jews sinned in His death, on whose behalf it
          is said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++21%3A38"
            >Mt. 21:38</a

          therefore, that the Gentiles should not be implicated in the sin of
          Christ's slaying.<br />

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the truth should respond to
              the figure. Now it was not the Gentiles but the Jews who offered
              the figurative sacrifices of the Old Law. Therefore neither ought

                  patrem suum dicebat Deum, aequalem se Deo faciens. Sed haec

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as related Jn. 5:18, "the
                  Jews sought to kill" Christ because "He did not only break the
                  sabbath, but also said God was His Father, making Himself
                  equal to God." But these things seemed to be only against the
                  Law of the Jews: hence they themselves said (<a

                  Himself the Son of God." It seems fitting, therefore, that
                  Christ should suffer, at the hands not of the Gentiles, but of
                  the Jews, and that what they said was untrue: "It is not
                  lawful for us to put any man to death," since many sins are
                  punishable with death according to the Law, as is evident from

                          Christi effectum salutis habuit in Iudaeis, quorum
                          plurimi in morte Christi baptizati sunt, ut patet Act.
                          II et IV. Secundo vero, Iudaeis praedicantibus,
                          effectus passionis Christi transivit ad gentes. Et
                          ideo conveniens fuit ut Christus a Iudaeis pati
                          inciperet, et postea, Iudaeis tradentibus, per manus
                          gentilium eius passio finiretur.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The effect of Christ's
                          Passion was foreshown by the very manner of His death.
                          For Christ's Passion wrought its effect of salvation
                          first of all among the Jews, very many of whom were
                          baptized in His death, as is evident from Acts 2:41
                          and Acts 4:4. Afterwards, by the preaching of Jews,
                          Christ's Passion passed on to the Gentiles.
                          Consequently it was fitting that Christ should begin
                          His sufferings at the hands of the Jews, and, after
                          they had delivered Him up, finish His Passion at the
                          hands of the Gentiles.<br />

                                      Augustine says (Tract. cxiv in Joan.):
                                      "The Jews said that 'it is not lawful for
                                      us to put any man to death,' because they
                                      understood that it was not lawful for them
                                      to put any man to death" owing to the
                                      sacredness of the feast-day, which they
                                      had already begun to celebrate. or, as
                                      Chrysostom observes (Hom. lxxxiii in
                                      Joan.), because they wanted Him to be
                                      slain, not as a transgressor of the Law,
                                      but as a public enemy, since He had made
                                      Himself out to be a king, of which it was
                                      not their place to judge. Or, again,
                                      because it was not lawful for them to
                                      crucify Him (as they wanted to), but to
                                      stone Him, as they did to Stephen. Better
                                      still is it to say that the power of
                                      putting to death was taken from them by
                                      the Romans, whose subjects they were.<br />

          proves most manifestly by these words that the rulers of the Jews
          crucified the Son of God, not from ignorance, but out of envy: for
          they understood that it was He to whom the Father says by the Prophet:
          'Ask of Me, and I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy inheritance.'"

                          elders, and others of lesser degree. Now according to
                          the author of De Qq. Nov. et Vet. Test., qu. lxvi, the
                          elders, who were called "rulers, knew," as did also
                          the devils, "that He was the Christ promised in the
                          Law: for they saw all the signs in Him which the
                          prophets said would come to pass: but they did not
                          know the mystery of His Godhead." Consequently the
                          Apostle says: "If they had known it, they would never
                          have crucified the Lord of glory." It must, however,
                          be understood that their ignorance did not excuse them
                          from crime, because it was, as it were, affected
                          ignorance. For they saw manifest signs of His Godhead;
                          yet they perverted them out of hatred and envy of
                          Christ; neither would they believe His words, whereby
                          He avowed that He was the Son of God. Hence He Himself
                          says of them (<a

                          >): "If I had not come, and spoken to them, they would
                          not have sin; but now they have no excuse for their
                          sin." And afterwards He adds (<a

                          other man hath done, they would not have sin." And so
                          the expression employed by Job (<a

                                  the Law, but the words of Ps. 2:8 seem to
                                  militate against this answer: "Ask of Me, and
                                  I will give Thee the Gentiles for Thy
                                  inheritance"; which are addressed to Him of

                                  have I begotten Thee." If, then, they knew Him
                                  to be the one to whom the words were
                                  addressed: "Ask of Me, and I will give Thee
                                  the Gentiles for Thy inheritance," it follows
                                  that they knew Him to be the Son of God.
                                  Chrysostom, too, says upon the same passage
                                  that "they knew Him to be the Son of God."
                                  Bede likewise, commenting on the words, "For

                                  the Son of God, preferred to crucify Him
                                  rather than acknowledge Him." But to this it
                                  may be replied that they knew Him to be the
                                  Son of God, not from His Nature, but from the
                                  excellence of His singular grace.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sin of Christ's
          crucifiers was not the most grievous. Because the sin which has some
          excuse cannot be most grievous. But our Lord Himself excused the sin
          of His crucifiers when He said: "Father, forgive them: for they know
          not what they do" (<a

              per suos ministros. Ergo videtur fuisse maius peccatum Iudae

                  and in the same place he adds: "Where no one suffers
                  injustice, nobody works injustice." Consequently nobody wreaks

                          affected ignorance, which could not excuse them.
                          Therefore their sin was the most grievous, both on
                          account of the kind of sin, as well as from the malice
                          of their will. The Jews also of the common order
                          sinned most grievously as to the kind of their sin:
                          yet in one respect their crime was lessened by reason

                                      Christ, indeed willed His Passion just as
                                      the Father willed it; yet He did not will
                                      the unjust action of the Jews.
                                      Consequently Christ's slayers are not
                                      excused of their injustice. Nevertheless,
                                      whoever slays a man not only does a wrong
                                      to the one slain, but likewise to God and
                                      to the State; just as he who kills
                                      himself, as the Philosopher says (Ethic.
                                      v). Hence it was that David condemned to
                                      death the man who "did not fear to lay
                                      hands upon the Lord's anointed," even
                                      though he (Saul) had requested it, as
                                      related 2 Kgs. 1:5-14.<br />
