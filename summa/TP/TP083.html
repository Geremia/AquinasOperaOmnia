          Respondeo dicendum quod duplici ratione celebratio huius sacramenti
          dicitur Christi immolatio. Primo quidem quia, sicut Augustinus dicit,
          ad Simplicianum, solent imagines earum rerum nominibus appellari
          quarum imagines sunt, sicut cum, intuentes tabulam aut parietem
          pictum, dicimus, ille Cicero est, ille Sallustius. Celebratio autem
          huius sacramenti, sicut supra dictum est, imago est quaedam
          repraesentativa passionis Christi, quae est vera immolatio. Unde
          Ambrosius dicit, super epistolam ad Heb., in Christo semel oblata est
          hostia ad salutem sempiternam potens. Quid ergo nos? Nonne per
          singulos dies offerimus ad recordationem mortis eius? Alio modo,
          quantum ad effectum passionis, quia scilicet per hoc sacramentum
          participes efficimur fructus dominicae passionis. Unde et in quadam
          dominicali oratione secreta dicitur, quoties huius hostiae
          commemoratio celebratur, opus nostrae redemptionis exercetur. Quantum
          igitur ad primum modum, poterat Christus dici immolari etiam in
          figuris veteris testamenti, unde et in Apoc. XIII dicitur, quorum
          nomina non sunt scripta in libro vitae agni, qui occisus est ab
          origine mundi. Sed quantum ad modum secundum, proprium est huic
          sacramento quod in eius celebratione Christus immoletur.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The celebration of this sacrament is
          called a sacrifice for two reasons. First, because, as Augustine says
          (Ad Simplician. ii), "the images of things are called by the names of
          the things whereof they are the images; as when we look upon a picture
          or a fresco, we say, 'This is Cicero and that is Sallust.'" But, as
          was said above (<a href="TP079.html#TPQ79OUTP1">Question [79]</a>,
          <a href="TP079.html#TPQ79A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), the celebration of
          this sacrament is an image representing Christ's Passion, which is His
          true sacrifice. Accordingly the celebration of this sacrament is
          called Christ's sacrifice. Hence it is that Ambrose, in commenting on
          Heb. 10:1, says: "In Christ was offered up a sacrifice capable of
          giving eternal salvation; what then do we do? Do we not offer it up
          every day in memory of His death?" Secondly it is called a sacrifice,
          in respect of the effect of His Passion: because, to wit, by this
          sacrament, we are made partakers of the fruit of our Lord's Passion.
          Hence in one of the Sunday Secrets (Ninth Sunday after Pentecost) we
          say: "Whenever the commemoration of this sacrifice is celebrated, the
          work of our redemption is enacted." Consequently, according to the
          first reason, it is true to say that Christ was sacrificed, even in
          the figures of the Old Testament: hence it is stated in the Apocalypse
          (13:8): "Whose names are not written in the Book of Life of the Lamb,
          which was slain from the beginning of the world." But according to the
          second reason, it is proper to this sacrament for Christ to be
          sacrificed in its celebration.<br />

          Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut Ambrosius ibidem dicit, una est

          multae, quia semel oblatus est Christus, hoc autem sacrificium
          exemplum est illius. Sicut enim quod ubique offertur unum est corpus

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Ambrose says (commenting on
          Heb. 10:1), "there is but one victim," namely that which Christ
          offered, and which we offer, "and not many victims, because Christ was
          offered but once: and this latter sacrifice is the pattern of the
          former. For, just as what is offered everywhere is one body, and not
          many bodies, so also is it but one sacrifice."<br />

          representative of our Lord's Passion. But the commemoration of our
          Lord's Passion takes place in the Church once in the year: because
          Augustine says (Enarr. ii in Ps. 21): "Is not Christ slain as often as
          the Pasch is celebrated? Nevertheless, the anniversary remembrance
          represents what took place in by-gone days; and so it does not cause
          us to be stirred as if we saw our Lord hanging upon the cross."
          Therefore this sacrament ought to be celebrated but once a year.

          The figure ceases on the advent of the reality. But this sacrament is
          a figure and a representation of our Lord's Passion, as stated above.
          And therefore on the day on which our Lord's Passion is recalled as it

          Nevertheless, lest the Church be deprived on that day of the fruit of

          On Christmas Day, however, several masses are said on account of
          Christ's threefold nativity. Of these the first is His eternal birth,
          which is hidden in our regard. and therefore one mass is sung in the
          night, in the "Introit" of which we say: "The Lord said unto Me: Thou
          art My Son, this day have I begotten Thee." The second is His nativity
          in time, and the spiritual birth, whereby Christ rises "as the

          we say: "The light will shine on us today." The third is Christ's
          temporal and bodily birth, according as He went forth from the
          virginal womb, becoming visible to us through being clothed with
          flesh: and on that account the third mass is sung in broad daylight,
          in the "Introit" of which we say: "A child is born to us."
          Nevertheless, on the other hand, it can be said that His eternal
          generation, of itself, is in the full light, and on this account in
          the gospel of the third mass mention is made of His eternal birth. But
          regarding His birth in the body, He was literally born during the
          night, as a sign that He came to the darknesses of our infirmity;
          hence also in the midnight mass we say the gospel of Christ's nativity

          because the night cometh when no man can work; as long as I am in the

          nor from sunrise, that is, when the substance of the sun appears above
          the earth; but when the dawn begins to show: because then the sun is

          This sacrament ought as a rule to be celebrated in a house, whereby

          know how thou oughtest to behave thyself in the house of God, which is
          the Church of the living God." Because "outside the Church there is no
          place for the true sacrifice," as Augustine says (Liber Sentent.
          Prosp. xv). And because the Church was not to be confined within the
          territories of the Jewish people, but was to be established throughout
          the whole world, therefore Christ's Passion was not celebrated within
          the city of the Jews, but in the open country, that so the whole world
          might serve as a house for Christ's Passion. Nevertheless, as is said
          in De Consecr., dist. 1, "if a church be not to hand, we permit
          travelers to celebrate mass in the open air, or in a tent, if there be

          The house in which this sacrament is celebrated denotes the Church,
          and is termed a church; and so it is fittingly consecrated, both to
          represent the holiness which the Church acquired from the Passion, as
          well as to denote the holiness required of them who have to receive
          this sacrament. By the altar Christ Himself is signified, of Whom the
          Apostle says (<a

            >Heb. 13:15</a
          >): "Through Him we offer a sacrifice of praise to God." Hence the
          consecration of the altar signifies Christ's holiness, of which it was

            >Lk. 1:35</a

          And therefore, as a rule, it is not lawful to celebrate this sacrament
          except in a consecrated house. Hence it is enacted (De Consecr., dist.
          1): "Let no priest presume to say mass except in places consecrated by
          the bishop." And furthermore because pagans and other unbelievers are
          not members of the Church, therefore we read (De Consecr., dist. 1):
          "It is not lawful to bless a church in which the bodies of unbelievers
          are buried, but if it seem suitable for consecration, then, after
          removing the corpses and tearing down the walls or beams, let it be
          rebuilt. If, however, it has been already consecrated, and the
          faithful lie in it, it is lawful to celebrate mass therein."
          Nevertheless in a case of necessity this sacrament can be performed in
          houses which have not been consecrated, or which have been profaned;
          but with the bishop's consent. Hence we read in the same distinction:
          "We deem that masses are not to be celebrated everywhere, but in
          places consecrated by the bishop, or where he gives permission." But
          not without a portable altar consecrated by the bishop: hence in the
          same distinction we read: "We permit that, if the churches be
          devastated or burned, masses may be celebrated in chapels, with a
          consecrated altar." For because Christ's holiness is the fount of all
          the Church's holiness, therefore in necessity a consecrated altar
          suffices for performing this sacrament. And on this account a church
          is never consecrated without consecrating the altar. Yet sometimes an
          altar is consecrated apart from the church, with the relics of the
          saints, "whose lives are hidden with Christ in God" (Col. 3:3).
          Accordingly under the same distinction we read: "It is our pleasure
          that altars, in which no relics of saints are found enclosed, be
          thrown down, if possible, by the bishops presiding over such
          places."<br />

          Hence it is that such places are cleansed and exorcised before being
          consecrated, that the enemy's power may be driven forth. And for the
          same reason churches defiled by shedding of blood or seed are
          reconciled: because some machination of the enemy is apparent on
          account of the sin committed there. And for this reason we read in the
          same distinction: "Wherever you find churches of the Arians,
          consecrate them as Catholic churches without delay by means of devout
          prayers and rites." Hence, too, it is that some say with probability,
          that by entering a consecrated church one obtains forgiveness of
          venial sins, just as one does by the sprinkling of holy water;
          alleging the words of Ps. 84:2,3: "Lord, Thou hast blessed Thy land...
          Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of Thy people." And therefore, in
          consequence of the virtue acquired by a church's consecration, the
          consecration is never repeated. Accordingly we find in the same
          distinction the following words quoted from the Council of Nicaea:
          "Churches which have once been consecrated, must not be consecrated
          again, except they be devastated by fire, or defiled by shedding of
          blood or of anyone's seed; because, just as a child once baptized in
          the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost, ought
          not to be baptized again, so neither ought a place, once dedicated to
          God, to be consecrated again, except owing to the causes mentioned
          above; provided that the consecrators held faith in the Holy Trinity":
          in fact, those outside the Church cannot consecrate. But, as we read
          in the same distinction: "Churches or altars of doubtful consecration
          are to be consecrated anew."<br />

          Since the consecration of the altar signifies Christ's holiness, and
          the consecration of a house the holiness of the entire Church,
          therefore the consecration of a church or of an altar is more
          fittingly commemorated. And on this account the solemnity of a church
          dedication is observed for eight days, in order to signify the happy
          resurrection of Christ and of the Church's members. Nor is the
          consecration of a church or altar man's doing only, since it has a
          spiritual virtue. Hence in the same distinction (De Consecr.) it is

          solemnly celebrated each year: and that dedications are to be kept up

          As we read in De Consecr., dist. 1, "altars, if not of stone, are not
          to be consecrated with the anointing of chrism." And this is in
          keeping with the signification of this sacrament; both because the
          altar signifies Christ, for in 1 Cor. 10:3, it is written, "But the
          rock was Christ": and because Christ's body was laid in a stone
          sepulchre. This is also in keeping with the use of the sacrament.
          Because stone is solid, and may be found everywhere. which was not
          necessary in the old Law, when the altar was made in one place. As to

          As is laid down in the same distinction, "formerly the priests did not
          use golden but wooden chalices; but Pope Zephyrinus ordered the mass
          to be said with glass patens; and subsequently Pope Urban had
          everything made of silver." Afterwards it was decided that "the Lord's
          chalice with the paten should be made entirely of gold, or of silver
          or at least of tin. But it is not to be made of brass, or copper,
          because the action of the wine thereon produces verdigris, and
          provokes vomiting. But no one is to presume to sing mass with a
          chalice of wood or of glass," because as the wood is porous, the
          consecrated blood would remain in it; while glass is brittle and there
          might arise danger of breakage; and the same applies to stone.
          Consequently, out of reverence for the sacrament, it was enacted that
          the chalice should be made of the aforesaid materials.<br />

          Where it could be done without danger, the Church gave order for that
          thing to be used which more expressively represents Christ's Passion.
          But there was not so much danger regarding the body which is placed on
          the corporal, as there is with the blood contained in the chalice. And
          consequently, although the chalice is not made of stone, yet the
          corporal is made of linen, since Christ's body was wrapped therein.
          Hence we read in an Epistle of Pope Silvester, quoted in the same
          distinction: "By a unanimous decree we command that no one shall
          presume to celebrate the sacrifice of the altar upon a cloth of silk,
          or dyed material, but upon linen consecrated by the bishop; as
          Christ's body was buried in a clean linen winding-sheet." Moreover,
          linen material is becoming, owing to its cleanness, to denote purity
          of conscience, and, owing to the manifold labor with which it is
          prepared, to denote Christ's Passion.<br />

          (Ecclus. 18:23): "Before prayer prepare thy soul," therefore the
          celebration of this mystery is preceded by a certain preparation in
          order that we may perform worthily that which follows after. The first
          part of this preparation is Divine praise, and consists in the
          "Introit": according to Ps. 49:23: "The sacrifice of praise shall
          glorify me; and there is the way by which I will show him the
          salvation of God": and this is taken for the most part from the
          Psalms, or, at least, is sung with a Psalm, because, as Dionysius says

          instruction is given "dispositively," when the Lectors and Sub-deacons
          read aloud in the church the teachings of the prophets and apostles:
          after this "lesson," the choir sing the "Gradual," which signifies
          progress in life; then the "Alleluia" is intoned, and this denotes
          spiritual joy; or in mournful offices the "Tract", expressive of
          spiritual sighing; for all these things ought to result from the
          aforesaid teaching. But the people are instructed "perfectly" by
          Christ's teaching contained in the Gospel, which is read by the higher
          ministers, that is, by the Deacons. And because we believe Christ as
          the Divine truth, according to Jn. 8:46, "If I tell you the truth, why
          do you not believe Me?" after the Gospel has been read, the "Creed" is
          sung in which the people show that they assent by faith to Christ's
          doctrine. And it is sung on those festivals of which mention is made
          therein, as on the festivals of Christ, of the Blessed Virgin, and of
          the apostles, who laid the foundations of this faith, and on other

          great joy Thy people which are here present, offer Thee their

          Christ's Godhead, saying with the angels: "Holy, Holy, Holy"; and His

          As is stated in the last chapter of John (verse 25), our Lord said and
          did many things which are not written down by the Evangelists; and
          among them is the uplifting of His eyes to heaven at the supper;
          nevertheless the Roman Church had it by tradition from the apostles.
          For it seems reasonable that He Who lifted up His eyes to the Father

          Greater devotion is required in this sacrament than in the others, for
          the reason that the entire Christ is contained therein. Moreover, this
          sacrament requires a more general devotion, i.e. on the part of the

          of the recipients, as in the other sacraments. Hence Cyprian observes

          souls of the brethren by saying, 'Lift up your hearts,' and when the

          As was said above (ad 3), those things are mentioned in this sacrament
          which belong to the entire Church; and consequently some things which
          refer to the people are sung by the choir, and same of these words are
          all sung by the choir, as though inspiring the entire people with
          them; and there are other words which the priest begins and the people
          take up, the priest then acting as in the person of God; to show that
          the things they denote have come to the people through Divine
          revelation, such as faith and heavenly glory; and therefore the priest
          intones the "Creed" and the "Gloria in excelsis Deo." Other words are
          uttered by the ministers, such as the doctrine of the Old and New
          Testament, as a sign that this doctrine was announced to the peoples
          through ministers sent by God. And there are other words which the
          priest alone recites, namely, such as belong to his personal office,
          "that he may offer up gifts and prayers for the people" (<a

          to priest and people alike, such as the "common prayers"; other words,
          however, belong to the priest alone, such as the oblation and the
          consecration; consequently, the prayers that are said in connection
          with these have to be said by the priest in secret. Nevertheless, in
          both he calls the people to attention by saying: "The Lord be with
          you," and he waits for them to assent by saying "Amen." And therefore
          before the secret prayers he says aloud, "The Lord be with you," and
          he concludes, "For ever and ever." Or the priest secretly pronounces

          Testament the ceremonies of the old are not to be observed, such as
          that the priests and ministers were purified with water when they drew
          nigh to offer up the sacrifice: for we read (<a

          are going into the tabernacle of the testimony... and when they are to

          Ad primum ergo dicendum quod ablutio manuum fit in celebratione Missae

          Unde indecens videtur quod ad tantum sacramentum aliquis accedat
          manibus, etiam corporaliter, inquinatis. Secundo, propter
          significationem. Quia, ut Dionysius dicit, III cap. Eccles. Hier.,
          extremitatum ablutio significat emundationem etiam a minimis peccatis,

          lavet. Et talis emundatio requiritur ab eo qui accedit ad hoc

          introitum Missae. Et hoc idem significabat ablutio sacerdotum in
          veteri lege, ut ibidem Dionysius dicit. Nec tamen Ecclesia hoc servat
          tanquam caeremoniale veteris legis praeceptum, sed quasi ab Ecclesia
          institutum, sicut quiddam secundum se conveniens. Et ideo non eodem
          modo observatur sicut tunc. Praetermittitur enim pedum ablutio, et
          servatur ablutio manuum, quae potest fieri magis in promptu, et quae
          sufficit ad significandam perfectam munditiam. Cum enim manus sit
          organum organorum, ut dicitur in III de anima, omnia opera

          The washing of the hands is done in the celebration of mass out of
          reverence for this sacrament; and this for two reasons: first, because
          we are not wont to handle precious objects except the hands be washed;
          hence it seems indecent for anyone to approach so great a sacrament
          with hands that are, even literally, unclean. Secondly, on account of
          its signification, because, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), the
          washing of the extremities of the limbs denotes cleansing from even
          the smallest sins, according to Jn. 13:10: "He that is washed needeth
          not but to wash his feet." And such cleansing is required of him who
          approaches this sacrament; and this is denoted by the confession which
          is made before the "Introit" of the mass. Moreover, this was signified
          by the washing of the priests under the Old Law, as Dionysius says
          (Eccl. Hier. iii). However, the Church observes this ceremony, not
          because it was prescribed under the Old Law, but because it is
          becoming in itself, and therefore instituted by the Church. Hence it
          is not observed in the same way as it was then: because the washing of
          the feet is omitted, and the washing of the hands is observed; for
          this can be done more readily, and suffices far denoting perfect
          cleansing. For, since the hand is the "organ of organs" (De Anima
          iii), all works are attributed to the hands: hence it is said in Ps.
          25:6: "I will wash my hands among the innocent."<br />

          We use incense, not as commanded by a ceremonial precept of the Law,
          but as prescribed by the Church; accordingly we do not use it in the
          same fashion as it was ordered under the Old Law. It has reference to
          two things: first, to the reverence due to this sacrament, i.e. in
          order by its good odor, to remove any disagreeable smell that may be
          about the place; secondly, it serves to show the effect of grace,
          wherewith Christ was filled as with a good odor, according to Gn.
          27:27: "Behold, the odor of my son is like the odor of a ripe field";
          and from Christ it spreads to the faithful by the work of His
          ministers, according to 2 Cor. 2:14: "He manifesteth the odor of his
          knowledge by us in every place"; and therefore when the altar which
          represents Christ, has been incensed on every side, then all are

          The actions performed by the priest in mass are not ridiculous
          gestures, since they are done so as to represent something else. The
          priest in extending his arms signifies the outstretching of Christ's
          arms upon the cross. He also lifts up his hands as he prays, to point
          out that his prayer is directed to God for the people, according to
          Lam. 3:41: "Let us lift up our hearts with our hands to the Lord in
          the heavens": and Ex. 17:11: "And when Moses lifted up his hands
          Israel overcame." That at times he joins his hands, and bows down,
          praying earnestly and humbly, denotes the humility and obedience of
          Christ, out of which He suffered. He closes his fingers, i.e. the
          thumb and first finger, after the consecration, because, with them, he
          had touched the consecrated body of Christ; so that if any particle
          cling to the fingers, it may not be scattered: and this belongs to the

          As Pope Sergius says, and it is to be found in the Decretals (De
          Consecr., dist. ii), "the Lord's body is threefold; the part offered
          and put into the chalice signifies Christ's risen body," namely,
          Christ Himself, and the Blessed Virgin, and the other saints, if there
          be any, who are already in glory with their bodies. "The part consumed
          denotes those still walking upon earth," because while living upon
          earth they are united together by this sacrament; and are bruised by
          the passions, just as the bread eaten is bruised by the teeth. "The
          part reserved on the altar till the close of the mass, is His body
          hidden in the sepulchre, because the bodies of the saints will be in
          their graves until the end of the world": though their souls are
          either in purgatory, or in heaven. However, this rite of reserving one
          part on the altar till the close of the mass is no longer observed, on
          account of the danger; nevertheless, the same meaning of the parts

          consequently it is received in order to rinse the mouth after

          from taking the ablution-wine he be prevented from celebrating again";

          namely, because a part of the host consecrated, of which the priest
          and ministers or even the people communicate, ought not to be reserved
          until the day following. Hence, as is laid down (De Consecr., dist.
          ii), Pope Clement I ordered that "as many hosts are to be offered on
          the altar as shall suffice for the people; should any be left over,
          they are not to be reserved until the morrow, but let the clergy
          carefully consume them with fear and trembling." Nevertheless, since
          this sacrament is to be received daily, whereas the Paschal Lamb was
          not, it is therefore necessary for other hosts to be reserved for the
          sick. Hence we read in the same distinction: "Let the priest always
          have the Eucharist ready, so that, when anyone fall sick, he may take
          Communion to him at once, lest he die without it."<br />

          the mass. Hence Pope Soter says (De Consecr., dist. 1): "It has also
          been ordained, that no priest is to presume to celebrate solemn mass,
          unless two others be present answering him, while he himself makes the
          third; because when he says in the plural, 'The Lord be with you,' and
          again in the Secrets, 'Pray ye for me,' it is most becoming that they
          should answer his greeting." Hence it is for the sake of greater
          solemnity that we find it decreed (De Consecr. dist. 1) that a bishop
          is to solemnize mass with several assistants. Nevertheless, in private
          masses it suffices to have one server, who takes the place of the

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that the defects occurring during
          the celebration of this sacrament cannot be sufficiently met by
          observing the statutes of the Church. For it sometimes happens that
          before or after the consecration the priest dies or goes mad, or is
          hindered by some other infirmity from receiving the sacrament and
          completing the mass. Consequently it seems impossible to observe the
          Church's statute, whereby the priest consecrating must communicate of
          his own sacrifice.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>
          If the priest be stricken by death or grave sickness before the
          consecration of our Lord's body and blood, there is no need for it to
          be completed by another. But if this happens after the consecration is
          begun, for instance, when the body has been consecrated and before the
          consecration of the blood, or even after both have been consecrated,
          then the celebration of the mass ought to be finished by someone else.
          Hence, as is laid down (Decretal vii, q. 1), we read the following
          decree of the (Seventh) Council of Toledo: "We consider it to be
          fitting that when the sacred mysteries are consecrated by priests
          during the time of mass, if any sickness supervenes, in consequence of
          which they cannot finish the mystery begun, let it be free for the
          bishop or another priest to finish the consecration of the office thus
          begun. For nothing else is suitable for completing the mysteries
          commenced, unless the consecration be completed either by the priest
          who began it, or by the one who follows him: because they cannot be
          completed except they be performed in perfect order. For since we are
          all one in Christ, the change of persons makes no difference, since
          unity of faith insures the happy issue of the mystery. Yet let not the
          course we propose for cases of natural debility, be presumptuously
          abused: and let no minister or priest presume ever to leave the Divine
          offices unfinished, unless he be absolutely prevented from continuing.
          If anyone shall have rashly presumed to do so, he will incur sentence
          of excommunication."<br />

          Where difficulty arises, the less dangerous course should always be
          followed. But the greatest danger regarding this sacrament lies in
          whatever may prevent its completion, because this is a heinous
          sacrilege; while that danger is of less account which regards the
          condition of the receiver. Consequently, if after the consecration has
          been begun the priest remembers that he has eaten or drunk anything,
          he ought nevertheless to complete the sacrifice and receive the
          sacrament. Likewise, if he recalls a sin committed, he ought to make
          an act of contrition, with the firm purpose of confessing and making
          satisfaction for it: and thus he will not receive the sacrament
          unworthily, but with profit. The same applies if he calls to mind that
          he is under some excommunication; for he ought to make the resolution
          of humbly seeking absolution; and so he will receive absolution from
          the invisible High Priest Jesus Christ for his act of completing the
          Divine mysteries.<br />

          others on any account, lest the life-giving chalice become one of
          death, but it ought to be kept in a suitable vessel with the relics:
          and in order that the sacrament may not remain incomplete, he ought to

          If before the consecration of the blood, and after the consecration of
          the body the priest detect that either the wine or the water is

          put in the chalice, and if he detect it before receiving the body,
          then rejecting the water, he ought to pour in wine with water, and
          begin over again the consecrating words of the blood. But if he notice
          it after receiving the body, he ought to procure another host which
          must be consecrated together with the blood; and I say so for this
          reason, because if he were to say only the words of consecration of
          the blood, the proper order of consecrating would not be observed;
          and, as is laid down by the Council of Toledo, quoted above (ad 1),
          sacrifices cannot be perfect, except they be performed in perfect
          order. But if he were to begin from the consecration of the blood, and
          were to repeat all the words which follow, it would not suffice,
          unless there was a consecrated host present, since in those words
          there are things to be said and done not only regarding the blood, but
          also regarding the body; and at the close he ought once more to
          receive the consecrated host and blood, even if he had already taken
          the water which was in the chalice, because the precept of the
          completing this sacrament is of greater weight than the precept of
          receiving the sacrament while fasting, as stated above (<a

          Although the priest may not recollect having said some of the words he
          ought to say, he ought not to be disturbed mentally on that account;
          for a man who utters many words cannot recall to mind all that he has
          said; unless perchance in uttering them he adverts to something
          connected with the consecration; for so it is impressed on the memory.
          Hence, if a man pays attention to what he is saying, but without
          adverting to the fact that he is saying these particular words, he
          remembers soon after that he has said them; for, a thing is presented
          to the memory under the formality of the past (De Mem. et Remin.
          i).<br />

          But if it seem to the priest that he has probably omitted some of the
          words that are not necessary for the sacrament, I think that he ought
          not to repeat them on that account, changing the order of the
          sacrifice, but that he ought to proceed: but if he is certain that he
          has left out any of those that are necessary for the sacrament,
          namely, the form of the consecration, since the form of the
          consecration is necessary for the sacrament, just as the matter is, it
          seems that the same thing ought to be done as was stated above (ad 4)
          with regard to defect in the matter, namely, that he should begin
          again with the form of the consecration, and repeat the other things
          in order, lest the order of the sacrifice be altered.<br />

          The breaking of the consecrated host, and the putting of only one part
          into the chalice, regards the mystical body, just as the mixing with
          water signifies the people, and therefore the omission of either of
          them causes no such imperfection in the sacrifice, as calls for

          Ad septimum dicendum quod, sicut legitur de Consecr., dist. II, ex
          decreto pii Papae, si per negligentiam aliquid stillaverit de sanguine
          in tabula quae terrae adhaeret, lingua lambetur et tabula radetur. Si
          vero non fuerit tabula, terra radetur, et igni comburetur, et cinis
          intra altare condetur. Et sacerdos quadraginta dies poeniteat. Si
          autem super altare stillaverit calix, sorbeat minister stillam. Et
          tribus diebus poeniteat. Si super linteum altaris, et ad aliud stilla
          pervenerit, quatuor diebus poeniteat. Si usque ad tertium, novem
          diebus poeniteat. Si usque ad quartum, viginti diebus poeniteat. Et
          linteamina quae stilla tetigit, tribus vicibus lavet minister, calice
          subtus posito, et aqua ablutionis sumatur et iuxta altare recondatur.
          Posset etiam sumi in potu a ministro, nisi propter abominationem
          dimitteretur. Quidam autem ulterius partem illam linteaminum incidunt
          et comburunt, et cinerem in altario vel sacrario reponunt. Subditur
          autem ibidem, ex poenitentiali Bedae presbyteri, si quis per
          ebrietatem vel voracitatem Eucharistiam evomuerit, quadraginta diebus
          poeniteat; clerici vel monachi, seu diaconi vel presbyteri, sexaginta
          diebus; episcopus nonaginta. Si autem infirmitatis causa evomuerit,
          septem diebus poeniteat. Et in eadem distinctione legitur, ex Concilio
          Aurelianensi, qui non bene custodierit sacrificium, et mus vel aliquod
          aliud animal in Ecclesia comederit, quadraginta diebus poeniteat. Qui
          autem perdiderit illud in Ecclesia, aut pars eius ceciderit et non
          inventa fuerit, triginta diebus poeniteat. Et eadem poenitentia
          videtur dignus sacerdos per cuius negligentiam hostiae consecratae
          putrefiunt. Praedictis autem diebus debet poenitens ieiunare et a
          communione cessare. Pensatis tamen conditionibus negotii et personae,
          potest minui vel addi ad poenitentiam praedictam. Hoc tamen
          observandum est, quod, ubicumque species integrae inveniuntur, sunt
          reverenter observandae, vel etiam sumendae, quia, manentibus

          According to the decree, De Consecr., dist. ii, quoting a decree of
          Pope Pius I, "If from neglect any of the blood falls upon a board
          which is fixed to the ground, let it be taken up with the tongue, and
          let the board be scraped. But if it be not a board, let the ground be
          scraped, and the scrapings burned, and the ashes buried inside the
          altar and let the priest do penance for forty days. But if a drop fall
          from the chalice on to the altar, let the minister suck up the drop,
          and do penance during three days; if it falls upon the altar cloth and
          penetrates to the second altar cloth, let him do four days' penance;
          if it penetrates to the third, let him do nine days' penance; if to
          the fourth, let him do twenty days' penance; and let the altar linens
          which the drop touched be washed three times by the priest, holding
          the chalice below, then let the water be taken and put away nigh to
          the altar." It might even be drunk by the minister, unless it might be
          rejected from nausea. Some persons go further, and cut out that part
          of the linen, which they burn, putting the ashes in the altar or down
          the sacrarium. And the Decretal continues with a quotation from the
          Penitential of Bede the Priest: "If, owing to drunkenness or gluttony,
          anyone vomits up the Eucharist, let him do forty days' penance, if he
          be a layman; but let clerics or monks, deacons and priests, do seventy
          days' penance; and let a bishop do ninety days'. But if they vomit
          from sickness, let them do penance for seven days." And in the same
          distinction, we read a decree of the (Fourth) Council of Arles: "They
          who do not keep proper custody over the sacrament, if a mouse or other
          animal consume it, must do forty days' penance: he who loses it in a
          church, or if a part fall and be not found, shall do thirty days'
          penance." And the priest seems to deserve the same penance, who from
          neglect allows the hosts to putrefy. And on those days the one doing
          penance ought to fast, and abstain from Communion. However, after
          weighing the circumstances of the fact and of the person, the said
          penances may be lessened or increased. But it must be observed that
          wherever the species are found to be entire, they must be preserved
          reverently, or consumed; because Christ's body is there so long as the
          species last, as stated above (<a href="TP077.html#TPQ77OUTP1"
            >Question [77]</a
          >, <a href="TP077.html#TPQ77ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5). But if it can
          be done conveniently, the things in which they are found are to be
          burned, and the ashes put in the sacrarium, as was said of the
          scrapings of the altar-table, here above.<br />
