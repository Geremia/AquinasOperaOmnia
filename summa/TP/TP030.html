          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was unnecessary to
          announce to the Blessed Virgin that which was to be done in her. For
          there seems to have been no need of the Annunciation except for the
          purpose of receiving the Virgin's consent. But her consent seems to
          have been unnecessary: because the Virginal Conception was foretold by
          a prophecy of "predestination," which is "fulfilled without our
          consent," as a gloss says on Mt. 1:22. There was no need, therefore,
          for this Annunciation.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Blessed Virgin believed in the

          no further instruction concerning what one believes without doubt.

          quam concipiendo carnem Christi. Et postea subdit, materna

          First, in order to maintain a becoming order in the union of the Son
          of God with the Virgin---namely, that she should be informed in mind
          concerning Him, before conceiving Him in the flesh. Thus Augustine
          says (De Sancta Virgin. iii): "Mary is more blessed in receiving the
          faith of Christ, than in conceiving the flesh of Christ"; and further
          on he adds: "Her nearness as a Mother would have been of no profit to
          Mary, had she not borne Christ in her heart after a more blessed
          manner than in her flesh."<br />

          established by God, by which Divine things are brought to men by means
          of the angels. Wherefore Dionysius says (Coel. Hier. iv) that "the
          angels were the first to be taught the Divine mystery of the loving
          kindness of Jesus: afterwards the grace of knowledge was imparted to
          us through them. Thus, then, the most god-like Gabriel made known to
          Zachary that a prophet son would be born to him; and, to Mary, how the

          Secondly, this was becoming to the restoration of human nature which
          was to be effected by Christ. Wherefore Bede says in a homily (in

          should be sent by God to the Virgin who was to be hallowed by the
          Divine Birth: since the first cause of man's ruin was through the

          The Mother of God was above the angels as regards the dignity to which
          she was chosen by God. But as regards the present state of life, she
          was beneath the angels. For even Christ Himself, by reason of His
          passible life, "was made a little lower than the angels," according to
          Heb. 2:9. But because Christ was both wayfarer and comprehensor, He
          did not need to be instructed by angels, as regards knowledge of
          Divine things. The Mother of God, however, was not yet in the state of
          comprehension: and therefore she had to be instructed by angels
          concerning the Divine Conception.<br />

          As Augustine says in a sermon on the Assumption (De Assump. B.V.M.
          [*Work of another author: among the works of St. Augustine]) a true
          estimation of the Blessed Virgin excludes her from certain general
          rules. For "neither did she 'multiply her conceptions' nor was she
          'under man's, i.e. her husband's,' power (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++3%3A16"
            >Gn. 3:16</a
          >), who in her spotless womb conceived Christ of the Holy Ghost."
          Therefore it was fitting that she should be informed of the mystery of
          the Incarnation by means not of a man, but of an angel. For this
          reason it was made known to her before Joseph: since the message was
          brought to her before she conceived, but to Joseph after she had
          conceived.<br />

          As may be gathered from the passage quoted from Dionysius, the angels
          were acquainted with the mystery of the Incarnation: and yet they put
          this question, being desirous that Christ should give them more
          perfect knowledge of the details of this mystery, which are
          incomprehensible to any created intellect. Thus Maximus [*Maximus of
          Constantinople] says that "there can be no question that the angels

          Some say that Gabriel was of the highest order; because Gregory says
          (Hom. de Centum Ovibus [*34 in Evang.]): "It was right that one of the
          highest angels should come, since his message was most sublime." But
          this does nat imply that he was of the highest order of all, but in
          regard to the angels: since he was an archangel. Thus the Church calls
          him an archangel, and Gregory himself in a homily (De Centum Ovibus
          34) says that "those are called archangels who announce sublime
          things." It is therefore sufficiently credible that he was the highest
          of the archangels. And, as Gregory says (De Centum Ovibus 34), this
          name agrees with his office: for "Gabriel means 'Power of God.' This
          message therefore was fittingly brought by the 'Power of God,' because
          the Lord of hosts and mighty in battle was coming to overcome the
          powers of the air."<br />

          apparuit, non ita excellentem apparitionem habuit sicut beata virgo.

          The imagination is indeed a higher power than the exterior sense: but
          because the senses are the principle of human knowledge, the greatest
          certainty is in them, for the principles of knowledge must needs
          always be most certain. Consequently Joseph, to whom the angel
          appeared in his sleep, did not have so excellent a vision as the
          Blessed Virgin.<br />

          Ad tertium dicendum quod, sicut Ambrosius dicit, super Luc.,
          perturbamur et a nostro alienamur affectu, quando restringimur
          alicuius superioris potestatis occursu. Et hoc non solum contingit in
          visione corporali, sed etiam in visione imaginaria. Unde Gen. XV
          dicitur quod, cum sol occubuisset, sopor irruit super Abraham, et
          horror magnus et tenebrosus invasit eum. Talis tamen perturbatio
          hominis non tantum homini nocet ut propter eam debeat angelica
          apparitio praetermitti. Primo quidem, quia ex hoc ipso quod homo supra
          seipsum elevatur, quod ad eius pertinet dignitatem, pars eius inferior
          debilitatur, ex quo provenit perturbatio praedicta, sicut etiam,
          calore naturali ad interiora reducto, exteriora tremunt. Secundo quia,
          sicut Origenes dicit, super Luc., Angelus apparens, sciens hanc esse
          humanam naturam, primum perturbationi humanae medetur. Unde tam
          Zachariae quam Mariae, post turbationem, dixit, ne timeas. Et propter
          hoc, ut legitur in vita Antonii, non difficilis est bonorum spirituum
          malorumque discretio. Si enim post timorem successerit gaudium, a

          As Ambrose says on Lk. 1:11: "We are disturbed, and lose our presence
          of mind, when we are confronted by the presence of a superior power."
          And this happens not only in bodily, but also in imaginary vision.
          Wherefore it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++15%3A12"
            >Gn. 15:12</a
          >) that "when the sun was setting, a deep sleep fell upon Abram, and a
          great and darksome horror seized upon him." But by being thus
          disturbed man is not harmed to such an extent that therefore he ought
          to forego the vision of an angel. First because from the very fact
          that man is raised above himself, in which matter his dignity is
          concerned, his inferior powers are weakened; and from this results the
          aforesaid disturbance: thus, also, when the natural heat is drawn
          within a body, the exterior parts tremble. Secondly, because, as
          Origen says (Hom. iv in Luc.): "The angel who appeared, knowing hers
          was a human nature, first sought to remedy the disturbance of mind to
          which a man is subject." Wherefore both to Zachary and to Mary, as
          soon as they were disturbed, he said: "Fear not." For this reason, as
          we read in the life of Anthony, "it is difficult to discern good from
          evil spirits. For if joy succeed fear, we should know that the help is
          from the Lord: because security of soul is a sign of present majesty.
          But if the fear with which we are stricken persevere, it is an enemy
          that we see."<br />

          matter of such moment. This he did by greeting her by a new and
          unwonted salutation. Wherefore Origen says, commenting on Luke (Hom.
          vi), that if "she had known that similar words had been addressed to
          anyone else, she, who had knowledge of the Law, would never have been
          astonished at the seeming strangeness of the salutation." In which
          salutation he began by asserting her worthiness of the conception, by
          saying, "Full of grace"; then he announced the conception in the
          words, "The Lord is with thee"; and then foretold the honor which
          would result to her therefrom, by saying, "Blessed art thou among
