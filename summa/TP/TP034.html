          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus non fuerit
          sanctificatus in primo instanti suae conceptionis. Dicitur enim I Cor.
          XV, non prius quod spirituale est, sed quod animale, deinde quod
          spirituale. Sed sanctificatio gratiae pertinet ad spiritualitatem. Non
          ergo statim a principio suae conceptionis Christus percepit gratiam
          sanctificationis, sed post aliquod spatium temporis.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was not
          sanctified in the first instant of His conception. For it is written
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A46"
            >1 Cor. 15:46</a
          >): "That was not first which is spiritual, but that which is natural:
          afterwards that which is spiritual." But sanctification by grace is
          something spiritual. Therefore Christ received the grace of
          sanctification, not at the very beginning of His conception, but after
          a space of time.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, sanctificatio videtur esse a peccato, secundum illud I
              Cor. VI, et hoc quidem fuistis aliquando, scilicet peccatores, sed
              abluti estis, sed sanctificati estis. Sed in Christo nunquam fuit
              peccatum. Ergo non convenit sibi sanctificari per gratiam.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sanctification seems to be a
              cleansing from sin: according to 1 Cor. 6:1: "And such some of you
              were," namely, sinners, "but you are washed, but you are
              sanctified." But sin was never in Christ. Therefore it was not
              becoming that He should be sanctified by grace.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, sicut per verbum Dei omnia facta sunt, ita per
                  verbum incarnatum sunt omnes homines sanctificati qui
                  sanctificantur, Heb. II, qui sanctificat et qui sanctificantur
                  ex uno omnes. Sed verbum Dei, per quod facta sunt omnia, non
                  est factum, ut Augustinus dicit, in I de Trin. Ergo Christus,
                  per quem sanctificantur omnes, non est sanctificatus.

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, as by the Word of God "all
                  things were made," so from the Word incarnate all men who are
                  made holy receive holiness, according to Heb. 2:11: "Both he
                  that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one."
                  But "the Word of God, by whom all things were made, was not
                  Himself made"; as Augustine says (De Trin. i). Therefore
                  Christ, by whom all are made holy, was not Himself made
                  holy.<br />

                                  He was not always thus sanctified by grace:
                                  yet He was not made holy from being a sinner,
                                  because He never sinned; but He was made holy
                                  from not-holy as man, not indeed by privation,
                                  as though He were at some time a man and not
                                  holy; but by negation---that is, when He was
                                  not man He had not human sanctity. Therefore
                                  at the same time He was made man and a holy
                                  man. For this reason the angel said (<a

                                  Which words Gregory expounds as follows
                                  (Moral. xviii): "In order to show the
                                  distinction between His holiness and ours, it
                                  is declared that He shall be born holy. For
                                  we, though we are made holy, yet are not born
                                  holy, because by the mere condition of a
                                  corruptible nature we are tied... But He alone
                                  is truly born holy who... was not conceived by
                                  the combining of carnal union."<br />

              the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii) that choice is "the desire of
              what has been previously the object of deliberation." Therefore it

                  free-will is an act of the will and the reason or intellect.
                  But the act of the intellect presupposes an act of the senses;

                            href="TP034.html#TPQ34A1THEP1"

                          >), spiritual perfection was becoming to the human
                          nature which Christ took, which perfection He attained
                          not by making progress, but by receiving it from the
                          very first. Now ultimate perfection does not consist
                          in power or habit, but in operation; wherefore it is
                          said (De Anima ii, text. 5) that operation is a
                          "second act." We must, therefore, say that in the
                          first instant of His conception Christ had that
                          operation of the soul which can be had in an instant.
                          And such is the operation of the will and intellect,
                          in which the use of free-will consists. For the
                          operation of the intellect and will is sudden and
                          instantaneous, much more, indeed, than corporeal
                          vision; inasmuch as to understand, to will, and to
                          feel, are not movements that may be described as "acts
                          of an imperfect being," which attains perfection
                          successively, but are "the acts of an already perfect
                          being," as is said, De Anima iii, text. 28. We must
                          therefore say that Christ had the use of free-will in
                          the first instant of His conception.<br />

                              the same time the agent has perfect existence, and
                              begins to act unless it is hindered. Thus fire, as

                              light. The action of heating, however, is not
                              terminated in an instant, but continues for a
                              time; whereas the action of giving light is
                              perfected in an instant. And such an operation is
                              the use of free-will, as stated above.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ could not merit
          in the first instant of His conception. For the free-will bears the
          same relation to merit as to demerit. But the devil could not sin in
          the first instant of his creation, as was shown in the FP, Question
          [63], Article [5]. Therefore neither could Christ's soul merit in the
          first instant of its creation---that is, in the first instant of
          Christ's conception.<br />

              not merit by what is natural to us, as is clear from what has been
              said in the FS, Question [109], Article [5]; FS, Question [114],
              Article [2]. Therefore it seems that the use of free-will, which

                  that he cannot merit the same thing again: for no one merits
                  what is already his. If, therefore, Christ merited in the

                  merited nothing. But this is evidently untrue. Therefore

                          instant of His conception. Now, sanctification is
                          twofold: that of adults who are sanctified in
                          consideration of their own act; and that of infants
                          who are sanctified in consideration of, not their own
                          act of faith, but that of their parents or of the
                          Church. The former sanctification is more perfect than
                          the latter: just as act is more perfect than habit;
                          and "that which is by itself, than that which is by
                          another" [*Aristotle, Phys. viii]. Since, therefore,
                          the sanctification of Christ was most perfect, because
                          He was so sanctified that He might sanctify others;
                          consequently He was sanctified by reason of His own
                          movement of the free-will towards God. Which movement,
                          indeed, of the free-will is meritorious. Consequently,
                          Christ did merit in the first instant of His
                          conception.<br />

                              exception to nature." Therefore the free-will of a
                              creature can be moved to good meritoriously in the

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As appears from what was
                          said above (<a href="TP034.html#TPQ34A3THEP1"
                            >Article [3]</a
                          >), it was unbecoming that in His conception Christ
                          should receive merely habitual grace without the act.
                          Now, He received grace "not by measure" (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A34"
                            >Jn. 3:34</a
                          >), as stated above (<a href="TP007.html#TPQ7OUTP1"
                            >Question [7]</a
                          >,
                          <a href="TP007.html#TPQ7A11THEP1">Article [11]</a>).
                          But the grace of the "wayfarer," being short of that
                          of the "comprehensor," is in less measure than that of
                          the comprehensor. Wherefore it is manifest that in the
                          first instant of His conception Christ received not
                          only as much grace as comprehensors have, but also
                          greater than that which they all have. And because
                          that grace was not without its act, it follows that He
                          was a comprehensor in act, seeing God in His Essence
                          more clearly than other creatures.<br />
