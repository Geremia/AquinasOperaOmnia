          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christi nativitas debuerit
          omnibus esse manifesta. Impletio enim debet promissioni respondere.
          Sed de promissione adventus Christi dicitur in Psalmo, Deus manifeste
          veniet. Venit autem per carnis nativitatem. Ergo videtur quod eius

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's birth should
          have been made known to all. Because fulfilment should correspond to
          promise. Now, the promise of Christ's coming is thus expressed (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++49%3A3"
            >Ps. 49:3</a
          >): "God shall come manifestly. But He came by His birth in the
          flesh." Therefore it seems that His birth should have been made known
          to the whole world.<br />

              Praeterea, I ad Tim. I dicitur, Christus in hunc mundum venit
              peccatores salvos facere. Sed hoc non fit nisi inquantum eis
              gratia Christi manifestatur, secundum illud Tit. II, apparuit
              gratia salvatoris nostri Dei omnibus hominibus, erudiens nos ut,
              abnegantes impietatem et saecularia desideria, sobrie et pie et
              iuste vivamus in hoc saeculo. Ergo videtur quod Christi nativitas

                >1 Tim. 1:15</a
              >): "Christ came into this world to save sinners." But this is not
              effected save in as far as the grace of Christ is made known to
              them; according to Titus 2:11,12: "The grace of God our Saviour
              hath appeared to all men, instructing us, that denying ungodliness
              and worldly desires, we should live soberly, and justly, and godly
              in this world." Therefore it seems that Christ's birth should have
              been made known to all.<br />

                  secundum illud Psalmi, miserationes eius super omnia opera
                  eius. Sed in secundo adventu, quo iustitias iudicabit, veniet
                  omnibus manifestus, secundum illud Matth. XXIV, sicut fulgur
                  exit ab oriente et paret usque in occidentem, ita erit
                  adventus filii hominis. Ergo multo magis primus, quo natus est

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God is most especially
                  inclined to mercy; according to Ps. 144:9: "His tender mercies
                  are over all His works." But in His second coming, when He
                  will "judge justices" (<a

                    >Ps. 70:3</a
                  >), He will come before the eyes of all; according to Mt.
                  24:27: "As lightning cometh out of the east, and appeareth
                  even into the west, so shall also the coming of the Son of Man
                  be." Much more, therefore, should His first coming, when He
                  was born into the world according to the flesh, have been made
                  known to all.<br />

                                  become true man? And while He is doing all

                                              himself as the devil in Herod. For
                                              Herod thought Him to be a man, but
                                              the devil thought Him to be God.
                                              Each feared a successor to his
                                              kingdom: the devil, a heavenly

                                              needless: since Christ had not
                                              come to set up an earthly kingdom,
                                              as Pope Leo says, addressing
                                              himself to Herod: "Thy palace
                                              cannot hold Christ: nor is the
                                              Lord of the world content with the
                                              paltry power of thy scepter." That
                                              the Jews were troubled, who, on
                                              the contrary, should have

          manifestaretur Iudaeis quam gentilibus. Ergo videtur quod multo minus

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those to whom Christ's
          birth was made known were not suitably chosen. For our Lord (<a

            >Mt. 10:5</a
          >) commanded His disciples, "Go ye not into the way of the Gentiles,"
          so that He might be made known to the Jews before the Gentiles.
          Therefore it seems that much less should Christ's birth have been at
          once revealed to the Gentiles who "came from the east," as stated Mt.
          2:1.<br />

              the Magi seem to be God's foes; for it is written (Lev. 19:31):
              "Go not aside after wizards [magi], neither ask anything of
              soothsayers." Therefore Christ's birth should not have been made

                                  sorts and conditions of men: because, as it is
                                  written (Col. 3:11), in Christ "there is
                                  neither male nor female, [*These words are in
                                  reality from Gal. 3:28] neither Gentile nor
                                  Jew... bond nor free," and so forth. And in
                                  order that this might be foreshadowed in
                                  Christ's birth, He was made known to men of
                                  all conditions. Because, as Augustine says in
                                  a sermon on the Epiphany (32 de Temp.), "the
                                  shepherds were Israelites, the Magi were
                                  Gentiles. The former were nigh to Him, the

                                  together as to the cornerstone." There was
                                  also another point of contrast: for the Magi
                                  were wise and powerful; the shepherds simple
                                  and lowly. He was also made known to the

                                              beginning of faith came from the

                                              faith is the light of the soul."
                                              Or, "because all who come to
                                              Christ come from Him and through
                                              Him": whence it is written (Zach.

                                              either because, as some say, they
                                              came from the farthest parts of
                                              the east, or because they came
                                              from the neighboring parts of
                                              Judea that lie to the east of the

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus per seipsum suam
          nativitatem manifestare debuerit. Causa enim quae est per se, semper
          est potior ea quae est per aliud, ut dicitur in VIII Physic. Sed
          Christus suam nativitatem manifestavit per alios, puta pastoribus per
          Angelos et, magis per stellam. Ergo multo magis per seipsum debuit
          suam nativitatem manifestare.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should have
          Himself made His birth known. For "a direct cause is always of greater
          power than an indirect cause," as is stated Phys. viii. But Christ
          made His birth known through others---for instance, to the shepherds
          through the angels, and to the Magi through the star. Much more,
          therefore, should He Himself have made His birth known.<br />

              Praeterea, Eccli. XX dicitur, sapientia abscondita, et thesaurus
              invisus, quae utilitas in utrisque? Sed Christus a principio
              conceptionis suae plene habuit sapientiae et gratiae thesaurum.
              Nisi ergo hanc plenitudinem manifestasset per opera et verba,
              fuisset frustra ei data sapientia et gratia. Quod est
              inconveniens, quia Deus et natura nihil frustra facit, ut dicitur
              in I de caelo.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (Ecclus. 20:32):
              "Wisdom that is hid and treasure that is not seen; what profit is
              there in them both?" But Christ had, to perfection, the treasure
              of wisdom and grace from the beginning of His conception.
              Therefore, unless He had made the fulness of these gifts known by
              words and deeds, wisdom and grace would have been given Him to no
              purpose. But this is unreasonable: because "God and nature do
              nothing without a purpose" (De Coelo i).<br />

                      from the generality of human infants." But other infants
                      do not make themselves known. Therefore it was not fitting

                          It behooved, therefore, Christ's birth to be made
                          known in such a way that the proof of His Godhead
                          should not be prejudicial to faith in His human
                          nature. But this took place while Christ presented a
                          likeness of human weakness, and yet, by means of God's
                          creatures, He showed the power of the Godhead in
                          Himself. Therefore Christ made His birth known, not by
                          Himself, but by means of certain other creatures.<br />

          spiritual substances, according to Ps. 103:4: "Who maketh His [Vulg.:
          'makest Thy'] angels, spirits." But Christ's birth was in the flesh,
          and not in His spiritual substance. Therefore it should not have been

                              domini. Pastoribus autem et magis, tanquam rebus
                              corporalibus deditis, manifestata est Christi
                              nativitas per apparitiones visibiles. Et quia
                              nativitas non erat pure terrena, sed quodammodo
                              caelestis, ideo per signa caelestia utrisque
                              nativitas Christi revelatur, ut enim Augustinus
                              dicit, in sermone de Epiphania, caelos Angeli
                              habitant, et sidera ornant, utrisque ergo caeli
                              enarrant gloriam Dei. Rationabiliter autem
                              pastoribus, tanquam Iudaeis, apud quos frequenter
                              factae sunt apparitiones Angelorum, revelata est
                              nativitas Christi per Angelos, magis autem,
                              assuetis in consideratione caelestium corporum,
                              manifestata est per signum stellae. Quia, ut
                              Chrysostomus dicit, per consueta eos dominus
                              vocare voluit, eis condescendens. Est autem et
                              alia ratio. Quia, ut Gregorius dicit, Iudaeis,
                              tanquam ratione utentibus, rationale animal, idest
                              Angelus, praedicare debuit. Gentiles vero, qui uti
                              ratione nesciebant ad cognoscendum Deum, non per
                              vocem, sed per signa perducuntur. Et sicut dominum
                              iam loquentem annuntiaverunt gentibus
                              praedicatores loquentes, ita eum nondum loquentem
                              elementa muta praedicaverunt. Est autem et alia
                              ratio. Quia, ut Augustinus dicit, in sermone
                              Epiphaniae, Abrahae innumerabilis erat promissa
                              successio non carnis semine, sed fidei fecunditate
                              generanda. Et ideo stellarum multitudini est
                              comparata, ut caelestis progenies speraretur. Et
                              ideo gentiles, in sideribus designati, ortu novi
                              sideris excitantur ut perveniant ad Christum, per
                              quem efficiuntur semen Abrahae.

                              <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As knowledge is
                              imparted through a syllogism from something which
                              we know better, so knowledge given by signs must
                              be conveyed through things which are familiar to
                              those to whom the knowledge is imparted. Now, it
                              is clear that the righteous have, through the
                              spirit of prophecy, a certain familiarity with the
                              interior instinct of the Holy Ghost, and are wont
                              to be taught thereby, without the guidance of
                              sensible signs. Whereas others, occupied with
                              material things, are led through the domain of the
                              senses to that of the intellect. The Jews,
                              however, were accustomed to receive Divine answers
                              through the angels; through whom they also
                              received the Law, according to Acts 7:53: "You
                              [Vulg.: 'who']... have received the Law by the
                              disposition of angels." And the Gentiles,
                              especially astrologers, were wont to observe the
                              course of the stars. And therefore Christ's birth
                              was made known to the righteous, viz. Simeon and
                              Anna, by the interior instinct of the Holy Ghost,
                              according to Lk. 2:26: "He had received an answer
                              from the Holy Ghost that he should not see death
                              before he had seen the Christ of the Lord." But to
                              the shepherds and Magi, as being occupied with
                              material things, Christ's birth was made known by
                              means of visible apparitions. And since this birth
                              was not only earthly, but also, in a way,
                              heavenly, to both (shepherds and Magi) it is
                              revealed through heavenly signs: for, as Augustine
                              says in a sermon on the Epiphany (cciv): "The
                              angels inhabit, and the stars adorn, the heavens:
                              by both, therefore, do the 'heavens show forth the
                              glory of God.'" Moreover, it was not without
                              reason that Christ's birth was made known, by
                              means of angels, to the shepherds, who, being
                              Jews, were accustomed to frequent apparitions of
                              the angels: whereas it was revealed by means of a
                              star to the Magi, who were wont to consider the
                              heavenly bodies. Because, as Chrysostom says (Hom.
                              vi in Matth.): "Our Lord deigned to call them
                              through things to which they were accustomed."
                              There is also another reason. For, as Gregory says
                              (Hom. x in Evang.): "To the Jews, as rational
                              beings, it was fitting that a rational animal
                              [*Cf. FP, Question [51], Article [1], ad 2]," viz.
                              an angel, "should preach. Whereas the Gentiles,
                              who were unable to come to the knowledge of God
                              through the reason, were led to God, not by words,
                              but by signs. And as our Lord, when He was able to
                              speak, was announced by heralds who spoke, so
                              before He could speak He was manifested by
                              speechless elements." Again, there is yet another
                              reason. For, as Augustine [*Pope Leo] says in a
                              sermon on the Epiphany: "To Abraham was promised
                              an innumerable progeny, begotten, not of carnal
                              propagation, but of the fruitfulness of faith. For
                              this reason it is compared to the multitude of
                              stars; that a heavenly progeny might be hoped
                              for." Wherefore the Gentiles, "who are thus
                              designated by the stars, are by the rising of a
                              new star stimulated" to seek Christ, through whom
                              they are made the seed of Abraham.<br />

                                          For, as Augustine says (Contra Faust.
                                          ii): "No astrologer has ever so far
                                          connected the stars with man's fate at
                                          the time of his birth as to assert
                                          that one of the stars, at the birth of
                                          any man, left its orbit and made its
                                          way to him who was just born": as
                                          happened in the case of the star which
                                          made known the birth of Christ.
                                          Consequently this does not corroborate
                                          the error of those who "think there is

                                          the course of the stars, for they do
                                          not hold that the course of the stars
                                          can be changed at a man's birth."<br />

          erant Christo per fidem, et maxime eius adventum desiderabant, unde
          dicitur Luc. II de Simeone quod erat homo iustus et timoratus,

          Christi nativitas Simeoni quam pastoribus et magis.

          known to them first who were nearest to Christ, and who longed for Him
          most; according to Wis. 6:14: "She preventeth them that covet her, so
          that she first showeth herself unto them." But the righteous were
          nearest to Christ by faith, and longed most for His coming; whence it

                  were two years in coming to Christ after His birth. It was
                  therefore unbecoming that Christ should be made known to the

                          departed from them into heaven they [Vulg.: 'the
                          shepherds'] said one to another: Let us go over to
                          Bethlehem... and they came with haste." Second in
                          order were the Magi, who came to Christ on the
                          thirteenth day after His birth, on which day is kept
                          the feast of the Epiphany. For if they had come after
                          a year, or even two years, they would not have found
                          Him in Bethlehem, since it is written (<a

                          to the law of the Lord"---that is to say, after they
                          had offered up the Child Jesus in the Temple---"they
                          returned into Galilee, to their city"---namely,
                          "Nazareth." In the third place, it was made known in
                          the Temple to the righteous on the fortieth day after
                          His birth, as related by Luke (2:22).<br />

                              The reason of this order is that the shepherds
                              represent the apostles and other believers of the
                              Jews, to whom the faith of Christ was made known

                              faith of Christ came to the "fulness of the
                              Gentiles"; and this is foreshadowed in the Magi.
                              Thirdly it came to the fulness of the Jews, which
                              is foreshadowed in the righteous. Wherefore also
                              Christ was manifested to them in the Jewish

                                              dicit, in quodam sermone
                                              innocentum, timebat ne puer cui
                                              sidera famulantur, speciem suam

                                              But others say that the star first
                                              appeared when Christ was born, and
                                              that the Magi set off as soon as
                                              they saw the star, and
                                              accomplished a journey of very
                                              great length in thirteen days,
                                              owing partly to the Divine
                                              assistance, and partly to the
                                              fleetness of the dromedaries. And
                                              I say this on the supposition that
                                              they came from the far east. But
                                              others, again, say that they came
                                              from a neighboring country, whence
                                              also was Balaam, to whose teaching
                                              they were heirs; and they are said
                                              to have come from the east,
                                              because their country was to the
                                              east of the country of the Jews.
                                              In this case Herod killed the
                                              babes, not as soon as the Magi
                                              departed, but two years after: and
                                              that either because he is said to
                                              have gone to Rome in the meanwhile
                                              on account of an accusation
                                              brought against him, or because he
                                              was troubled at some imminent
                                              peril, and for the time being
                                              desisted from his anxiety to slay
                                              the child, or because he may have
                                              thought that the Magi, "being
                                              deceived by the illusory
                                              appearance of the star, and not
                                              finding the child, as they had
                                              expected to, were ashamed to
                                              return to him": as Augustine says
                                              (De Consensu Evang. ii). And the
                                              reason why he killed not only
                                              those who were two years old, but
                                              also the younger children, would
                                              be, as Augustine says in a sermon
                                              on the Innocents, because he
                                              feared lest a child whom the stars
                                              obey, might make himself appear
                                              older or younger.<br />

    Whether the star which appeared to the Magi belonged to the heavenly

          Ad septimum sic proceditur. Videtur quod stella quae magis apparuit,
          fuerit una de caelestibus stellis. Dicit enim Augustinus, in quodam
          sermone Epiphaniae, dum pendet ad ubera et vilium patitur Deus
          involumenta pannorum, repente novum de caelo sidus effulsit. Fuit

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the star which appeared
          to the Magi belonged to the heavenly system. For Augustine says in a
          sermon on the Epiphany (cxxii): "While God yet clings to the breast,
          and suffers Himself to be wrapped in humble swaddling clothes,
          suddenly a new star shines forth in the heavens." Therefore the star
          which appeared to the Magi belonged to the heavenly system.<br />

              Praeterea, Augustinus dicit, in sermone quodam Epiphaniae,
              pastoribus Angeli, magis stella Christum demonstrat. Utrisque
              loquitur lingua caelorum, quia lingua cessaverat prophetarum. Sed
              Angeli pastoribus apparentes fuerunt vere de caelestibus Angelis.
              Ergo et stella magis apparens fuit vere de caelestibus stellis.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says in a sermon on
              the Epiphany (cci): "Christ was made known to the shepherds by
              angels, to the Magi by a star. A heavenly tongue speaks to both,
              because the tongue of the prophets spoke no longer." But the
              angels who appeared to the shepherds were really angels from
              heaven. Therefore also the star which appeared to the Magi was
              really a star from the heavens.<br />

                  regum, sed magis sunt indicia mortis eorum. Sed illa stella
                  designabat regis nativitatem, unde magi dicunt, Matth. II, ubi
                  est qui natus est rex Iudaeorum? Vidimus enim stellam eius in

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, stars which are not in the
                  heavens but in the air are called comets, which do not appear
                  at the birth of kings, but rather are signs of their
                  approaching death. But this star was a sign of the King's
                  birth: wherefore the Magi said (<a

                      virgin in childbirth."<br />

                          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut Chrysostomus dicit,
                          super Matth., quod illa stella quae magis apparuit non
                          fuerit una caelestium stellarum, multipliciter
                          manifestum est. Primo quidem, quia nulla alia
                          stellarum hac via incedit. Haec enim stella ferebatur
                          a Septentrione in meridiem, ita enim iacet Iudaea ad
                          Persidem, unde magi venerunt. Secundo, apparet hoc ex
                          tempore. Non enim solum apparebat in nocte, sed etiam
                          in media die. Quod non est virtutis stellae, sed nec
                          etiam lunae. Tertio, quia quandoque apparebat et
                          quandoque occultabatur. Cum enim intraverunt
                          Ierosolymam, occultavit seipsam, deinde, ubi Herodem
                          reliquerunt, monstravit seipsam. Quarto, quia non
                          habebat continuum motum, sed, cum oportebat ire magos,
                          ibat; quando autem oportebat stare, stabat; sicut et
                          de columna nubis erat in deserto. Quinto, quia non
                          sursum manens partum virginis demonstrabat, sed
                          deorsum descendens hoc faciebat. Dicitur enim Matth.
                          II quod stella quam viderant in oriente, antecedebat
                          eos, usque dum veniens staret supra ubi erat puer. Ex
                          quo patet quod verbum magorum dicentium, vidimus
                          stellam eius in oriente, non est sic intelligendum
                          quasi ipsis in oriente positis stella apparuerit
                          existens in terra Iuda, sed quia viderunt eam in
                          oriente existentem, et praecessit eos usque in Iudaeam
                          (quamvis hoc a quibusdam sub dubio relinquatur). Non
                          autem potuisset distincte domum demonstrare nisi esset
                          terrae vicina. Et, sicut ipse dicit, hoc non videtur
                          proprium esse stellae, sed virtutis cuiusdam
                          rationalis. Unde videtur quod haec stella virtus
                          invisibilis fuisset in talem apparentiam transformata.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Chrysostom says (Hom.
                          vi in Matth.), it is clear, for many reasons, that the
                          star which appeared to the Magi did not belong to the
                          heavenly system. First, because no other star
                          approaches from the same quarter as this star, whose
                          course was from north to south, these being the
                          relative positions of Persia, whence the Magi came,
                          and Judea. Secondly, from the time [at which it was
                          seen]. For it appeared not only at night, but also at
                          midday: and no star can do this, not even the moon.
                          Thirdly, because it was visible at one time and hidden
                          at another. For when they entered Jerusalem it hid
                          itself: then, when they had left Herod, it showed
                          itself again. Fourthly, because its movement was not
                          continuous, but when the Magi had to continue their
                          journey the star moved on; when they had to stop the
                          star stood still; as happened to the pillar of a cloud
                          in the desert. Fifthly, because it indicated the
                          virginal Birth, not by remaining aloft, but by coming
                          down below. For it is written (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++2%3A9"
                            >Mt. 2:9</a
                          >) that "the star which they had seen in the east went
                          before them, until it came and stood over where the
                          child was." Whence it is evident that the words of the
                          Magi, "We have seen His star in the east," are to be
                          taken as meaning, not that when they were in the east
                          the star appeared over the country of Judea, but that
                          when they saw the star it was in the east, and that it
                          preceded them into Judea (although this is considered
                          doubtful by some). But it could not have indicated the
                          house distinctly, unless it were near the earth. And,
                          as he [Chrysostom] observes, this does not seem
                          fitting to a star, but "of some power endowed with
                          reason." Consequently "it seems that this was some
                          invisible force made visible under the form of a
                          star."<br />

                              Wherefore some say that, as the Holy Ghost, after
                              our Lord's Baptism, came down on Him under the
                              form of a dove, so did He appear to the Magi under
                              the form of a star. While others say that the
                              angel who, under a human form, appeared to the
                              shepherds, under the form of a star, appeared to
                              the Magi. But it seems more probable that it was a
                              newly created star, not in the heavens, but in the
                              air near the earth, and that its movement varied
                              according to God's will. Wherefore Pope Leo says
                              in a sermon on the Epiphany (xxxi): "A star of
                              unusual brightness appeared to the three Magi in
                              the east, which, through being more brilliant and
                              more beautiful than the other stars, drew men's
                              gaze and attention: so that they understood at
                              once that such an unwonted event could not be

                                  born and died, none of them did the Magi seek
                                  to adore. And so they who came from a distant

                                      was to come, the Magi feared not the king
                                      who was actually present. They had not yet
                                      seen Christ, and they were already

                                          the Magi to the place where the Divine
                                          Infant was with His Virgin-Mother
                                          could bring them to the town of

                                          Yet it hid itself until the Jews also
                                          bore testimony of the city in which
                                          Christ was to be born: so that, being
                                          encouraged by a twofold witness," as
                                          Pope Leo says (Serm. xxxiv), "they
                                          might seek with more ardent faith Him,
                                          whom both the brightness of the star
                                          and the authority of prophecy
                                          revealed." Thus they "proclaim" that
                                          Christ is born, and "inquire where;
                                          they believe and ask, as it were,
                                          betokening those who walk by faith and
                                          desire to see," as Augustine says in a
                                          sermon on the Epiphany (cxcix). But
                                          the Jews, by indicating to them the
                                          place of Christ's birth, "are like the
                                          carpenters who built the Ark of Noe,
                                          who provided others with the means of
                                          escape, and themselves perished in the
                                          flood. Those who asked, heard and went
                                          their way: the teachers spoke and
                                          stayed where they were; like the
                                          milestones that point out the way but
                                          walk not" (Augustine, Serm. cclxxiii).
                                          It was also by God's will that, when
                                          they no longer saw the star, the Magi,
                                          by human instinct, went to Jerusalem,
                                          to seek in the royal city the new-born
                                          King, in order that Christ's birth
                                          might be publicly proclaimed first in
                                          Jerusalem, according to Is. 2:3: "The
                                          Law shall come forth from Sion, and
                                          the Word of the Lord from Jerusalem";
                                          and also "in order that by the zeal of
                                          the Magi who came from afar, the
                                          indolence of the Jews who lived near

                                          condemnation" (Remig., Hom. in Matth.

                                              nec munera obtulissent. Nunc
                                              autem, quia caelestem regem
                                              quaerebant, etsi nihil regalis
                                              excellentiae in eo viderunt,
                                              tamen, solius stellae testimonio
                                              contenti, adoraverunt, vident enim
                                              hominem, et agnoscunt Deum. Et
                                              offerunt munera dignitati Christi
                                              congruentia, aurum quidem, quasi
                                              regi magno; thus, quod in Dei
                                              sacrificio ponitur immolant ut
                                              Deo; myrrha, qua mortuorum corpora
                                              condiuntur, praebetur tanquam pro
                                              salute omnium morituro. Et, ut
                                              Gregorius dicit, instruimur ut
                                              nato regi aurum, per quod
                                              significatur sapientia, offeramus,
                                              in conspectu eius sapientiae
                                              lumine splendentes; thus autem,
                                              per quod exprimitur orationis
                                              devotio, offerimus Deo si per
                                              orationum studia Deo redolere
                                              valeamus; myrrham, quae significat
                                              mortificationem carnis, offerimus
                                              si carnis vitia per abstinentiam
                                              mortificamus.

                                              As Chrysostom says (Hom. ii in
                                              Matth. [*From the supposititious
                                              Opus Imperfectum]): "If the Magi
                                              had come in search of an earthly
                                              King, they would have been
                                              disconcerted at finding that they
                                              had taken the trouble to come such
                                              a long way for nothing.
                                              Consequently they would have
                                              neither adored nor offered gifts.
                                              But since they sought a heavenly
                                              King, though they found in Him no
                                              signs of royal pre-eminence, yet,
                                              content with the testimony of the
                                              star alone, they adored: for they
                                              saw a man, and they acknowledged a
                                              God." Moreover, they offer gifts
                                              in keeping with Christ's
                                              greatness: "gold, as to the great
                                              King; they offer up incense as to
                                              God, because it is used in the
                                              Divine Sacrifice; and myrrh, which
                                              is used in embalming the bodies of
                                              the dead, is offered as to Him who
                                              is to die for the salvation of
                                              all" (Gregory, Hom. x in Evang.).
                                              And hereby, as Gregory says (Hom.
                                              x in Evang.), we are taught to
                                              offer gold, "which signifies
                                              wisdom, to the new-born King, by
                                              the luster of our wisdom in His
                                              sight." We offer God incense,
                                              "which signifies fervor in prayer,
                                              if our constant prayers mount up
                                              to God with an odor of sweetness";
                                              and we offer myrrh, "which
                                              signifies mortification of the
                                              flesh, if we mortify the ill-deeds
                                              of the flesh by refraining from
                                              them."<br />
