          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ should not have
          worked miracles. For Christ's deeds should have been consistent with
          His words. But He Himself said (<a

          sign shall not be given it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet."

          53:3: "A man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity." But the

          Respondeo dicendum quod divinitus conceditur homini miracula facere,
          propter duo. Primo quidem, et principaliter, ad confirmandam veritatem
          quam aliquis docet. Quia enim ea quae sunt fidei humanam rationem
          excedunt, non possunt per rationes humanas probari, sed oportet quod
          probentur per argumentum divinae virtutis, ut, dum aliquis facit opera
          quae solus Deus facere potest, credantur ea quae dicuntur esse a Deo;
          sicut, cum aliquis defert litteras anulo regis signatas, creditur ex

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God enables man to work miracles for two
          reasons. First and principally, in confirmation of the doctrine that a
          man teaches. For since those things which are of faith surpass human
          reason, they cannot be proved by human arguments, but need to be
          proved by the argument of Divine power: so that when a man does works
          that God alone can do, we may believe that what he says is from God:
          just as when a man is the bearer of letters sealed with the king's
          ring, it is to be believed that what they contain expresses the king's
          will.<br />

          sancti, ut dum scilicet homo facit opera Dei, credatur Deus habitare

          Secondly, in order to make known God's presence in a man by the grace
          of the Holy Ghost: so that when a man does the works of God we may
          believe that God dwells in him by His grace. Wherefore it is written
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A5"
            >Gal. 3:5</a

          quod eius supernaturalis doctrina esset a Deo. Et ideo
          convenientissimum fuit ut miracula faceret. Unde ipse dicit, Ioan. X,
          si mihi non vultis credere, operibus credite. Et Ioan. V, opera quae

          of union: and that His supernatural doctrine was from God. And
          therefore it was most fitting that He should work miracles. Wherefore

          Miracles lessen the merit of faith in so far as those are shown to be
          hard of heart who are unwilling to believe what is proved from the
          Scriptures unless (they are convinced) by miracles. Yet it is better
          for them to be converted to the faith even by miracles than that they
          should remain altogether in their unbelief. For it is written (1 Cor.
          14:22) that signs are given "to unbelievers," viz. that they may be
          converted to the faith.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut in prima parte habitum est, vera
          miracula sola virtute divina fieri possunt, quia solus Deus potest
          mutare naturae ordinem, quod pertinet ad rationem miraculi. Unde Leo
          Papa dicit, in epistola ad Flavianum, quod, cum in Christo sint duae
          naturae, una earum est, scilicet divina, quae fulget miraculis;
          altera, scilicet humana, quae succumbit iniuriis; et tamen una earum
          agit cum communicatione alterius, inquantum scilicet humana natura est
          instrumentum divinae actionis, et actio humana virtutem accepit a

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> as stated in the FP, Question [110],
          Article [4], true miracles cannot be wrought save by Divine power:
          because God alone can change the order of nature; and this is what is
          meant by a miracle. Wherefore Pope Leo says (Ep. ad Flav. xxviii)
          that, while there are two natures in Christ, there is "one," viz. the
          Divine, which shines forth in miracles; and "another," viz. the human,
          "which submits to insults"; yet "each communicates its actions to the
          other": in as far as the human nature is the instrument of the Divine
          action, and the human action receives power from the Divine Nature, as

          Christ cast out demons otherwise than they are cast out by the power
          of demons. For demons are cast out from bodies by the power of higher
          demons in such a way that they retain their power over the soul: since
          the devil does not work against his own kingdom. On the other hand,
          Christ cast out demons, not only from the body, but still more from
          the soul. For this reason our Lord rebuked the blasphemy of the Jews,
          who said that He cast out demons by the power of the demons: first, by
          saying that Satan is not divided against himself; secondly, by quoting
          the instance of others who cast out demons by the Spirit of God;
          thirdly, because He could not have cast out a demon unless He had
          overcome Him by Divine power; fourthly, because there was nothing in
          common between His works and their effects and those of Satan; since
          Satan's purpose was to "scatter" those whom Christ "gathered" together

          Secundo, propter modum miracula faciendi, quia scilicet quasi propria
          potestate miracula faciebat, non autem orando, sicut alii. Unde
          dicitur Luc. VI, quod virtus de illo exibat et sanabat omnes. Per quod

          Secondly, as to the way in which He worked miracles---namely, because
          He worked miracles as though of His own power, and not by praying, as
          others do. Wherefore it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++6%3A19"
            >Lk. 6:19</a
          >) that "virtue went out from Him and healed all." Whereby it is
          proved, as Cyril says (Comment. in Lucam) that "He did not receive
          power from another, but, being God by nature, He showed His own power
          over the sick. And this is how He worked countless miracles." Hence on
          Mt. 8:16: "He cast out spirits with His word, and all that were sick
          He healed," Chrysostom says: "Mark how great a multitude of persons
          healed, the Evangelists pass quickly over, not mentioning one by
          one... but in one word traversing an unspeakable sea of miracles." And
          thus it was shown that His power was co-equal with that of God the
          Father, according to Jn. 5:19: "What things soever" the Father "doth,
          these the Son doth also in like manner"; and, again (<a

            >Jn. 5:21</a

          Ad primum ergo dicendum quod haec erat obiectio gentilium. Unde

          Iesum prophetaverunt, et ei gloriam magnam dederunt. Qui propterea
          talia et ipse facere voluit, ne esset absurdum, quod per illos
          fecerat, si ipse non faceret. Sed tamen et aliquid proprium facere

          factus est mundus? Sed nec maior mundus, nec isti aequalis in hoc

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This was the argument of the
          Gentiles. Wherefore Augustine says (Ep. ad Volusian. cxxxvii): "No
          suitable wonders; say they, show forth the presence of so great
          majesty, for the ghostly cleansing" whereby He cast out demons, "the
          cure of the sick, the raising of the dead to life, if other miracles
          be taken into account, are small things before God." To this Augustine
          answers thus: "We own that the prophets did as much... But even Moses
          himself and the other prophets made Christ the Lord the object of
          their prophecy, and gave Him great glory... He, therefore, chose to do
          similar things to avoid the inconsistency of failing to do what He had
          done through others. Yet still He was bound to do something which no
          other had done: to be born of a virgin, to rise from the dead, and to
          ascend into heaven. If anyone deem this a slight thing for God to do,
          I know not what more he can expect. Having become man, ought He to
          have made another world, that we might believe Him to be Him by whom
          the world was made? But in this world neither a greater world could be
          made nor one equal to it: and if He had made a lesser world in
          comparison with this, that too would have been deemed a small
          thing."<br />

          As to the miracles worked by others, Christ did greater still. Hence
          on Jn. 15:24: "If I had not done in [Douay: 'among'] them the works
          that no other men hath done," etc., Augustine says: "None of the works
          of Christ seem to be greater than the raising of the dead: which thing
          we know the ancient prophets also did... Yet Christ did some works
          'which no other man hath done.' But we are told in answer that others
          did works which He did not, and which none other did... But to heal
          with so great a power so many defects and ailments and grievances of
          mortal men, this we read concerning none soever of the men of old. To
          say nothing of those, each of whom by His bidding, as they came in His
          way, He made whole... Mark saith (6:56): 'Whithersoever He entered,
          into towns or into villages or into cities, they laid the sick in the
          streets, and besought Him that they might touch but the hem of His
          garment: and as many as touched Him were made whole.' These things
          none other did in them; for when He saith 'In them,' it is not to be
          understood to mean 'Among them,' or 'In their presence,' but wholly
          'In them,' because He healed them... Therefore whatever works He did
          in them are works that none ever did; since if ever any other man did
          any one of them, by His doing he did it; whereas these works He did,
          not by their doing, but by Himself."<br />

          Augustine explains this passage of John as follows (Tract. lxxi):
          "What are these 'greater works' which believers in Him would do? That,
          as they passed by, their very shadow healed the sick? For it is
          greater that a shadow should heal than the hem of a garment... When,
          however, He said these words, it was the deeds and works of His words
          that He spoke of: for when He said... 'The Father who abideth in Me,
          He doth the works,' what works did He mean, then, but the words He was
          speaking?... and the fruits of those same words was the faith of those
          (who believed): but when the disciples preached the Gospel, not some
          few like those, but the very nations believed... (Tract. lxxii). Did
          not that rich man go away from His presence sorrowful?... and yet
          afterwards, what one individual, having heard from Him, did not, that
          many did when He spake by the mouth of His disciples... Behold, He did
          greater works when spoken of by men believing than when speaking to
          men hearing. But there is yet this difficulty: that He did these
          'greater works' by the apostles: whereas He saith as meaning not only
          them:... 'He that believeth in Me'... Listen!... 'He that believeth in
          Me, the works that I do, he also shall do': first, 'I do,' then 'he
          also shall do,' because I do that he may do. What works---but that
          from ungodly he should be made righteous?... Which thing Christ
          worketh in him, truly, but not without him. Yes, I may affirm this to
          be altogether greater than to create" [*The words 'to create' are not
          in the text of St. Augustine] "heaven and earth... for 'heaven and
          earth shall pass away'; but the salvation and justification of the
          predestinate shall remain... But also in the heavens... the angels are
          the works of Christ: and does that man do greater works than these,
          who co-operates with Christ in the work of his justification?... let
          him, who can, judge whether it be greater to create a righteous being
          than to justify an ungodly one. Certainly if both are works of equal
