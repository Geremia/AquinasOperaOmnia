          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod in Christo sit tantum una
          operatio divinitatis et humanitatis. Dicit enim Dionysius, II cap. de
          Div. Nom., discreta autem est benignissima circa nos Dei operatio per
          hoc quod, secundum nos, ex nobis, integre vereque humanatum est verbum
          quod est supra substantiam, et operari et pati quaecumque humanae eius
          divinaeque operationi congruunt, ubi unam operationem nominat humanam
          et divinam, quae in Graeco dicitur theandrica, idest deivirilis.
          Videtur igitur esse una operatio composita in Christo.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there is but
          one operation of the Godhead and the Manhood. For Dionysius says (Div.
          Nom. ii): "The most loving operation of God is made manifest to us by
          the supersubstantial Word having taken flesh integrally and truly, and
          having operated and suffered whatsoever befits His human and Divine
          operation." But he here mentions only one human and Divine operation,
          which is written in Greek {theandrike}, i.e. God-manlike. Hence it
          seems that there is but one composite operation in Christ.<br />

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, principalis agentis et instrumenti est una sola
              operatio. Sed humana natura in Christo fuit instrumentum divinae,
              ut supra dictum est. Ergo eadem operatio est divinae et humanae
              naturae in Christo.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, there is but one operation of
              the principal and instrumental agent. Now the human nature in
              Christ was the instrument of the Divine, as was said above (<a

              the operations of the Divine and human natures in Christ are the
              same.<br />

                  Praeterea, cum in Christo duae naturae in una hypostasi vel
                  persona sint, necesse est unum et idem esse quod pertinet ad
                  hypostasim vel personam. Sed operatio pertinet ad hypostasim
                  vel personam, nihil enim operatur nisi suppositum subsistens;
                  unde et, secundum philosophum, actus sunt singularium. Ergo in
                  Christo est una et eadem operatio divinitatis et humanitatis.

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since in Christ there are
                  two natures in one hypostasis or person, whatever pertains to
                  the hypostasis or person is one and the same. But operation
                  pertains to the hypostasis or person, for it is only a
                  subsisting suppositum that operates; hence, according to the
                  Philosopher (Metaph. i, 1), acts belong to singulars. Hence in
                  Christ there is only one operation of the Godhead and the
                  Manhood.<br />

                      Christo unum esse, ut supra dictum est. Ergo et propter
                      eandem unitatem est in Christo una operatio.

                      account of the unity of hypostasis there is only one
                      operation of the Godhead and the (<a

                      Hence, on account of the same unity, there is one
                      operation in Christ.<br />

                          humanitatis, sicut sanatio leprosi, vel suscitatio
                          mortui. Ergo videtur quod in Christo sit una tantum

                          the healing of the lepers or the raising of the dead.
                          Hence it seems that in Christ there is but one

                                  Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum
                                  est, haeretici qui posuerunt in Christo unam
                                  voluntatem, posuerunt etiam in ipso unam
                                  operationem. Et ut eorum opinio erronea melius
                                  intelligatur, considerandum est quod,
                                  ubicumque sunt plura agentia ordinata,
                                  inferius movetur a superiori, sicut in homine
                                  corpus movetur ab anima, et inferiores vires a
                                  ratione. Sic igitur actiones et motus
                                  inferioris principii sunt magis operata
                                  quaedam quam operationes, id autem quod
                                  pertinet ad supremum principium, est proprie
                                  operatio. Puta si dicamus in homine quod
                                  ambulare, quod est pedum, et palpare, quod est
                                  manuum, sunt quaedam hominis operata, quorum
                                  unum operatur anima per pedes, aliud per
                                  manus, et quia est eadem anima operans per
                                  utrumque, ex parte ipsius operantis, quod est
                                  primum principium movens, est una et
                                  indifferens operatio; ex parte autem ipsorum
                                  operatorum differentia invenitur. Sicut autem
                                  in homine puro corpus movetur ab anima, et
                                  appetitus sensitivus a rationali, ita in
                                  domino Iesu Christo humana natura movebatur et
                                  regebatur a divina. Et ideo dicebant quod
                                  eadem est operatio et indifferens ex parte
                                  ipsius divinitatis operantis sunt tamen
                                  diversa operata, inquantum scilicet divinitas
                                  Christi aliud agebat per seipsam, sicut quod
                                  portabat omnia verbo virtutis suae; aliud
                                  autem per naturam humanam, sicut quod
                                  corporaliter ambulabat. Unde in sexta synodo
                                  inducuntur verba Severi haeretici sic
                                  dicentis, ea quae agebantur et operabantur ab
                                  uno Christo, multum differunt. Quaedam enim
                                  sunt Deo decibilia, quaedam humana. Veluti,
                                  corporaliter vadere super terram profecto
                                  humanum est, cruribus vero vexatis, et
                                  ambulare super terram penitus non valentibus,
                                  sanum gressum donare Deo decibile est. Sed
                                  unum, scilicet incarnatum verbum, hoc et illud
                                  operatum est et nequaquam hoc quidem huius,
                                  hoc vero huius est naturae. Neque, eo quod
                                  diversa sunt operamenta, ideo duas operatrices
                                  naturas atque formas iuste definiemus.

                                  in Christ placed one operation in Christ. Now
                                  in order better to understand their erroneous
                                  opinion, we must bear in mind that wherever
                                  there are several mutually ordained agents,
                                  the inferior is moved by the superior, as in
                                  man the body is moved by the soul and the
                                  lower powers by the reason. And thus the
                                  actions and movements of the inferior
                                  principle are things operated rather than
                                  operations. Now what pertains to the highest
                                  principle is properly the operation; thus we
                                  say of man that to walk, which belongs to the
                                  feet, and to touch, which belongs to the hand,
                                  are things operated by the man---one of which
                                  is operated by the soul through the feet, the
                                  other through the hands. And because it is the
                                  same soul that operates in both cases, there
                                  is only one indifferent operation, on the part
                                  of the thing operating, which is the first
                                  moving principle; but difference is found on
                                  the part of what is operated. Now, as in a
                                  mere man the body is moved by the soul, and
                                  the sensitive by the rational appetite, so in
                                  the Lord Jesus Christ the human nature is
                                  moved and ruled by the Divine. Hence they said
                                  that there is one indifferent operation on the
                                  part of the Godhead operating, but divers
                                  things operated, inasmuch as the Godhead of
                                  Christ did one thing by Itself, as to uphold
                                  all things by the word of His power---and
                                  another thing by His human nature, as to walk
                                  in body. Hence the Sixth Council [*Third
                                  Council of Constantinople, Act. 10] quotes the
                                  words of Severus the heretic, who said: "What
                                  things were done and wrought by the one
                                  Christ, differ greatly; for some are becoming
                                  to God, and some are human, as to walk bodily
                                  on the earth is indeed human, but to give hale
                                  steps to sickly limbs, wholly unable to walk
                                  on the ground, is becoming to God. Yet one,
                                  i.e. the Incarnate Word, wrought one and the
                                  other---neither was this from one nature, and
                                  that from another; nor can we justly affirm
                                  that because there are distinct things
                                  operated there are therefore two operating
                                  natures and forms."<br />

                                      But herein they were deceived, for what is
                                      moved by another has a twofold
                                      action---one which it has from its own
                                      form---the other, which it has inasmuch as
                                      it is moved by another; thus the operation
                                      of an axe of itself is to cleave; but
                                      inasmuch as it is moved by the craftsman,
                                      its operation is to make benches. Hence
                                      the operation which belongs to a thing by
                                      its form is proper to it, nor does it
                                      belong to the mover, except in so far as
                                      he makes use of this kind of thing for his
                                      work: thus to heat is the proper operation
                                      of fire, but not of a smith, except in so
                                      far as he makes use of fire for heating
                                      iron. But the operation which belongs to
                                      the thing, as moved by another, is not
                                      distinct from the operation of the mover;
                                      thus to make a bench is not the work of
                                      the axe independently of the workman.
                                      Hence, wheresoever the mover and the moved
                                      have different forms or operative
                                      faculties, there must the operation of the
                                      mover and the proper operation of the
                                      moved be distinct; although the moved
                                      shares in the operation of the mover, and
                                      the mover makes use of the operation of
                                      the moved, and, consequently, each acts in
                                      communion with the other.<br />

                                          Therefore in Christ the human nature
                                          has its proper form and power whereby
                                          it acts; and so has the Divine. Hence
                                          the human nature has its proper
                                          operation distinct from the Divine,
                                          and conversely. Nevertheless, the
                                          Divine Nature makes use of the
                                          operation of the human nature, as of

                                          in the same way the human nature
                                          shares in the operation of the Divine
                                          Nature, as an instrument shares in the

                                          operates what belongs to the Word, and
                                          the flesh carries out what belongs to

                                              But if there were only one
                                              operation of the Godhead and
                                              manhood in Christ, it would be
                                              necessary to say either that the
                                              human nature had not its proper
                                              form and power (for this could not
                                              possibly be said of the Divine),
                                              whence it would follow that in
                                              Christ there was only the Divine
                                              operation; or it would be
                                              necessary to say that from the
                                              Divine and human power there was
                                              made up one power. Now both of
                                              these are impossible. For by the
                                              first the human nature in Christ
                                              is supposed to be imperfect; and
                                              by the second a confusion of the
                                              natures is supposed. Hence it is
                                              with reason that the Sixth Council
                                              (Act. 18) condemned this opinion,
                                              and decreed as follows: "We
                                              confess two natural, indivisible,
                                              unconvertible, unconfused, and

                                                  by any confusion of the
                                                  operations or powers of both
                                                  natures, but inasmuch as His
                                                  Divine operation employs the
                                                  human, and His human operation
                                                  shares in the power of the
                                                  Divine. Hence, as he says in a
                                                  certain epistle (Ad Caium iv),
                                                  "what is of man He works
                                                  beyond man; and this is shown
                                                  by the Virgin conceiving
                                                  supernaturally and by the
                                                  unstable waters bearing up the
                                                  weight of bodily feet." Now it
                                                  is clear that to be begotten
                                                  belongs to human nature, and
                                                  likewise to walk; yet both
                                                  were in Christ supernaturally.
                                                  So, too, He wrought Divine
                                                  things humanly, as when He
                                                  healed the leper with a touch.
                                                  Hence in the same epistle he
                                                  adds: "He performed Divine
                                                  works not as God does, and
                                                  human works not as man does,

                                                      he adds: "He is truly the

          the angels by His intellective soul, even as other men do. Now the
          operations of a plant as plant and of an animal as animal are
          different. Therefore Christ as man has several operations.<br />

                          that man is what he is; that operation is called human
                          simply, which proceeds from the reason through the
                          will, which is the rational appetite. Now if there is
                          any operation in man which does not proceed from the
                          reason and the will, it is not simply a human
                          operation, but belongs to man by reason of some part
                          of human nature---sometimes by reason of the nature of
                          elementary bodies, as to be borne
                          downwards---sometimes by reason of the force of the
                          vegetative soul, as to be nourished, and to
                          grow---sometimes by reason of the sensitive part, as
                          to see and hear, to imagine and remember, to desire
                          and to be angry. Now between these operations there is
                          a difference. For the operations of the sensitive soul
                          are to some extent obedient to reason, and
                          consequently they are somewhat rational and human
                          inasmuch as they obey reason, as is clear from the
                          Philosopher (Ethic. i, 13). But the operations that
                          spring from the vegetative soul, or from the nature of
                          elemental bodies, are not subject to reason;
                          consequently they are nowise rational; nor simply
                          human, but only as regards a part of human nature. Now
                          it was said (<a href="TP019.html#TPQ19A1THEP1"

                          the operations of the inferior and of the superior
                          agent are distinct; but when the inferior agent acts
                          only as moved by the superior agent, then the
                          operation of the superior and the inferior agent is
                          one.<br />

                                          Powers and habits are diversified by
                                          comparison with their objects. Hence
                                          in this way the diversity of
                                          operations corresponds to the divers

          Ad tertium sic proceditur. Videtur quod actio humana Christi non
          potuit ei esse meritoria. Christus enim ante mortem fuit comprehensor,
          sicut et modo est. Sed comprehensoris non est mereri, caritas enim
          comprehensoris pertinet ad praemium beatitudinis, cum secundum eam
          attendatur fruitio; unde non videtur esse principium merendi, cum non
          sit idem meritum et praemium. Ergo Christus ante passionem non
          merebatur, sicut nec modo meretur.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the human action of
          Christ could not be meritorious to Him. For before His death Christ
          was a comprehensor even as He is now. But comprehensors do not merit:
          because the charity of the comprehensor belongs to the reward of
          beatitude, since fruition depends upon it. Hence it does not seem to
          be the principle of merit, since merit and reward are not the same.
          Therefore Christ before His passion did not merit, even as He does not
          merit now.<br />

              aeterna, quam alii homines per bona opera merentur. Non ergo
              Christus aliquid sibi mereri potuit, qui a principio fuit filius
              Dei.

              him. But because Christ is the Son of God by nature, the eternal
              inheritance is due to Him, which other men merit by their works.
              And hence Christ Who, from the beginning, was the Word of God,
              could not merit anything for Himself.<br />

                  Christ has the glory of the soul, whence, in the natural
                  course, flowed the glory of the body, as Augustine says (Ep.
                  ad Dios cxviii); though by a dispensation it was brought about
                  that in Christ the glory of the soul should not overflow to
                  the body. Hence Christ did not merit the glory of the body.<br />

                      of those who know Him. Hence it is promised as a reward to
                      such as love Christ that He will be manifested to them,
                      according to Jn. 14:21: "He that loveth Me, shall be loved

                              thing of oneself is more excellent than to have it
                              from another, for "what is of itself a cause is
                              always more excellent than what is a cause through
                              another," as is said Phys. viii, 5. Now a thing is
                              said to have, of itself, that of which it is to
                              some extent the cause. But of whatever good we
                              possess the first cause by authority is God; and
                              in this way no creature has any good of itself,
                              according to 1 Cor. 4:7: "What hast thou that thou
                              hast not received?" Nevertheless, in a secondary
                              manner anyone may be a cause, to himself, of
                              having certain good things, inasmuch as he
                              cooperates with God in the matter, and thus
                              whoever has anything by his own merit has it, in a
                              manner, of himself. Hence it is better to have a

                                  Et ideo dicendum est quod Christus gloriam
                                  corporis, et ea quae pertinent ad exteriorem
                                  eius excellentiam, sicut est ascensio,

                                  have by merit what others have by merit;

                                  merit. Hence He merited neither grace nor

                                  than the dignity of meriting, which pertains
                                  to the virtue of charity. Hence we must say
                                  that Christ had, by merit, the glory of His
                                  body and whatever pertained to His outward
                                  excellence, as His Ascension, veneration, and
                                  the rest. And thus it is clear that He could
                                  merit for Himself.<br />

                                      Fruition, which is an act of charity,
                                      pertains to the glory of the soul, which
                                      Christ did not merit. Hence if He merited
                                      by charity, it does not follow that the
                                      merit and the reward are the same. Nor did
                                      He merit by charity inasmuch as it was the
                                      charity of a comprehensor, but inasmuch as
                                      it was that of a wayfarer. For He was at
                                      once a wayfarer and a comprehensor, as was
                                      said above (<a

                                          Because by nature Christ is God and

                                          the lordship of all things are due to
                                          Him, as to the first and supreme Lord.

                                              there is an overflow of glory from
                                              the soul to the body, in keeping

                                              which he performs in the body, so

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus aliis mereri non
          potuit. Dicitur enim Ezech. XVIII, anima quae peccaverit ipsa
          morietur. Ergo, pari ratione, anima quae meretur ipsa remunerabitur.
          Non est ergo possibile quod Christus aliis meruerit.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ could not merit
          for others. For it is written (Ezech. 18:4): "The soul that sinneth,
          the same shall die." Hence, for a like reason, the soul that meriteth,
          the same shall be recompensed. Therefore it is not possible that
          Christ merited for others.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, de plenitudine gratiae Christi omnes accipiunt, ut
              dicitur Ioan. I. Sed alii homines, habentes gratiam Christi, non
              possunt aliis mereri, dicitur enim Ezech. XIV quod, si fuerint in
              civitate Noe, Daniel et Iob, filium et filiam non liberabunt, sed
              ipsi iustitia sua liberabunt animas suas. Ergo nec Christus potuit
              aliquid nobis mereri.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, of the fulness of Christ's
              grace we all receive, as is written Jn. 1:16. Now other men having
              Christ's grace cannot merit for others. For it is written (Ezech.
              14:20) that if "Noe and Daniel and Job be in the city [Vulg.: 'the
              midst thereof']... they shall deliver neither son nor daughter;
              but they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice."
              Hence Christ could not merit anything for us.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, merces quam quis meretur, debetur secundum
                  iustitiam, et non secundum gratiam, ut patet Rom. IV. Si ergo
                  Christus meruit salutem nostram, sequitur quod salus nostra
                  non sit ex gratia Dei, sed ex iustitia, et quod iniuste agat
                  cum eis quos non salvat, cum meritum Christi ad omnes se
                  extendat.

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the "reward" that we merit
                  is due "according to justice [Vulg.: 'debt'] and not according
                  to grace," as is clear from Rm. 4:4. Therefore if Christ
                  merited our salvation it follows that our salvation is not by
                  God's grace but by justice, and that He acts unjustly with
                  those whom He does not save, since Christ's merit extends to
                  all.<br />

                      Sed contra est quod dicitur Rom. V, sicut per unius
                      delictum in omnes homines in condemnationem, sic et per
                      unius iustitiam in omnes homines in iustificationem vitae.
                      Sed demeritum Adae derivatur ad condemnationem aliorum.
                      Ergo multo magis meritum Christi ad alios derivatur.

                      to justification of life." But Adam's demerits reached to
                      the condemnation of others. Much more, therefore, does the
                      merit of Christ reach others.<br />

                          grace was in Christ not merely as in an individual,

                          all are united, as members to a head, who constitute
                          one mystical person. And hence it is that Christ's
                          merit extends to others inasmuch as they are His
