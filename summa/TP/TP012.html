                          held to be in Christ's soul, as we have said Question
                          [9], Article [4], by reason of the active intellect,
                          lest its action, which is to make things actually
                          intelligible, should be wanting; even as imprinted or
                          infused knowledge is held to be in Christ's soul for
                          the perfection of the passive intellect. Now as the
                          passive intellect is that by which "all things are in
                          potentiality," so the active intellect is that by
                          which "all are in act," as is said De Anima iii, 18.
                          And hence, as the soul of Christ knew by infused
                          knowledge all things to which the passive intellect is
                          in any way in potentiality, so by acquired knowledge
                          it knew whatever can be known by the action of the
                          active intellect.<br />

                  and grace, as if receiving additional sensations, do not
                  venerate the union which is in hypostasis." But it is impious

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There is a twofold
                          advancement in knowledge: one in essence, inasmuch as
                          the habit of knowledge is increased; the other in
                          effect---e.g. if someone were with one and the same

                          truths at first, and afterwards greater and more
                          subtle conclusions. Now in this second way it is plain
                          that Christ advanced in knowledge and grace, even as
                          in age, since as His age increased He wrought greater
                          deeds, and showed greater knowledge and grace.<br />

                              est quod habitus scientiae infusae in eo non est
                              augmentatus, cum a principio plenarie sibi fuerit
                              omnis scientia infusa. Et multo minus scientia
                              beata in eo augeri potuit. De scientia autem
                              divina quod non possit augeri, supra in prima

                              scientiae infusum, non sit in anima Christi

                              inditas ad ea quae de novo per sensum accepit. Sed
                              quia inconveniens videtur quod aliqua naturalis
                              actio intelligibilis Christo deesset, cum

                              fuit qui per huiusmodi abstractionem specierum
                              potuerit augmentari, ex hoc scilicet quod
                              intellectus agens, post primas species
                              intelligibiles abstractas a phantasmatibus,
                              poterat etiam alias abstrahere.

                              But as regards the habit of knowledge, it is plain
                              that His habit of infused knowledge did not
                              increase, since from the beginning He had perfect
                              infused knowledge of all things; and still less
                              could His beatific knowledge increase; while in
                              the FP, Question [14], Article [15], we have
                              already said that His Divine knowledge could not
                              increase. Therefore, if in the soul of Christ
                              there was no habit of acquired knowledge, beyond
                              the habit of infused knowledge, as appears to some
                              [*Blessed Albert the Great, Alexander of Hales,
                              St. Bonaventure], and sometime appeared to me
                              (Sent. iii, D, xiv), no knowledge in Christ
                              increased in essence, but merely by experience,
                              i.e. by comparing the infused intelligible species
                              with phantasms. And in this way they maintain that
                              Christ's knowledge grew in experience, e.g. by
                              comparing the infused intelligible species with
                              what He received through the senses for the first
                              time. But because it seems unfitting that any
                              natural intelligible action should be wanting to
                              Christ, and because to extract intelligible
                              species from phantasms is a natural action of
                              man's active intellect, it seems becoming to place
                              even this action in Christ. And it follows from
                              this that in the soul of Christ there was a habit
                              of knowledge which could increase by this
                              abstraction of species; inasmuch as the active
                              intellect, after abstracting the first
                              intelligible species from phantasms, could
                              abstract others, and others again.<br />

                                  of Christ's soul were the effects of an agent
                                  of infinite power, which could produce the
                                  whole at once; and thus in neither knowledge
                                  did Christ advance; since from the beginning
                                  He had them perfectly. But the acquired
                                  knowledge of Christ is caused by the active
                                  intellect which does not produce the whole at

                                      man to acquire knowledge by discovery, so
                                      also that he may acquire it by being
                                      taught. But our Lord did nothing
                                      unbecoming to His age; and hence He did
                                      not give ear to hearing the lessons of
                                      doctrine until such time as He was able to

                                      way of experience. Hence Gregory says

          Him." But we are strengthened by the comforting words of a teacher,
          according to Job 4:3,4: "Behold thou hast taught many and hast
          strengthened the weary hand. Thy words have confirmed them that were
          staggering." Therefore Christ was taught by angels.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the human soul is
                          midway between spiritual substances and corporeal
                          things, it is perfected naturally in two ways. First
                          by knowledge received from sensible things; secondly,
                          by knowledge imprinted or infused by the illumination
                          of spiritual substances. Now in both these ways the
                          soul of Christ was perfected; first by empirical
                          knowledge of sensible things, for which there is no
                          need of angelic light, since the light of the active
                          intellect suffices; secondly, by the higher impression
                          of infused knowledge, which He received directly from
                          God. For as His soul was united to the Word above the
                          common mode, in unity of person, so above the common
                          manner of men was it filled with knowledge and grace
                          by the Word of God Himself; and not by the medium of
                          angels, who in their beginning received the knowledge
                          of things by the influence of the Word, as Augustine
                          says (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8).<br />

                              "In testimony of both natures are the angels said

                              Him. For the Creator did not need help from His
                              creature; but having become man, even as it was
                              for our sake that He was sad, so was it for our
                              sake that He was strengthened," i.e. in order that
                              our faith in the Incarnation might be
                              strengthened.<br />
