          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod miracula quae Christus fecit
          circa spirituales substantias, non fuerint convenientia. Inter
          spirituales enim substantias, sancti Angeli praepollent Daemonibus,
          quia, ut Augustinus dicit, in III de Trin., spiritus vitae rationalis
          desertor atque peccator regitur per spiritum vitae rationalem pium et
          iustum. Sed Christus non legitur aliqua miracula fecisse circa Angelos
          bonos. Ergo neque etiam circa Daemones aliqua miracula facere debuit.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that those miracles were
          unfitting which Christ worked in spiritual substances. For among
          spiritual substances the holy angels are above the demons; for, as
          Augustine says (De Trin. iii): "The treacherous and sinful rational
          spirit of life is ruled by the rational, pious, and just spirit of
          life." But we read of no miracles worked by Christ in the good angels.
          Therefore neither should He have worked miracles in the demons.<br />

          the salvation of mankind. But sometimes the casting out of demons from
          men was detrimental to man, in some cases to the body: thus it is
          related (Mk. 9:24,25) that a demon at Christ's command, "crying out
          and greatly tearing" the man, "went out of him; and he became as dead,
          so that many said: He is dead"; sometimes also to things: as when He
          sent the demons, at their own request, into the swine, which they cast
          headlong into the sea; wherefore the inhabitants of those parts
          "besought Him that He would depart from their coasts" (<a

          Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus dicit, IX de Civit. Dei,
          Christus tantum innotuit Daemonibus quantum voluit, tantum autem
          voluit quantum oportuit. Sed innotuit eis, non sicut Angelis sanctis,
          per id quod est vita aeterna, sed per quaedam temporalia suae virtutis
          effecta. Et primo quidem, videntes Christum esurire post ieiunium,
          aestimaverunt eum non esse filium Dei. Unde, super illud Luc. IV, si
          filius Dei es etc., dicit Ambrosius, quid sibi vult talis sermonis
          exorsus, nisi quia cognoverat Dei filium esse venturum, sed venisse
          per infirmitatem corporis non putavit? Sed postmodum, visis miraculis,
          ex quadam suspicatione coniecturavit eum esse filium Dei. Unde super
          illud Marci I, scio quia sis sanctus Dei, dicit Chrysostomus quod non
          certam aut firmam adventus Dei habebat notitiam. Sciebat tamen ipsum
          esse Christum in lege promissum, unde dicitur Luc. IV, quia sciebant
          ipsum esse Christum. Quod autem ipsum confitebantur esse filium Dei,
          magis erat ex suspicione quam ex certitudine. Unde Beda dicit, super
          Luc., Daemonia filium Dei confitentur, et, sicut postea dicitur,
          sciebant eum esse Christum. Quia, cum ieiunio fatigatum eum Diabolus
          videret, verum hominem intellexit, sed, quia tentando non praevaluit
          utrum filius Dei esset, dubitabat. Nunc autem, per signorum potentiam,
          vel intellexit, vel potius suspicatus est esse filium Dei. Non ideo
          igitur Iudaeis eum crucifigere persuasit, quia Christum sive Dei
          filium non esse putavit, sed quia se morte illius non praevidit esse
          damnandum. De hoc enim mysterio a saeculis abscondito dicit apostolus
          quod nemo principum huius saeculi cognovit, si enim cognovissent,
          nunquam dominum gloriae crucifixissent.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei
          ix): "Christ was known to the demons just as much as He willed; and He
          willed just as far as there was need. But He was known to them, not as
          to the holy angels, by that which is eternal life, but by certain
          temporal effects of His power." First, when they saw that Christ was
          hungry after fasting they deemed Him not to be the Son of God. Hence,
          on Lk. 4:3, "If Thou be the Son of God," etc., Ambrose says: "What
          means this way of addressing Him? save that, though He knew that the
          Son of God was to come, yet he did not think that He had come in the
          weakness of the flesh?" But afterwards, when he saw Him work miracles,
          he had a sort of conjectural suspicion that He was the Son of God.
          Hence on Mk. 1:24, "I know who Thou art, the Holy one of God,"
          Chrysostom [*Victor of Antioch. Cf. Catena Aurea] says that "he had no
          certain or firm knowledge of God's coming." Yet he knew that He was
          "the Christ promised in the Law," wherefore it is said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++4%3A41"
            >Lk. 4:41</a
          >) that "they knew that He was Christ." But it was rather from
          suspicion than from certainty that they confessed Him to be the Son of
          God. Hence Bede says on Lk. 4:41: "The demons confess the Son of God,
          and, as stated farther on, 'they knew that He was Christ.' For when
          the devil saw Him weakened by His fast, He knew Him to be a real man:
          but when He failed to overcome Him by temptation, He doubted lest He
          should be the Son of God. And now from the power of His miracles He
          either knew, or rather suspected that He was the Son of God. His
          reason therefore for persuading the Jews to crucify Him was not that
          he deemed Him not to be Christ or the Son of God, but because he did
          not foresee that he would be the loser by His death. For the Apostle
          says of this mystery" (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++2%3A7,8"
            >1 Cor. 2:7,8</a
          >), "which is hidden from the beginning, that 'none of the princes of
          this world knew it,' for if they had known it they would never have
          crucified the Lord of glory."<br />

          laudem ipsius pertinebant, primo quidem, propter exemplum. Quia, ut

          The miracles which Christ worked in expelling demons were for the
          benefit, not of the demons, but of men, that they might glorify Him.
          Wherefore He forbade them to speak in His praise. First, to give us an
          example. For, as Athanasius says, "He restrained his speech, although
          he was confessing the truth; to teach us not to care about such
          things, although it may seem that what is said is true. For it is
          wrong to seek to learn from the devil when we have the Divine
          Scripture": Besides, it is dangerous, since the demons frequently mix
          falsehood with truth. Or, as Chrysostom [*Cyril of Alexandria,
          Comment. in Luc.] says: "It was not meet for them to usurp the
          prerogative of the apostolic office. Nor was it fitting that the
          mystery of Christ should be proclaimed by a corrupt tongue" because
          "praise is not seemly in the mouth of a sinner" [*Cf. Theophylact,
          Enarr. in Luc.]. Thirdly, because, as Bede says, "He did not wish the
          envy of the Jews to be aroused thereby" [*Bede, Expos. in Luc. iv,
          41]. Hence "even the apostles are commanded to be silent about Him,
          lest, if His Divine majesty were proclaimed, the gift of His Passion
          should be deferred."<br />

          Chrysostomus dicit, super Matth., quod Christus permisit Daemonibus in
          porcos ire, non quasi a Daemonibus persuasus, sed primo quidem, ut
          instruat magnitudinem nocumenti Daemonum qui hominibus insidiantur;

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b>
          Christ came specially to teach and to work miracles for the good of
          man, and principally as to the salvation of his soul. Consequently, He
          allowed the demons, that He cast out, to do man some harm, either in
          his body or in his goods, for the salvation of man's soul---namely,
          for man's instruction. Hence Chrysostom says on Mt. 8:32 that Christ
          let the demons depart into the swine, "not as yielding to the demons,
          but first, to show... how harmful are the demons who attack men;
          secondly, that all might learn that the demons would not dare to hurt
          even the swine, except He allow them; thirdly, that they would have
          treated those men more grievously than they treated the swine, unless
          they had been protected by God's providence."<br />

          Et propter easdem etiam causas permisit eum qui a Daemonibus
          liberabatur, ad horam gravius affligi, a qua tamen afflictione eum
          continuo liberavit. Per hoc etiam ostenditur, ut Beda dicit, quod
          saepe, dum converti ad Deum post peccata conamur, maioribus novisque
          antiqui hostis pulsamur insidiis. Quod facit vel ut odium virtutis

          homo sanatus velut mortuus, ut Hieronymus dicit, quia sanatis dicitur,

          And for the same motives He allowed the man, who was being delivered
          from the demons, to suffer grievously for the moment; yet did He
          release him at once from that distress. By this, moreover, we are
          taught, as Bede says on Mk. 9:25, that "often, when after falling into
          sin we strive to return to God, we experience further and more
          grievous attacks from the old enemy. This he does, either that he may
          inspire us with a distaste for virtue, or that he may avenge the shame
          of having been cast out." For the man who was healed "became as dead,"
          says Jerome, "because to those who are healed it is said, 'You are
          dead; and your life is hid with Christ in God'" (Col. 3:3)<br />

          Christo facta miracula circa caelestia corpora. Ut enim Dionysius

          to preserve, nature." Now, the heavenly bodies are by nature
          incorruptible and unchangeable, as is proved De Coelo i. Therefore it

          <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it was more fitting that Christ
          should work miracles in life and when teaching, than in death: both
          because, as it is written (2 Cor. 13:4), "He was crucified through
          weakness, yet He liveth by the power of God," by which He worked
          miracles; and because His miracles were in confirmation of His
          doctrine. But there is no record of Christ having worked any miracles
          in the heavenly bodies during His lifetime: nay, more; when the
          Pharisees asked Him to give "a sign from heaven," He refused, as
          Matthew relates (12,16). Therefore it seems that neither in His death

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The order of the seasons was not
          disturbed by the miracle worked by Christ. For, according to some,
          this gloom or darkening of the sun, which occurred at the time of
          Christ's passion, was caused by the sun withdrawing its rays, without
          any change in the movement of the heavenly bodies, which measures the
          duration of the seasons. Hence Jerome says on Mt. 27:45: "It seems as
          though the 'greater light' withdrew its rays, lest it should look on
          its Lord hanging on the Cross, or bestow its radiancy on the impious
          blasphemers." And this withdrawal of the rays is not to be understood
          as though it were in the sun's power to send forth or withdraw its
          rays: for it sheds its light, not from choice, but by nature, as
          Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). But the sun is said to withdraw its
          rays in so far as the Divine power caused the sun's rays not to reach
          the earth. On the other hand, Origen says this was caused by clouds
          coming between (the earth and the sun). Hence on Mt. 27:45 he says:
          "We must therefore suppose that many large and very dense clouds were
          massed together over Jerusalem and the land of Judea; so that it was
          exceedingly dark from the sixth to the ninth hour. Hence I am of
          opinion that, just as the other signs which occurred at the time of
          the Passion"---namely, "the rending of the veil, the quaking of the
          earth," etc.---"took place in Jerusalem only, so this also:... or if
          anyone prefer, it may be extended to the whole of Judea," since it is
          said that "'there was darkness over the whole earth,' which expression
          refers to the land of Judea, as may be gathered from 3 Kgs. 18:10,
          where Abdias says to Elias: 'As the Lord thy God liveth, there is no
          nation or kingdom whither my lord hath not sent to seek thee': which
          shows that they sought him among the nations in the neighborhood of
          Judea."<br />

          Sed circa hoc magis est credendum Dionysio, qui oculata fide inspexit
          hoc accidisse per interpositionem lunae inter nos et solem. Dicit
          enim, in epistola ad Polycarpum, inopinabiliter soli lunam incidentem
          videbamus, in Aegypto scilicet existentes, ut ibidem dicitur. Et
          designat ibi quatuor miracula. Quorum primum est quod naturalis
          eclipsis solis per interpositionem lunae nunquam accidit nisi tempore
          coniunctionis solis et lunae. Tunc autem erat luna in oppositione ad
          solem, quintadecima existens, quia erat Pascha Iudaeorum. Unde dicit,
          non enim erat conventus tempus. Secundum miraculum est quod, cum circa
          horam sextam luna visa fuisset simul cum sole in medio caeli, in
          vesperis apparuit in suo loco, idest in oriente, opposita soli. Unde
          dicit, et rursus ipsam vidimus, scilicet lunam, a nona hora, scilicet
          in qua recessit a sole, cessantibus tenebris, usque ad vesperam,
          supernaturaliter restitutam ad diametrum solis, id est ut
          diametraliter esset soli opposita. Et sic patet quod non est turbatus
          consuetus temporum cursus, quia divina virtute factum est et quod ad
          solem supernaturaliter accederet praeter debitum tempus, et quod, a
          sole recedens, in locum proprium restitueretur tempore debito. Tertium
          miraculum est quod naturaliter eclipsis solis semper incipit ab
          Occidentali parte et pervenit usque ad Orientalem, et hoc ideo quia
          luna secundum proprium motum, quo movetur ab occidente in orientem,
          est velocior sole in suo proprio motu; et ideo luna, ab occidente
          veniens, attingit solem et pertransit ipsum ad orientem tendens. Sed
          tunc luna iam pertransiverat solem, et distabat ab eo per medietatem
          circuli, in oppositione existens. Unde oportuit quod reverteretur ad
          orientem versus solem, et attingeret ipsum primo ex parte Orientali,
          procedens versus occidentem. Et hoc est quod dicit, eclipsim etiam
          ipsam ex oriente vidimus inchoatam et usque ad solarem terminum
          venientem, quia totum solem eclipsavit, postea hinc regredientem.
          Quartum miraculum fuit quod in naturali eclipsi ex eadem parte incipit
          sol prius reapparere ex qua parte incipit prius obscurari, quia
          scilicet luna, se soli subiiciens, naturali suo motu solem pertransit
          versus orientem, et ita partem Occidentalem solis, quam primo occupat,
          primo etiam derelinquit. Sed tunc luna, miraculose ab oriente versus
          occidentem rediens, non pertransivit solem, ut esset eo Occidentalior,
          sed, postquam pervenit ad terminum solis, reversa est versus orientem,
          et ita partem solis quam ultimo occupavit, primo etiam dereliquit. Et
          sic ex parte Orientali inchoata fuit eclipsis, sed in parte
          Occidentali prius incoepit claritas apparere. Et hoc est quod dicit,
          et rursus vidimus non ex eodem, idest, non ex eadem parte solis, et
          defectum et repurgationem, sed e contra secundum diametrum factam.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          On this point, however, credence is to be given rather to Dionysius,
          who is an eyewitness as to this having occurred by the moon eclipsing
          the sun. For he says (Ep. ad Polycarp): "Without any doubt we saw the
          moon encroach on the sun," he being in Egypt at the time, as he says
          in the same letter. And in this he points out four miracles. The first
          is that the natural eclipse of the sun by interposition of the moon
          never takes place except when the sun and moon are in conjunction. But
          then the sun and moon were in opposition, it being the fifteenth day,
          since it was the Jewish Passover. Wherefore he says: "For it was not
          the time of conjunction."---The second miracle is that whereas at the
          sixth hour the moon was seen, together with the sun, in the middle of
          the heavens, in the evening it was seen to be in its place, i.e. in
          the east, opposite the sun. Wherefore he says: "Again we saw it," i.e.
          the moon, "return supernaturally into opposition with the sun," so as
          to be diametrically opposite, having withdrawn from the sun "at the
          ninth hour," when the darkness ceased, "until evening." From this it
          is clear that the wonted course of the seasons was not disturbed,
          because the Divine power caused the moon both to approach the sun
          supernaturally at an unwonted season, and to withdraw from the sun and
          return to its proper place according to the season. The third miracle
          was that the eclipse of the sun naturally always begins in that part
          of the sun which is to the west and spreads towards the east: and this
          is because the moon's proper movement from west to east is more rapid
          than that of the sun, and consequently the moon, coming up from the
          west, overtakes the sun and passes it on its eastward course. But in
          this case the moon had already passed the sun, and was distant from it
          by the length of half the heavenly circle, being opposite to it:
          consequently it had to return eastwards towards the sun, so as to come
          into apparent contact with it from the east, and continue in a
          westerly direction. This is what he refers to when he says: "Moreover,
          we saw the eclipse begin to the east and spread towards the western
          edge of the sun," for it was a total eclipse, "and afterwards pass
          away." The fourth miracle consisted in this, that in a natural eclipse
          that part of the sun which is first eclipsed is the first to reappear
          (because the moon, coming in front of the sun, by its natural movement
          passes on to the east, so as to come away first from the western
          portion of the sun, which was the first part to be eclipsed), whereas
          in this case the moon, while returning miraculously from the east to
          the west, did not pass the sun so as to be to the west of it: but
          having reached the western edge of the sun returned towards the east:
          so that the last portion of the sun to be eclipsed was the first to
          reappear. Consequently the eclipse began towards the east, whereas the
          sun began to reappear towards the west. And to this he refers by
          saying: "Again we observed that the occultation and emersion did not
          begin from the same point," i.e. on the same side of the sun, "but on
          opposite sides."<br />

          Chrysostom adds a fifth miracle (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.), saying that

          of the sun lasts but a short time, for it is soon over, as those know
          who have seen one." Hence we are given to understand that the moon was
          stationary below the sun, except we prefer to say that the duration of
          the darkness was measured from the first moment of occultation of the

          quia astrologi ubique terrarum tunc temporis existentes, non
          sollicitabantur de observanda eclipsi, quia tempus non erat, sed illam
          obscuritatem ex aliqua passione aeris putaverunt accidere. Sed in

          occurred at the full moon." It may be, therefore, that because it was
          not the time for an eclipse, the various astronomers living then
          throughout the world were not on the look-out for one, and that they
          ascribed this darkness to some disturbance of the atmosphere. But in

          Then, above all, was there need for miraculous proof of Christ's
          Godhead, when the weakness of human nature was most apparent in Him.
          Hence it was that at His birth a new star appeared in the heavens.
          Wherefore Maximus says (Serm. de Nativ. viii): "If thou disdain the
          manger, raise thine eyes a little and gaze on the new star in the
          heavens, proclaiming to the world the birth of our Lord." But in His
          Passion yet greater weakness appeared in His manhood. Therefore there
          was need for yet greater miracles in the greater lights of the world.
          And, as Chrysostom says (Hom. lxxxviii in Matth.): "This is the sign
          which He promised to them who sought for one saying: 'An evil and
          adulterous generation seeketh a sign; and a sign shall not be given
          it, but the sign of Jonas the prophet,' referring to His Cross... and
          Resurrection... For it was much more wonderful that this should happen
          when He was crucified than when He was walking on earth."<br />

          spitting upon his eyes, laying His hands on him, He asked him if he

          walking. After that again He laid His hands upon his eyes, and he
          began to see, and was restored, so that he saw all things clearly." It
          is clear from this that He did not heal him suddenly, but at first
          imperfectly, and by means of His spittle. Therefore it seems that He
          worked miracles on men unfittingly.<br />

          illustratione et hominum iustificatione. Quorum primum praesupponit

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The means are distinct from the
          end. Now the end for which Christ's miracles were worked was the
          health of the rational part, which is healed by the light of wisdom,
          and the gift of righteousness: the former of which presupposes the
          latter, since, as it is written (Wis. 1:4): "Wisdom will not enter
          into a malicious soul, nor dwell in a body subject to sins." Now it
          was unfitting that man should be made righteous unless he willed: for
          this would be both against the nature of righteousness, which implies
          rectitude of the will, and contrary to the very nature of man, which
          requires to be led to good by the free-will, not by force. Christ,
          therefore, justified man inwardly by the Divine power, but not against
          man's will. Nor did this pertain to His miracles, but to the end of
          His miracles. In like manner by the Divine power He infused wisdom
          into the simple minds of His disciples: hence He said to them (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++21%3A15"
            >Lk. 21:15</a
          >): "I will give you a mouth and wisdom" which "all your adversaries
          will not be able to resist and gainsay." And this, in so far as the
          enlightenment was inward, is not to be reckoned as a miracle, but only
          as regards the outward action---namely, in so far as men saw that
          those who had been unlettered and simple spoke with such wisdom and
          constancy. Wherefore it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+4%3A13"
            >Acts 4:13</a
          >) that the Jews, "seeing the constancy of Peter and of John,
          understanding that they were illiterate and ignorant men...
          wondered."---And though such like spiritual effects are different from
          visible miracles, yet do they testify to Christ's doctrine and power,
          according to Heb. 2:4: "God also bearing them witness by signs and
          wonders and divers miracles, and distributions of the Holy Ghost."<br />

          Nevertheless Christ did work some miracles on the soul of man,
          principally by changing its lower powers. Hence Jerome, commenting on
          Mt. 9:9, "He rose up and followed Him," says: "Such was the splendor
          and majesty of His hidden Godhead, which shone forth even in His human
          countenance, that those who gazed on it were drawn to Him at first
          sight." And on Mt. 21:12, "(Jesus) cast out all them that sold and
          bought," the same Jerome says: "Of all the signs worked by our Lord,
          this seems to me the most wondrous---that one man, at that time
          despised, could, with the blows of one scourge, cast out such a
          multitude. For a fiery and heavenly light flashed from His eyes, and
          the majesty of His Godhead shone in His countenance." And Origen says
          on Jn. 2:15 that "this was a greater miracle than when He changed
          water into wine, for there He shows His power over inanimate matter,
          whereas here He tames the minds of thousands of men." Again, on Jn.
          18:6, "They went backward and fell to the ground," Augustine says:
          "Though that crowd was fierce in hate and terrible with arms, yet did
          that one word... without any weapon, smite them through, drive them
          back, lay them prostrate: for God lay hidden in that flesh." Moreover,
          to this must be referred what Luke says (4:30) ---namely, that Jesus,
          "passing through the midst of them, went His way," on which Chrysostom
          observes (Hom. xlviii in Joan.): "That He stood in the midst of those
          who were lying in wait for Him, and was not seized by them, shows the
          power of His Godhead"; and, again, that which is written Jn. 8:59,
          "Jesus hid Himself and went out of the Temple," on which Theophylact
          says: "He did not hide Himself in a corner of the Temple, as if
          afraid, or take shelter behind a wall or pillar; but by His heavenly
          power making Himself invisible to those who were threatening Him, He
          passed through the midst of them."<br />

          Christ came to save the world, not only by Divine power, but also
          through the mystery of His Incarnation. Consequently in healing the
          sick He frequently not only made use of His Divine power, healing by
          way of command, but also by applying something pertaining to His human
          nature. Hence on Lk. 4:40, "He, laying His hands on every one of them,
          healed them," Cyril says: "Although, as God, He might, by one word,
          have driven out all diseases, yet He touched them, showing that His
          own flesh was endowed with a healing virtue." And on Mk. 8:23,
          "Spitting upon his eyes, laying His hands on him," etc., Chrysostom
          [*Victor of Antioch] says: "He spat and laid His hands upon the blind
          man, wishing to show that His Divine word, accompanied by His
          operation, works wonders: for the hand signifies operation; the
          spittle signifies the word which proceeds from the mouth." Again, on
          Jn. 9:6, "He made clay of the spittle, and spread the clay upon the
          eyes of the blind man," Augustine says: "Of His spittle He made
          clay---because 'the Word was made flesh.'" Or, again, as Chrysostom
          says, to signify that it was He who made man of "the slime of the
          earth."<br />

          It is furthermore to be observed concerning Christ's miracles that
          generally what He did was most perfect. Hence on Jn. 2:10, "Every man

          are such as to far surpass the works of nature in splendor and
          usefulness." Likewise in an instant He conferred perfect health on the
          sick. Hence on Mt. 8:15, "She arose and ministered to them," Jerome

          <a href="TP043.html#TPQ43A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), Christ worked

          the outward healing worked by Christ is the healing of the soul.
          Consequently it was not fitting that Christ should heal a man's body
          without healing his soul. Wherefore on Jn. 7:23, "I have healed the
          whole man on a Sabbath day," Augustine says: "Because he was cured, so
          as to be whole in body; he believed, so as to be whole in soul." To
          the man sick of the palsy it is said specially, "Thy sins are forgiven
          thee," because, as Jerome observes on Mt. 9:5,6: "We are hereby given
          to understand that ailments of the body are frequently due to sin: for
          which reason, perhaps, first are his sins forgiven, that the cause of
          the ailment being removed, health may return." Wherefore, also (<a

            >Jn. 4:14</a
          >), it is said: "Sin no more, lest some worse thing happen to thee."

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, miracula Christi ad
          hoc ordinabantur quod virtus divinitatis cognosceretur in ipso ad
          hominum salutem. Pertinet autem ad virtutem divinitatis ut omnis
          creatura sit ei subiecta. Et ideo in omnibus creaturarum generibus
          miracula eum facere oportuit, et non solum in hominibus, sed etiam in
          irrationabilibus creaturis.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above, Christ's miracles were
          ordained to the end that He should be recognized as having Divine
          power, unto the salvation of mankind. Now it belongs to the Divine
          power that every creature be subject thereto. Consequently it behooved
          Him to work miracles on every kind of creature, not only on man, but
          also on irrational creatures.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Brute animals are akin generically
          to man, wherefore they were created on the same day as man. And since
          He had worked many miracles on the bodies of men, there was no need
          for Him to work miracles on the bodies of brute animals. and so much
          the less that, as to their sensible and corporeal nature, the same
          reason applies to both men and animals, especially terrestrial. But
          fish, from living in water, are more alien from human nature;
          wherefore they were made on another day. On them Christ worked a
          miracle in the plentiful draught of fishes, related Lk. 5 and Jn. 21;
          and, again, in the fish caught by Peter, who found a stater in it (<a

          Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Chrysostomus dicit, super Matth., cum

          humanis corporibus exercuit, ubi vero in contumaces formam severitatis
          constituebat, futuri speciem damno arboris indicavit. Et praecipue, ut

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Chrysostom says on Mt. 21:19:
          "When our Lord does any such like thing" on plants or brute animals,
          "ask not how it was just to wither up the fig-tree, since it was not
          the fruit season; to ask such a question is foolish in the extreme,"
          because such things cannot commit a fault or be punished: "but look at
          the miracle, and wonder at the worker." Nor does the Creator "inflict"
          any hurt on the owner, if He choose to make use of His own creature
          for the salvation of others; rather, as Hilary says on Mt. 21:19, "we
          should see in this a proof of God's goodness, for when He wished to
          afford an example of salvation as being procured by Him, He exercised
          His mighty power on the human body: but when He wished to picture to
          them His severity towards those who wilfully disobey Him, He
          foreshadows their doom by His sentence on the tree." This is the more
          noteworthy in a fig-tree which, as Chrysostom observes (on Mt. 21:19),
          "being full of moisture, makes the miracle all the more
          remarkable."<br />

          Christ also worked miracles befitting to Himself in the air and water:
          when, to wit, as related Mt. 8:26, "He commanded the winds, and the
          sea, and there came a great calm." But it was not befitting that He
          who came to restore all things to a state of peace and calm should
          cause either a disturbance in the atmosphere or a division of waters.
          Hence the Apostle says (<a

          The multiplication of the loaves was not effected by way of creation,
          but by an addition of extraneous matter transformed into loaves; hence
          Augustine says on Jn. 6:1-14: "Whence He multiplieth a few grains into
          harvests, thence in His hands He multiplied the five loaves": and it
          is clearly by a process of transformation that grains are multiplied
