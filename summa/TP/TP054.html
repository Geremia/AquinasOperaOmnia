          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus post resurrectionem
          non habuerit verum corpus. Verum enim corpus non potest simul esse cum
          alio corpore in eodem loco. Sed corpus Christi post resurrectionem
          fuit simul cum alio corpore in eodem loco, intravit enim ad discipulos
          ianuis clausis, ut dicitur Ioan. XX. Ergo videtur quod Christus post
          resurrectionem non habuerit verum corpus.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not have a
          true body after His Resurrection. For a true body cannot be in the
          same place at the same time with another body. But after the
          Resurrection Christ's body was with another at the same time in the
          same place: since He entered among the disciples "the doors being
          shut," as is related in Jn. 20:26. Therefore it seems that Christ did
          not have a true body after His Resurrection.<br />

              Praeterea, verum corpus non evanescit ab aspectu intuentium, nisi
              forte corrumpatur. Sed corpus Christi evanuit ab oculis
              discipulorum eum intuentium, ut dicitur Luc. ult. Ergo videtur
              quod Christus post resurrectionem non habuerit verum corpus.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a true body does not vanish
              from the beholder's sight unless perchance it be corrupted. But
              Christ's body "vanished out of the sight" of the disciples as they
              gazed upon Him, as is related in Lk. 24:31. Therefore, it seems
              that Christ did not have a true body after His Resurrection.<br />

                  Sed corpus Christi apparuit discipulis in alia effigie, ut
                  patet Marci ult. Ergo videtur quod Christus post
                  resurrectionem non habuerit verum corpus humanum.

                  disciples "in another shape," as is evident from Mk. 15:12.

                      troubled and frightened, supposed that they saw a spirit,"
                      as if He had not a true but an imaginary body: but to
                      remove their fears He presently added: "Handle and see,
                      for a spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me to
                      have." Consequently, He had not an imaginary but a true

                          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut Damascenus dicit, in IV
                          libro, illud resurgere dicitur quod cecidit. Corpus
                          autem Christi per mortem cecidit, inquantum scilicet
                          fuit ab eo anima separata, quae erat eius formalis
                          perfectio. Unde oportuit, ad hoc quod esset vera
                          Christi resurrectio, ut idem corpus Christi iterato
                          eidem animae uniretur. Et quia veritas naturae
                          corporis est ex forma, consequens est quod corpus
                          Christi post resurrectionem et verum corpus fuerit, et
                          eiusdem naturae cuius fuerat prius. Si autem eius
                          corpus fuisset phantasticum, non fuisset vera
                          resurrectio, sed apparens.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Damascene says (De
                          Fide Orth. iv): that is said to rise, which fell. But
                          Christ's body fell by death; namely, inasmuch as the
                          soul which was its formal perfection was separated
                          from it. Hence, in order for it to be a true
                          resurrection, it was necessary for the same body of
                          Christ to be once more united with the same soul. And
                          since the truth of the body's nature is from its form
                          it follows that Christ's body after His Resurrection
                          was a true body, and of the same nature as it was
                          before. But had His been an imaginary body, then His
                          Resurrection would not have been true, but
                          apparent.<br />

                              gloriae, sicut quidam dicunt, clausis ianuis ad
                              discipulos introivit, simul cum alio corpore in
                              eodem loco existens. Sed utrum hoc facere possit
                              corpus gloriosum ex aliqua proprietate sibi
                              indita, ut simul cum alio corpore in eodem loco
                              existat, inferius discutietur, ubi agetur de
                              resurrectione communi. Nunc autem, quantum ad
                              propositum sufficit, dicendum est quod non ex
                              natura corporis, sed potius ex virtute divinitatis
                              unitae, illud corpus ad discipulos, licet verum
                              esset, ianuis clausis introivit. Unde Augustinus
                              dicit, in quodam sermone paschali, quod quidam sic
                              disputant, si corpus erat, si hoc surrexit de
                              sepulcro quod pependit in ligno, quomodo per ostia
                              clausa intrare potuit? Et respondet, si
                              comprehendis modum, non est miraculum. Ubi deficit
                              ratio, ibi est fidei aedificatio. Et super Ioan.,
                              dicit, moli corporis ubi divinitas erat, ostia
                              clausa non obstiterunt, ille quippe non eis
                              apertis intrare potuit, quo nascente virginitas
                              matris inviolata permansit. Et idem dicit
                              Gregorius, in quadam homilia de octava Paschae.

                              its glorified condition, as some say, entered in

                              with. For the present let it suffice to say that
                              it was not from any property within the body, but
                              by virtue of the Godhead united to it, that this
                              body, although a true one, entered in among the
                              disciples while the doors were shut. Accordingly
                              Augustine says in a sermon for Easter (ccxlvii)
                              that some men argue in this fashion: "If it were a
                              body; if what rose from the sepulchre were what
                              hung upon the tree, how could it enter through
                              closed doors?" And he answers: "If you understand
                              how, it is no miracle: where reason fails, faith
                              abounds." And (Tract. cxxi super Joan.) he says:
                              "Closed doors were no obstacle to the substance of
                              a Body wherein was the Godhead; for truly He could
                              enter in by doors not open, in whose Birth His
                              Mother's virginity remained inviolate." And
                              Gregory says the same in a homily for the octave
                              of Easter (xxvi in Evang.).<br />

                                  aliquid videatur, fit per actionem visibilis
                                  in visum, ut patet per philosophum, in II de
                                  anima. Et ideo quicumque habet corpus
                                  glorificatum, in potestate sua habet videri
                                  quando vult, et, quando non vult, non videri.
                                  Hoc tamen Christus habuit non solum ex
                                  conditione corporis gloriosi, sed etiam ex
                                  virtute divinitatis, per quam fieri potest ut
                                  etiam corpora non gloriosa miraculose non
                                  videantur; sicut praestitum fuit miraculose
                                  beato Bartholomaeo, ut, si vellet, videretur,
                                  non autem videretur si non vellet. Dicitur
                                  ergo quod Christus ab oculis discipulorum
                                  evanuit, non quia corrumperetur aut
                                  resolveretur in aliqua invisibilia, sed quia
                                  sua voluntate desiit ab eis videri, vel eo
                                  praesente, vel etiam eo abscedente per dotem
                                  agilitatis.

                                  But such is the disposition of a glorified
                                  body that it is spiritual, i.e. subject to the
                                  spirit, as the Apostle says (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A44"
                                    >1 Cor. 15:44</a
                                  >). Now in order for the body to be entirely
                                  subject to the spirit, it is necessary for the
                                  body's every action to be subject to the will
                                  of the spirit. Again, that an object be seen
                                  is due to the action of the visible object
                                  upon the sight, as the Philosopher shows (De
                                  Anima ii). Consequently, whoever has a
                                  glorified body has it in his power to be seen
                                  when he so wishes, and not to be seen when he
                                  does not wish it. Moreover Christ had this not
                                  only from the condition of His glorified body,
                                  but also from the power of His Godhead, by
                                  which power it may happen that even bodies not
                                  glorified are miraculously unseen: as was by a
                                  miracle bestowed on the blessed Bartholomew,
                                  that "if he wished he could be seen, and not
                                  be seen if he did not wish it" [*Apocryphal
                                  Historia Apost. viii, 2]. Christ, then, is
                                  said to have vanished from the eyes of the
                                  disciples, not as though He were corrupted or
                                  dissolved into invisible elements; but because
                                  He ceased, of His own will, to be seen by
                                  them, either while He was present or while He
                                  was departing by the gift of agility.<br />

                                      Severianus [*Peter Chrysologus: Serm.
                                      lxxxii] says in a sermon for Easter: "Let
                                      no one suppose that Christ changed His
                                      features at the Resurrection." This is to
                                      be understood of the outline of His
                                      members; since there was nothing out of
                                      keeping or deformed in the body of Christ
                                      which was conceived of the Holy Ghost,
                                      that had to be righted at the
                                      Resurrection. Nevertheless He received the
                                      glory of clarity in the Resurrection:
                                      accordingly the same writer adds: "but the
                                      semblance is changed, when, ceasing to be
                                      mortal, it becomes immortal; so that it
                                      acquired the glory of countenance, without
                                      losing the substance of the countenance."
                                      Yet He did not come to those disciples in
                                      glorified appearance; but, as it lay in
                                      His power for His body to be seen or not,
                                      so it was within His power to present to
                                      the eyes of the beholders His form either
                                      glorified or not glorified, or partly
                                      glorified and partly not, or in any
                                      fashion whatsoever. Still it requires but

          shall the just shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father." But
          shining bodies are seen under the aspect of light, but not of color.
          Therefore, since Christ's body was beheld under the aspect of color,
          as it had been hitherto, it seems that it was not a glorified one.<br />

                          exemplar et causa nostrae resurrectionis, ut habetur I
                          Cor. XV. Sancti autem in resurrectione habebunt
                          corpora gloriosa, sicut dicitur ibidem, seminatur in
                          ignobilitate, surget in gloria. Unde, cum causa sit
                          potior causato et exemplar exemplato, multo magis
                          corpus Christi resurgentis fuit gloriosum. Secundo,
                          quia per humilitatem passionis meruit gloriam
                          resurrectionis. Unde et ipse dicebat, nunc anima mea
                          turbata est, quod pertinet ad passionem, et postea
                          subdit, pater, clarifica nomen tuum, in quo petit
                          gloriam resurrectionis. Tertio quia, sicut supra
                          habitum est, anima Christi a principio suae
                          conceptionis fuit gloriosa per fruitionem divinitatis
                          perfectam. Est autem dispensative factum, sicut supra
                          dictum est, ut ab anima gloria non redundaret in
                          corpus, ad hoc quod mysterium nostrae redemptionis sua
                          passione impleret. Et ideo, peracto hoc mysterio
                          passionis et mortis Christi, anima Christi statim in
                          corpus, in resurrectione resumptum, suam gloriam
                          derivavit. Et ita factum est corpus illud gloriosum.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's was a glorified
                          body in His Resurrection, and this is evident from
                          three reasons. First of all, because His Resurrection
                          was the exemplar and the cause of ours, as is stated
                          in 1 Cor. 15:43. But in the resurrection the saints
                          will have glorified bodies, as is written in the same
                          place: "It is sown in dishonor, it shall rise in
                          glory." Hence, since the cause is mightier than the
                          effect, and the exemplar than the exemplate; much more
                          glorious, then, was the body of Christ in His
                          Resurrection. Secondly, because He merited the glory
                          of His Resurrection by the lowliness of His Passion.
                          Hence He said (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++12%3A27"

                          >): "Now is My soul troubled," which refers to the
                          Passion; and later He adds: "Father, glorify Thy
                          name," whereby He asks for the glory of the
                          Resurrection. Thirdly, because as stated above (<a
                            href="TP034.html#TPQ34OUTP1"
                            >Question [34]</a
                          >, <a href="TP034.html#TPQ34A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>),
                          Christ's soul was glorified from the instant of His
                          conception by perfect fruition of the Godhead. But, as
                          stated above (<a href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1"
                            >Question [14]</a

                          ad 2), it was owing to the Divine economy that the
                          glory did not pass from His soul to His body, in order
                          that by the Passion He might accomplish the mystery of
                          our redemption. Consequently, when this mystery of
                          Christ's Passion and death was finished, straightway
                          the soul communicated its glory to the risen body in
                          the Resurrection; and so that body was made
                          glorious.<br />

                              the subject's capacity. Therefore, since glory
                              flows from the soul into the body, it follows
                              that, as Augustine says (Ep. ad Dioscor. cxviii),
                              the brightness or splendor of a glorified body is
                              after the manner of natural color in the human
                              body; just as variously colored glass derives its
                              splendor from the sun's radiance, according to the
                              mode of the color. But as it lies within the power
                              of a glorified man whether his body be seen or
                              not, as stated above (<a

                              was in this way that Christ's body appeared to the

                                  that a body can be handled not only because of
                                  its resistance, but also on account of its
                                  density. But from rarity and density follow
                                  weight and lightness, heat and cold, and
                                  similar contraries, which are the principles
                                  of corruption in elementary bodies.
                                  Consequently, a body that can be handled by
                                  human touch is naturally corruptible. But if
                                  there be a body that resists touch, and yet is
                                  not disposed according to the qualities
                                  mentioned, which are the proper objects of
                                  human touch, such as a heavenly body, then
                                  such body cannot be said to be handled. But
                                  Christ's body after the Resurrection was truly
                                  made up of elements, and had tangible
                                  qualities such as the nature of a human body
                                  requires, and therefore it could naturally be
                                  handled; and if it had nothing beyond the
                                  nature of a human body, it would likewise be
                                  corruptible. But it had something else which
                                  made it incorruptible, and this was not the
                                  nature of a heavenly body, as some maintain,
                                  and into which we shall make fuller inquiry

                                  soul: because, as Augustine says (Ep. ad
                                  Dioscor. cxviii): "God made the soul of such
                                  powerful nature, that from its fullest
                                  beatitude the fulness of health overflows into
                                  the body, that is, the vigor of incorruption."
                                  And therefore Gregory says (Hom. in Evang.
                                  xxvi): "Christ's body is shown to be of the
                                  same nature, but of different glory, after the
                                  Resurrection."<br />

                                      Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xiii): "After
                                      the Resurrection, our Saviour in spiritual
                                      but true flesh partook of meat with the
                                      disciples, not from need of food, but
                                      because it lay in His power." For as Bede
                                      says on Lk. 24:41: "The thirsty earth
                                      sucks in the water, and the sun's burning
                                      ray absorbs it; the former from need, the
                                      latter by its power." Hence after the
                                      Resurrection He ate, "not as needing food,
                                      but in order thus to show the nature of
                                      His risen body." Nor does it follow that
                                      His was an animal body that stands in need
                                      of food.<br />

                              Constantinople, who maintained that "our body in
                              that glory of the resurrection will be impalpable,
                              and more subtle than wind and air: and that our

                              handled Him were confirmed, brought back to
                              subtlety whatever could be handled in Him" [*St.
                              Gregory, Moral. in Job 14:56]. Now Gregory
                              condemns this in the same book, because Christ's
                              body was not changed after the Resurrection,
                              according to Rm. 6:9: "Christ rising from the
                              dead, dieth now no more." Accordingly, the very

                              Valentine asserted, it is much more unbecoming for
                              Him at His Resurrection to resume a body of
                              another nature, because in His Resurrection He
                              resumed unto an everlasting life, the body which

                                  mortality of flesh and blood." Therefore flesh
                                  according to its substance possesses the
                                  kingdom of God, according to Lk. 24:39: "A
                                  spirit hath not flesh and bones, as you see Me
                                  to have." But flesh, if understood as to its
                                  corruption, will not possess it; hence it is
                                  straightway added in the words of the Apostle:
                                  "Neither shall corruption possess
                                  incorruption."<br />

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Damascene says (De Fide
                  Orth. iv) that "some things are truly said of Christ after the
                  Resurrection, which He did not have from nature but from
                  special dispensation, such as the scars, in order to make it
                  sure that it was the body which had suffered that rose again."
                  Now when the cause ceases, the effect ceases. Therefore it
                  seems that when the disciples were assured of the
                  Resurrection, He bore the scars no longer. But it ill became
                  the unchangeableness of His glory that He should assume
                  anything which was not to remain in Him for ever.
                  Consequently, it seems that He ought not at His Resurrection
                  to have resumed a body with scars.<br />

                          Primo quidem, propter gloriam ipsius Christi. Dicit

                          sicut Augustinus dicit, in libro de symbolo, sciebat
                          Christus quare cicatrices in suo corpore servaret.
                          Sicut enim demonstravit Thomae non credenti nisi
                          tangeret et videret, ita etiam inimicis vulnera
                          demonstraturus est sua, ut convincens eos veritas
                          dicat, ecce hominem quem crucifixistis. Videtis
                          vulnera quae infixistis. Agnoscitis latus quod
                          pupugistis. Quoniam per vos, et propter vos apertum
                          est, nec tamen intrare voluistis.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for
                          Christ's soul at His Resurrection to resume the body
                          with its scars. In the first place, for Christ's own
                          glory. For Bede says on Lk. 24:40 that He kept His
                          scars not from inability to heal them, "but to wear
                          them as an everlasting trophy of His victory." Hence
                          Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xxii): "Perhaps in that
                          kingdom we shall see on the bodies of the Martyrs the
                          traces of the wounds which they bore for Christ's
                          name: because it will not be a deformity, but a
                          dignity in them; and a certain kind of beauty will
                          shine in them, in the body, though not of the body."
                          Secondly, to confirm the hearts of the disciples as to
                          "the faith in His Resurrection" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40).
                          Thirdly, "that when He pleads for us with the Father,
                          He may always show the manner of death He endured for
                          us" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40). Fourthly, "that He may
                          convince those redeemed in His blood, how mercifully
                          they have been helped, as He exposes before them the
                          traces of the same death" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40).
                          Lastly, "that in the Judgment-day He may upbraid them
                          with their just condemnation" (Bede, on Lk. 24:40).
                          Hence, as Augustine says (De Symb. ii): "Christ knew
                          why He kept the scars in His body. For, as He showed
                          them to Thomas who would not believe except he handled
                          and saw them, so will He show His wounds to His
                          enemies, so that He who is the Truth may convict them,
                          saying: 'Behold the man whom you crucified; see the
                          wounds you inflicted; recognize the side you pierced,
                          since it was opened by you and for you, yet you would
                          not enter.'"<br />

                                  perfected. Thomas, however, not only saw, but
                                  handled the wounds, because as Pope Leo [*Cf.
                                  Append. Opp. August., Serm. clxii] says: "It
                                  sufficed for his personal faith for him to
                                  have seen what he saw; but it was on our
                                  behalf that he touched what he beheld."<br />

                                      remanere, non solum ad certificandum
                                      discipulorum fidem, sed etiam propter
                                      alias rationes. Ex quibus apparet quod
                                      semper in eius corpore cicatrices illae

                                      corpus in caelo esse credo ut erat quando
                                      ascendit in caelum. Et Gregorius, XIV
                                      Moral., dicit quod, si quid in corpore
                                      Christi post resurrectionem potuit
                                      immutari, contra veridicam Pauli
                                      sententiam, post resurrectionem dominus
                                      rediit in mortem. Quod quis dicere vel
                                      stultus praesumat, nisi qui veram carnis
                                      resurrectionem denegat? Unde patet quod
                                      cicatrices quas Christus post
                                      resurrectionem in suo corpore ostendit,
                                      nunquam postmodum ab illo corpore sunt

                                      willed the scars of His wounds to remain
                                      on His body, not only to confirm the faith
                                      of His disciples, but for other reasons
                                      also. From these it seems that those scars
                                      will always remain on His body; because,
                                      as Augustine says (Ad Consent., De Resurr.
                                      Carn.): "I believe our Lord's body to be
                                      in heaven, such as it was when He ascended
                                      into heaven." And Gregory (Moral. xiv)
                                      says that "if aught could be changed in
                                      Christ's body after His Resurrection,
                                      contrary to Paul's truthful teaching, then
                                      the Lord after His Resurrection returned
                                      to death; and what fool would dare to say
                                      this, save he that denies the true
                                      resurrection of the flesh?" Accordingly,
                                      it is evident that the scars which Christ
                                      showed on His body after His Resurrection,
                                      have never since been removed from His
