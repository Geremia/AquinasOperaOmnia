    Whether we were delivered from sin through Christ's Passion?<br />

  <table cellpadding="12">
    <tbody>
      <tr valign="top">
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod per passionem Christi non simus
          liberati a peccato. Liberare enim a peccato est proprium Dei secundum
          illud Isaiae XLIII, ego sum qui deleo iniquitates tuas propter me.
          Christus autem non est passus secundum quod Deus, sed secundum quod
          homo. Ergo passio Christi non liberavit nos a peccato.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not delivered
          from sin through Christ's Passion. For to deliver from sin belongs to
          God alone, according to Is. 43:25: "I am He who blot out your
          iniquities for My own sake." But Christ did not suffer as God, but as
          man. Therefore Christ's Passion did not free us from sin.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, corporale non agit in spirituale. Sed passio Christi
              corporalis est, peccatum autem non est nisi in anima, quae est
              spiritualis creatura. Ergo passio Christi non potuit nos mundare a
              peccato.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, what is corporeal does not act
              upon what is spiritual. But Christ's Passion is corporeal, whereas
              sin exists in the soul, which is a spiritual creature. Therefore
              Christ's Passion could not cleanse us from sin.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, nullus potest liberari a peccato quod nondum
                  commisit, sed quod in posterum est commissurus. Cum igitur
                  multa peccata post Christi passionem sint commissa, et tota
                  die committantur, videtur quod per passionem Christi non simus
                  liberati a peccato.
                </td>
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, one cannot be purged from
                  a sin not yet committed, but which shall be committed
                  hereafter. Since, then, many sins have been committed since
                  Christ's death, and are being committed daily, it seems that
                  we were not delivered from sin by Christ's death.<br />

                    <td style="text-align: justify">
                      Praeterea, posita causa sufficienti, nihil aliud
                      requiritur ad effectum inducendum. Requiruntur autem adhuc
                      alia ad remissionem peccatorum, scilicet Baptismus et
                      poenitentia. Ergo videtur quod passio Christi non sit
                      sufficiens causa remissionis peccatorum.

                    <td style="text-align: justify">
                      <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, given an efficient
                      cause, nothing else is required for producing the effect.
                      But other things besides are required for the forgiveness
                      of sins, such as baptism and penance. Consequently it
                      seems that Christ's Passion is not the sufficient cause of
                      the forgiveness of sins.<br />

                          purgantur peccata. Sed multa sunt alia de quibus
                          habemus fidem, et quae sunt provocativa caritatis.
                          Ergo passio Christi non est propria causa remissionis
                          peccatorum.

                          there are many other things of which we have faith,
                          and which excite charity. Therefore Christ's Passion
                          is not the proper cause of the forgiveness of sins.<br />

                                  Respondeo dicendum quod passio Christi est
                                  propria causa remissionis peccatorum,
                                  tripliciter. Primo quidem, per modum
                                  provocantis ad caritatem. Quia, ut apostolus
                                  dicit, Rom. V, commendat Deus suam caritatem
                                  in nobis, quoniam, cum inimici essemus,
                                  Christus pro nobis mortuus est. Per caritatem
                                  autem consequimur veniam peccatorum, secundum
                                  illud Luc. VII, dimissa sunt ei peccata multa,
                                  quoniam dilexit multum. Secundo, passio
                                  Christi causat remissionem peccatorum per
                                  modum redemptionis. Quia enim ipse est caput
                                  nostrum, per passionem suam, quam ex caritate
                                  et obedientia sustinuit, liberavit nos,
                                  tanquam membra sua, a peccatis, quasi per
                                  pretium suae passionis, sicut si homo per
                                  aliquod opus meritorium quod manu exerceret,
                                  redimeret se a peccato quod pedibus
                                  commisisset. Sicut enim naturale corpus est
                                  unum, ex membrorum diversitate consistens, ita
                                  tota Ecclesia, quae est mysticum corpus
                                  Christi, computatur quasi una persona cum suo
                                  capite, quod est Christus. Tertio, per modum
                                  efficientiae, inquantum caro, secundum quam
                                  Christus passionem sustinuit, est instrumentum
                                  divinitatis, ex quo eius passiones et actiones
                                  operantur in virtute divina ad expellendum
                                  peccatum.

                                  <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's Passion
                                  is the proper cause of the forgiveness of sins
                                  in three ways. First of all, by way of
                                  exciting our charity, because, as the Apostle
                                  says (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A8"
                                    >Rm. 5:8</a
                                  >): "God commendeth His charity towards us:
                                  because when as yet we were sinners, according
                                  to the time, Christ died for us." But it is by
                                  charity that we procure pardon of our sins,
                                  according to Lk. 7:47: "Many sins are forgiven
                                  her because she hath loved much." Secondly,
                                  Christ's Passion causes forgiveness of sins by
                                  way of redemption. For since He is our head,
                                  then, by the Passion which He endured from
                                  love and obedience, He delivered us as His
                                  members from our sins, as by the price of His
                                  Passion: in the same way as if a man by the
                                  good industry of his hands were to redeem
                                  himself from a sin committed with his feet.
                                  For, just as the natural body is one though
                                  made up of diverse members, so the whole
                                  Church, Christ's mystic body, is reckoned as
                                  one person with its head, which is Christ.
                                  Thirdly, by way of efficiency, inasmuch as
                                  Christ's flesh, wherein He endured the
                                  Passion, is the instrument of the Godhead, so
                                  that His sufferings and actions operate with
                                  Divine power for expelling sin.<br />

                                                      Christ's Passion is
                                                      applied to us even through
                                                      faith, that we may share
                                                      in its fruits, according
                                                      to Rm. 3:25: "Whom God
                                                      hath proposed to be a
                                                      propitiation, through
                                                      faith in His blood." But
                                                      the faith through which we
                                                      are cleansed from sin is
                                                      not "lifeless faith,"
                                                      which can exist even with
                                                      sin, but "faith living"
                                                      through charity; that thus
                                                      Christ's Passion may be
                                                      applied to us, not only as
                                                      to our minds, but also as
                                                      to our hearts. And even in
                                                      this way sins are forgiven

    Whether we were delivered from the devil's power through Christ's

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod per passionem Christi non
          simus liberati a potestate Diaboli. Ille enim non habet potestatem
          super aliquos, in quibus nihil sine permissione alterius facere
          potest. Sed Diabolus nunquam potuit aliquid in nocumentum hominum
          facere nisi ex permissione divina, sicut patet Iob I et II quod,
          potestate divinitus accepta, eum primo in rebus, et postea in corpore
          laesit. Et similiter Matth. VIII dicitur quod Daemones, nisi Christo
          concedente, non potuerunt porcos intrare. Ergo Diabolus nunquam habuit
          in hominibus potestatem. Et ita per passionem Christi non sumus a
          potestate Diaboli liberati.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not delivered
          from the power of the devil through Christ's Passion. For he has no
          power over others, who can do nothing to them without the sanction of
          another. But without the Divine permission the devil could never do
          hurt to any man, as is evident in the instance of Job (1,2), where, by
          power received from God, the devil first injured him in his
          possessions, and afterwards in his body. In like manner it is stated
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++8%3A31,32"
            >Mt. 8:31,32</a
          >) that the devils could not enter into the swine except with Christ's
          leave. Therefore the devil never had power over men: and hence we are
          not delivered from his power through Christ's Passion.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, Diabolus potestatem suam in hominibus exercet tentando
              et corporaliter vexando. Sed hoc adhuc in hominibus operatur, post
              Christi passionem. Ergo non sumus per passionem Christi ab eius
              potestate liberati.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the devil exercises his power
              over men by tempting them and molesting their bodies. But even
              after the Passion he continues to do the same to men. Therefore we
              are not delivered from his power through Christ's Passion.<br />

                  Praeterea, virtus passionis Christi in perpetuum durat,
                  secundum illud Heb. X, una oblatione consummavit sanctificatos
                  in sempiternum. Sed liberatio a potestate Diaboli nec est
                  ubique, quia in multis partibus mundi adhuc sunt idololatrae,
                  nec etiam erit semper, quia tempore Antichristi maxime suam
                  potestatem exercebit in hominum nocumentum, de quo dicitur, II
                  ad Thess. II, quod eius adventus erit secundum operationem
                  Satanae in omni virtute et signis et prodigiis mendacibus, et
                  in omni seductione iniquitatis. Ergo videtur quod passio
                  Christi non sit causa liberationis humani generis a potestate
                  Diaboli.

                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the might of Christ's
                  Passion endures for ever, as, according to Heb. 10:14: "By one
                  oblation He hath perfected for ever them that are sanctified."
                  But deliverance rom the devil's power is not found everywhere,
                  since there are still idolaters in many regions of the world;
                  nor will it endure for ever, because in the time of Antichrist
                  he will be especially active in using his power to the hurt of
                  men; because it is said of him (<a
                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Thess++2%3A9"
                    >2 Thess. 2:9</a
                  >): "Whose coming is according to the working of Satan, in all
                  power, and signs, and lying wonders, and in all seduction of
                  iniquity." Consequently it seems that Christ's Passion is not
                  the cause of the human race being delivered from the power of
                  the devil.<br />

                      from the earth, will draw all things to Myself." Now He
                      was lifted up from the earth by His Passion on the cross.
                      Therefore by His Passion the devil was deprived of his

                          qui, per suam iustitiam, hominem reliquerat potestati
                          Diaboli. Tertium autem est ex parte ipsius Diaboli,
                          qui sua nequissima voluntate hominem a consecutione
                          salutis impediebat.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are three things to
                          be considered regarding the power which the devil
                          exercised over men previous to Christ's Passion. The
                          first is on man's own part, who by his sin deserved to
                          be delivered over to the devil's power, and was
                          overcome by his tempting. Another point is on God's
                          part, whom man had offended by sinning, and who with
                          justice left man under the devil's power. The third is
                          on the devil's part, who out of his most wicked will
                          hindered man from securing his salvation.<br />

                              Quantum igitur ad primum, homo est a potestate

                              passio Christi est causa remissionis peccatorum,
                              ut dictum est. Quantum autem ad secundum, dicendum

                              liberavit, inquantum nos Deo reconciliavit, ut
                              infra dicetur. Quantum vero ad tertium, passio

                              peccato. Unde Augustinus dicit, in XIII de Trin.,
                              iustitia Christi Diabolus victus est, quia, cum in
                              eo nihil morte dignum inveniret, occidit eum
                              tamen; et utique iustum est ut debitores quos
                              tenebat, liberi dimittantur, in eum credentes quem
                              sine ullo debito occidit.

                              As to the first point, by Christ's Passion man was
                              delivered from the devil's power, in so far as the
                              Passion is the cause of the forgiveness of sins,
                              as stated above (<a href="TP049.html#TPQ49A1THEP1"
                                >Article [1]</a
                              >). As to the second, it must be said that
                              Christ's Passion freed us from the devil's power,
                              inasmuch as it reconciled us with God, as shall be
                              shown later (<a href="TP049.html#TPQ49A4THEP1"
                                >Article [4]</a
                              >). But as to the third, Christ's Passion
                              delivered us from the devil, inasmuch as in
                              Christ's Passion he exceeded the limit of power
                              assigned him by God, by conspiring to bring about
                              Christ's death, Who, being sinless, did not
                              deserve to die. Hence Augustine says (De Trin.
                              xiii, cap. xiv): "The devil was vanquished by
                              Christ's justice: because, while discovering in
                              Him nothing deserving of death, nevertheless he
                              slew Him. And it is certainly just that the
                              debtors whom he held captive should be set at

          sin is eternal damnation. But those damned in hell for their sins were
          not set free by Christ's Passion, because "in hell there is no
          redemption" [*Office of the Dead, Resp. vii]. It seems, therefore,

                                  imponitur, quia sunt totaliter liberati per
                                  satisfactionem Christi. Quia vero Christus
                                  semel tantum pro peccatis nostris mortuus est,
                                  ut dicitur I Pet. III, ideo non potest homo
                                  secundario configurari morti Christi per
                                  sacramentum Baptismi. Unde oportet quod illi
                                  qui post Baptismum peccant, configurentur
                                  Christo patienti per aliquid poenalitatis vel
                                  passionis quam in seipsis sustineant. Quae
                                  tamen multo minor sufficit quam esset condigna
                                  peccato, cooperante satisfactione Christi.

                                  Christ's Passion, we must be likened unto Him.
                                  Now we are likened unto Him sacramentally in
                                  Baptism, according to Rm. 6:4: "For we are
                                  buried together with Him by baptism into
                                  death." Hence no punishment of satisfaction is
                                  imposed upon men at their baptism, since they
                                  are fully delivered by Christ's satisfaction.
                                  But because, as it is written (<a

                                  therefore a man cannot a second time be
                                  likened unto Christ's death by the sacrament
                                  of Baptism. Hence it is necessary that those
                                  who sin after Baptism be likened unto Christ
                                  suffering by some form of punishment or

                                  than one that is proportionate to the sin.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we were not reconciled
          to God through Christ's Passion. For there is no need of
          reconciliation between friends. But God always loved us, according to
          Wis. 11:25: "Thou lovest all the things that are, and hatest none of
          the things which Thou hast made." Therefore Christ's Passion did not
          reconcile us to God.<br />

              dilectio Dei est principium passionis Christi, secundum illud
              Ioan. III, sic Deus dilexit mundum ut filium suum unigenitum

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same thing cannot be cause
              and effect: hence grace, which is the cause of meriting, does not
              come under merit. But God's love is the cause of Christ's Passion,
              according to Jn. 3:16: "God so loved the world, as to give His
              only-begotten Son." It does not appear, then, that we were
              reconciled to God through Christ's Passion, so that He began to
              love us anew.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's Passion is in
                          two ways the cause of our reconciliation to God. In
                          the first way, inasmuch as it takes away sin by which
                          men became God's enemies, according to Wis. 14:9: "To
                          God the wicked and his wickedness are hateful alike";
                          and Ps. 5:7: "Thou hatest all the workers of
                          iniquity." In another way, inasmuch as it is a most
                          acceptable sacrifice to God. Now it is the proper
                          effect of sacrifice to appease God: just as man
                          likewise overlooks an offense committed against him on
                          account of some pleasing act of homage shown him.

          Ad quintum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus sua passione non
          aperuerit nobis ianuam caeli. Dicitur enim Proverb. XI, seminanti

          caelestis. Ergo videtur quod sancti patres, qui operati sunt opera

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not open the
          gate of heaven to us by His Passion. For it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++11%3A18"
            >Prov. 11:18</a
          >): "To him that soweth justice, there is a faithful reward." But the
          reward of justice is the entering into the kingdom of heaven. It
          seems, therefore, that the holy Fathers who wrought works of justice,
          obtained by faith the entering into the heavenly kingdom even without
          Christ's Passion. Consequently Christ's Passion is not the cause of
          the opening of the gate of the kingdom of heaven.<br />

              videtur quod apertio ianuae caelestis non sit effectus passionis

                              entering in. But it is on account of sin that men
                              were prevented from entering into the heavenly
                              kingdom, since, according to Is. 35:8: "It shall
                              be called the holy way, and the unclean shall not
                              pass over it." Now there is a twofold sin which
                              prevents men from entering into the kingdom of
                              heaven. The first is common to the whole race, for
                              it is our first parents' sin, and by that sin
                              heaven's entrance is closed to man. Hence we read
                              in Gn. 3:24 that after our first parents' sin God
                              "placed... cherubim and a flaming sword, turning
                              every way, to keep the way of the tree of life."
                              The other is the personal sin of each one of us,
                              committed by our personal act.<br />

                                  proprium sanguinem introivit semel in sancta,
                                  aeterna redemptione inventa. Et hoc
                                  significatur Num. XXXV, ubi dicitur quod
                                  homicida manebit ibi, scilicet in civitate
                                  refugii, donec sacerdos magnus, qui oleo
                                  sancto unctus est, moriatur, quo mortuo,
                                  poterit in domum suam redire.

                                  Now by Christ's Passion we have been delivered
                                  not only from the common sin of the whole
                                  human race, both as to its guilt and as to the
                                  debt of punishment, for which He paid the
                                  penalty on our behalf; but, furthermore, from
                                  the personal sins of individuals, who share in
                                  His Passion by faith and charity and the
                                  sacraments of faith. Consequently, then the
                                  gate of heaven's kingdom is thrown open to us

                                  what the Apostle says (<a

                                      saints "by faith conquered kingdoms,

    Whether by His Passion Christ merited to be exalted?<br />

          Ad sextum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christus per suam passionem non
          meruit exaltari. Sicut enim cognitio veritatis est proprium Deo, ita
          et sublimitas, secundum illud Psalmi, excelsus super omnes gentes
          dominus, et super caelos gloria eius. Sed Christus, secundum quod
          homo, habuit cognitionem omnis veritatis non ex aliquo merito
          praecedenti, sed ex ipsa unione Dei et hominis, secundum illud Ioan.
          I, vidimus gloriam eius quasi unigeniti a patre, plenum gratiae et
          veritatis. Ergo neque exaltationem habuit ex merito passionis, sed ex
          sola unione.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that Christ did not merit to be
          exalted on account of His Passion. For eminence of rank belongs to God
          alone, just as knowledge of truth, according to Ps. 112:4: "The Lord
          is high above all nations, and His glory above the heavens." But
          Christ as man had the knowledge of all truth, not on account of any
          preceding merit, but from the very union of God and man, according to
          Jn. 1:14: "We saw His glory... as it were of the only-Begotten of the
          Father, full of grace and of truth." Therefore neither had He
          exaltation from the merit of the Passion but from the union alone.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, Christus meruit sibi a primo instanti suae
              conceptionis, ut supra habitum est. Non autem maior caritas fuit
              in eo tempore passionis quam ante. Cum ergo caritas sit merendi
              principium, videtur quod non magis meruit per passionem suam
              exaltationem quam ante.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ merited for Himself
              from the first instant of His conception, as stated above (<a

              >, <a href="TP034.html#TPQ34A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). But His
              love was no greater during the Passion than before. Therefore,
              since charity is the principle of merit, it seems that He did not
              merit exaltation from the Passion more than before.

                  Praeterea, gloria corporis resultat ex gloria animae, ut
                  Augustinus dicit, in epistola ad Dioscorum. Sed Christus per
                  passionem suam non meruit exaltationem quantum ad gloriam
                  animae, quia anima eius fuit beata a primo instanti suae
                  conceptionis. Ergo neque etiam per passionem meruit

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the glory of the body
                  comes from the glory of the soul, as Augustine says (Ep. ad
                  Dioscor.). But by His Passion Christ did not merit exaltation
                  as to the glory of His soul, because His soul was beatified
                  from the first instant of His conception. Therefore neither
                  did He merit exaltation, as to the glory of His body, from the

                          est iniqua voluntas. Ita etiam, cum aliquis sibi ex

                          ut sibi amplius aliquid superaddatur, quasi merces

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Merit implies a certain
                          equality of justice: hence the Apostle says (<a

                          according to debt." But when anyone by reason of his
                          unjust will ascribes to himself something beyond his
                          due, it is only just that he be deprived of something
                          else which is his due; thus, "when a man steals a
                          sheep he shall pay back four" (<a

                          unjust will is chastised thereby. So likewise when any

                          he ought to have, he deserves that something further

                                  caelum. Unde dicitur Ephes. IV, descendit
                                  primo in inferiores partes terrae, qui autem
                                  descendit, ipse est et qui ascendit super

                                  inglorius erit inter viros aspectus eius. Et
                                  Philipp. II dicitur, factus est obediens usque

                                  of His Godhead, according to Is. 52:13: "He

                                  exceeding high: as many have been astonished
                                  at him, so shall His visage be inglorious
                                  among men." Moreover (<a

                                    >Phil. 2:8</a
                                  >) it is written: "He humbled Himself,
                                  becoming obedient unto death, even to the
                                  death of the cross: for which cause also God
                                  hath exalted Him, and hath given Him a name
                                  which is above all names"---that is to say, so
                                  that He shall be hailed as God by all; and all
                                  shall pay Him homage as God. And this is
                                  expressed in what follows: "That in the name
                                  of Jesus every knee should bow, of those that
                                  are in heaven, on earth, and under the earth."
                                  Fourthly, as to His judiciary power: for it is
                                  written (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+36%3A17"

                                  >): "Thy cause hath been judged as that of the
                                  wicked cause and judgment Thou shalt recover."
