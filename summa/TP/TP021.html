          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod Christo non competat orare.
          Nam, sicut dicit Damascenus, oratio est petitio decentium a Deo. Sed,
          cum Christus omnia facere posset, non videtur ei convenire quod
          aliquid ab aliquo peteret. Ergo videtur quod Christo non conveniat

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unbecoming that Christ should
          pray. For, as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "prayer is the
          asking for becoming things from God." But since Christ could do all
          things, it does not seem becoming to Him to ask anything from anyone.
          Therefore it does not seem fitting that Christ should pray.<br />

              Praeterea, non oportet orando petere illud quod aliquis scit pro
              certo esse futurum, sicut non oramus quod sol oriatur cras. Neque
              etiam est conveniens quod aliquis orando petat quod scit nullo
              modo esse futurum. Sed Christus sciebat circa omnia quid esset
              futurum. Ergo non conveniebat ei aliquid orando petere.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we need not ask in prayer for
              what we know for certain will happen; thus, we do not pray that
              the sun may rise tomorrow. Nor is it fitting that anyone should
              ask in prayer for what he knows will not happen. But Christ in all
              things knew what would happen. Therefore it was not fitting that
              He should ask anything in prayer.<br />

                  Praeterea, Damascenus dicit, in III libro, quod oratio est
                  ascensus intellectus in Deum. Sed intellectus Christi non
                  indigebat ascensione in Deum, quia semper intellectus eius
                  erat Deo coniunctus, non solum secundum unionem hypostasis,
                  sed etiam secundum fruitionem beatitudinis. Ergo Christo non

                  Orth. iii, 24) that "prayer is the raising up of the mind to
                  God." Now Christ's mind needed no uplifting to God, since His
                  mind was always united to God, not only by the union of the
                  hypostasis, but by the fruition of beatitude. Therefore it was

                          parte, oratio est quaedam explicatio propriae
                          voluntatis apud Deum, ut eam impleat. Si igitur in

                          nullo modo sibi competeret orare, quia voluntas divina
                          per seipsam est effectiva eorum quae vult, secundum
                          illud Psalmi, omnia quaecumque voluit dominus fecit.
                          Sed quia in Christo est alia voluntas divina et alia
                          humana; et voluntas humana non est per seipsam efficax
                          ad implendum ea quae vult, nisi per virtutem divinam,
                          inde est quod Christo, secundum quod est homo et
                          humanam voluntatem habens, competit orare.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As was said in the SS,
                          Question [83], Articles [1],2, prayer is the unfolding
                          of our will to God, that He may fulfill it. If,
                          therefore, there had been but one will in Christ, viz.
                          the Divine, it would nowise belong to Him to pray,
                          since the Divine will of itself is effective of
                          whatever He wishes by it, according to Ps. 134:6:
                          "Whatsoever the Lord pleased, He hath done." But
                          because the Divine and the human wills are distinct in
                          Christ, and the human will of itself is not
                          efficacious enough to do what it wishes, except by
                          Divine power, hence to pray belongs to Christ as man
                          and as having a human will.<br />

                              Ad primum ergo dicendum quod Christus poterat
                              perficere omnia quae volebat secundum quod Deus,
                              non autem secundum quod homo, quia, secundum quod
                              homo, non habuit omnipotentiam, ut supra habitum
                              est. Nihilominus tamen, idem ipse Deus existens et
                              homo, voluit ad patrem orationem porrigere, non
                              quasi ipse esset impotens, sed propter nostram
                              instructionem. Primo quidem, ut ostenderet se esse
                              a patre. Unde ipse dicit, Ioan. XI, propter
                              populum qui circumstat dixi, scilicet verba
                              orationis, ut credant quia tu me misisti. Unde
                              Hilarius, in X de Trin., dicit, non prece eguit,
                              nobis oravit, ne filius ignoraretur. Secundo, ut
                              nobis exemplum daret. Unde Ambrosius dicit, super
                              Luc., noli insidiatrices aperire aures, ut putes
                              filium Dei quasi infirmum rogare, ut impetret quod
                              implere non possit. Potestatis enim auctor,
                              obedientiae magister, ad praecepta virtutis suo
                              nos informat exemplo. Unde et Augustinus dicit,
                              super Ioan., poterat dominus in forma servi, si
                              hoc opus esset, orare silentio. Sed ita se patri
                              voluit exhibere precatorem, ut meminisset nostrum
                              se esse doctorem.

                              wished, since as man He was not omnipotent, as
                              stated above (<a href="TP013.html#TPQ13OUTP1"
                                >Question [13]</a

                              >). Nevertheless being both God and man, He wished
                              to offer prayers to the Father, not as though He
                              were incompetent, but for our instruction. First,
                              that He might show Himself to be from the Father;
                              hence He says (<a
                                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++11%3A42"
                                >Jn. 11:42</a
                              >): "Because of the people who stand about I have
                              said it" (i.e. the words of the prayer) "that they
                              may believe that Thou hast sent Me." Hence Hilary
                              says (De Trin. x): "He did not need prayer. It was
                              for us He prayed, lest the Son should be unknown."
                              Secondly, to give us an example of prayer; hence
                              Ambrose says (on Lk. 6:12): "Be not deceived, nor
                              think that the Son of God prays as a weakling, in
                              order to beseech what He cannot effect. For the
                              Author of power, the Master of obedience persuades
                              us to the precepts of virtue by His example."
                              Hence Augustine says (Tract. civ in Joan.): "Our
                              Lord in the form of a servant could have prayed in
                              silence, if need be, but He wished to show Himself
                              a suppliant of the Father, in such sort as to bear
                              in mind that He was our Teacher."<br />

                                      sursum. Motus autem, ut dicitur in III de
                                      anima, dupliciter dicitur. Uno modo,
                                      proprie, secundum quod importat exitum de
                                      potentia in actum, prout est actus
                                      imperfecti. Et sic ascendere competit ei
                                      quod est potentia sursum et non actu. Et
                                      hoc modo, ut Damascenus dicit, in III
                                      libro, intellectus humanus Christi non
                                      eget ascensione in Deum, cum sit semper
                                      Deo unitus et secundum esse personale, et
                                      secundum beatam contemplationem. Alio modo
                                      dicitur motus actus perfecti, idest
                                      existentis in actu, sicut intelligere et
                                      sentire dicuntur quidam motus. Et hoc modo
                                      intellectus Christi semper ascendit in
                                      Deum, quia semper contemplatur ipsum ut
                                      supra se existentem.

                                      rise is nothing more than to move towards
                                      what is above. Now movement is taken in
                                      two ways, as is said De Anima iii, 7;
                                      first, strictly, according as it implies
                                      the passing from potentiality to act,
                                      inasmuch as it is the act of something
                                      imperfect, and thus to rise pertains to
                                      what is potentially and not actually
                                      above. Now in this sense, as Damascene
                                      says (De Fide Orth. iii, 24), "the human
                                      mind of Christ did not need to rise to
                                      God, since it was ever united to God both
                                      by personal being and by the blessed
                                      vision." Secondly, movement signifies the
                                      act of something perfect, i.e. something
                                      existing in act, as to understand and to
                                      feel are called movements; and in this
                                      sense the mind of Christ was always raised
                                      up to God, since He was always
                                      contemplating Him as existing above
                                      Himself.<br />

          Christi, cor meum et caro mea exultaverunt in Deum vivum. Sed
          sensualitas dicitur appetitus carnis. Ergo Christi sensualitas potuit

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it pertains to Christ to
          pray according to His sensuality. For it is written (<a

            >Ps. 83:3</a
          >) in the person of Christ: "My heart and My flesh have rejoiced in
          the Living God." Now sensuality is called the appetite of the flesh.
          Hence Christ's sensuality could ascend to the Living God by rejoicing;
          and with equal reason by praying.<br />

                  the sensuality was assumed by God to the unity of Person, even
                  as every other part of human nature. Much more, therefore,

                          sit actus sensualitatis. Et hoc modo Christus secundum
                          sensualitatem non oravit. Quia eius sensualitas
                          eiusdem naturae et speciei fuit in Christo et in
                          nobis. In nobis autem non potest orare, duplici
                          ratione. Primo quidem, quia motus sensualitatis non
                          potest sensualia transcendere, et ideo non potest in
                          Deum ascendere, quod requiritur ad orationem. Secundo,
                          quia oratio importat quandam ordinationem, prout
                          aliquis desiderat aliquid quasi a Deo implendum, et
                          hoc est solius rationis. Unde oratio est actus
                          rationis, ut in secunda parte habitum est.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To pray according to
                          sensuality may be understood in two ways. First as if
                          prayer itself were an act of the sensuality; and in
                          this sense Christ did not pray with His sensuality,
                          since His sensuality was of the same nature and
                          species in Christ as in us. Now in us the sensuality
                          cannot pray for two reasons; first because the
                          movement of the sensuality cannot transcend sensible
                          things, and, consequently, it cannot mount to God,
                          which is required for prayer; secondly, because prayer
                          implies a certain ordering inasmuch as we desire
                          something to be fulfilled by God; and this is the work
                          of reason alone. Hence prayer is an act of the reason,
                          as was said in the SS, Question [83], Article [1].<br />

                              Alio modo potest dici aliquis orare secundum
                              sensualitatem, quia scilicet eius ratio orando Deo
                              proposuit quod erat in appetitu sensualitatis
                              ipsius. Et secundum hoc, Christus oravit secundum
                              sensualitatem, inquantum scilicet eius oratio
                              exprimebat sensualitatis affectum, tanquam
                              sensualitatis advocata. Et hoc, ut nos de tribus
                              instrueret. Primo, ut ostenderet se veram humanam
                              naturam assumpsisse, cum omnibus naturalibus
                              affectibus. Secundo, ut ostenderet quod homini
                              licet, secundum naturalem affectum, aliquid velle
                              quod Deus non vult. Tertio, ut ostendat quod
                              proprium affectum debet homo divinae voluntati
                              subiicere. Unde Augustinus dicit, in Enchirid.,
                              sic Christus, hominem gerens, ostendit privatam
                              quandam hominis voluntatem, cum dicit, transeat a
                              me calix iste. Haec enim erat humana voluntas,
                              proprium aliquid, et tanquam privatum, volens. Sed
                              quia rectum vult esse hominem, et ad Deum dirigi,
                              subdit, veruntamen non sicut ego volo, sed sicut
                              tu, ac si dicat, vide te in me, quia potes aliquid
                              proprium velle, etsi Deus aliud velit.

                              Secondly, we may be said to pray according to the
                              sensuality when our prayer lays before God what is
                              in our appetite of sensuality; and in this sense
                              Christ prayed with His sensuality inasmuch as His
                              prayer expressed the desire of His sensuality, as
                              if it were the advocate of the sensuality---and
                              this, that He might teach us three things. First,
                              to show that He had taken a true human nature,
                              with all its natural affections: secondly, to show
                              that a man may wish with his natural desire what
                              God does not wish: thirdly, to show that man
                              should subject his own will to the Divine will.
                              Hence Augustine says in the Enchiridion (Serm. 1
                              in Ps. 32): "Christ acting as a man, shows the
                              proper will of a man when He says 'Let this
                              chalice pass from Me'; for this was the human will
                              desiring something proper to itself and, so to
                              say, private. But because He wishes man to be
                              righteous and to be directed to God, He adds:
                              'Nevertheless not as I will but as Thou wilt,' as
                              if to say, 'See thyself in Me, for thou canst
                              desire something proper to thee, even though God
                              wishes something else.'"<br />

          proficeret deprecationis sermo, ad profectum tamen fidei nostrae

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not fitting that
          Christ should pray for Himself. For Hilary says (De Trin. x):
          "Although His word of beseeching did not benefit Himself, yet He spoke
          for the profit of our faith." Hence it seems that Christ prayed not
          for Himself but for us.<br />

              Praeterea, nullus orat nisi pro eo quod vult, quia, sicut dictum
              est oratio est quaedam explicatio voluntatis per Deum implendae.
              Sed Christus volebat pati ea quae patiebatur, dicit enim
              Augustinus, XXVI contra Faustum, homo plerumque, etsi nolit,
              contristatur; etsi nolit, dormit; etsi nolit, esurit aut sitit.
              Ille autem, scilicet Christus, omnia ista habuit quia voluit. Ergo
              ei non competebat pro seipso orare.

                >Article [1]</a
              >), prayer is an unfolding of our will to God that He may fulfil
              it. Now Christ wished to suffer what He suffered. For Augustine
              says (Contra Faust. xxvi): "A man, though unwilling, is often
              angry; though unwilling, is sad; though unwilling, sleeps; though
              unwilling, hungers and thirsts. But He" (i.e. Christ) "did all
              these things, because He wished." Therefore it was not fitting
              that He should pray for Himself.<br />

                  Sed Christus illud implevit quod docuit secundum illud Act. I,
                  coepit Iesus facere et docere. Ergo Christus nunquam pro se

                  prayers to be offered individually and privately, lest when we

                  what He taught, according to Acts 1:1: "Jesus began to do and
                  to teach." Therefore Christ never prayed for Himself alone.<br />

                          sensualitatis, ut supra dictum est; vel etiam
                          voluntatis simplicis, quae consideratur ut natura;

                          quae consideratur ut ratio, sicut cum petiit gloriam
                          resurrectionis. Et hoc rationabiliter. Sicut enim
                          dictum est, Christus ad hoc uti voluit oratione ad
                          patrem, ut nobis daret exemplum orandi; et ut
                          ostenderet patrem suum esse auctorem a quo et
                          aeternaliter processit secundum divinam naturam, et
                          secundum humanam naturam ab eo habet quidquid boni
                          habet. Sicut autem in humana natura quaedam bona
                          habebat a patre iam percepta, ita etiam expectabat ab
                          eo quaedam bona nondum habita, sed percipienda. Et
                          ideo, sicut pro bonis iam perceptis in humana natura
                          gratias agebat patri, recognoscendo eum auctorem, ut
                          patet Matth. XXVI et Ioan. XI, ita etiam, ut patrem
                          auctorem recognosceret, ab eo orando petebat quae sibi

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ prayed for Himself
                          in two ways. First, by expressing the desire of His
                          sensuality, as stated above (<a

                          >); or also of His simple will, considered as a
                          nature; as when He prayed that the chalice of His
                          Passion might pass from Him (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A39"
                            >Mt. 26:39</a
                          >). Secondly, by expressing the desire of His
                          deliberate will, which is considered as reason; as
                          when He prayed for the glory of His Resurrection (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A1"

                          >). And this is reasonable. For as we have said above
                          (<a href="TP021.html#TPQ21A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad
                          1) Christ wished to pray to His Father in order to
                          give us an example of praying; and also to show that
                          His Father is the author both of His eternal
                          procession in the Divine Nature, and of all the good
                          that He possesses in the human nature. Now just as in
                          His human nature He had already received certain gifts
                          from His Father. so there were other gifts which He
                          had not yet received, but which He expected to
                          receive. And therefore, as He gave thanks to the
                          Father for gifts already received in His human nature,
                          by acknowledging Him as the author thereof, as we read
                          (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++26%3A27;+Jn++11:41"
                            >Mt. 26:27; Jn. 11:41</a
                          >): so also, in recognition of His Father, He besought
                          Him in prayer for those gifts still due to Him in His
                          human nature, such as the glory of His body, and the
                          like. And in this He gave us an example, that we
                          should give thanks for benefits received, and ask in
                          prayer for those we have not as yet.<br />

                                  every prayer was fulfilled. For in this
                                  respect also is it that other men's prayers
                                  are fulfilled, in that their will is in
                                  conformity with God, according to Rm. 8:27:
                                  "And He that searcheth the hearts knoweth,"
                                  that is, approves of, "what the Spirit
                                  desireth," that is, what the Spirit makes the
                                  saints to desire: "because He asketh for the
                                  saints according to God," that is, in
                                  conformity with the Divine will.<br />

                                      prayer for the passing of the chalice is
                                      variously explained by the Saints. For
                                      Hilary (Super Matth. 31) says: "When He
                                      asks that this may pass from Him, He does
                                      not pray that it may pass by Him, but that
                                      others may share in that which passes on
                                      from Him to them; So that the sense is: As
                                      I am partaking of the chalice of the
                                      passion, so may others drink of it, with
                                      unfailing hope, with unflinching anguish,
                                      without fear of death."<br />

                                                      Passion, or that He prayed
                                                      that the fear of drinking
                                                      His chalice might not

                                                      might not withhold Him,
                                                      His prayer was entirely
