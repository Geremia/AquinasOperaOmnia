          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod corpus Christi non fuerit
          formatum in primo instanti conceptionis. Dicitur enim Ioan. II,
          quadraginta et sex annis aedificatum est templum hoc, quod exponens
          Augustinus, in IV de Trin., dicit, hic numerus perfectioni dominici
          corporis aperte congruit. Et in libro octoginta trium quaest. dicit,
          non absurde quadraginta sex annis dicitur fabricatum esse templum,
          quod corpus eius figurabat, ut, quot anni fuerunt in fabricatione
          templi, tot dies fuerint in corporis dominici perfectione. Non ergo in
          primo instanti conceptionis corpus Christi fuit perfecte formatum.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body was not
          formed in the first instant of its conception. For it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++2%3A20"
            >Jn. 2:20</a
          >): "Six-and-forty years was this Temple in building"; on which words
          Augustine comments as follows (De Trin. iv): "This number applies
          manifestly to the perfection of our Lord's body." He says, further
          (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 56): "It is not without reason that the
          Temple, which was a type of His body, is said to have been forty-six
          years in building: so that as many years as it took to build the
          Temple, in so many days was our Lord's body perfected." Therefore
          Christ's body was not perfectly formed in the first instant of its
          conception.<br />

          in instanti, eo quod tempus motus dividitur secundum divisionem

          taken in movement is divided according to the division of the thing
          moved, as is proved Phys. vi. Therefore Christ's body was not formed

          could not be in the same instant both blood and flesh, because thus

          Therefore the last instant in which it was blood was distinct from the
          first instant in which it was flesh. But between any two instants
          there is an interval of time. Therefore Christ's body was not formed

          a fixed time for its act, so also does the generative power: for both

          same reason that the formation of His body, since that, too, belongs

          matter; thirdly, the development whereby it was brought to perfection

          whatever, the parts of which come into a place successively. The third
          also requires a succession of time: both because there is no increase
          without local movement, and because increase is effected by the power
          of the soul already informing the body, the operation of which power
          is subject to time.<br />

          Christi est formatum, ut supra dictum est. Tanto enim aliquod agens

          But the body's very formation, in which conception principally
          consists, was instantaneous, for two reasons. First, because of the
          infinite power of the agent, viz. the Holy Ghost, by whom Christ's
          body was formed, as stated above (<a href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1"
            >Question [32]</a
          >, <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). For the greater
          the power of an agent, the more quickly can it dispose matter; and,
          consequently, an agent of infinite power can dispose matter
          instantaneously to its due form. Secondly, on the part of the Person
          of the Son, whose body was being formed. For it was unbecoming that He
          should take to Himself a body as yet unformed. While, if the
          conception had been going on for any time before the perfect formation
          of the body, the whole conception could not be attributed to the Son
          of God, since it is not attributed to Him except by reason of the
          assumption of that body. Therefore in the first instant in which the
          various parts of the matter were united together in the place of
          generation, Christ's body was both perfectly formed and assumed. And
          thus is the Son of God said to have been conceived; nor could it be
          said otherwise.<br />

          Increase is caused by the augmentative power of that which is the
          subject of increase: but the formation of the body is caused by the
          generative power, not of that which is generated, but of the father
          generating from seed, in which the formative power derived from the
          father's soul has its operation. But Christ's body was not formed by
          the seed of man, as stated above (<a href="TP031.html#TPQ31OUTP1"

          the operation of the Holy Ghost. Therefore the formation thereof
          should be such as to be worthy of the Holy Ghost. But the development
          of Christ's body was the effect of the augmentative power in Christ's
          soul: and since this was of the same species as ours, it behooved His
          body to develop in the same way as the bodies of other men, so as to
          prove the reality of His human nature.<br />

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod corpus Christi non fuit
          animatum in primo instanti conceptionis. Dicit enim Leo Papa, in

          nostrae, nec alio illi quam ceteris hominibus anima est inspirata

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body was not
          animated in the first instant of its conception. For Pope Leo says
          (Ep. ad Julian.): "Christ's flesh was not of another nature than ours:
          nor was the beginning of His animation different from that of other
          men." But the soul is not infused into other men at the first instant
          of their conception. Therefore neither should Christ's soul have been
          infused into His body in the first instant of its conception.<br />

          bodies of other men when they are animated: otherwise, if afterwards
          its development had been continuous, either its birth would have
          occurred sooner, or at the time of birth He would have been a bigger
          child than others. The former alternative is contrary to what
          Augustine says (De Trin. iv), where he proves that Christ was in the
          Virgin's womb for the space of nine months: while the latter is
          contrary to what Pope Leo says (Serm. iv in Epiph.): "They found the

          quantity that a body has when the soul is first infused into it is in

          development: that is to say, men of greater stature have greater
          bodies at the time of first animation. But Christ at the perfect age
          was of becoming and middle stature: in proportion to which was the
          quantity of His body at the time when other men's bodies are animated;
          though it was less than theirs at the first instant of His conception.
          Nevertheless that quantity was not too small to safeguard the nature
          of an animated body; since it would have sufficed for the animation of

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod conceptio Christi fuerit
          naturalis. Secundum enim conceptionem carnis Christus dicitur filius
          hominis. Est autem verus et naturalis hominis filius, sicut et verus
          et naturalis Dei filius. Ergo eius conceptio fuit naturalis.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's conception was
          natural. For Christ is called the Son of Man by reason of His
          conception in the flesh. But He is a true and natural Son of Man: as
          also is He the true and natural Son of God. Therefore His conception
          was natural.<br />

          Praeterea, nulla creatura producit operationem miraculosam. Sed
          conceptio Christi attribuitur beatae virgini, quae est pura creatura,
          dicitur enim quod virgo Christum concepit. Ergo videtur quod non sit
          miraculosa, sed naturalis conceptio.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no creature can be the cause of a
          miraculous effect. But Christ's conception is attributed to the
          Blessed Virgin, who is a mere creature: for we say that the Virgin
          conceived Christ. Therefore it seems that His conception was not
          miraculous, but natural.<br />

          Praeterea, ad hoc quod aliqua transmutatio sit naturalis, sufficit
          quod principium passivum sit naturale, ut supra habitum est. Sed
          principium passivum ex parte matris in conceptione Christi fuit
          naturale, ut ex dictis patet. Ergo conceptio Christi fuit naturalis.

          <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, for a transformation to be
          natural, it is enough that the passive principle be natural, as stated
          above (<a href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1">Question [32]</a>,
          <a href="TP032.html#TPQ32A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But in Christ's
          conception the passive principle on the part of His Mother was
          natural, as we have shown (<a href="TP032.html#TPQ32OUTP1"

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut Ambrosius dicit, in libro de
          incarnatione, multa in hoc mysterio et secundum naturam invenies, et
          ultra naturam. Si enim consideremus id quod est ex parte materiae
          conceptus, quam mater ministravit, totum est naturale. Si vero
          consideremus id quod est ex parte virtutis activae, totum est
          miraculosum. Et quia unumquodque magis iudicatur secundum formam quam
          secundum materiam; et similiter secundum agens quam secundum patiens,
          inde est quod conceptio Christi debet dici simpliciter miraculosa et
          supernaturalis, sed secundum aliquid naturalis.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As Ambrose says (De Incarn. vi): "In this
          mystery thou shalt find many things that are natural, and many that
          are supernatural." For if we consider in this conception anything
          connected with the matter thereof, which was supplied by the mother,
          it was in all such things natural. But if we consider it on the part
          of the active power, thus it was entirely miraculous. And since
          judgment of a thing should be pronounced in respect of its form rather
          than of its matter: and likewise in respect of its activity rather
          than of its passiveness: therefore is it that Christ's conception
          should be described simply as miraculous and supernatural, although in
          a certain respect it was natural.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ is said to be a natural Son
          of Man, by reason of His having a true human nature, through which He
          is a Son of Man, although He had it miraculously; thus, too, the blind
          man to whom sight has been restored sees naturally by sight
          miraculously received.<br />

          so in the case in point. Therefore this conception cannot be called
