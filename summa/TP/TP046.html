          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was not necessary for
          Christ to suffer for the deliverance of the human race. For the human
          race could not be delivered except by God, according to Is. 45:21: "Am
          not I the Lord, and there is no God else besides Me? A just God and a
          Saviour, there is none besides Me." But no necessity can compel God,
          for this would be repugnant to His omnipotence. Therefore it was not
          necessary for Christ to suffer.<br />

          seem necessary that He should suffer on the part of the Divine mercy,
          which, as it bestows gifts freely, so it appears to condone debts
          without satisfaction: nor, again, on the part of Divine justice,
          according to which man had deserved everlasting condemnation.
          Therefore it does not seem necessary that Christ should have suffered

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut philosophus docet in V Metaphys.,
          necessarium multipliciter dicitur. Uno quidem modo, quod secundum sui
          naturam impossibile est aliter se habere. Et sic manifestum est quod
          non fuit necessarium Christum pati, neque ex parte Dei, neque ex parte
          hominis. Alio modo dicitur aliquid necessarium ex aliquo exteriori.
          Quod quidem si sit causa efficiens vel movens, facit necessitatem
          coactionis, utpote cum aliquis non potest ire propter violentiam
          detinentis ipsum. Si vero illud exterius quod necessitatem inducit,
          sit finis, dicetur aliquid necessarium ex suppositione finis, quando
          scilicet finis aliquis aut nullo modo potest esse, aut non potest esse
          convenienter, nisi tali fine praesupposito. Non fuit ergo necessarium
          Christum pati necessitate coactionis, neque ex parte Dei, qui Christum
          definivit pati; neque etiam ex parte ipsius Christi, qui voluntarie
          passus est. Fuit autem necessarium necessitate finis. Qui quidem
          potest tripliciter intelligi. Primo quidem, ex parte nostra, qui per
          eius passionem liberati sumus, secundum illud Ioan. III, oportet
          exaltari filium hominis, ut omnis qui credit in eum non pereat, sed
          habeat vitam aeternam. Secundo, ex parte ipsius Christi, qui per
          humilitatem passionis meruit gloriam exaltationis. Et ad hoc pertinet
          quod dicitur Luc. ult., haec oportuit Christum pati, et sic intrare in
          gloriam suam. Tertio, ex parte Dei, cuius definitio est circa
          passionem Christi praenuntiatam in Scripturis et praefiguratam in
          observantia veteris testamenti. Et hoc est quod dicitur Luc. XXII,
          filius hominis secundum quod definitum est vadit; et Luc. ult., haec
          sunt verba quae locutus sum ad vos cum adhuc essem vobiscum, quoniam
          necesse est impleri omnia quae scripta sunt in lege Moysi et prophetis
          et Psalmis de me; et, quoniam scriptum est quoniam oportebat Christum
          pati et resurgere a mortuis.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As the Philosopher teaches (Metaph. v),
          there are several acceptations of the word "necessary." In one way it
          means anything which of its nature cannot be otherwise; and in this
          way it is evident that it was not necessary either on the part of God
          or on the part of man for Christ to suffer. In another sense a thing
          may be necessary from some cause quite apart from itself; and should
          this be either an efficient or a moving cause then it brings about the
          necessity of compulsion; as, for instance, when a man cannot get away
          owing to the violence of someone else holding him. But if the external
          factor which induces necessity be an end, then it will be said to be
          necessary from presupposing such end---namely, when some particular
          end cannot exist at all, or not conveniently, except such end be
          presupposed. It was not necessary, then, for Christ to suffer from
          necessity of compulsion, either on God's part, who ruled that Christ
          should suffer, or on Christ's own part, who suffered voluntarily. Yet
          it was necessary from necessity of the end proposed; and this can be
          accepted in three ways. First of all, on our part, who have been
          delivered by His Passion, according to John (3:14): "The Son of man
          must be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him may not perish, but
          may have life everlasting." Secondly, on Christ's part, who merited
          the glory of being exalted, through the lowliness of His Passion: and
          to this must be referred Lk. 24:26: "Ought not Christ to have suffered
          these things, and so to enter into His glory?" Thirdly, on God's part,
          whose determination regarding the Passion of Christ, foretold in the
          Scriptures and prefigured in the observances of the Old Testament, had
          to be fulfilled. And this is what St. Luke says (22:22): "The Son of
          man indeed goeth, according to that which is determined"; and (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A44,46"
            >Lk. 24:44,46</a
          >): "These are the words which I spoke to you while I was yet with
          you, that all things must needs be fulfilled which are written in the
          law of Moses, and in the prophets, and in the psalms concerning Me:
          for it is thus written, and thus it behooved Christ to suffer, and to
          rise again from the dead."<br />

          Ad tertium dicendum quod hominem liberari per passionem Christi,
          conveniens fuit et misericordiae et iustitiae eius. Iustitiae quidem,

          That man should be delivered by Christ's Passion was in keeping with
          both His mercy and His justice. With His justice, because by His
          Passion Christ made satisfaction for the sin of the human race; and so
          man was set free by Christ's justice: and with His mercy, for since
          man of himself could not satisfy for the sin of all human nature, as
          was said above (<a href="TP001.html#TPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
          <a href="TP001.html#TPQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), God gave him His
          Son to satisfy for him, according to Rm. 3:24,25: "Being justified
          freely by His grace, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
          whom God hath proposed to be a propitiation, through faith in His
          blood." And this came of more copious mercy than if He had forgiven
          sins without satisfaction. Hence it is said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++2%3A4"
            >Eph. 2:4</a

          loved us, even when we were dead in sins, hath quickened us together
          in Christ."<br />

          "Christ called Himself the seed." Consequently, unless He suffered

          Even this justice depends on the Divine will, requiring satisfaction
          for sin from the human race. But if He had willed to free man from sin
          without any satisfaction, He would not have acted against justice. For
          a judge, while preserving justice, cannot pardon fault without
          penalty, if he must visit fault committed against another---for
          instance, against another man, or against the State, or any Prince in
          higher authority. But God has no one higher than Himself, for He is
          the sovereign and common good of the whole universe. Consequently, if
          He forgive sin, which has the formality of fault in that it is
          committed against Himself, He wrongs no one: just as anyone else,
          overlooking a personal trespass, without satisfaction, acts mercifully
          and not unjustly. And so David exclaimed when he sought mercy: "To
          Thee only have I sinned" (<a

          Respondeo dicendum quod tanto aliquis modus convenientior est ad
          assequendum finem, quanto per ipsum plura concurrunt quae sunt
          expedientia fini. Per hoc autem quod homo per Christi passionem est
          liberatus, multa occurrerunt ad salutem hominis pertinentia, praeter
          liberationem a peccato. Primo enim, per hoc homo cognoscit quantum
          Deus hominem diligat, et per hoc provocatur ad eum diligendum, in quo
          perfectio humanae salutis consistit. Unde apostolus dicit, Rom. V,
          commendat suam caritatem Deus in nobis, quoniam, cum inimici essemus,
          Christus pro nobis mortuus est. Secundo, quia per hoc dedit nobis
          exemplum obedientiae, humilitatis, constantiae, iustitiae, et
          ceterarum virtutum in passione Christi ostensarum, quae sunt
          necessariae ad humanam salutem. Unde dicitur I Pet. II, Christus
          passus est pro nobis, nobis relinquens exemplum, ut sequamur vestigia
          eius. Tertio, quia Christus per passionem suam non solum hominem a
          peccato liberavit, sed etiam gratiam iustificantem et gloriam
          beatitudinis ei promeruit, ut infra dicetur. Quarto, quia per hoc est
          homini indicta maior necessitas se immunem a peccato conservandi,
          secundum illud I Cor. VI, empti estis pretio magno, glorificate et
          portate Deum in corpore vestro. Quinto, quia hoc ad maiorem dignitatem
          cessit, ut, sicut homo victus fuerat et deceptus a Diabolo, ita etiam
          homo esset qui Diabolum vinceret; et sicut homo mortem meruit, ita
          homo moriendo mortem superaret; ut dicitur I Cor. XV, Deo gratias, qui
          dedit nobis victoriam per Iesum Christum. Et ideo convenientius fuit
          quod per passionem Christi liberaremur, quam per solam Dei voluntatem.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Among means to an end that one is the
          more suitable whereby the various concurring means employed are
          themselves helpful to such end. But in this that man was delivered by
          Christ's Passion, many other things besides deliverance from sin
          concurred for man's salvation. In the first place, man knows thereby
          how much God loves him, and is thereby stirred to love Him in return,
          and herein lies the perfection of human salvation; hence the Apostle
          says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A8"
            >Rm. 5:8</a
          >): "God commendeth His charity towards us; for when as yet we were
          sinners... Christ died for us." Secondly, because thereby He set us an
          example of obedience, humility, constancy, justice, and the other
          virtues displayed in the Passion, which are requisite for man's
          salvation. Hence it is written (1 Pt. 2:21): "Christ also suffered for
          us, leaving you an example that you should follow in His steps."
          Thirdly, because Christ by His Passion not only delivered man from
          sin, but also merited justifying grace for him and the glory of bliss,
          as shall be shown later (<a href="TP048.html#TPQ48OUTP1"
            >Question [48]</a
          >, <a href="TP048.html#TPQ48A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
          <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49OUTP1">Question [49]</a>,
          <a href="TP049.html#TPQ49ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>, 5). Fourthly,
          because by this man is all the more bound to refrain from sin,
          according to 1 Cor. 6:20: "You are bought with a great price: glorify
          and bear God in your body." Fifthly, because it redounded to man's
          greater dignity, that as man was overcome and deceived by the devil,
          so also it should be a man that should overthrow the devil; and as man
          deserved death, so a man by dying should vanquish death. Hence it is
          written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A57"
            >1 Cor. 15:57</a
          >): "Thanks be to God who hath given us the victory through our Lord
          Jesus Christ." It was accordingly more fitting that we should be
          delivered by Christ's Passion than simply by God's good-will.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Chrysostom [*Athanasius, Orat.

          not His own, (for since He is life itself, death could not be His),
          but men's death. Hence it was not by reason of His being bound to die
          that He laid His body aside, but because the death He endured was
          inflicted on Him by men. But even if His body had sickened and
          dissolved in the sight of all men, it was not befitting Him who healed
          the infirmities of others to have his own body afflicted with the
          same. And even had He laid His body aside without any sickness, and
          had then appeared, men would not have believed Him when He spoke of
          His resurrection. For how could Christ's victory over death appear,
          unless He endured it in the sight of all men, and so proved that death
          was vanquished by the incorruption of His body?"<br />

          Although the devil assailed man unjustly, nevertheless, on account of
          sin, man was justly left by God under the devil's bondage. And
          therefore it was fitting that through justice man should be delivered
          from the devil's bondage by Christ making satisfaction on his behalf
          in the Passion. This was also a fitting means of overthrowing the
          pride of the devil, "who is a deserter from justice, and covetous of
          sway"; in that Christ "should vanquish him and deliver man, not merely
          by the power of His Godhead, but likewise by the justice and lowliness
          of the Passion," as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii).<br />

          Primo quidem, propter exemplum virtutis. Dicit enim Augustinus, in

          First of all, as an example of virtue. For Augustine thus writes
          (Questions. lxxxiii, qu. 25): "God's Wisdom became man to give us an
          example in righteousness of living. But it is part of righteous living
          not to stand in fear of things which ought not to be feared. Now there
          are some men who, although they do not fear death in itself, are yet
          troubled over the manner of their death. In order, then, that no kind
          of death should trouble an upright man, the cross of this Man had to
          be set before him, because, among all kinds of death, none was more
          execrable, more fear-inspiring, than this."<br />

          Secundo, quia hoc genus mortis maxime conveniens erat satisfactioni
          pro peccato primi parentis, quod fuit ex eo quod, contra mandatum Dei,
          pomum ligni vetiti sumpsit. Et ideo conveniens fuit quod Christus, ad
          satisfaciendum pro peccato illo, seipsum pateretur ligno affigi, quasi
          restituens quod Adam sustulerat, secundum illud Psalmi, quae non
          rapui, tunc exsolvebam. Unde Augustinus dicit, in quodam sermone de

          Secondly, because this kind of death was especially suitable in order
          to atone for the sin of our first parent, which was the plucking of
          the apple from the forbidden tree against God's command. And so, to
          atone for that sin, it was fitting that Christ should suffer by being
          fastened to a tree, as if restoring what Adam had purloined; according
          to Ps. 68:5: "Then did I pay that which I took not away." Hence
          Augustine says in a sermon on the Passion [*Cf. Serm. ci De Tempore]:
          "Adam despised the command, plucking the apple from the tree: but all
          that Adam lost, Christ found upon the cross."<br />

          purified: and the earth felt a like benefit, for it was cleansed by
          the flowing of the blood from His side." And on Jn. 3:14: "The Son of

          providence diffused everywhere of Him who hung upon it." Chrysostom
          [*Athanasius, vide A. III, ad 2] also says that upon the cross "He
          dies with outstretched hands in order to draw with one hand the people

          The sixth reason is because of the various virtues denoted by this
          class of death. Hence Augustine in his book on the grace of the Old
          and New Testament (Ep. cxl) says: "Not without purpose did He choose
          this class of death, that He might be a teacher of that breadth, and
          height, and length, and depth," of which the Apostle speaks (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++3%3A18"
            >Eph. 3:18</a
          >): "For breadth is in the beam, which is fixed transversely above;
          this appertains to good works, since the hands are stretched out upon
          it. Length is the tree's extent from the beam to the ground; and there
          it is planted---that is, it stands and abides---which is the note of
          longanimity. Height is in that portion of the tree which remains over
          from the transverse beam upwards to the top, and this is at the head
          of the Crucified, because He is the supreme desire of souls of good
          hope. But that part of the tree which is hidden from view to hold it
          fixed, and from which the entire rood springs, denotes the depth of
          gratuitous grace." And, as Augustine says (Tract. cxix in Joan.): "The
          tree upon which were fixed the members of Him dying was even the chair
          of the Master teaching."<br />

          The seventh reason is because this kind of death responds to very many
          figures. For, as Augustine says in a sermon on the Passion (Serm. ci
          De Tempore), an ark of wood preserved the human race from the waters
          of the Deluge; at the exodus of God's people from Egypt, Moses with a
          rod divided the sea, overthrew Pharaoh and saved the people of God.
          the same Moses dipped his rod into the water, changing it from bitter
          to sweet; at the touch of a wooden rod a salutary spring gushed forth
          from a spiritual rock; likewise, in order to overcome Amalec, Moses
          stretched forth his arms with rod in hand; lastly, God's law is
          entrusted to the wooden Ark of the Covenant; all of which are like
          steps by which we mount to the wood of the cross.<br />

          The altar of holocausts, upon which the sacrifices of animals were
          immolated, was constructed of timbers, as is set forth Ex. 27:, and in
          this respect the truth answers to the figure; but "it is not necessary
          for it to be likened in every respect, otherwise it would not be a

          As Augustine says (Contra Faust. xiv), sin is accursed, and,
          consequently, so is death, and mortality, which comes of sin. "But
          Christ's flesh was mortal, 'having the resemblance of the flesh of
          sin'"; and hence Moses calls it "accursed," just as the Apostle calls
          it "sin," saying (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++5%3A21"
            >2 Cor. 5:21</a
          >): "Him that knew no sin, for us He hath made sin"---namely, because
          of the penalty of sin. "Nor is there greater ignominy on that account,
          because he said: 'He is accursed of God.'" For, "unless God had hated
          sin, He would never have sent His Son to take upon Himself our death,
          and to destroy it. Acknowledge, then, that it was for us He took the
          curse upon Himself, whom you confess to have died for us." Hence it is
          written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A13"
            >Gal. 3:13</a

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Human sufferings may be considered under
          two aspects. First of all, specifically, and in this way it was not
          necessary for Christ to endure them all, since many are mutually
          exclusive, as burning and drowning; for we are dealing now with
          sufferings inflicted from without, since it was not beseeming for Him
          to endure those arising from within, such as bodily ailments, as
          already stated (<a href="TP014.html#TPQ14OUTP1">Question [14]</a>,
          <a href="TP014.html#TPQ14A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But, speaking
          generically, He did endure every human suffering. This admits of a
          threefold acceptance. First of all, on the part of men: for He endured
          something from Gentiles and from Jews; from men and from women, as is
          clear from the women servants who accused Peter. He suffered from the
          rulers, from their servants and from the mob, according to Ps. 2:1,2:
          "Why have the Gentiles raged, and the people devised vain things? The
          kings of the earth stood up, and the princes met together, against the
          Lord and against His Christ." He suffered from friends and
          acquaintances, as is manifest from Judas betraying and Peter denying
          Him.<br />

          Secondly, the same is evident on the part of the sufferings which a

          glory, from the mockeries and the insults heaped upon Him; in things,

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the pain of Christ's
          Passion was not greater than all other pains. For the sufferer's pain
          is increased by the sharpness and the duration of the suffering. But
          some of the martyrs endured sharper and more prolonged pains than
          Christ, as is seen in St. Lawrence, who was roasted upon a gridiron;
          and in St. Vincent, whose flesh was torn with iron pincers. Therefore
          it seems that the pain of the suffering Christ was not the
          greatest.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est cum de defectibus

          sensibilis, qui causatur ex corporali nocivo; et dolor interior, qui

          sensibilibus, scilicet in manibus et pedibus; et ipsum pondus corporis
          pendentis continue auget dolorem; et cum hoc etiam est doloris
          diuturnitas, quia non statim moriuntur, sicut hi qui sunt gladio
          interfecti. Doloris autem interioris causa fuit, primo quidem, omnia
          peccata humani generis, pro quibus satisfaciebat patiendo, unde ea
          quasi sibi adscribit, dicens in Psalmo, verba delictorum meorum.
          Secundo, specialiter casus Iudaeorum et aliorum in eius mortem
          delinquentium, et praecipue discipulorum, qui scandalum passi fuerant
          in Christi passione. Tertio etiam amissio vitae corporalis, quae
          naturaliter est horribilis humanae naturae.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have stated, when treating of the
          defects assumed by Christ (<a href="TP015.html#TPQ15OUTP1"
            >Question [15]</a
          >, <a href="TP015.html#TPQ15ATHEP1">Articles [5]</a>,6), there was
          true and sensible pain in the suffering Christ, which is caused by
          something hurtful to the body: also, there was internal pain, which is
          caused from the apprehension of something hurtful, and this is termed
          "sadness." And in Christ each of these was the greatest in this
          present life. This arose from four causes. First of all, from the
          sources of His pain. For the cause of the sensitive pain was the
          wounding of His body; and this wounding had its bitterness, both from
          the extent of the suffering already mentioned (<a
            href="TP046.html#TPQ46A5THEP1"
            >Article [5]</a
          >) and from the kind of suffering, since the death of the crucified is
          most bitter, because they are pierced in nervous and highly sensitive
          parts---to wit, the hands and feet; moreover, the weight of the
          suspended body intensifies the agony, and besides this there is the
          duration of the suffering because they do not die at once like those
          slain by the sword. The cause of the interior pain was, first of all,
          all the sins of the human race, for which He made satisfaction by
          suffering; hence He ascribes them, so to speak, to Himself, saying (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++21%3A2"
            >Ps. 21:2</a
          >): "The words of my sins." Secondly, especially the fall of the Jews
          and of the others who sinned in His death chiefly of the apostles, who
          were scandalized at His Passion. Thirdly, the loss of His bodily life,
          which is naturally horrible to human nature.<br />

          miraculously by the operation of the Holy Ghost; just as some other
          things made by miracles are better than others, as Chrysostom says
          (Hom. xxii in Joan.) respecting the wine into which Christ changed the
          water at the wedding-feast. And, consequently, Christ's sense of
          touch, the sensitiveness of which is the reason for our feeling pain,
          was most acute. His soul likewise, from its interior powers,
          apprehended most vehemently all the causes of sadness.<br />

          Moral virtue lessens interior sadness in one way, and outward
          sensitive pain in quite another; for it lessens interior sadness
          directly by fixing the mean, as being its proper matter, within
          limits. But, as was laid down in the FS, Question [64], Article [2],
          moral virtue fixes the mean in the passions, not according to
          mathematical quantity, but according to quantity of proportion, so
          that the passion shall not go beyond the rule of reason. And since the
          Stoics held all sadness to be unprofitable, they accordingly believed
          it to be altogether discordant with reason, and consequently to be
          shunned altogether by a wise man. But in very truth some sadness is
          praiseworthy, as Augustine proves (De Civ. Dei xiv)---namely, when it
          flows from holy love, as, for instance, when a man is saddened over
          his own or others' sins. Furthermore, it is employed as a useful means
          of satisfying for sins, according to the saying of the Apostle (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++7%3A10"
            >2 Cor. 7:10</a
          >): "The sorrow that is according to God worketh penance, steadfast
          unto salvation." And so to atone for the sins of all men, Christ
          accepted sadness, the greatest in absolute quantity, yet not exceeding
          the rule of reason. But moral virtue does not lessen outward sensitive
          pain, because such pain is not subject to reason, but follows the
          nature of the body; yet it lessens it indirectly by redundance of the
          higher powers into the lower. But this did not happen in Christ's
          case, as stated above (cf.

          The pain of a suffering, separated soul belongs to the state of future
          condemnation, which exceeds every evil of this life, just as the glory
          of the saints surpasses every good of the present life. Accordingly,
          when we say that Christ's pain was the greatest, we make no comparison
          between His and the pain of a separated soul. But Adam's body could
          not suffer, except he sinned. so that he would become mortal, and
          passible. And, though actually suffering, it would have felt less pain
          than Christ's body, for the reasons already stated. From all this it
          is clear that even if by impassibility Adam had suffered in the state
          of innocence, his pain would have been less than Christ's.<br />

          Christ grieved not only over the loss of His own bodily life, but also
          over the sins of all others. And this grief in Christ surpassed all
          grief of every contrite heart, both because it flowed from a greater
          wisdom and charity, by which the pang of contrition is intensified,
          and because He grieved at the one time for all sins, according to Is.
          53:4: "Surely He hath carried our sorrows." But such was the dignity
          of Christ's life in the body, especially on account of the Godhead
          united with it, that its loss, even for one hour, would be a matter of
          greater grief than the loss of another man's life for howsoever long a
          time. Hence the Philosopher says (Ethic. iii) that the man of virtue
          loves his life all the more in proportion as he knows it to be better;
          and yet he exposes it for virtue's sake. And in like fashion Christ
          laid down His most beloved life for the good of charity, according to
          Jer. 12:7: "I have given My dear soul into the hands of her
          enemies."<br />

          The sufferer's innocence does lessen numerically the pain of the
          suffering, since, when a guilty man suffers, he grieves not merely on
          account of the penalty, but also because of the crime. whereas the
          innocent man grieves only for the penalty: yet this pain is more
          intensified by reason of his innocence, in so far as he deems the hurt
          inflicted to be the more undeserved. Hence it is that even others are
          more deserving of blame if they do not compassionate him. according to

          thus, sight may suffer from superabundance of the visible object. In

          is based; as sight suffers when the sense of touch in the eye is

          So, then, we say that if the soul be considered with respect to its
          essence, it is evident that Christ's whole soul suffered. For the
          soul's whole essence is allied with the body, so that it is entire in
          the whole body and in its every part. Consequently, when the body
          suffered and was disposed to separate from the soul, the entire soul
          suffered. But if we consider the whole soul according to its
          faculties, speaking thus of the proper passions of the faculties, He
          suffered indeed as to all His lower powers; because in all the soul's
          lower powers, whose operations are but temporal, there was something
          to be found which was a source of woe to Christ, as is evident from
          what was said above (<a href="TP046.html#TPQ46A6THEP1">Article [6]</a

          its object, which is God, who was the cause, not of grief, but rather
          of delight and joy, to the soul of Christ. Nevertheless, all the
          powers of Christ's soul did suffer according as any faculty is said to
          be affected as regards its subject, because all the faculties of
          Christ's soul were rooted in its essence, to which suffering extended

          paschalis, unde et apostolus dicit, I Cor. V, Pascha nostrum immolatus
          est Christus. Sed agnus paschalis immolabatur quartadecima die ad
          vesperam, ut dicitur Exod. XII. Ergo videtur quod Christus tunc
          debuerit pati. Quod patet esse falsum, nam tunc Pascha cum suis
          discipulis celebravit, secundum illud Marc. XIV, prima die azymorum,

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ did not suffer at
          a suitable time. For Christ's Passion was prefigured by the sacrifice
          of the Paschal lamb: hence the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++5%3A7"
            >1 Cor. 5:7</a
          >): "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed." But the paschal lamb was slain
          "on the fourteenth day at eventide," as is stated in Ex. 12:6.
          Therefore it seems that Christ ought to have suffered then; which is
          manifestly false: for He was then celebrating the Pasch with His
          disciples, according to Mark's account (14:12): "On the first day of
          the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch"; whereas it was
          on the following day that He suffered.<br />

          But even this solution does not tally with Mark, who says: "On the
          first day of the unleavened bread, when they sacrificed the Pasch."
          Consequently Christ and the Jews celebrated the ancient Pasch at the
          one time. And as Bede says on Lk. 22:7,8: "Although Christ who is our
          Pasch was slain on the following day---that is, on the fifteenth day

          delivering to the disciples to be celebrated, the mysteries of His
          body and blood, and being held and bound by the Jews, He hallowed the
          opening of His own immolation---that is, of His Passion."<br />

          refer to the fourteenth day of the moon, which then fell upon the
          Thursday: for the fifteenth day of the moon was the most solemn day of
          the Pasch with the Jews: and so the same day which John calls "before
          the festival day of the Pasch," on account of the natural distinction
          of days, Matthew calls the first day of the unleavened bread, because,
          according to the rite of the Jewish festivity, the solemnity began
          from the evening of the preceding day. When it is said, then, that
          they were going to eat the Pasch on the fifteenth day of the month, it
          is to be understood that the Pasch there is not called the Paschal
          lamb, which was sacrificed on the fourteenth day, but the Paschal
          food---that is, the unleavened bread---which had to be eaten by the
          clean. Hence Chrysostom in the same passage gives another explanation,
          that the Pasch can be taken as meaning the whole feast of the Jews,
          which lasted seven days.<br />

          As Augustine says (De Consensu Evang. iii): "'It was about the sixth
          hour' when the Lord was delivered up by Pilate to be crucified," as
          John relates. For it "was not quite the sixth hour, but about the
          sixth---that is, it was after the fifth, and when part of the sixth
          had been entered upon until the sixth hour was ended---that the
          darkness began, when Christ hung upon the cross. It is understood to
          have been the third hour when the Jews clamored for the Lord to be
          crucified: and it is most clearly shown that they crucified Him when
          they clamored out. Therefore, lest anyone might divert the thought of
          so great a crime from the Jews to the soldiers, he says: 'It was the
          third hour, and they crucified Him,' that they before all may be found
          to have crucified Him, who at the third hour clamored for His
          crucifixion. Although there are not wanting some persons who wish the
          Parasceve to be understood as the third hour, which John recalls,
          saying: 'It was the Parasceve, about the sixth hour.' For 'Parasceve'
          is interpreted 'preparation.' But the true Pasch, which was celebrated
          in the Lord's Passion, began to be prepared from the ninth hour of the
          night---namely, when the chief priests said: 'He is deserving of
          death.'" According to John, then, "the sixth hour of the Parasceve"
          lasts from that hour of the night down to Christ's crucifixion; while,
          according to Mark, it is the third hour of the day.<br />

          For three reasons Christ suffered outside the gate, and not in the
          Temple nor in the city. First of all, that the truth might correspond
          with the figure. For the calf and the goat which were offered in most
          solemn sacrifice for expiation on behalf of the entire multitude were
          burnt outside the camp, as commanded in Lev. 16:27. Hence it is

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b>
          According to Jerome, in his commentary on Mt. 27:33, "someone
          explained 'the place of Calvary' as being the place where Adam was
          buried; and that it was so called because the skull of the first man
          was buried there. A pleasing interpretation indeed, and one suited to
          catch the ear of the people, but, still, not the true one. For the
          spots where the condemned are beheaded are outside the city and beyond
          the gates, deriving thence the name of Calvary---that is, of the
          beheaded. Jesus, accordingly, was crucified there, that the standards
          of martyrdom might be uplifted over what was formerly the place of the
          condemned. But Adam was buried close by Hebron and Arbe, as we read in
          the book of Jesus Ben Nave." But Jesus was to be crucified in the
          common spot of the condemned rather than beside Adam's sepulchre, to
          make it manifest that Christ's cross was the remedy, not only for
          Adam's personal sin, but also for the sin of the entire world.<br />

          noxios quasi noxius crucifigitur. Secundo, ut dicit Leo Papa, in

          As to God's ordinance, Christ was crucified with thieves, because, as
          Jerome says on Mt. 27:33: "As Christ became accursed of the cross for
          us, so for our salvation He was crucified as a guilty one among the
          guilty." Secondly, as Pope Leo observes (Serm. iv de Passione): "Two
          thieves were crucified, one on His right hand and one on His left, to
          set forth by the very appearance of the gibbet that separation of all
          men which shall be made in His hour of judgment." And Augustine on Jn.
          7:36: "The very cross, if thou mark it well, was a judgment-seat: for
          the judge being set in the midst, the one who believed was delivered,
          the other who mocked Him was condemned. Already He has signified what
          He shall do to the quick and the dead; some He will set on His right,
          others on His left hand." Thirdly, according to Hilary (Comm. xxxiii
          in Matth.): "Two thieves are set, one upon His right and one upon His
          left, to show that all mankind is called to the sacrament of His
          Passion. But because of the cleavage between believers and
          unbelievers, the multitude is divided into right and left, those on
          the right being saved by the justification of faith." Fourthly,
          because, as Bede says on Mk. 15:27: "The thieves crucified with our
          Lord denote those who, believing in and confessing Christ, either
          endure the conflict of martyrdom or keep the institutes of stricter
          observance. But those who do the like for the sake of everlasting
          glory are denoted by the faith of the thief on the right; while others
          who do so for the sake of human applause copy the mind and behavior of
          the one on the left."<br />

          glory." But Christ is the Lord of glory in respect of His Godhead.
          Therefore Christ's Passion is attributed to Him in respect of His
          Godhead.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, unio humanae naturae
          et divinae facta est in persona et hypostasi et supposito, manente
          tamen distinctione naturarum, ut scilicet sit eadem persona et
          hypostasis divinae et humanae naturae, salva tamen utriusque naturae
          proprietate. Et ideo, sicut supra dictum est, supposito divinae
          naturae attribuenda est passio, non ratione divinae naturae, quae est
          impassibilis, sed ratione humanae naturae. Unde in epistola synodali
          Cyrilli dicitur, si quis non confitetur Dei verbum passum carne et
          crucifixum carne, anathema sit. Pertinet ergo passio Christi ad

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
            href="TP002.html#TPQ2OUTP1"
            >Question [2]</a
          >, <a href="TP002.html#TPQ2ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2,3,6), the union
          of the human nature with the Divine was effected in the Person, in the
          hypostasis, in the suppositum, yet observing the distinction of
          natures; so that it is the same Person and hypostasis of the Divine
          and human natures, while each nature retains that which is proper to
          it. And therefore, as stated above (<a href="TP016.html#TPQ16OUTP1"
            >Question [16]</a
          >, <a href="TP016.html#TPQ16A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), the Passion is
          to be attributed to the suppositum of the Divine Nature, not because
          of the Divine Nature, which is impassible, but by reason of the human
          nature. Hence, in a Synodal Epistle of Cyril [*Act. Conc. Ephes., P.
          i, cap. 26] we read: "If any man does not confess that the Word of God
          suffered in the flesh and was crucified in the flesh, let him be
          anathema." Therefore Christ's Passion belongs to the "suppositum" of
          the Divine Nature by reason of the passible nature assumed, but not on
          account of the impassible Divine Nature.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As the passage quoted goes on to
          say: "The Jews did not crucify one who was simply a man; they
          inflicted their presumptions upon God. For suppose a prince to speak
          by word of mouth, and that his words are committed to writing on a
          parchment and sent out to the cities, and that some rebel tears up the
          document, he will be led forth to endure the death sentence, not for
          merely tearing up a document, but as destroying the imperial message.
          Let not the Jew, then, stand in security, as crucifying a mere man;
          since what he saw was as the parchment, but what was hidden under it
          was the imperial Word, the Son by nature, not the mere utterance of a
          tongue."<br />
