          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod circumcisio non fuerit

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that circumcision was not a
          preparation for, and a figure of Baptism. For every figure has some
          likeness to that which it foreshadows. But circumcision has no
          likeness to Baptism. Therefore it seems that it was not a preparation
          for, and a figure of Baptism.<br />

              dicit quod in circumcisione baptizati sint. Ergo protectio

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Apostle, speaking of the
              Fathers of old, says (1 Cor. 10:2), that "all were baptized in the
              cloud, and in the sea": but not that they were baptized in
              circumcision. Therefore the protecting pillar of a cloud, and the
              crossing of the Red Sea, rather than circumcision, were a
              preparation for, and a figure of Baptism.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Baptism is called the
                          Sacrament of Faith; in so far, to wit, as in Baptism
                          man makes a profession of faith, and by Baptism is
                          aggregated to the congregation of the faithful. Now
                          our faith is the same as that of the Fathers of old,
                          according to the Apostle (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++4%3A13"

                          >): "Having the same spirit of faith... we...
                          believe." But circumcision was a protestation of
                          faith; wherefore by circumcision also men of old were
                          aggregated to the body of the faithful. Consequently,
                          it is manifest that circumcision was a preparation for
                          Baptism and a figure thereof, forasmuch as "all things
                          happened" to the Fathers of old "in figure" (<a

          inconvenienter instituta. Sicut enim dictum est, in circumcisione
          fiebat quaedam professio fidei. Sed a peccato primi hominis nullus
          unquam salvari potuit nisi per fidem passionis Christi, secundum illud
          Rom. III, quem proposuit Deus propitiatorem per fidem in sanguine

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that circumcision was instituted
          in an unfitting manner. For as stated above (<a
            href="TP070.html#TPQ70A1THEP1"
            >Article [1]</a
          >) a profession of faith was made in circumcision. But none could ever
          be delivered from the first man's sin, except by faith in Christ's
          Passion, according to Rm. 3:25: "Whom God hath proposed to be a
          propitiation, through faith in His blood." Therefore circumcision
          should have been instituted forthwith after the first man's sin, and
          not at the time of Abraham.<br />

              Praeterea, in circumcisione profitebatur homo observantiam veteris

              apostolus dicit, Galat. V, testificor omni homini circumcidenti se
              quoniam debitor est universae legis faciendae. Sed legalis
              observantia non est tradita tempore Abrahae, sed magis tempore
              Moysi. Ergo inconvenienter instituta est circumcisio tempore
              Abrahae.

              profession of keeping the Old Law, just as in Baptism he makes
              profession of keeping the New Law; wherefore the Apostle says (<a

              debtor to do the whole Law." But the observance of the Law was not
              promulgated at the time of Abraham, but rather at the time of
              Moses. Therefore it was unfitting for circumcision to be
              instituted at the time of Abraham<br />

                                  both faith and natural reason flourished in
                                  man to such an extent, that there was no need
                                  for any signs of faith and salvation to be
                                  prescribed to him, but each one was wont to
                                  make protestation of his faith, by outward
                                  signs of his profession, according as he

                                          Baptism contains in itself the
                                          perfection of salvation, to which God
                                          calls all men, according to 1 Tim.
                                          2:4: "Who will have all men to be
                                          saved." Wherefore Baptism is offered
                                          to all nations. On the other hand
                                          circumcision did not contain the
                                          perfection of salvation, but signified

                                          was to be born of the Jewish nation.
                                          For this reason circumcision was given
                                          to that nation alone.<br />

                                              as a sign of Abraham's faith, who
                                              believed that himself would be the

            >Articles [1]</a
          >,2), was a profession of faith. But faith is in the apprehensive
          power, whose operations appear mostly in the head. Therefore the sign
          of circumcision should have been conferred on the head rather than on
          the virile member.<br />

              which is used for washing, and bread, which we use for
              nourishment. But, in cutting, we use an iron knife more commonly

                  circumcision, as Bede says (Hom. in Circum.). But now Baptism
                  is not put off until the eighth day, lest children should be
                  in danger of loss on account of original sin, if they should
                  die before being baptized. On the other hand, sometimes
                  Baptism is put off until after the eighth day. Therefore the
                  eighth day should not have been fixed for circumcision, but
                  this day should have been anticipated, just as sometimes it

                                              Hence on Prov. 4:3: "I was... an
                                              only son in the sight of my
                                              mother," a gloss says, that
                                              Bersabee's other baby boy did not
                                              count because through dying before
                                              the eighth day it received no
                                              name; and consequently neither was
                                              it circumcised.<br />

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod circumcisio non conferebat
          gratiam iustificantem. Dicit enim apostolus, Galat. II, si ex lege est
          iustitia, Christus gratis mortuus est, idest sine causa. Sed
          circumcisio erat quaedam obligatio legis implendae, secundum illud
          Galat. V, testificor omni homini circumcidenti se quoniam debitor est
          universae legis faciendae. Ergo, si ex circumcisione est iustitia,
          Christus gratis, idest sine causa, mortuus est. Sed hoc est
          inconveniens. Non ergo ex circumcisione erat gratia iustificans a
          peccato.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that circumcision did not bestow
          sanctifying grace. For the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++2%3A21"
            >Gal. 2:21</a
          >): "If justice be by the Law, then Christ died in vain," i.e. without
          cause. But circumcision was an obligation imposed by the Law,
          according to Gal. 5:3: "I testify... to every man circumcising
          himself, that ne is a debtor to do the whole law." Therefore, if
          justice be by circumcision, "Christ died in vain," i.e. without cause.
          But this cannot be allowed. Therefore circumcision did not confer
          grace whereby the sinner is made righteous.<br />

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, ante institutionem circumcisionis sola fides ad
              iustificationem sufficiebat, dicit enim Gregorius, in Moral., quod
              apud nos valet aqua Baptismatis, hoc egit apud veteres pro
              parvulis sola fides. Sed virtus fidei non est imminuta propter
              mandatum circumcisionis. Ergo sola fides parvulos iustificabat, et
              non circumcisio.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, before the institution of
              circumcision faith alone sufficed for justification; hence Gregory
              says (Moral. iv): "Faith alone did of old in behalf of infants
              that for which the water of Baptism avails with us." But faith has
              lost nothing of its strength through the commandment of
              circumcision. Therefore faith alone justified little ones, and not
              circumcision.<br />

                  omnes qui in deserto mortui sunt, tam parvuli quam adulti,
                  fuerint damnati. Et eadem obiectio est de pueris qui

                  sin was taken away by circumcision, it seems that all who died
                  in the desert, both little children and adults, were lost. And

                                  remit sin. The Master holds this opinion
                                  (Sent. iv, D, 1), and in a gloss on Rm. 4:11.
                                  But this is impossible, since guilt is not

                                      grace. Secondly, because, in the order of
                                      the formal cause, positive effects
                                      naturally precede those that denote
                                      privation, although it is the reverse in
                                      the order of the material cause: since a

                                          Consequently, others said that grace
                                          was conferred in circumcision, also as
                                          a particular positive effect
                                          consisting in being made worthy of

                                          effects, for it did not suffice for
                                          the repression of the concupiscence of

                                          And this was my opinion at one time
                                          (Sent. iv, D, 1;

                                          not true. Because the least grace can
                                          resist any degree of concupiscence,
                                          and avoid every mortal sin, that is
                                          committed in transgressing the
                                          precepts of the Law; for the smallest
                                          degree of charity loves God more than
                                          cupidity loves "thousands of gold and

                                              We must say, therefore, that grace
                                              was bestowed in circumcision as to
                                              all the effects of grace, but not
                                              as in Baptism. Because in Baptism
                                              grace is bestowed by the very
                                              power of Baptism itself, which
                                              power Baptism has as the
                                              instrument of Christ's Passion
                                              already consummated. Whereas
                                              circumcision bestowed grace,
                                              inasmuch as it was a sign of faith
                                              in Christ's future Passion: so
                                              that the man who was circumcised,
                                              professed to embrace that faith;
                                              whether, being an adult, he made
                                              profession for himself, or, being
                                              a child, someone else made
                                              profession for him. Hence, too,
                                              the Apostle says (<a
                                                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A11"

                                              >), that Abraham "received the
                                              sign of circumcision, a seal of
                                              the justice of the faith":
                                              because, to wit, justice was of
                                              faith signified: not of
                                              circumcision signifying. And since
                                              Baptism operates instrumentally by
                                              the power of Christ's Passion,
                                              whereas circumcision does not,
                                              therefore Baptism imprints a
                                              character that incorporates man in

                                              copiously than does circumcision;
                                              since greater is the effect of a
                                              thing already present, than of the

                                                      institution. But before,
                                                      there was no need of a
                                                      sign expressive of this
                                                      faith; because as yet
                                                      believers had not begun to
                                                      be united together apart

                                                      worship of one God. It is

                                                      offered up some prayers to
