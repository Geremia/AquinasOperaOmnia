          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod in Christo non fuerit aliqua
          scientia praeter divinam. Ad hoc enim necessaria est scientia ut per
          eam aliqua cognoscantur. Sed Christus per scientiam divinam
          cognoscebat omnia. Superfluum igitur fuisset quod in eo esset quaedam
          alia scientia.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was no
          knowledge except the Divine. For knowledge is necessary that things
          may be known thereby. But by His Divine knowledge Christ knew all
          things. Therefore any other knowledge would have been superfluous in
          Him.<br />

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the lesser light is dimmed by
              the greater. But all created knowledge in comparison with the
              uncreated knowledge of God is as the lesser to the greater light.
              Therefore there shone in Christ no other knowledge except the
              Divine.<br />

                  Praeterea, unio humanae naturae ad divinam facta est in
                  persona, ut ex supra dictis patet. Ponitur autem in Christo,
                  secundum quosdam, quaedam scientia unionis, per quam scilicet
                  Christus ea quae ad mysterium incarnationis pertinent plenius
                  scivit quam aliquis alius. Cum ergo unio personalis contineat
                  duas naturas, videtur quod in Christo non sint duae scientiae,
                  sed una tantum scientia pertinens ad utramque naturam.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the union of the human
                  nature with the Divine took place in the Person, as is clear
                  from Question [2], Article [2]. Now, according to some there
                  is in Christ a certain "knowledge of the union," whereby
                  Christ knew what belongs to the mystery of the Incarnation
                  more fully than anyone else. Hence, since the personal union
                  contains two natures, it would seem that there are not two
                  knowledges in Christ, but one only, pertaining to both
                  natures.<br />

                      Sed contra est quod Ambrosius dicit, in libro de
                      incarnatione, Deus in carne perfectionem humanae naturae
                      assumpsit, suscepit sensum hominis, sed non sensum carnis
                      inflatum. Sed ad sensum hominis pertinet scientia creata.
                      Ergo in eo fuit alia scientia praeter divinam.

                      <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Ambrose says (De Incarnat.
                      vii): "God assumed the perfection of human nature in the
                      flesh; He took upon Himself the sense of man, but not the
                      swollen sense of the flesh." But created knowledge
                      pertains to the sense of man. Therefore in Christ there
                      was created knowledge.

                          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut ex supra dictis patet,
                          filius Dei humanam naturam integram assumpsit, idest,
                          non corpus solum, sed etiam animam; non solum
                          sensitivam, sed etiam rationalem. Et ideo oportuit
                          quod haberet scientiam creatam, propter tria. Primo
                          quidem, propter animae perfectionem. Anima enim,
                          secundum se considerata, est in potentia ad
                          intelligibilia cognoscenda, est enim sicut tabula in
                          qua nihil est scriptum; et tamen possibile est in ea
                          scribi, propter intellectum possibilem, in quo est
                          omnia fieri, ut dicitur in III de anima. Quod autem
                          est in potentia, est imperfectum nisi reducatur ad
                          actum. Non autem fuit conveniens ut filius Dei humanam
                          naturam imperfectam assumeret, sed perfectam, utpote
                          qua mediante, totum humanum genus erat ad perfectum
                          reducendum. Et ideo oportuit quod anima Christi esset
                          perfecta per aliquam scientiam, quae esset proprie
                          perfectio eius. Et ideo oportuit in Christo esse
                          aliquam scientiam praeter scientiam divinam. Alioquin
                          anima Christi esset imperfectior omnibus animabus
                          aliorum hominum. Secundo quia, cum quaelibet res sit
                          propter suam operationem, ut dicitur in II de caelo et
                          mundo, frustra haberet Christus animam intellectualem,
                          si non intelligeret secundum illam. Quod pertinet ad
                          scientiam creatam. Tertio, quia aliqua scientia creata
                          pertinet ad animae humanae naturam, scilicet illa per
                          quam naturaliter cognoscimus prima principia,
                          scientiam enim hic large accipimus pro qualibet
                          cognitione intellectus humani. Nihil autem naturalium
                          Christo defuit, quia totam humanam naturam suscepit,
                          ut supra dictum est. Et ideo in sexta synodo damnata
                          est positio negantium in Christo duas esse scientias,
                          vel duas sapientias.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As said above (<a
                            href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"
                            >Question [5]</a
                          >), the Son of God assumed an entire human nature,
                          i.e. not only a body, but also a soul, and not only a
                          sensitive, but also a rational soul. And therefore it
                          behooved Him to have created knowledge, for three
                          reasons. First, on account of the soul's perfection.
                          For the soul, considered in itself, is in potentiality
                          to knowing intelligible things. since it is like "a
                          tablet on which nothing is written," and yet it may be
                          written upon through the possible intellect, whereby
                          it may become all things, as is said De Anima iii, 18.
                          Now what is in potentiality is imperfect unless
                          reduced to act. But it was fitting that the Son of God
                          should assume, not an imperfect, but a perfect human
                          nature, since the whole human race was to be brought
                          back to perfection by its means. Hence it behooved the
                          soul of Christ to be perfected by a knowledge, which
                          would be its proper perfection. And therefore it was
                          necessary that there should be another knowledge in
                          Christ besides the Divine knowledge, otherwise the
                          soul of Christ would have been more imperfect than the
                          souls of the rest of men. Secondly, because, since
                          everything is on account of its operation, as stated
                          De Coel. ii, 17, Christ would have had an intellective
                          soul to no purpose if He had not understood by it; and
                          this pertains to created knowledge. Thirdly, because
                          some created knowledge pertains to the nature of the
                          human soul, viz. that whereby we naturally know first
                          principles; since we are here taking knowledge for any
                          cognition of the human intellect. Now nothing natural
                          was wanting to Christ, since He took the whole human
                          nature, as stated above (<a
                            href="TP005.html#TPQ5OUTP1"
                            >Question [5]</a
                          >). And hence the Sixth Council [*Third Council of
                          Constantinople, Act. 4] condemned the opinion of those
                          who denied that in Christ there are two knowledges or
                          wisdoms.<br />

                              of Christ, seeing that it belongs to another
                              nature. Therefore, if there had been no other
                              knowledge in the soul of Christ, it would have
                              known nothing; and thus it would have been assumed
                              to no purpose, since everything is on account of
                              its operation.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in Christ there was not
          the knowledge of the blessed or comprehensors. For the knowledge of
          the blessed is a participation of Divine light, according to Ps.
          35:10: "In Thy light we shall see light." Now Christ had not a
          participated light, but He had the Godhead Itself substantially
          abiding in Him, according to Col. 2:9: "For in Him dwelleth all the
          fulness of the Godhead corporeally." Therefore in Christ there was not
          the knowledge of the blessed.<br />

              that they may know Thee, the only true God, and Jesus Christ Whom
              Thou hast sent." But this Man was blessed through being united to
              God in person, according to Ps. 64:5: "Blessed is He Whom Thou
              hast chosen and taken to Thee." Therefore it is not necessary to

                          is reduced to act by what is in act; for that whereby
                          things are heated must itself be hot. Now man is in
                          potentiality to the knowledge of the blessed, which
                          consists in the vision of God; and is ordained to it
                          as to an end; since the rational creature is capable
                          of that blessed knowledge, inasmuch as he is made in
                          the image of God. Now men are brought to this end of
                          beatitude by the humanity of Christ, according to Heb.
                          2:10: "For it became Him, for Whom are all things, and
                          by Whom are all things, Who had brought many children
                          unto glory, to perfect the author of their salvation
                          by His passion." And hence it was necessary that the
                          beatific knowledge, which consists in the vision of
                          God, should belong to Christ pre-eminently, since the
                          cause ought always to be more efficacious than the
                          effect.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was not in Christ
          another infused knowledge besides the beatific knowledge. For all
          other knowledge compared to the beatific knowledge is like imperfect
          to perfect. But imperfect knowledge is removed by the presence of
          perfect knowledge, as the clear "face-to-face" vision removes the
          enigmatical vision of faith, as is plain from 1 Cor. 13:10,12. Since,
          therefore, in Christ there was the beatific knowledge, as stated above
          (<a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), it would seem that
          there could not be any other imprinted knowledge.<br />

              sicut opinio, quae est per syllogismum dialecticum, disponit ad
              scientiam, quae est per syllogismum demonstrativum. Habita autem
              perfectione, non est ulterius necessaria dispositio, sicut, habito
              termino, non est necessarius motus. Cum igitur cognitio quaecumque
              alia creata comparetur ad cognitionem beatam sicut imperfectum ad
              perfectum, et sicut dispositio ad terminum, videtur quod, cum
              Christus habuerit cognitionem beatam, quod non fuerit ei
              necessarium habere aliam cognitionem.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an imperfect mode of cognition
              disposes towards a more perfect, as opinion, the result of
              dialectical syllogisms, disposes towards science, which results
              from demonstrative syllogisms. Now, when perfection is reached,
              there is no further need of the disposition, even as on reaching
              the end motion is no longer necessary. Hence, since every created
              cognition is compared to beatific cognition, as imperfect to
              perfect and as disposition to its term, it seems that since Christ
              had beatific knowledge, it was not necessary for Him to have any
              other knowledge.<br />

                  cannot receive two forms at once! one more perfect and the

                            >Article [1]</a
                          >), it was fitting that the human nature assumed by
                          the Word of God should not be imperfect. Now
                          everything in potentiality is imperfect unless it be
                          reduced to act. But the passive intellect of man is in
                          potentiality to all intelligible things. and it is
                          reduced to act by intelligible species, which are its
                          completive forms, as is plain from what is said De
                          Anima iii, 32,38. And hence we must admit in the soul
                          of Christ an infused knowledge, inasmuch as the Word
                          of God imprinted upon the soul of Christ, which is
                          personally united to Him, intelligible species of all
                          things to which the possible intellect is in
                          potentiality; even as in the beginning of the creation
                          of things, the Word of God imprinted intelligible
                          species upon the angelic mind, as is clear from
                          Augustine (Gen. ad lit. ii, 8). And therefore, even as
                          in the angels, according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit.
                          iv, 22,24,30), there is a double knowledge---one the
                          morning knowledge, whereby they know things in the
                          Word; the other the evening knowledge, whereby they
                          know things in their proper natures by infused
                          species; so likewise, besides the Divine and uncreated
                          knowledge in Christ, there is in His soul a beatific
                          knowledge, whereby He knows the Word, and things in
                          the Word; and an infused or imprinted knowledge,
                          whereby He knows things in their proper nature by
                          intelligible species proportioned to the human
                          mind.<br />

                                  Disposition is referred to perfection in two
                                  ways: first, as a way leading to perfection;
                                  secondly, as an effect proceeding from
                                  perfection; thus matter is disposed by heat to
                                  receive the form of fire, and, when this
                                  comes, the heat does not cease, but remains as
                                  an effect of this form. So, too, opinion
                                  caused by a dialectical syllogism is a way to
                                  knowledge, which is acquired by demonstration,
                                  yet, when this has been acquired, there may
                                  still remain the knowledge gained by the
                                  dialectical syllogism, following, so to say,
                                  the demonstrative knowledge, which is based on
                                  the cause, since he who knows the cause is
                                  thereby enabled the better to understand the
                                  probable signs from which dialectical
                                  syllogisms proceed. So likewise in Christ,
                                  together with the beatific knowledge, there
                                  still remains infused knowledge, not as a way
                                  to beatitude, but as strengthened by
                                  beatitude.<br />

          most perfectly. Now Christ did not possess acquired knowledge most
          perfectly, since He did not devote Himself to the study of letters, by
          which knowledge is acquired in its perfection; for it is said (<a

                          nihil eorum quae Deus in nostra natura plantavit,
                          defuit humanae naturae assumptae a verbo Dei.
                          Manifestum est autem quod in humana natura Deus
                          plantavit non solum intellectum possibilem, sed etiam
                          intellectum agentem. Unde necesse est dicere quod in
                          anima Christi non solum intellectus possibilis, sed
                          etiam intellectus agens fuerit. Si autem in aliis Deus
                          et natura nihil frustra fecerunt, ut philosophus
                          dicit, in I de caelo et mundo, multo minus in anima
                          Christi aliquid fuit frustra. Frustra autem est quod
                          non habet propriam operationem, cum omnis res sit
                          propter suam operationem, ut dicitur in II de caelo et
                          mundo. Propria autem operatio intellectus agentis est
                          facere species intelligibiles actu, abstrahendo eas a
                          phantasmatibus, unde dicitur in III de anima quod
                          intellectus agens est quo est omnia facere. Sic igitur
                          necesse est dicere quod in Christo fuerunt aliquae
                          species intelligibiles per actionem intellectus
                          agentis in intellectu possibili eius receptae. Quod
                          est esse in ipso scientiam acquisitam, quam quidam
                          experimentalem nominant. Et ideo, quamvis aliter alibi
                          scripserim, dicendum est in Christo scientiam
                          acquisitam fuisse. Quae proprie est scientia secundum
                          modum humanum, non solum ex parte recipientis
                          subiecti, sed etiam ex parte causae agentis, nam talis
                          scientia ponitur in Christo secundum lumen intellectus
                          agentis, quod est humanae naturae connaturale.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As is plain from Article
                          [1], nothing that God planted in our nature was
                          wanting to the human nature assumed by the Word of
                          God. Now it is manifest that God planted in human
                          nature not only a passive, but an active intellect.
                          Hence it is necessary to say that in the soul of
                          Christ there was not merely a passive, but also an
                          active intellect. But if in other things God and
                          nature make nothing in vain, as the Philosopher says
                          (De Coel. i, 31; ii, 59), still less in the soul of
                          Christ is there anything in vain. Now what has not its
                          proper operation is useless, as is said in De Coel.
                          ii, 17. Now the proper operation of the active
                          intellect is to make intelligible species in act, by
                          abstracting them from phantasms; hence, it is said (De
                          Anima iii, 18) that the active intellect is that
                          "whereby everything is made actual." And thus it is
                          necessary to say that in Christ there were
                          intelligible species received in the passive intellect
                          by the action of the active intellect---which means
                          that there was acquired knowledge in Him, which some
                          call empiric. And hence, although I wrote differently
                          (Sent. iii, D, xiv,
                          <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>; D,
                          xviii,
                          <a href="TP009.html#TPQ9A3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>),
                          it must be said that in Christ there was acquired
                          knowledge, which is properly knowledge in a human
                          fashion, both as regards the subject receiving and as
                          regards the active cause. For such knowledge springs
                          from Christ's active intellect, which is natural to
                          the human soul. But infused knowledge is attributed to
                          the soul, on account of a light infused from on high,
                          and this manner of knowing is proportioned to the
                          angelic nature. But the beatific knowledge, whereby
                          the very Essence of God is seen, is proper and natural
                          to God alone, as was said in the FP, Question [12],

                              <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since there is
                              a twofold way of acquiring knowledge---by
                              discovery and by being taught---the way of
                              discovery is the higher, and the way of being
                              taught is secondary. Hence it is said (Ethic. i,
                              4): "He indeed is the best who knows everything by
                              himself: yet he is good who obeys him that speaks
                              aright." And hence it was more fitting for Christ
                              to possess a knowledge acquired by discovery than
                              by being taught, especially since He was given to
                              be the Teacher of all, according to Joel 2:23: "Be
                              joyful in the Lord your God, because He hath given
                              you a Teacher of justice."<br />

                                  mind has two relations---one to higher things,
                                  and in this respect the soul of Christ was
                                  full of the infused knowledge. The other
                                  relation is to lower things, i.e. to
                                  phantasms, which naturally move the human mind
                                  by virtue of the active intellect. Now it was
                                  necessary that even in this respect the soul
                                  of Christ should be filled with knowledge, not
                                  that the first fulness was insufficient for
                                  the human mind in itself, but that it behooved
                                  it to be also perfected with regard to
                                  phantasms.<br />

                                      classed together; for the habit of
                                      knowledge is acquired by the relation of

                                      again acquired. But the habit of infused
                                      knowledge is of a different nature, as
