                          Respondeo dicendum quod conveniens fuit Christum
                          sepeliri. Primo quidem, ad comprobandum veritatem
                          mortis, non enim aliquis in sepulcro ponitur, nisi
                          quando iam de veritate mortis constat. Unde et Marci
                          XV legitur quod Pilatus, antequam concederet Christum
                          sepeliri, diligenti inquisitione cognovit eum mortuum
                          esse. Secundo, quia per hoc quod Christus de sepulcro
                          resurrexit, datur spes resurgendi per ipsum his qui
                          sunt in sepulcro, secundum illud Ioan. V, omnes qui in
                          monumentis sunt, audient vocem filii Dei, et qui
                          audierint, vivent. Tertio, ad exemplum eorum qui per
                          mortem Christi spiritualiter moriuntur peccatis, qui
                          scilicet absconduntur a conturbatione hominum. Unde
                          dicitur Coloss. III, mortui estis, et vita vestra
                          abscondita est cum Christo in Deo. Unde et baptizati,
                          qui per mortem Christi moriuntur peccatis, quasi
                          consepeliuntur Christo per immersionem, secundum illud
                          Rom. VI, consepulti sumus cum Christo per Baptismum in
                          mortem.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was fitting for Christ
                          to be buried. First of all, to establish the truth of
                          His death; for no one is laid in the grave unless
                          there be certainty of death. Hence we read (Mk.
                          15:44,45), that Pilate by diligent inquiry assured
                          himself of Christ's death before granting leave for
                          His burial. Secondly, because by Christ's rising from
                          the grave, to them who are in the grave, hope is given
                          of rising again through Him, according to Jn. 5:25,28:
                          "All that are in their graves shall hear the voice of
                          the Son of God... and they that hear shall live."
                          Thirdly, as an example to them who dying spiritually
                          to their sins are hidden away "from the disturbance of
                          men" (<a
                            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++30%3A21"
                            >Ps. 30:21</a
                          >). Hence it is said (Col. 3:3): "You are dead, and
                          your life is hid with Christ in God." Wherefore the
                          baptized likewise who through Christ's death die to
                          sins, are as it were buried with Christ by immersion,
                          according to Rm. 6:4: "We are buried together with
                          Christ by baptism into death."<br />

                              not be hindered from going forth by rising

                                  gentes, quae sine pietate erant, Deo patrique
                                  dabit, quia mortuus et sepultus eos
                                  acquisivit.

                                  likewise did His burial. Hence Jerome says
                                  (Super Marc. xiv): "By Christ's burial we rise
                                  again"; and on Is. 53:9: "He shall give the
                                  ungodly for His burial," a gloss says: "He
                                  shall give to God and the Father the Gentiles
                                  who were without godliness, because He
                                  purchased them by His death and burial."<br />

                                      of men's salvation. Thus thou shalt not
                                      deem God's Nature to be so vile, as though
                                      It may sometimes be subjected to
                                      injuries."<br />

          Christus fuit passus mortem abiectissimam, secundum illud Sap. II,

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ was buried in an
          unbecoming manner. For His burial should be in keeping with His death.
          But Christ underwent a most shameful death, according to Wis. 2:20:
          "Let us condemn Him to a most shameful death." It seems therefore
          unbecoming for honorable burial to be accorded to Christ, inasmuch as
          He was buried by men of position---namely, by Joseph of Arimathea, who
          was "a noble counselor," to use Mark's expression (Mk. 15:43), and by
          Nicodemus, who was "a ruler of the Jews," as John states (<a

              aloes quasi libras centum, ut dicitur Ioan. XIX, praesertim cum
              mulier praevenerit corpus eius ungere in sepulturam, ut dicitur

              Christ which might set an example of wastefulness. But it seems to
              savor of waste that in order to bury Christ Nicodemus came
              "bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes about a hundred pounds
              weight," as recorded by John (19:39), especially since a woman
              came beforehand to anoint His body for the burial, as Mark relates
              (Mk. 14:28). Consequently, this was not done becomingly with
              regard to Christ.<br />

                  quia scilicet Ioseph involvit corpus eius in sindone munda, ut
                  dicitur Matth. XXVII, non autem auro aut gemmis aut serico, ut
                  Hieronymus ibidem dicit, ex alia vero parte videtur fuisse

                  burial on the one hand was simple, because "Joseph wrapped His

                  (27:59), "but not with gold or gems, or silk," as Jerome
                  observes: yet on the other hand there appears to have been

                              Christ's burial is shown to be seemly in three
                              respects. First, to confirm faith in His death and
                              resurrection. Secondly, to commend the devotion of
                              those who gave Him burial. Hence Augustine says
                              (De Civ. Dei i): "The Gospel mentions as
                              praiseworthy the deed of those who received His
                              body from the cross, and with due care and
                              reverence wrapped it up and buried it." Thirdly,
                              as to the mystery whereby those are molded who
                              "are buried together with Christ into death" (<a

                                      said in De Doctr. Christ. iii that "in all
                                      such things, it is not the use thereof,
                                      but the luxury of the user that is at
                                      fault"; and, farther on: "what in other
                                      persons is frequently criminal, in a
                                      divine or prophetic person is a sign of
                                      something great." For myrrh and aloes by
                                      their bitterness denote penance, by which
                                      man keeps Christ within himself without
                                      the corruption of sin; while the odor of
                                      the ointments expresses good report.

                                          ut licite possimus aliquibus pretiosis

                                          Myrrh and aloes were used on Christ's
                                          body in order that it might be
                                          preserved from corruption, and this
                                          seemed to imply a certain need (in the
                                          body): hence the example is set us
                                          that we may lawfully use precious
                                          things medicinally, from the need of
                                          preserving our body. But the wrapping
                                          up of the body was merely a question
                                          of becoming propriety. And we ought to
                                          content ourselves with simplicity in
                                          such things. Yet, as Jerome observes,
                                          by this act was denoted that "he
                                          swathes Jesus in clean linen, who
                                          receives Him with a pure soul." Hence,
                                          as Bede says on Mark 15:46: "The
                                          Church's custom has prevailed for the
                                          sacrifice of the altar to be offered
                                          not upon silk, nor upon dyed cloth,
                                          but on linen of the earth; as the
                                          Lord's body was buried in a clean
                                          winding-sheet."<br />

                                              moriebatur salute, sepulcrum autem
                                              mortis est habitaculum. Per hoc

                                              nudus existens a Ioseph operitur.
                                              In novo autem ponitur monumento,
                                              ut Hieronymus dicit, ne, post
                                              resurrectionem, ceteris corporibus
                                              remanentibus, surrexisse alius
                                              fingeretur. Potest autem et novum

                                              demonstrare. Per hoc etiam datur

                                              ostendit non absque auxilio
                                              plurimorum sepulcrum potuisse
                                              reserari. Si etiam sepultus
                                              fuisset in terra, dicere poterant,
                                              suffoderunt terram, et furati sunt

                                              Significatur autem mystice per
                                              hoc, ut Hilarius dicit, quod per

                                              penetrare, lapis ostio advolvitur.
                                              Et, sicut Origenes dicit, non
                                              fortuito scriptum est, Ioseph

                                              Christ was buried "in a garden" to
                                              express that by His death and
                                              burial we are delivered from the
                                              death which we incur through
                                              Adam's sin committed in the garden
                                              of paradise. But for this "was our
                                              Lord buried in the grave of a
                                              stranger," as Augustine says in a
                                              sermon (ccxlviii), "because He
                                              died for the salvation of others;
                                              and a sepulchre is the abode of
                                              death." Also the extent of the
                                              poverty endured for us can be
                                              thereby estimated: since He who
                                              while living had no home, after
                                              death was laid to rest in
                                              another's tomb, and being naked
                                              was clothed by Joseph. But He is
                                              laid in a "new" sepulchre, as
                                              Jerome observes on Mt. 27:60,
                                              "lest after the resurrection it
                                              might be pretended that someone
                                              else had risen, while the other
                                              corpses remained. The new
                                              sepulchre can also denote Mary's
                                              virginal womb." And furthermore it
                                              may be understood that all of us
                                              are renewed by Christ's burial;
                                              death and corruption being
                                              destroyed. Moreover, He was buried
                                              in a monument "hewn out of a
                                              rock," as Jerome says on Mt.
                                              27:64, "lest, if it had been
                                              constructed of many stones, they
                                              might say that He was stolen away
                                              by digging away the foundations of
                                              the tomb." Hence the "great stone"
                                              which was set shows that "the tomb
                                              could not be opened except by the
                                              help of many hands. Again, if He
                                              had been buried in the earth, they
                                              might have said: They dug up the
                                              soil and stole Him away," as
                                              Augustine observes [*Cf. Catena
                                              Aurea]. Hilary (Comment. in Matth.
                                              cap. xxxiii) gives the mystical
                                              interpretation, saying that "by
                                              the teaching of the apostles,
                                              Christ is borne into the stony
                                              heart of the gentile; for it is
                                              hewn out by the process of
                                              teaching, unpolished and new,
                                              untenanted and open to the
                                              entrance of the fear of God. And
                                              since naught besides Him must
                                              enter into our hearts, a great
                                              stone is rolled against the door."
                                              Furthermore, as Origen says
                                              (Tract. xxxv in Matth.): "It was
                                              not written by hazard: 'Joseph
                                              wrapped Christ's body in a clean

                                              new monument,'" and that "'he
                                              rolled a great stone,' because all
                                              things around the body of Jesus
                                              are clean, and new, and exceeding

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ's body was
          reduced to dust in the tomb. For just as man dies in punishment of his
          first parent's sin, so also does he return to dust, since it was said
          to the first man after his sin: "Dust thou art, and into dust thou
          shalt return" (<a

            >Gn. 3:19</a
          >). But Christ endured death in order to deliver us from death.
          Therefore His body ought to be made to return to dust, so as to free
          us from the same penalty.<br />

              Praeterea, corpus Christi fuit eiusdem naturae cum corporibus

              et ad putrefactionem disponuntur, quia, exhalante calido naturali,
              supervenit calor extraneus, qui putrefactionem causat. Ergo

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Christ's body was of the same
              nature as ours. But directly after death our bodies begin to
              dissolve into dust, and are disposed towards putrefaction, because
              when the natural heat departs, there supervenes heat from without
              which causes corruption. Therefore it seems that the same thing
              happened to Christ's body.<br />

                          Respondeo dicendum quod non fuit conveniens corpus
                          Christi putrefieri, vel quocumque modo incinerari.
                          Quia putrefactio cuiuscumque corporis provenit ex
                          infirmitate naturae illius corporis, quae non potest
                          amplius corpus continere in unum. Mors autem Christi,
                          sicut supra dictum est, non debuit esse cum
                          infirmitate naturae, ne crederetur non esse
                          voluntaria. Et ideo non ex morbo, sed ex passione
                          illata voluit mori, cui se obtulit sponte. Et ideo
                          Christus, ne mors eius naturae infirmitati
                          adscriberetur, noluit corpus suum qualitercumque
                          putrefieri, aut qualitercumque resolvi, sed, ad
                          ostensionem virtutis divinae, voluit corpus illud
                          incorruptum permanere. Unde Chrysostomus dicit quod,
                          viventibus aliis hominibus, his scilicet qui egerunt
                          strenue, arrident propria gesta, his autem
                          pereuntibus, pereunt. Sed in Christo est totum
                          contrarium, nam ante crucem, omnia sunt maesta et
                          infirma; ut autem crucifixus est, omnia clariora sunt
                          facta, ut noscas non purum hominem crucifixum.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was not fitting for
                          Christ's body to putrefy, or in any way be reduced to
                          dust, since the putrefaction of any body comes of that
                          body's infirmity of nature, which can no longer hold
                          the body together. But as was said above (<a
                            href="TP050.html#TPQ50OUTP1"
                            >Question [50]</a
                          >, <a href="TP050.html#TPQ50A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>,
                          ad 2), Christ's death ought not to come from weakness
                          of nature, lest it might not be believed to be
                          voluntary: and therefore He willed to die, not from
                          sickness, but from suffering inflicted on Him, to
                          which He gave Himself up willingly. And therefore,
                          lest His death might be ascribed to infirmity of
                          nature, Christ did not wish His body to putrefy in any
                          way or dissolve no matter how; but for the
                          manifestation of His Divine power He willed that His
                          body should continue incorrupt. Hence Chrysostom says
                          (Cont. Jud. et Gent. quod 'Christus sit Deus') that
                          "with other men, especially with such as have wrought
                          strenuously, their deeds shine forth in their
                          lifetime; but as soon as they die, their deeds go with
                          them. But it is quite the contrary with Christ:
                          because previous to the cross all is sadness and
                          weakness, but as soon as He is crucified, everything
                          comes to light, in order that you may learn it was not
                          an ordinary man that was crucified."<br />

                              <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine says
                              (De Consens. Evang. iii): "Some men, ignorant of
                              Scriptural language, wished to compute as night
                              those three hours, from the sixth to the ninth
                              hour, during which the sun was darkened, and as
                              day those other three hours during which it was
                              restored to the earth, that is, from the ninth
                              hour until its setting: for the coming night of
                              the Sabbath follows, and if this be reckoned with
                              its day, there will be already two nights and two
                              days. Now after the Sabbath there follows the
                              night of the first day of the Sabbath, that is, of
                              the dawning Sunday, on which the Lord rose. Even
                              so, the reckoning of the three days and three
                              nights will not stand. It remains then to find the
                              solution in the customary usage of speech of the
                              Scriptures, whereby the whole is understood from
                              the part": so that we are able to take a day and a
                              night as one natural day. And so the first day is
                              computed from its ending, during which Christ died
                              and was buried on the Friday; while the second.
                              day is an entire day with twenty-four hours of
                              night and day; while the night following belongs
                              to the third day. "For as the primitive days were

                                  Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut Augustinus
                                  dicit, in IV de Trin., Christus in diluculo
                                  resurrexit, in quo aliquid lucis apparet, et
                                  adhuc tamen aliquid remanet tenebrarum noctis,
                                  unde de mulieribus dicitur, Ioan. XX, quod cum
                                  tenebrae adhuc essent, venerunt ad monumentum.
                                  Ratione ergo harum tenebrarum, Gregorius dicit
                                  Christum media nocte surrexisse, non quidem
                                  divisa nocte in duas partes aequales, sed
                                  infra illam noctem. Illud enim diluculum et
                                  pars noctis et pars diei dici potest, propter
                                  communicantiam quam habet cum utroque.

                                  Augustine says (De Trin. iv; cf. De Consens.
                                  Evang. iii), Christ rose with the dawn, when
                                  light appears in part, and still some part of
                                  the darkness of the night remains. Hence it is
                                  said of the women that "when it was yet dark"
                                  they came "to the sepulchre" (<a
                                    href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++20%3A1"

                                  >). Therefore, in consequence of this
                                  darkness, Gregory says (Hom. xxi) that Christ
                                  rose in the middle of the night, not that
                                  night is divided into two equal parts, but
                                  during the night itself: for the expression
                                  "early" can be taken as partly night and
                                  partly day, from its fittingness with both.<br />
