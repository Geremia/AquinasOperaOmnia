          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Men are bound to that without which they
          cannot obtain salvation. Now it is manifest that no one can obtain

            >Rm. 5:18</a

          by the justice of one, unto all men unto justification of life." But
          for this end is Baptism conferred on a man, that being regenerated
          thereby, he may be incorporated in Christ, by becoming His member:
          wherefore it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A27"
            >Gal. 3:27</a
          >): "As many of you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on
          Christ." Consequently it is manifest that all are bound to be
          baptized: and that without Baptism there is no salvation for men.<br />

          Ad primum ergo dicendum quod nunquam homines potuerunt salvari, etiam
          ante Christi adventum, nisi fierent membra Christi, quia, ut dicitur
          Act. IV, non est aliud nomen datum hominibus in quo oporteat nos
          salvos fieri. Sed ante adventum Christi, homines Christo
          incorporabantur per fidem futuri adventus, cuius fidei signaculum erat
          circumcisio, ut apostolus dicit, Rom. IV. Ante vero quam circumcisio
          institueretur, sola fide, ut Gregorius dicit, cum sacrificiorum
          oblatione, quibus suam fidem antiqui patres profitebantur, homines
          Christo incorporabantur. Post adventum etiam Christi, homines per
          fidem Christo incorporantur, secundum illud Ephes. III habitare
          Christum per fidem in cordibus vestris. Sed alio signo manifestatur
          fides rei iam praesentis quam demonstrabatur quando erat futura, sicut
          aliis verbis significatur praesens, praeteritum et futurum. Et ideo,
          licet ipsum sacramentum Baptismi non semper fuerit necessarium ad
          salutem, fides tamen, cuius Baptismus sacramentum est, semper
          necessaria fuit.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> At no time, not even before the
          coming of Christ, could men be saved unless they became members of
          Christ: because, as it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+4%3A12"
            >Acts 4:12</a
          >), "there is no other name under heaven given to men, whereby we must
          be saved." But before Christ's coming, men were incorporated in Christ
          by faith in His future coming: of which faith circumcision was the
          "seal," as the Apostle calls it (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++4%3A11"
            >Rm. 4:11</a
          >): whereas before circumcision was instituted, men were incorporated
          in Christ by "faith alone," as Gregory says (Moral. iv), together with
          the offering of sacrifices, by means of which the Fathers of old made
          profession of their faith. Again, since Christ's coming, men are
          incorporated in Christ by faith; according to Eph. 3:17: "That Christ
          may dwell by faith in your hearts." But faith in a thing already
          present is manifested by a sign different from that by which it was
          manifested when that thing was yet in the future: just as we use other
          parts of the verb, to signify the present, the past, and the future.
          Consequently although the sacrament itself of Baptism was not always
          necessary for salvation, yet faith, of which Baptism is the sacrament,
          was always necessary.<br />

          Ad secundum dicendum quod, sicut in secunda parte dictum est, illi qui
          baptizantur, renovantur per Baptismum secundum spiritum, corpus tamen
          remanet subiectum vetustati peccati, secundum illud Rom. VIII, corpus
          quidem mortuum est propter peccatum, spiritus vero vivit propter
          iustificationem. Unde Augustinus probat, in libro contra Iulianum,
          quod non baptizatur in homine quidquid in eo est. Manifestum est autem
          quod homo non generat generatione carnali secundum spiritum, sed
          secundum carnem. Et ideo filii baptizatorum cum peccato originali

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As we have stated in the FS,
          Question [81], Article [3], ad 2, those who are baptized are renewed
          in spirit by Baptism, while their body remains subject to the oldness
          of sin, according to Rm. 8:10: "The body, indeed, is dead because of
          sin, but the spirit liveth because of justification." Wherefore
          Augustine (Contra Julian. vi) proves that "not everything that is in
          man is baptized." Now it is manifest that in carnal generation man
          does not beget in respect of his soul, but in respect of his body.
          Consequently the children of those who are baptized are born with
          original sin; wherefore they need to be baptized.<br />

          propter hoc, si aliqui nunc sanctificarentur in utero, necesse esset
          eos baptizari, ut per susceptionem characteris aliis membris Christi

          Secondly, the sacrament of Baptism may be wanting to anyone in reality
          but not in desire: for instance, when a man wishes to be baptized, but
          by some ill-chance he is forestalled by death before receiving
          Baptism. And such a man can obtain salvation without being actually
          baptized, on account of his desire for Baptism, which desire is the
          outcome of "faith that worketh by charity," whereby God, Whose power
          is not tied to visible sacraments, sanctifies man inwardly. Hence
          Ambrose says of Valentinian, who died while yet a catechumen: "I lost

          they are converted, but it should be deferred until some fixed time.
          First, as a safeguard to the Church, lest she be deceived through
          baptizing those who come to her under false pretenses, according to 1
          Jn. 4:1: "Believe not every spirit, but try the spirits, if they be of
          God." And those who approach Baptism are put to this test, when their
          faith and morals are subjected to proof for a space of time. Secondly,
          this is needful as being useful for those who are baptized; for they
          require a certain space of time in order to be fully instructed in the
          faith, and to be drilled in those things that pertain to the Christian
          mode of life. Thirdly, a certain reverence for the sacrament demands a
          delay whereby men are admitted to Baptism at the principal

          death, sickness, siege, persecution, or shipwreck, should be baptized
          at any time." Yet if a man is forestalled by death, so as to have no
          time to receive the sacrament, while he awaits the season appointed by
          the Church, he is saved, yet "so as by fire," as stated above (<a

            >Article [2]</a
          >, ad 2). Nevertheless he sins if he defer being baptized beyond the
          time appointed by the Church, except this be for an unavoidable cause
          and with the permission of the authorities of the Church. But even
          this sin, with his other sins, can be washed away by his subsequent
          contrition, which takes the place of Baptism, as stated above (<a

          Baptism, by the grace which it bestows, removes not only past sins,
          but hinders the commission of future sins. Now this is the point to be

          that their sins be less grievous, or that their sins be washed away,
          according to 1 Jn. 2:1,2: "My little children, these things I write to
          you, that you may not sin. But if any man sin, we have an advocate

          Secondly, a man may be called a sinner because he wills to sin and
          purposes to remain in sin: and on sinners in this sense the sacrament
          of Baptism should not be conferred. First, indeed, because by Baptism
          men are incorporated in Christ, according to Gal. 3:27: "As many of
          you as have been baptized in Christ, have put on Christ." Now so long
          as a man wills to sin, he cannot be united to Christ, according to 2
          Cor. 6:14: "What participation hath justice with injustice?" Wherefore
          Augustine says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli) that "no man who
          has the use of free-will can begin the new life, except he repent of
          his former life." Secondly, because there should be nothing useless in
          the works of Christ and of the Church. Now that is useless which does
          not reach the end to which it is ordained; and, on the other hand, no
          one having the will to sin can, at the same time, be cleansed from
          sin, which is the purpose of Baptism; for this would be to combine two
          contradictory things. Thirdly, because there should be no falsehood in
          the sacramental signs. Now a sign is false if it does not correspond
          with the thing signified. But the very fact that a man presents
          himself to be cleansed by Baptism, signifies that he prepares himself
          for the inward cleansing: while this cannot be the case with one who
          purposes to remain in sin. Therefore it is manifest that on such a man
          the sacrament of Baptism is not to be conferred.<br />

          Baptism is the sacrament of faith. Now dead faith does not suffice for
          salvation; nor is it the foundation, but living faith alone, "that
          worketh by charity" (<a

          sacrament of Baptism give salvation to a man whose will is set on
          sinning, and hence expels the form of faith. Moreover, the impression
          of the baptismal character cannot dispose a man for grace as long as
          he retains the will to sin; for "God compels no man to be virtuous,"
          as Damascene says (De Fide Orth. ii).<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut apostolus dicit, Rom. VI, quicumque

          satisfied sufficiently for sins, "not for ours only, but also for
          those of the whole world," according to 1 Jn. 2:2. Consequently no
          kind of satisfaction should be enjoined on one who is being baptized,
          for any sins whatever: and this would be to dishonor the Passion and
          death of Christ, as being insufficient for the plenary satisfaction

          ordinatur ad hoc quod sacerdos confitentem absolvat a peccatis, et

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Confession of sins is twofold. One is
          made inwardly to God: and such confession of sins is required before
          Baptism: in other words, man should call his sins to mind and sorrow
          for them; since "he cannot begin the new life, except he repent of his
          former life," as Augustine says in his book on Penance (Serm. cccli).
          The other is the outward confession of sins, which is made to a
          priest; and such confession is not required before Baptism. First,
          because this confession, since it is directed to the person of the
          minister, belongs to the sacrament of Penance, which is not required
          before Baptism, which is the door of all the sacraments. Secondly,
          because the reason why a man makes outward confession to a priest, is
          that the priest may absolve him from his sins, and bind him to works
          of satisfaction, which should not be enjoined on the baptized, as
          stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>).
          Moreover those who are being baptized do not need to be released from
          their sins by the keys of the Church, since all are forgiven them in
          Baptism. Thirdly, because the very act of confession made to a man is
          penal, by reason of the shame it inflicts on the one confessing:
          whereas no exterior punishment is enjoined on a man who is being
          baptized.

          The Church's intention in Baptizing men is that they may be cleansed
          from sin, according to Is. 27:9: "This is all the fruit, that the
          sin... should be taken away." And therefore, as far as she is
          concerned, she does not intend to give Baptism save to those who have
          right faith, without which there is no remission of sins. And for this
          reason she asks those who come to be baptized whether they believe.
          If, on the contrary, anyone, without right faith, receive Baptism
          outside the Church, he does not receive it unto salvation. Hence
          Augustine says (De Baptism. contr. Donat. iv): "From the Church being
          compared to Paradise we learn that men can receive her Baptism even
          outside her fold, but that elsewhere none can receive or keep the

            >Rm. 5:17</a

          "much more they who receive abundance of grace, and of the gift, and
          of justice, shall reign in life through one, Jesus Christ." Now
          children contract original sin from the sin of Adam; which is made
          clear by the fact that they are under the ban of death, which "passed
          upon all" on account of the sin of the first man, as the Apostle says
          in the same passage (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A12"
            >Rm. 5:12</a
          >). Much more, therefore, can children receive grace through Christ,
          so as to reign in eternal life. But our Lord Himself said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A5"
            >Jn. 3:5</a
          >): "Unless a man be born again of water and the Holy Ghost, he cannot
          enter into the kingdom of God." Consequently it became necessary to
          baptize children, that, as in birth they incurred damnation through
          Adam so in a second birth they might obtain salvation through Christ.
          Moreover it was fitting that children should receive Baptism, in order
          that being reared from childhood in things pertaining to the Christian
          mode of life, they may the more easily persevere therein; according to
          Prov. 22:5: "A young man according to his way, even when he is old, he
          will not depart from it." This reason is also given by Dionysius

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The spiritual regeneration
          effected by Baptism is somewhat like carnal birth, in this respect,
          that as the child while in the mother's womb receives nourishment not
          independently, but through the nourishment of its mother, so also
          children before the use of reason, being as it were in the womb of
          their mother the Church, receive salvation not by their own act, but
          by the act of the Church. Hence Augustine says (De Pecc. Merit. et
          Remiss. i): "The Church, our mother, offers her maternal mouth for her
          children, that they may imbibe the sacred mysteries: for they cannot
          as yet with their own hearts believe unto justice, nor with their own
          mouths confess unto salvation... And if they are rightly said to
          believe, because in a certain fashion they make profession of faith by
          the words of their sponsors, why should they not also be said to
          repent, since by the words of those same sponsors they evidence their
          renunciation of the devil and this world?" For the same reason they
          can be said to intend, not by their own act of intention, since at
          times they struggle and cry; but by the act of those who bring them to
          be baptized.<br />

          aliis quae in Baptismo remittuntur peccata traxerunt. Nec impeditur
          eorum salus si parentes sint infideles, quia, sicut Augustinus dicit,
          eidem Bonifacio scribens, offeruntur parvuli ad percipiendam
          spiritualem gratiam, non tam ab eis quorum gestantur manibus (quamvis
          et ab ipsis, si et ipsi boni fideles sunt), quam ab universa societate
          sanctorum atque fidelium. Ab omnibus namque offerri recte
          intelliguntur, quibus placet quod offeruntur, et quorum caritate ad
          communionem sancti spiritus adiunguntur. Infidelitas autem propriorum
          parentum, etiam si eos post Baptismum Daemoniorum sacrificiis imbuere
          conentur, pueris non nocet. Quia, ut ibidem Augustinus dicit, puer
          semel generatus per aliorum voluntatem, deinceps non potest vinculo
          alienae iniquitatis obstringi, ubi nulla sua voluntate consentit,
          secundum illud, Ezech. XVIII, sicut anima patris mea est, et anima
          filii, anima quae peccaverit, ipsa morietur. Sed ideo ex Adam traxit
          quod sacramenti illius gratia solveretur, quia nondum erat anima
          separata vivens. Fides autem unius, immo totius Ecclesiae, parvulo
          prodest per operationem spiritus sancti, qui unit Ecclesiam et bona
          unius alteri communicat.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says, writing to
          Boniface (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i), "in the Church of our Saviour
          little children believe through others, just as they contracted from
          others those sins which are remitted in Baptism." Nor is it a
          hindrance to their salvation if their parents be unbelievers, because,
          as Augustine says, writing to the same Boniface (Ep. xcviii), "little
          children are offered that they may receive grace in their souls, not
          so much from the hands of those that carry them (yet from these too,
          if they be good and faithful) as from the whole company of the saints
          and the faithful. For they are rightly considered to be offered by
          those who are pleased at their being offered, and by whose charity
          they are united in communion with the Holy Ghost." And the unbelief of
          their own parents, even if after Baptism these strive to infect them
          with the worship of demons, hurts not the children. For as Augustine
          says (Cont. duas Ep. Pelag. i) "when once the child has been begotten
          by the will of others, he cannot subsequently be held by the bonds of
          another's sin so long as he consent not with his will, according to"
          Ezech. 18:4: "'As the soul of the Father, so also the soul of the son
          is mine; the soul that sinneth, the same shall die.' Yet he contracted
          from Adam that which was loosed by the grace of this sacrament,
          because as yet he was not endowed with a separate existence." But the
          faith of one, indeed of the whole Church, profits the child through
          the operation of the Holy Ghost, Who unites the Church together, and
          communicates the goods of one member to another.<br />

          be if one having the use of reason were baptized against his will.
          Moreover under the circumstances it would be dangerous to baptize the
          children of unbelievers; for they would be liable to lapse into
          unbelief, by reason of their natural affection for their parents.
          Therefore it is not the custom of the Church to baptize the children
          of unbelievers against their parents' will.<br />

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is essential to Baptism that some part
          of the body of the person baptized be in some way washed with water,
          since Baptism is a kind of washing, as stated above (<a
            href="TP066.html#TPQ66OUTP1"
            >Question [66]</a
          >, <a href="TP066.html#TPQ66A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). But an infant's
          body, before being born from the womb, can nowise be washed with
          water; unless perchance it be said that the baptismal water, with
          which the mother's body is washed, reaches the child while yet in its
          mother's womb. But this is impossible: both because the child's soul,
          to the sanctification of which Baptism is ordained, is distinct from
          the soul of the mother; and because the body of the animated infant is
          already formed, and consequently distinct from the body of the mother.
          Therefore the Baptism which the mother receives does not overflow on
          to the child which is in her womb. Hence Augustine says (Cont. Julian.
          vi): "If what is conceived within a mother belonged to her body, so as
          to be considered a part thereof, we should not baptize an infant whose
          mother, through danger of death, was baptized while she bore it in her
          womb. Since, then, it," i.e. the infant, "is baptized, it certainly
          did not belong to the mother's body while it was in the womb." It
          follows, therefore, that a child can nowise be baptized while in its
          mother's womb.<br />

          efficaciam habuit. Unde et carentibus usu rationis aliquando Baptismus
          dari debet.

          <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (Confess. iv) of his
          friend that "he was baptized when his recovery was despaired of": and
          yet Baptism was efficacious with him. Therefore Baptism should
          sometimes be given to those who lack the use of reason.<br />

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the matter of madmen and imbeciles a
          distinction is to be made. For some are so from birth, and have no
          lucid intervals, and show no signs of the use of reason. And with
          regard to these it seems that we should come to the same decision as
          with regard to children who are baptized in the Faith of the Church,
          as stated above (<a href="TP068.html#TPQ68A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>, ad

          But there are others who have fallen from a state of sanity into a
          state of insanity. And with regard to these we must be guided by their
          wishes as expressed by them when sane: so that, if then they
          manifested a desire to receive Baptism, it should be given to them
          when in a state of madness or imbecility, even though then they
          refuse. If, on the other hand, while sane they showed no desire to
          receive Baptism, they must not be baptized.<br />

          Again, there are some who, though mad or imbecile from birth, have,
          nevertheless, lucid intervals, in which they can make right use of
          reason. Wherefore, if then they express a desire for Baptism, they can
          be baptized though they be actually in a state of madness. And in this
          case the sacrament should be bestowed on them if there be fear of
          danger otherwise it is better to wait until the time when they are
          sane, so that they may receive the sacrament more devoutly. But if

          Lastly there are others who, though not altogether sane, yet can use

          Imbeciles who never had, and have not now, the use of reason, are

          the Church's ritual, they believe and repent; as we have stated above

          Madmen and imbeciles lack the use of reason accidentally, i.e. through
          some impediment in a bodily organ; but not like irrational animals
          through want of a rational soul. Consequently the comparison does not

          A person should not be baptized while asleep, except he be threatened
          with the danger of death. In which case he should be baptized, if
          previously he has manifested a desire to receive Baptism, as we have
          stated in reference to imbeciles: thus Augustine relates of his friend
          that "he was baptized while unconscious," because he was in danger of
          death (Confess. iv).<br />
