          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod ratio praeceptorum iudicialium
          non consistat in hoc quod sunt ordinantia ad proximum. Iudicialia enim
          praecepta a iudicio dicuntur. Sed multa sunt alia quibus homo ad

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts
          were not those which directed man in his relations to his neighbor.
          For judicial precepts take their name from "judgment." But there are
          many things that direct man as to his neighbor, which are not
          subordinate to judgment. Therefore the judicial precepts were not
          those which directed man in his relations to his neighbor.<br />
          <tr valign="top">

              Praeterea, praecepta iudicialia a moralibus distinguuntur, ut
              supra dictum est. Sed multa praecepta moralia sunt quibus homo
              ordinatur ad proximum, sicut patet in septem praeceptis secundae
              tabulae. Non ergo praecepta iudicialia dicuntur ex hoc quod ad
              proximum ordinant.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the judicial precepts are
              distinct from the moral precepts, as stated above (<a

              are many moral precepts which direct man as to his neighbor: as is
              evidently the case with the seven precepts of the second table.
              Therefore the judicial precepts are not so called from directing
              man as to his neighbor.<br />

                  quae pertinent ad seipsum, sicut observantiae ciborum et

                  the ceremonial precepts there are some which concern man
                  himself, such as observances in matter of food and apparel, of
                  which we have already spoken (<a href="FS102.html#FSQ102OUTP1"

                      judicial precepts are so called from "judgment." Therefore

                          obligandi ex ipso dictamine rationis, quia naturalis

                          huiusmodi praecepta dicuntur moralia, eo quod a

                          <a href="FS099.html#FSQ99A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), in
                          every law, some precepts derive their binding force
                          from the dictate of reason itself, because natural
                          reason dictates that something ought to be done or to
                          be avoided. These are called "moral" precepts: since
                          human morals are based on reason. At the same time
                          there are other precepts which derive their binding
                          force, not from the very dictate of reason (because,
                          considered in themselves, they do not imply an
                          obligation of something due or undue); but from some
                          institution, Divine or human: and such are certain
                          determinations of the moral precepts. When therefore
                          the moral precepts are fixed by Divine institution in
                          matters relating to man's subordination to God, they
                          are called "ceremonial" precepts: but when they refer
                          to man's relations to other men, they are called
                          "judicial" precepts. Hence there are two conditions
                          attached to the judicial precepts: viz. first, that
                          they refer to man's relations to other men; secondly,
                          that they derive their binding force not from reason
                          alone, but in virtue of their institution.<br />

                              whom the judicial power is vested. Now it belongs

                              regulate not only litigious matters, but also

                                      quae ipsa ratio fide informata dictat,
                                      sicut Deum esse amandum et colendum.
                                      Quaedam vero sunt caeremonialia, quae non
                                      habent vim obligationis nisi ex
                                      institutione divina. Ad Deum autem
                                      pertinent non solum sacrificia oblata Deo,

                                      idoneitatem offerentium et Deum colentium.
                                      Homines enim ordinantur in Deum sicut in

                                      respectu cultus divini. Sed homo non
                                      ordinatur ad proximum sicut in finem, ut
                                      oporteat eum disponi in seipso in ordine
                                      ad proximum, haec enim est comparatio

                                      dominorum sunt, secundum philosophum, in I
                                      Polit. Et ideo non sunt aliqua praecepta
                                      iudicialia ordinantia hominem in seipso,
                                      sed omnia talia sunt moralia, quia ratio,
                                      quae est principium moralium, se habet in

                                      in those precepts which direct us to God,
                                      some are moral precepts, which the reason
                                      itself dictates when it is quickened by
                                      faith; such as that God is to be loved and
                                      worshipped. There are also ceremonial
                                      precepts, which have no binding force
                                      except in virtue of their Divine
                                      institution. Now God is concerned not only
                                      with the sacrifices that are offered to
                                      Him, but also with whatever relates to the
                                      fitness of those who offer sacrifices to
                                      Him and worship Him. Because men are
                                      ordained to God as to their end; wherefore
                                      it concerns God and, consequently, is a
                                      matter of ceremonial precept, that man
                                      should show some fitness for the divine
                                      worship. On the other hand, man is not
                                      ordained to his neighbor as to his end, so
                                      as to need to be disposed in himself with
                                      regard to his neighbor, for such is the
                                      relationship of a slave to his master,
                                      since a slave "is his master's in all that
                                      he is," as the Philosopher says (Polit. i,
                                      2). Hence there are no judicial precepts
                                      ordaining man in himself; all such
                                      precepts are moral: because the reason,
                                      which is the principal in moral matters,
                                      holds the same position, in man, with
                                      regard to things that concern him, as a
                                      prince or judge holds in the state.
                                      Nevertheless we must take note that, since
                                      the relations of man to his neighbor are
                                      more subject to reason than the relations
                                      of man to God, there are more precepts
                                      whereby man is directed in his relations
                                      to his neighbor, than whereby he is
                                      directed to God. For the same reason there
                                      had to be more ceremonial than judicial
                                      precepts in the Law.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A precept may be
                          figurative in two ways. First, primarily and in
                          itself: because, to wit, it is instituted principally
                          that it may be the figure of something. In this way
                          the ceremonial precepts are figurative; since they
                          were instituted for the very purpose that they might
                          foreshadow something relating to the worship of God
                          and the mystery of Christ. But some precepts are
                          figurative, not primarily and in themselves, but
                          consequently. In this way the judicial precepts of the
                          Old Law are figurative. For they were not instituted
                          for the purpose of being figurative, but in order that
                          they might regulate the state of that people according
                          to justice and equity. Nevertheless they did
                          foreshadow something consequently: since, to wit, the
                          entire state of that people, who were directed by
                          these precepts, was figurative, according to 1 Cor.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts of

          virtue of justice: since a judgment is an execution of the virtue of
          justice. Now "justice is perpetual and immortal" (Wis. 1:15).

                  because of the weakness and unprofitableness thereof." Now
                  this is true of the ceremonial precept, which "could [Vulg.:

                  efficacious in respect of the purpose for which they were
                  instituted, viz. to establish justice and equity among men.
                  Therefore the judicial precepts of the Old Law are not set

                          not bind for ever, but were annulled by the coming of

                          far as to be not only "dead," but also deadly to those
                          who observe them since the coming of Christ,
                          especially since the promulgation of the Gospel. On

                              but that they might shape the state of that people
                              who were directed to Christ. Consequently, when
                              the state of that people changed with the coming
                              of Christ, the judicial precepts lost their
                              binding force: for the Law was a pedagogue,
                              leading men to Christ, as stated in Gal. 3:24.
                              Since, however, these judicial precepts are
                              instituted, not for the purpose of being figures,
                              but for the performance of certain deeds, the
                              observance thereof is not prejudicial to the truth
                              of faith. But the intention of observing them, as
                              though one were bound by the Law, is prejudicial
                              to the truth of faith: because it would follow
                              that the former state of the people still lasts,
                              and that Christ has not yet come.<br />

                              Now in every people a fourfold order is to be
                              found: one, of the people's sovereign to his
                              subjects; a second of the subjects among
                              themselves; a third, of the citizens to
                              foreigners; a fourth, of members of the same
                              household, such as the order of the father to his
                              son; of the wife to her husband; of the master to
                              his servant: and according to these four orders we
                              may distinguish different kinds of judicial
                              precepts in the Old Law. For certain precepts are
                              laid down concerning the institution of the
                              sovereign and relating to his office, and about
                              the respect due to him: this is one part of the
                              judicial precepts. Again, certain precepts are
                              given in respect of a man to his fellow citizens:
                              for instance, about buying and selling, judgments
                              and penalties: this is the second part of the
                              judicial precepts. Again, certain precepts are
                              enjoined with regard to foreigners: for instance,
                              about wars waged against their foes, and about the
                              way to receive travelers and strangers: this is
                              the third part of the judicial precepts. Lastly,
                              certain precepts are given relating to home life:
                              for instance, about servants, wives and children:
                              this is the fourth part of the judicial
                              precepts.<br />

                                      natural reason, but from their institution
                                      alone. Hence there is a distinct reason
                                      for distinguishing them.<br />
