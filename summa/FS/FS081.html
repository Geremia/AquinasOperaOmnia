          We must now consider the cause of sin, on the part of man. Now, while
          man, like the devil, is the cause of another's sin, by outward
          suggestion, he has a certain special manner of causing sin, by way of
          origin. Wherefore we must speak about original sin, the consideration
          of which will be three-fold:

          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod primum peccatum primi parentis
          non traducatur ad alios per originem. Dicitur enim Ezech. XVIII,
          filius non portabit iniquitatem patris. Portaret autem, si ab eo
          iniquitatem traheret. Ergo nullus trahit ab aliquo parentum per
          originem aliquod peccatum.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the first sin of our
          first parent is not contracted by others, by way of origin. For it is
          written (Ezech. 18:20): "The son shall not bear the iniquity of the
          father." But he would bear the iniquity if he contracted it from him.
          Therefore no one contracts any sin from one of his parents by way of
          origin.<br />

              Praeterea, accidens non traducitur per originem, nisi traducto
              subiecto, eo quod accidens non transit de subiecto in subiectum.
              Sed anima rationalis, quae est subiectum culpae, non traducitur
              per originem, ut in primo ostensum est. Ergo neque aliqua culpa
              per originem traduci potest.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, an accident is not transmitted
              by way of origin, unless its subject be also transmitted, since
              accidents do not pass from one subject to another. Now the
              rational soul which is the subject of sin, is not transmitted by
              way of origin, as was shown in the FP, Question [118], Article
              [2]. Therefore neither can any sin be transmitted by way of

                  cannot cause sin, because it lacks the rational part of the
                  soul, which alone can be a cause of sin. Therefore no sin can

                      flesh cannot infect the soul united to it, else the soul
                      could not be cleansed of original sin, so long as it is
                      united to the body. Much less, therefore, can the semen

                          through want of exercise and through carelessness."
                          Now those are said to be "naturally ugly," who are so

                                      per hoc quod corporis defectus traducuntur
                                      a parente in prolem, sicut si leprosus
                                      generat leprosum, et podagricus
                                      podagricum, propter aliquam corruptionem
                                      seminis, licet talis corruptio non dicatur
                                      lepra vel podagra. Cum autem corpus sit
                                      proportionatum animae, et defectus animae
                                      redundent in corpus, et e converso; simili
                                      modo dicunt quod culpabilis defectus
                                      animae per traductionem seminis in prolem
                                      derivatur, quamvis semen actualiter non
                                      sit culpae subiectum.

                                      In endeavoring to explain how the sin of
                                      our first parent could be transmitted by
                                      way of origin to his descendants, various
                                      writers have gone about it in various
                                      ways. For some, considering that the
                                      subject of sin is the rational soul,
                                      maintained that the rational soul is
                                      transmitted with the semen, so that thus
                                      an infected soul would seem to produce
                                      other infected souls. Others, rejecting
                                      this as erroneous, endeavored to show how
                                      the guilt of the parent's soul can be
                                      transmitted to the children, even though
                                      the soul be not transmitted, from the fact
                                      that defects of the body are transmitted
                                      from parent to child—thus a leper may
                                      beget a leper, or a gouty man may be the
                                      father of a gouty son, on account of some
                                      seminal corruption, although this
                                      corruption is not leprosy or gout. Now
                                      since the body is proportionate to the
                                      soul, and since the soul's defects redound
                                      into the body, and vice versa, in like
                                      manner, say they, a culpable defect of the
                                      soul is passed on to the child, through
                                      the transmission of the semen, albeit the
                                      semen itself is not the subject of the
                                      guilt.<br />

                                          the fact of having a defect by the way

                                          the stain on the child's soul is not

                                          reproaches a man born blind; one

                                              they have one common nature, which
                                              they receive from their first
                                              parents; even as in civil matters,
                                              all who are members of one
                                              community are reputed as one body,
                                              and the whole community as one
                                              man. Indeed Porphyry says
                                              (Praedic., De Specie) that "by
                                              sharing the same species, many men
                                              are one man." Accordingly the
                                              multitude of men born of Adam, are
                                              as so many members of one body.
                                              Now the action of one member of
                                              the body, of the hand for
                                              instance, is voluntary not by the
                                              will of that hand, but by the will
                                              of the soul, the first mover of
                                              the members. Wherefore a murder
                                              which the hand commits would not
                                              be imputed as a sin to the hand,
                                              considered by itself as apart from
                                              the body, but is imputed to it as
                                              something belonging to man and
                                              moved by man's first moving
                                              principle. In this way, then, the
                                              disorder which is in this man born
                                              of Adam, is voluntary, not by his
                                              will, but by the will of his first
                                              parent, who, by the movement of
                                              generation, moves all who
                                              originate from him, even as the
                                              soul's will moves all the members
                                              to their actions. Hence the sin
                                              which is thus transmitted by the
                                              first parent to his descendants is
                                              called "original," just as the sin
                                              which flows from the soul into the
                                              bodily members is called "actual."
                                              And just as the actual sin that is
                                              committed by a member of the body,
                                              is not the sin of that member,
                                              except inasmuch as that member is
                                              a part of the man, for which
                                              reason it is called a "human sin";
                                              so original sin is not the sin of
                                              this person, except inasmuch as
                                              this person receives his nature
                                              from his first parent, for which
                                              reason it is called the "sin of
                                              nature," according to Eph. 2:3:
                                              "We... were by nature children of
                                              wrath."<br />

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod etiam alia peccata vel ipsius
          primi parentis, vel proximorum parentum, traducantur in posteros.
          Poena enim nunquam debetur nisi culpae. Sed aliqui puniuntur iudicio
          divino pro peccato proximorum parentum; secundum illud Exod. XX, ego
          sum Deus Zelotes, visitans iniquitatem patrum in filios, in tertiam et
          quartam generationem. Iudicio etiam humano, in crimine laesae
          maiestatis, filii exheredantur pro peccato parentum. Ergo etiam culpa

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that also other sins, whether
          of the first parent or of nearer ancestors, are transmitted to their
          descendants. For punishment is never due unless for fault. Now some
          are punished by the judgment of God for the sin of their immediate
          parents, according to Ex. 20:5: "I am... God... jealous, visiting the
          iniquity of the fathers upon the children, unto the third and fourth
          generation." Furthermore, according to human law, the children of
          those who are guilty of high treason are disinherited. Therefore the
          guilt of nearer ancestors is also transmitted to their descendants.<br />

              Praeterea, magis potest transferre in alterum id quod habet
              aliquis a seipso, quam id quod habet ex alio, sicut ignis magis
              potest calefacere quam aqua calefacta, sed homo transfert in
              prolem per originem peccatum quod habet ab Adam. Ergo multo magis
              peccatum quod ipse commisit.

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man can better transmit to
              another, that which he has of himself, than that which he has
              received from another: thus fire heats better than hot water does.
              Now a man transmits to his children, by the way, of origin, the
              sin which he has from Adam. Much more therefore should he transmit
              the sin which he has contracted of himself.<br />

                  originale, quia in eo fuimus sicut in principio naturae, quam
                  ipse corrupit. Sed similiter fuimus in proximis parentibus
                  sicut in quibusdam principiis naturae, quae etsi sit corrupta,
                  potest adhuc magis corrumpi per peccatum, secundum illud Apoc.
                  ult., qui in sordibus est, sordescat adhuc. Ergo filii

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the reason why we contract
                  original sin from our first parent is because we were in him
                  as in the principle of our nature, which he corrupted. But we
                  were likewise in our nearer ancestors, as in principles of our
                  nature, which however it be corrupt, can be corrupted yet more
                  by sin, according to Apoc. 22:11: "He that is filthy, let him
                  be filthier still." Therefore children contract, by the way of
                  origin, the sins of their nearer ancestors, even as they
                  contract the sin of their first parent.<br />

                          movet in Enchiridio, et insolutam relinquit. Sed si

                          est quia homo generat sibi idem in specie, non autem
                          secundum individuum. Et ideo ea quae directe pertinent
                          ad individuum, sicut personales actus et quae ad eos

                          enim grammaticus traducit in filium scientiam
                          grammaticae, quam proprio studio acquisivit. Sed ea

                          oculatus generat oculatum, nisi natura deficiat. Et si
                          natura sit fortis, etiam aliqua accidentia
                          individualia propagantur in filios, pertinentia ad
                          dispositionem naturae, sicut velocitas corporis,
                          bonitas ingenii, et alia huiusmodi, nullo autem modo
                          ea quae sunt pure personalia, ut dictum est.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Augustine puts this
                          question in the Enchiridion xlvi, xlvii, and leaves it
                          unsolved. Yet if we look into the matter carefully we
                          shall see that it is impossible for the sins of the
                          nearer ancestors, or even any other but the first sin
                          of our first parent to be transmitted by way of
                          origin. The reason is that a man begets his like in
                          species but not in individual. Consequently those
                          things that pertain directly to the individual, such
                          as personal actions and matters affecting them, are
                          not transmitted by parents to their children: for a
                          grammarian does not transmit to his son the knowledge
                          of grammar that he has acquired by his own studies. On
                          the other hand, those things that concern the nature
                          of the species, are transmitted by parents to their
                          children, unless there be a defect of nature: thus a
                          man with eyes begets a son having eyes, unless nature
                          fails. And if nature be strong, even certain accidents
                          of the individual pertaining to natural disposition,
                          are transmitted to the children, e.g. fleetness of
                          body, acuteness of intellect, and so forth; but nowise
                          those that are purely personal, as stated above.<br />

                              such, and also something through the gift of
                              grace, so may something belong to the nature as

                              nature, and something too through the gift of
                              grace. In this way original justice, as stated in
                              the FP, Question [100], Article [1], was a gift of
                              grace, conferred by God on all human nature in our
                              first parent. This gift the first man lost by his
                              first sin. Wherefore as that original justice
                              together with the nature was to have been
                              transmitted to his posterity, so also was its
                              disorder. Other actual sins, however, whether of
                              the first parent or of others, do not corrupt the
                              nature as nature, but only as the nature of that
                              person, i.e. in respect of the proneness to sin:
                              and consequently other sins are not

          Ad quartum sic proceditur. Videtur quod, si aliquis formaretur ex
          carne humana miraculose, contraheret originale peccatum. Dicit enim
          quaedam Glossa Gen. IV, quod in lumbis Adae fuit tota posteritas
          corrupta, quia non est separata prius in loco vitae, sed postea in
          loco exilii. Sed si aliquis homo sic formaretur sicut dictum est, caro

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that original sin would be
          contracted by a person formed miraculously from human flesh. For a
          gloss on Gn. 4:1 says that "Adam's entire posterity was corrupted in
          his loins, because they were not severed from him in the place of
          life, before he sinned, but in the place of exile after he had
          sinned." But if a man were to be formed in the aforesaid manner, his
          flesh would be severed in the place of exile. Therefore it would
          contract original sin.<br />

                          parent to his posterity, inasmuch as they are moved by
                          him through generation, even as the members are moved
                          by the soul to actual sin. Now there is no movement to
                          generation except by the active power of generation:
                          so that those alone contract original sin, who are

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that if Eve, and not Adam,
          had sinned, their children would have contracted original sin. Because
          we contract original sin from our parents, in so far as we were once
          in them, according to the word of the Apostle (<a

          well as in his father. Therefore a man would have contracted original
          sin from his mother's sin as well as from his father's.<br />

                                  would have been subject to the necessity of

                                  a necessary result of the matter which is
                                  provided by the mother, not as punishments,
                                  but as actual defects. This, however, seems
                                  unreasonable. Because, as stated in the FP,

                                  evident that the children would not have been
                                  deprived of original justice: and consequently
                                  they would not have been liable to suffer and
                                  subject to the necessity of dying.<br />
