<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man cannot attain happiness. For just as the 
rational is above the sensible nature, so the intellectual is above the 
rational, as Dionysius declares (Div. Nom. iv, vi, vii) in several 
passages. But irrational animals that have the sensitive nature only, 
cannot attain the end of the  rational nature. Therefore neither can man, 
who is of rational nature, attain the end of the intellectual nature, 
which is Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, True Happiness consists in seeing God, Who is pure 
Truth. But from his very nature, man considers truth in material things: 
wherefore "he understands the intelligible species in the phantasm" (De 
Anima iii, 7). Therefore he cannot attain Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Happiness consists in attaining the Sovereign Good. But 
we cannot arrive at the top without surmounting the middle. Since, 
therefore, the angelic nature through which man cannot mount is midway 
between God and human nature; it seems that he cannot attain Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++93%3A12">Ps. 93:12</a>): "Blessed is the man whom 
Thou shalt instruct, O Lord."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Happiness is the attainment of the Perfect Good. Whoever, 
therefore, is capable of the Perfect Good can attain Happiness. Now, that 
man is capable of the Perfect Good, is proved both because his intellect 
can apprehend the universal and perfect good, and because his will can 
desire it. And therefore man can attain Happiness. This can be proved 
again from the fact that man is capable of seeing God, as stated in FP, 
Question [12], Article [1]: in which vision, as we stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) man's 
perfect Happiness consists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The rational exceeds the sensitive nature, otherwise than 
the intellectual surpasses the rational. For the rational exceeds the 
sensitive nature in respect of the object of its knowledge: since the 
senses have no knowledge whatever of the universal, whereas the reason 
has knowledge thereof. But the intellectual surpasses the rational 
nature, as to the mode of knowing the same intelligible truth: for the 
intellectual nature grasps forthwith the truth which the rational nature 
reaches by the inquiry of reason, as was made clear in the FP, Question [58], 
Article [3]; FP, Question [79], Article [8]. Therefore reason arrives by a kind of movement at 
that which the intellect grasps. Consequently the rational nature can 
attain Happiness, which is the perfection of the intellectual nature: but 
otherwise than the angels. Because the angels attained it forthwith after 
the beginning of their creation: whereas man attains if after a time. But 
the sensitive nature can nowise attain this end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To man in the present state of life the natural way of 
knowing intelligible truth is by means of phantasms. But after this state 
of life, he has another natural way, as was stated in the FP, Question [84], Article [7]
; FP, Question [89], Article [1].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Man cannot surmount the angels in the degree of nature so 
as to be above them naturally. But he can surmount them by an operation 
of the intellect, by understanding that there is above the angels 
something that makes men happy; and when he has  attained it, he will be 
perfectly happy.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one man can be happier than another?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one man cannot be happier than another. For 
Happiness is "the reward of virtue," as the Philosopher says (Ethic. i, 
9). But equal reward is given for all the works of virtue; because it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++20%3A10">Mt. 20:10</a>) that all who labor in the vineyard "received every 
man a penny"; for, as Gregory says (Hom. xix in Evang.), "each was 
equally rewarded with eternal life." Therefore one man cannot be happier 
than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Happiness is the supreme good. But nothing can surpass 
the supreme. Therefore one man's Happiness cannot be surpassed by 
another's.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, since Happiness is "the perfect and sufficient good" 
(Ethic. i, 7) it brings rest to man's desire. But his desire is not at 
rest, if he yet lacks some good that can be got. And if he lack nothing 
that he can get, there can be no still greater good. Therefore either man 
is not happy; or, if he be happy, no other Happiness can be greater.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++14%3A2">Jn. 14:2</a>): "In My Father's house there 
are many mansions"; which, according to Augustine (Tract. lxvii in Joan.) 
signify "the diverse dignities of merits in the one eternal life." But 
the dignity of eternal life which is given according to merit, is 
Happiness itself. Therefore there are diverse degrees of Happiness, and 
Happiness is not equally in all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="FS001.html#FSQ1A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>; <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2OUTP1">Question [2]</a>, <A Href="FS002.html#FSQ2A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>), Happiness 
implies two things, to wit, the last end itself, i.e. the Sovereign Good; 
and the attainment or enjoyment of that same Good. As to that Good 
itself, Which is the object and cause of Happiness, one Happiness cannot 
be greater than another, since there is but one Sovereign Good, namely, 
God, by enjoying Whom, men are made happy. But as to the attainment or 
enjoyment of this Good, one man can be happier than another; because the 
more a man enjoys this Good the happier he is. Now, that one man enjoys 
God more than another, happens through his being better disposed or 
ordered to the enjoyment of Him. And in this sense one man can be happier 
than another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The one penny signifies that Happiness is one in its 
object. But the many mansions signify the manifold Happiness in the 
divers degrees of enjoyment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Happiness is said to be the supreme good, inasmuch as it is 
the perfect possession or enjoyment of the Supreme Good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> None of the Blessed lacks any desirable good; since they 
have the Infinite Good Itself, Which is "the good of all  good," as 
Augustine says (Enarr. in Ps. 134). But one is said to be happier than 
another, by reason of diverse participation of the same good. And the 
addition of other goods does not increase Happiness, since Augustine says 
(Confess. v, 4): "He who knows Thee, and others besides, is not the 
happier for knowing them, but is happy for knowing Thee alone."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Happiness can be had in this life. For it is 
written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++118%3A1">Ps. 118:1</a>): "Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in 
the law of the Lord." But this happens in this life. Therefore one can be 
happy in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, imperfect participation in the Sovereign Good does not 
destroy the nature of Happiness, otherwise one would not be happier than 
another. But men can participate in the Sovereign Good in this life, by 
knowing and loving God, albeit imperfectly. Therefore man can be happy in 
this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, what is said by many cannot be altogether false: since 
what is in many, comes, apparently, from nature; and nature does not fail 
altogether. Now many say that Happiness can be had in this life, as 
appears from Ps. 143:15: "They have called the people happy that hath 
these things," to wit, the good things in this life. Therefore one can be 
happy in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+14%3A1">Job 14:1</a>): "Man born of a woman, living 
for a short time, is filled with many miseries." But Happiness excludes 
misery. Therefore man cannot be happy in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A certain participation of Happiness can be had in this 
life: but perfect and true Happiness cannot be had in this life. This may 
be seen from a twofold consideration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; First, from the general notion of happiness. For since happiness is a 
"perfect and sufficient good," it excludes every evil, and fulfils every 
desire. But in this life every evil cannot be excluded. For this present 
life is subject to many unavoidable evils; to ignorance on the part of 
the intellect; to inordinate affection on the part of the appetite, and 
to many penalties on the part of the body; as Augustine sets forth in De 
Civ. Dei xix, 4. Likewise neither can the desire for good be satiated in 
this life. For man naturally desires the good, which he has, to be 
abiding. Now the goods of the present life pass away; since life itself 
passes away, which we naturally desire to have, and would wish to hold 
abidingly, for man naturally shrinks from death. Wherefore it is 
impossible to have true Happiness in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, from a consideration of the specific nature of Happiness, viz. 
the vision of the Divine Essence, which man cannot obtain in this life, 
as was shown in the FP, Question [12], Article [11]. Hence it is  evident that none can 
attain true and perfect Happiness in this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Some are said to be happy in this life, either on account 
of the hope of obtaining Happiness in the life to come, according to Rm. 
8:24: "We are saved by hope"; or on account of a certain participation of 
Happiness, by reason of a kind of enjoyment of the Sovereign Good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The imperfection of participated Happiness is due to one of 
two causes. First, on the part of the object of Happiness, which is not 
seen in Its Essence: and this imperfection destroys the nature of true 
Happiness. Secondly, the imperfection may be on the part of the 
participator, who indeed attains the object of Happiness, in itself, 
namely, God: imperfectly, however, in comparison with the way in which 
God enjoys Himself. This imperfection does not destroy the true nature of 
Happiness; because, since Happiness is an operation, as stated above 
(<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), the true nature of Happiness is taken from the object, 
which specifies the act, and not from the subject.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Men esteem that there is some kind of happiness to be had 
in this life, on account of a certain likeness to true Happiness. And 
thus they do not fail altogether in their estimate.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether happiness once had can be lost?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Happiness can be lost. For Happiness is a 
perfection. But every perfection is in the thing perfected according to 
the mode of the latter. Since then man is, by his nature, changeable, it 
seems that Happiness is participated by man in a changeable manner. And 
consequently it seems that man can lose Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Happiness consists in an act of the intellect; and the 
intellect is subject to the will. But the will can be directed to 
opposites. Therefore it seems that it can desist from the operation 
whereby man is made happy: and thus man will cease to be happy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the end corresponds to the beginning. But man's 
Happiness has a beginning, since man was not always happy. Therefore it 
seems that it has an end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++25%3A46">Mt. 25:46</a>) of the righteous that "they 
shall god . . . into life everlasting," which, as above stated (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), is 
the Happiness of the saints. Now what is eternal ceases not. Therefore 
Happiness cannot be lost.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of imperfect happiness, such as can be had in 
this life, in this sense it can be lost. This is clear of contemplative 
happiness, which is lost either by forgetfulness, for instance, when 
knowledge is lost through sickness; or again by  certain occupations, 
whereby a man is altogether withdrawn from contemplation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This is also clear of active happiness: since man's will can be changed 
so as to fall to vice from the virtue, in whose act that happiness 
principally consists. If, however, the virtue remain unimpaired, outward 
changes can indeed disturb such like happiness, in so far as they hinder 
many acts of virtue; but they cannot take it away altogether because 
there still remains an act of virtue, whereby man bears these trials in a 
praiseworthy manner. And since the happiness of this life can be lost, a 
circumstance that appears to be contrary to the nature of happiness, 
therefore did the Philosopher state (Ethic. i, 10) that some are happy in 
this life, not simply, but "as men," whose nature is subject to change.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But if we speak of that perfect Happiness which we await after this 
life, it must be observed that Origen (Peri Archon. ii, 3), following the 
error of certain Platonists, held that man can become unhappy after the 
final Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This, however, is evidently false, for two reasons. First, from the 
general notion of happiness. For since happiness is the "perfect and 
sufficient good," it must needs set man's desire at rest and exclude 
every evil. Now man naturally desires to hold to the good that he has, 
and to have the surety of his holding: else he must of necessity be 
troubled with the fear of losing it, or with the sorrow of knowing that 
he will lose it. Therefore it is necessary for true Happiness that man 
have the assured opinion of never losing the good that he possesses. If 
this opinion be true, it follows that he never will lose happiness: but 
if it be false, it is in itself an evil that he should have a false 
opinion: because the false is the evil of the intellect, just as the true 
is its good, as stated in Ethic. vi, 2. Consequently he will no longer be 
truly happy, if evil be in him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, it is again evident if we consider the specific nature of 
Happiness. For it has been shown above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>) that man's perfect 
Happiness consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now it is 
impossible for anyone seeing the Divine Essence, to wish not to see It. 
Because every good that one possesses and yet wishes to be without, is 
either insufficient, something more sufficing being desired in its stead; 
or else has some inconvenience attached to it, by reason of which it 
becomes wearisome. But the vision of the Divine Essence fills the soul 
with all good things, since it unites it to the source of all goodness; 
hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++16%3A15">Ps. 16:15</a>): "I shall be satisfied when Thy glory 
shall appear"; and (Wis. 7:11): "All good things came to me together with 
her," i.e. with the contemplation of wisdom. In like manner neither has 
it any inconvenience attached to it; because it is written of the 
contemplation of wisdom (Wis. 8:16): "Her conversation hath no 
bitterness, nor her company any tediousness." It is thus evident that the 
happy man cannot forsake Happiness of his own accord. Moreover, neither 
can he lose Happiness, through God taking it away from him. Because, 
since the withdrawal of  Happiness is a punishment, it cannot be enforced 
by God, the just Judge, except for some fault; and he that sees God 
cannot fall into a fault, since rectitude of the will, of necessity, 
results from that vision as was shown above (<A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). Nor again can 
it be withdrawn by any other agent. Because the mind that is united to 
God is raised above all other things: and consequently no other agent can 
sever the mind from that union. Therefore it seems unreasonable that as 
time goes on, man should pass from happiness to misery, and vice versa; 
because such like vicissitudes of time can only be for such things as are 
subject to time and movement.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Happiness is consummate perfection, which excludes every 
defect from the happy. And therefore whoever has happiness has it 
altogether unchangeably: this is done by the Divine power, which raises 
man to the participation of eternity which transcends all change.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The will can be directed to opposites, in things which are 
ordained to the end; but it is ordained, of natural necessity, to the 
last end. This is evident from the fact that man is unable not to wish to 
be happy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Happiness has a beginning owing to the condition of the 
participator: but it has no end by reason of the condition of the good, 
the participation of which makes man happy. Hence the beginning of 
happiness is from one cause, its endlessness is from another.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man can attain happiness by his natural powers?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man can attain Happiness by his natural 
powers. For nature does not fail in necessary things. But nothing is so 
necessary to man as that by which he attains the last end. Therefore this 
is not lacking to human nature. Therefore man can attain Happiness by his 
natural powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, since man is more noble than irrational creatures, it 
seems that he must be better equipped than they. But irrational creatures 
can attain their end by their natural powers. Much more therefore can man 
attain Happiness by his natural powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Happiness is a "perfect operation," according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. vii, 13). Now the beginning of a thing belongs to the 
same principle as the perfecting thereof. Since, therefore, the imperfect 
operation, which is as the beginning in human operations, is subject to 
man's natural power, whereby he is master of his own actions; it seems 
that he can attain to perfect operation, i.e. Happiness, by his natural 
powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Man is naturally the principle of his action, by his 
intellect and will. But final Happiness prepared for the saints, 
surpasses the intellect and will of man; for the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++2%3A9">1 Cor. 2:9</a>) "Eye hath not seen, nor ear heard, neither hath  it entered into the 
heart of man, what things God hath prepared for them that love Him." 
Therefore man cannot attain Happiness by his natural powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Imperfect happiness that can be had in this life, can be 
acquired by man by his natural powers, in the same way as virtue, in 
whose operation it consists: on this point we shall speak further on 
(<A Href="FS063.html#FSQ63OUTP1">Question [63]</a>). But man's perfect Happiness, as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>), 
consists in the vision of the Divine Essence. Now the vision of God's 
Essence surpasses the nature not only of man, but also of every creature, 
as was shown in the FP, Question [12], Article [4]. For the natural knowledge of every 
creature is in keeping with the mode of his substance: thus it is said of 
the intelligence (De Causis; Prop. viii) that "it knows things that are 
above it, and things that are below it, according to the mode of its 
substance." But every knowledge that is according to the mode of created 
substance, falls short of the vision of the Divine Essence, which 
infinitely surpasses all created substance. Consequently neither man, nor 
any creature, can attain final Happiness by his natural powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as nature does not fail man in necessaries, although 
it has not provided him with weapons and clothing, as it provided other 
animals, because it gave him reason and hands, with which he is able to 
get these things for himself; so neither did it fail man in things 
necessary, although it gave him not the wherewithal to attain Happiness: 
since this it could not do. But it did give him free-will, with which he 
can turn to God, that He may make him happy. "For what we do by means of 
our friends, is done, in a sense, by ourselves" (Ethic. iii, 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The nature that can attain perfect good, although it needs 
help from without in order to attain it, is of more noble condition than 
a nature which cannot attain perfect good, but attains some imperfect 
good, although it need no help from without in order to attain it, as the 
Philosopher says (De Coel. ii, 12). Thus he is better disposed to health 
who can attain perfect health, albeit by means of medicine, than he who 
can attain but imperfect health, without the help of medicine. And 
therefore the rational creature, which can attain the perfect good of 
happiness, but needs the Divine assistance for the purpose, is more 
perfect than the irrational creature, which is not capable of attaining 
this good, but attains some imperfect good by its natural powers.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When imperfect and perfect are of the same species, they 
can be caused by the same power. But this does not follow of necessity, 
if they be of different species: for not everything, that can cause the 
disposition of matter, can produce the final perfection. Now the 
imperfect operation, which is subject to man's natural power, is not of 
the same species as that perfect operation which is man's happiness: 
since operation takes its species from its object. Consequently the 
argument does not prove.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether man attains happiness through the action of some higher  creature?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man can be made happy through the action of 
some higher creature, viz. an angel. For since we observe a twofold order 
in things---one, of the parts of the universe to one another, the other, 
of the whole universe to a good which is outside the universe; the former 
order is ordained to the second as to its end (Metaph. xii, 10). Thus the 
mutual order of the parts of an army is dependent on the order of the 
parts of an army is dependent on the order of the whole army to the 
general. But the mutual order of the parts of the universe consists in 
the higher creatures acting on the lower, as stated in the FP, Question [109], 
Article [2]: while happiness consists in the order of man to a good which is 
outside the universe, i.e. God. Therefore man is made happy, through a 
higher creature, viz. an angel, acting on him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which is such in potentiality, can be reduced to 
act, by that which is such actually: thus what is potentially hot, is 
made actually hot, by something that is actually hot. But man is 
potentially happy. Therefore he can be made actually happy by an angel 
who is actually happy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Happiness consists in an operation of the intellect as 
stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>). But an angel can enlighten man's intellect as 
shown in the FP, Question [111], Article [1]. Therefore an angel can make a man happy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++83%3A12">Ps. 83:12</a>): "The Lord will give grace 
and glory."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since every creature is subject to the laws of nature, 
from the very fact that its power and action are limited: that which 
surpasses created nature, cannot be done by the power of any creature. 
Consequently if anything need to be done that is above nature, it is done 
by God immediately; such as raising the dead to life, restoring sight to 
the blind, and such like. Now it has been shown above (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>) that 
Happiness is a good surpassing created nature. Therefore it is impossible 
that it be bestowed through the action of any creature: but by God alone 
is man made happy, if we speak of perfect Happiness. If, however, we 
speak of imperfect happiness, the same is to be said of it as of the 
virtue, in whose act it consists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It often happens in the case of active powers ordained to 
one another, that it belongs to the highest power to reach the last end, 
while the lower powers contribute to the attainment of that last end, by 
causing a disposition thereto: thus to the art of sailing, which commands 
the art of shipbuilding, it belongs to use a ship for the end for which 
it was made. Thus, too, in the order of the universe, man is indeed 
helped by the angels in the attainment of his last end, in respect of 
certain preliminary dispositions thereto: whereas he attains the last end 
itself through the First Agent, which is God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a form exists perfectly and naturally in something, it 
can be the principle of action on something else: for instance a hot 
thing heats through heat. But if a form exist in something imperfectly, 
and not naturally, it cannot be the principle whereby it is communicated 
to something else: thus the "intention" of color which is in the pupil, 
cannot make a thing white; nor indeed can everything enlightened or 
heated give heat or light to something else; for if they could, 
enlightening and heating would go on to infinity. But the light of glory, 
whereby God is seen, is in God perfectly and naturally; whereas in any 
creature, it is imperfectly and by likeness or participation. 
Consequently no creature can communicate its Happiness to another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A happy angel enlightens the intellect of a man or of a 
lower angel, as to certain notions of the Divine works: but not as to the 
vision of the Divine Essence, as was stated in the FP, Question [106], Article [1]: 
since in order to see this, all are immediately enlightened by God.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether any good works are necessary that man may receive happiness from God?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no works of man are necessary that he may 
obtain Happiness from God. For since God is an agent of infinite power, 
He requires before acting, neither matter, nor disposition of matter, but 
can forthwith produce the whole effect. But man's works, since they are 
not required for Happiness, as the efficient cause thereof, as stated 
above (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>), can be required only as dispositions thereto. Therefore God 
who does not require dispositions before acting, bestows Happiness 
without any previous works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as God is the immediate cause of Happiness, so is 
He the immediate cause of nature. But when God first established nature, 
He produced creatures without any previous disposition or action on the 
part of the creature, but made each one perfect forthwith in its species. 
Therefore it seems that He bestows Happiness on man without any previous 
works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Apostle says (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++4%3A6">Rm. 4:6</a>) that Happiness is of the man 
"to whom God reputeth justice without works." Therefore no works of man 
are necessary for attaining Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13%3A17">Jn. 13:17</a>): "If you know these things, 
you shall be blessed if you do them." Therefore Happiness is obtained 
through works.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Rectitude of the will, as stated above (<A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>, <A Href="FS004.html#FSQ4A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), is 
necessary for Happiness; since it is nothing else than the right order of 
the will to the last end; and it is therefore necessary for obtaining the 
end, just as the right disposition of matter, in order to receive the 
form. But this does not prove that any work of man need precede his 
Happiness: for God could make a  will having a right tendency to the end, 
and at the same time attaining the end; just as sometimes He disposes 
matter and at the same time introduces the form. But the order of Divine 
wisdom demands that it should not be thus; for as is stated in De Coel. 
ii, 12, "of those things that have a natural capacity for the perfect 
good, one has it without movement, some by one movement, some by 
several." Now to possess the perfect good without movement, belongs to 
that which has it naturally: and to have Happiness naturally belongs to 
God alone. Therefore it belongs to God alone not to be moved towards 
Happiness by any previous operation. Now since Happiness surpasses every 
created nature, no pure creature can becomingly gain Happiness, without 
the movement of operation, whereby it tends thereto. But the angel, who 
is above man in the natural order, obtained it, according to the order of 
Divine wisdom, by one movement of a meritorious work, as was explained in 
the FP, Question [62], Article [5]; whereas man obtains it by many movements of works 
which are called merits. Wherefore also according to the Philosopher 
(Ethic. i, 9), happiness is the reward of works of virtue.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Works are necessary to man in order to gain Happiness; not 
on account of the insufficiency of the Divine power which bestows 
Happiness, but that the order in things be observed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God produced the first creatures so that they are perfect 
forthwith, without any previous disposition or operation of the creature; 
because He instituted the first individuals of the various species, that 
through them nature might be propagated to their progeny. In like manner, 
because Happiness was to be bestowed on others through Christ, who is God 
and Man, "Who," according to Heb. 2:10, "had brought many children into 
glory"; therefore, from the very beginning of His conception, His soul 
was happy, without any previous meritorious operation. But this is 
peculiar to Him: for Christ's merit avails baptized children for the 
gaining of Happiness, though they have no merits of their own; because by 
Baptism they are made members of Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[7] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The Apostle is speaking of the Happiness of Hope, which is 
bestowed on us by sanctifying grace, which is not given on account of 
previous works. For grace is not a term of movement, as Happiness is; 
rather is it the principle of the movement that tends towards Happiness.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether every man desires happiness?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all desire Happiness. For no man can 
desire what he knows not; since the apprehended good is the object of the 
appetite (De Anima iii, 10). But many know not what Happiness is. This is 
evident from the fact that, as Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 4), "some 
thought that Happiness consists in pleasures of the body; some, in a 
virtue of the soul; some in other things." Therefore not all desire 
Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the essence of Happiness is the vision of the Divine 
Essence, as stated above (<A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>, <A Href="FS003.html#FSQ3A8THEP1">Article [8]</a>). But some consider it impossible 
for man to see the Divine Essence; wherefore they desire it not. 
Therefore all men do not desire Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 5) that "happy is he who 
has all he desires, and desires nothing amiss." But all do not desire 
this; for some desire certain things amiss, and yet they wish to desire 
such things. Therefore all do not desire Happiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Trin. xiii, 3): "If that actor had 
said: 'You all wish to be happy; you do not wish to be unhappy,' he would 
have said that which none would have failed to acknowledge in his will." 
Therefore everyone desires to be happy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Happiness can be considered in two ways. First according 
to the general notion of happiness: and thus, of necessity, every man 
desires happiness. For the general notion of happiness consists in the 
perfect good, as stated above (<A Href="FS005.html#FSQ5ATHEP1">Articles [3]</a>,4). But since good is the object of 
the will, the perfect good of a man is that which entirely satisfies his 
will. Consequently to desire happiness is nothing else than to desire 
that one's will be satisfied. And this everyone desires. Secondly we may 
speak of Happiness according to its specific notion, as to that in which 
it consists. And thus all do not know Happiness; because they know not in 
what thing the general notion of happiness is found. And consequently, in 
this respect, not all desire it. Wherefore the reply to the first 
Objection is clear.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Since the will follows the apprehension of the intellect or 
reason; just as it happens that where there is no real distinction, there 
may be a distinction according to the consideration of reason; so does it 
happen that one and the same thing is desired in one way, and not desired 
in another. So that happiness may be considered as the final and perfect 
good, which is the general notion of happiness: and thus the will 
naturally and of necessity tends thereto, as stated above. Again it can 
be considered under other special aspects, either on the part of the 
operation itself, or on the part of the operating power, or on the part 
of the object; and thus the will does not tend thereto of necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT FS Q[5] A[8] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This definition of Happiness given by some---"Happy is the 
man that has all he desires," or, "whose every wish is fulfilled" is a 
good and adequate definition; but an inadequate definition if understood 
in another. For if we understand it simply of all that man desires by his 
natural appetite, thus it is true that he who has all that he desires, is 
happy: since nothing satisfies man's natural desire, except the perfect 
good which is Happiness. But if we understand it of those things that man 
desires according to the apprehension of the reason, thus it does not 
belong to Happiness, to have certain things that man desires; rather does 
it belong to unhappiness, in  so far as the possession of such things 
hinders man from having all that he desires naturally; thus it is that 
reason sometimes accepts as true things that are a hindrance to the 
knowledge of truth. And it was through taking this into consideration 
that Augustine added so as to include perfect Happiness---that he 
"desires nothing amiss": although the first part suffices if rightly 
understood, to wit, that "happy is he who has all he desires."<br>
