    Whether the Old Law enjoined fitting precepts concerning rulers?<br />
  </h3>

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod inconvenienter lex vetus de
          principibus ordinaverit. Quia, ut philosophus dicit, in III Polit.,
          ordinatio populi praecipue dependet ex maximo principatu. Sed in lege
          non invenitur qualiter debeat institui supremus princeps. Invenitur
          autem de inferioribus principibus, primo quidem, Exod. XVIII, provide
          de omni plebe viros sapientes, etc.; et Num. XI, congrega mihi
          septuaginta viros de senioribus Israel; et Deut. I, date ex vobis
          viros sapientes et gnaros, et cetera. Ergo insufficienter lex vetus
          principes populi ordinavit.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law made
          unfitting precepts concerning rulers. Because, as the Philosopher says
          (Polit. iii, 4), "the ordering of the people depends mostly on the
          chief ruler." But the Law contains no precept relating to the
          institution of the chief ruler; and yet we find therein prescriptions
          concerning the inferior rulers: firstly (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++18%3A21"
            >Ex. 18:21</a
          >): "Provide out of all the people wise [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc.;
          again (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Num++11%3A16"
            >Num. 11:16</a
          >): "Gather unto Me seventy men of the ancients of Israel"; and again
          (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt+++1%3A13"
            >Dt. 1:13</a
          >): "Let Me have from among you wise and understanding men," etc.
          Therefore the Law provided insufficiently in regard to the rulers of
          the people.<br />

              Praeterea, optimi est optima adducere, ut Plato dicit. Sed optima
              ordinatio civitatis vel populi cuiuscumque est ut gubernetur per
              regem, quia huiusmodi regimen maxime repraesentat divinum regimen,
              quo unus Deus mundum gubernat. A principio igitur lex debuit regem
              populo instituere; et non permittere hoc eorum arbitrio, sicut
              permittitur Deut. XVII, cum dixeris, constituam super me regem,
              eum constitues, et cetera.

            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "The best gives of the best,"
              as Plato states (Tim. ii). Now the best ordering of a state or of
              any nation is to be ruled by a king: because this kind of
              government approaches nearest in resemblance to the Divine
              government, whereby God rules the world from the beginning.
              Therefore the Law should have set a king over the people, and they
              should not have been allowed a choice in the matter, as indeed
              they were allowed (<a
                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++17%3A14,15"
                >Dt. 17:14,15</a
              >): "When thou... shalt say: I will set a king over me... thou
              shalt set him," etc.<br />

                  desolabitur, quod etiam experimento patuit in populo
                  Iudaeorum, in quo divisio regni fuit destructionis causa. Sed
                  lex praecipue debet intendere ea quae pertinent ad communem
                  salutem populi. Ergo debuit in lege prohiberi divisio regni in
                  duos reges. Nec etiam debuit hoc auctoritate divina introduci;
                  sicut legitur introductum auctoritate domini per Ahiam
                  Silonitem prophetam, III Reg. XI.

                  "Every kingdom divided against itself shall be made desolate":
                  a saying which was verified in the Jewish people, whose
                  destruction was brought about by the division of the kingdom.
                  But the Law should aim chiefly at things pertaining to the
                  general well-being of the people. Therefore it should have
                  forbidden the kingdom to be divided under two kings: nor
                  should this have been introduced even by Divine authority; as
                  we read of its being introduced by the authority of the
                  prophet Ahias the Silonite (<a

                      etiam principes instituuntur ad utilitatem populi in rebus
                      humanis. Sed sacerdotibus et Levitis qui sunt in lege,
                      deputantur aliqua ex quibus vivere debeant, sicut decimae
                      et primitiae, et multa alia huiusmodi. Ergo similiter
                      principibus populi debuerunt aliqua ordinari unde

                      concerning God, as stated in Heb. 5:1; so are rulers set
                      up for the benefit of the people in human affairs. But
                      certain things were allotted as a means of livelihood for
                      the priests and Levites of the Law: such as the tithes and
                      first-fruits, and many like things. Therefore in like
                      manner certain things should have been determined for the
                      livelihood of the rulers of the people: the more that they
                      were forbidden to accept presents, as is clearly stated in
                      Ex. 23:8: "You shall not [Vulg.: 'Neither shalt thou']

                                  <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Two points are to
                                  be observed concerning the right ordering of
                                  rulers in a state or nation. One is that all
                                  should take some share in the government: for
                                  this form of constitution ensures peace among
                                  the people, commends itself to all, and is
                                  most enduring, as stated in Polit. ii, 6. The
                                  other point is to be observed in respect of
                                  the kinds of government, or the different ways
                                  in which the constitutions are established.
                                  For whereas these differ in kind, as the
                                  Philosopher states (Polit. iii, 5),
                                  nevertheless the first place is held by the
                                  "kingdom," where the power of government is
                                  vested in one; and "aristocracy," which
                                  signifies government by the best, where the
                                  power of government is vested in a few.
                                  Accordingly, the best form of government is in
                                  a state or kingdom, where one is given the
                                  power to preside over all; while under him are
                                  others having governing powers: and yet a
                                  government of this kind is shared by all, both
                                  because all are eligible to govern, and
                                  because the rules are chosen by all. For this
                                  is the best form of polity, being partly
                                  kingdom, since there is one at the head of
                                  all; partly aristocracy, in so far as a number
                                  of persons are set in authority; partly
                                  democracy, i.e. government by the people, in
                                  so far as the rulers can be chosen from the
                                  people, and the people have the right to
                                  choose their rulers.<br />

                                      Such was the form of government
                                      established by the Divine Law. For Moses
                                      and his successors governed the people in
                                      such a way that each of them was ruler
                                      over all; so that there was a kind of
                                      kingdom. Moreover, seventy-two men were
                                      chosen, who were elders in virtue: for it
                                      is written (<a
                                        href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++1%3A15"
                                        >Dt. 1:15</a

                                      honorable, and appointed them rulers": so
                                      that there was an element of aristocracy.
                                      But it was a democratical government in so
                                      far as the rulers were chosen from all the
                                      people; for it is written (<a

                                        >Ex. 18:21</a

                                      [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc.; and, again, in
                                      so far as they were chosen by the people;
                                      wherefore it is written (<a

                                      [Vulg.: 'able'] men," etc. Consequently it
                                      is evident that the ordering of the rulers
                                      was well provided for by the Law.<br />

                                          is why the Lord reserved to Himself
                                          the institution of the chief ruler.
                                          For this too did Moses pray (<a

                                          spirits of all the flesh provide a

                                          Thus by God's orders Josue was set at
                                          the head in place of Moses; and we
                                          read about each of the judges who
                                          succeeded Josue that God "raised... up
                                          a saviour" for the people, and that
                                          "the spirit of the Lord was" in them
                                          (Jgs 3:9,10,15). Hence the Lord did
                                          not leave the choice of a king to the
                                          people; but reserved this to Himself,
                                          as appears from Dt. 17:15: "Thou shalt
                                          set him whom the Lord thy God shall

                                              cum plena potestate, sed iudicem
                                              et gubernatorem in eorum
                                              custodiam. Sed postea regem ad

                                              Reg. VIII, non te abiecerunt, sed
                                              me, ne regnem super eos.

                                              A kingdom is the best form of
                                              government of the people, so long
                                              as it is not corrupt. But since
                                              the power granted to a king is so
                                              great, it easily degenerates into
                                              tyranny, unless he to whom this
                                              power is given be a very virtuous
                                              man: for it is only the virtuous
                                              man that conducts himself well in
                                              the midst of prosperity, as the
                                              Philosopher observes (Ethic. iv,
                                              3). Now perfect virtue is to be
                                              found in few: and especially were
                                              the Jews inclined to cruelty and
                                              avarice, which vices above all
                                              turn men into tyrants. Hence from
                                              the very first the Lord did not
                                              set up the kingly authority with
                                              full power, but gave them judges
                                              and governors to rule them. But
                                              afterwards when the people asked
                                              Him to do so, being indignant with
                                              them, so to speak, He granted them
                                              a king, as is clear from His words

                                                  wait for the Lord's decision;
                                                  and that they should not make
                                                  a man of another nation king,
                                                  because such kings are wont to
                                                  take little interest in the
                                                  people they are set over, and
                                                  consequently to have no care
                                                  for their welfare: secondly,
                                                  He prescribed how the king
                                                  after his appointment should
                                                  behave, in regard to himself;
                                                  namely, that he should not
                                                  accumulate chariots and
                                                  horses, nor wives, nor immense
                                                  wealth: because through
                                                  craving for such things
                                                  princes become tyrants and
                                                  forsake justice. He also
                                                  appointed the manner in which
                                                  they were to conduct
                                                  themselves towards God:
                                                  namely, that they should
                                                  continually read and ponder on
                                                  God's Law, and should ever
                                                  fear and obey God. Moreover,
                                                  He decided how they should
                                                  behave towards their subjects:
                                                  namely, that they should not

                                                  ill-treat them, and that they
                                                  should not depart from the

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod inconvenienter fuerint
          tradita praecepta iudicialia quantum ad popularium convictum. Non enim
          possunt homines pacifice vivere ad invicem, si unus accipiat ea quae
          sunt alterius. Sed hoc videtur esse inductum in lege, dicitur enim
          Deut. XXIII, ingressus vineam proximi tui, comede uvas quantum tibi

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial precepts
          were not suitably framed as regards the relations of one man with
          another. Because men cannot live together in peace, if one man takes
          what belongs to another. But this seems to have been approved by the
          Law: since it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++23%3A24"
            >Dt. 23:24</a
          >): "Going into thy neighbor's vineyard, thou mayest eat as many
          grapes as thou pleasest." Therefore the Old Law did not make suitable
          provisions for man's peace.<br />

              II Polit. Sed hoc fuit introductum in veteri lege, dicitur enim
              Num. XXVII, homo cum mortuus fuerit absque filio, ad filiam eius
              transibit hereditas. Ergo non convenienter providit lex saluti

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, one of the chief causes of the
              downfall of states has been the holding of property by women, as
              the Philosopher says (Polit. ii, 6). But this was introduced by
              the Old Law; for it is written (<a

                >Num. 27:8</a
              >): "When a man dieth without a son, his inheritance shall pass to
              his daughter." Therefore the Law made unsuitable provision for the
              welfare of the people.<br />

                  quibus indigent, ut dicitur in I Polit. Sed lex vetus abstulit
                  virtutem venditionis, mandavit enim quod possessio vendita
                  reverteretur ad venditorem in quinquagesimo anno iubilaei, ut
                  patet Levit. XXV. Inconvenienter igitur lex populum illum

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is most conducive to
                  the preservation of human society that men may provide
                  themselves with necessaries by buying and selling, as stated
                  in Polit. i. But the Old Law took away the force of sales;
                  since it prescribes that in the 50th year of the jubilee all
                  that is sold shall return to the vendor (Lev. 25:28).
                  Therefore in this matter the Law gave the people an unfitting
                  command.<br />

                      promptitudo tollitur per hoc quod creditores accepta non
                      reddunt, unde dicitur Eccli. XXIX, multi non causa
                      nequitiae non faenerati sunt, sed fraudari gratis
                      timuerunt. Hoc autem induxit lex. Primo quidem, quia
                      mandavit Deut. XV, cui debetur aliquid ab amico vel
                      proximo ac fratre suo, repetere non poterit, quia annus
                      remissionis est domini; et Exod. XXII dicitur quod si
                      praesente domino animal mutuatum mortuum fuerit, reddere
                      non tenetur. Secundo, quia aufertur ei securitas quae
                      habetur per pignus, dicitur enim Deut. XXIV, cum repetes a
                      proximo tuo rem aliquam quam debet tibi, non ingredieris
                      domum eius ut pignus auferas; et iterum, non pernoctabit
                      apud te pignus, sed statim reddes ei. Ergo insufficienter
                      fuit ordinatum in lege de mutuis.

                      <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, man's needs require
                      that men should be ready to lend: which readiness ceases
                      if the creditors do not return the pledges: hence it is
                      written (Ecclus. 29:10): "Many have refused to lend, not
                      out of wickedness, but they were afraid to be defrauded
                      without cause." And yet this was encouraged by the Law.
                      First, because it prescribed (<a

                        >Ex. 22:15</a
                      >) it is stated that if a borrowed animal should die while
                      the owner is present, the borrower is not bound to make
                      restitution. Secondly, because the security acquired
                      through the pledge is lost: for it is written (<a
                        href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++24%3A10"

                      he oweth thee, thou shalt not go into his house to take
                      away a pledge"; and again (<a

                      thou shalt restore it to him presently." Therefore the Law
                      made insufficient provision in the matter of loans.<br />

                          observed little caution in regard to deposits: since
                          it is prescribed (<a

                          stand by the oath of the depositary. Therefore the Law

                                      [peregrino]." Thirdly, when any foreigners
                                      wished to be admitted entirely to their
                                      fellowship and mode of worship. With
                                      regard to these a certain order was
                                      observed. For they were not at once
                                      admitted to citizenship: just as it was
                                      law with some nations that no one was
                                      deemed a citizen except after two or three
                                      generations, as the Philosopher says
                                      (Polit. iii, 1). The reason for this was
                                      that if foreigners were allowed to meddle
                                      with the affairs of a nation as soon as
                                      they settled down in its midst, many
                                      dangers might occur, since the foreigners
                                      not yet having the common good firmly at
                                      heart might attempt something hurtful to
                                      the people. Hence it was that the Law
                                      prescribed in respect of certain nations
                                      that had close relations with the Jews
                                      (viz., the Egyptians among whom they were
                                      born and educated, and the Idumeans, the
                                      children of Esau, Jacob's brother), that
                                      they should be admitted to the fellowship
                                      of the people after the third generation;
                                      whereas others (with whom their relations
                                      had been hostile, such as the Ammonites
                                      and Moabites) were never to be admitted to
                                      citizenship; while the Amalekites, who
                                      were yet more hostile to them, and had no
                                      fellowship of kindred with them, were to
                                      be held as foes in perpetuity: for it is

                                          In like manner with regard to hostile
                                          relations with foreigners, the Law
                                          contained suitable precepts. For, in
                                          the first place, it commanded that war
                                          should be declared for a just cause:
                                          thus it is commanded (<a

                                            >Dt. 20:10</a
                                          >) that when they advanced to besiege
                                          a city, they should at first make an
                                          offer of peace. Secondly, it enjoined
                                          that when once they had entered on a
                                          war they should undauntedly persevere
                                          in it, putting their trust in God. And
                                          in order that they might be the more
                                          heedful of this command, it ordered
                                          that on the approach of battle the
                                          priest should hearten them by
                                          promising them God's aid. Thirdly, it
                                          prescribed the removal of whatever
                                          might prove an obstacle to the fight,
                                          and that certain men, who might be in
                                          the way, should be sent home.
                                          Fourthly, it enjoined that they should
                                          use moderation in pursuing the
                                          advantage of victory, by sparing women
                                          and children, and by not cutting down
                                          fruit-trees of that country.<br />

                                                      (Polit. iii, 3), a man is
                                                      said to be a citizen in
                                                      two ways: first, simply;
                                                      secondly, in a restricted
                                                      sense. A man is a citizen
                                                      simply if he has all the
                                                      rights of citizenship, for
                                                      instance, the right of
                                                      debating or voting in the
                                                      popular assembly. On the
                                                      other hand, any man may be
                                                      called citizen, only in a
                                                      restricted sense, if he
                                                      dwells within the state,
                                                      even common people or
                                                      children or old men, who
                                                      are not fit to enjoy power

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Old Law set forth
          unsuitable precepts about the members of the household. For a slave
          "is in every respect his master's property," as the Philosopher states
          (Polit. i, 2). But that which is a man's property should be his
          always. Therefore it was unfitting for the Law to command (<a

                                                  members of a household regard
                                                  everyday actions directed to
                                                  the necessities of life, as
                                                  the Philosopher states (Polit.
                                                  i, 1). Now the preservation of
                                                  man's life may be considered
                                                  from two points of view.
                                                  First, from the point of view
                                                  of the individual, i.e. in so
                                                  far as man preserves his
                                                  individuality: and for the
                                                  purpose of the preservation of
                                                  life, considered from this
                                                  standpoint, man has at his
                                                  service external goods, by
                                                  means of which he provides
                                                  himself with food and clothing
                                                  and other such necessaries of
                                                  life: in the handling of which
                                                  he has need of servants.
                                                  Secondly man's life is
                                                  preserved from the point of
                                                  view of the species, by means
                                                  of generation, for which
                                                  purpose man needs a wife, that
                                                  she may bear him children.
                                                  Accordingly the mutual
                                                  relations of the members of a
                                                  household admit of a threefold
                                                  combination: viz. those of
                                                  master and servant, those of
                                                  husband and wife, and those of
                                                  father and son: and in respect
                                                  of all these relationships the
                                                  Old Law contained fitting
                                                  precepts. Thus, with regard to
                                                  servants, it commanded them to
                                                  be treated with
                                                  moderation—both as to their
                                                  work, lest, to wit, they
