          good. For it is written (Ezech. 20:25): "I gave them statutes that
          were not good, and judgments in which they shall not live." But a law
          is not said to be good except on account of the goodness of the

          reprimebat, quae rationi adversatur; ut patet in illo mandato, non
          concupisces rem proximi tui, quod ponitur Exod. XX. Ipsa etiam omnia

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Without any doubt, the Old Law was good.
          For just as a doctrine is shown to be good by the fact that it accords
          with right reason, so is a law proved to be good if it accords with
          reason. Now the Old Law was in accordance with reason. Because it
          repressed concupiscence which is in conflict with reason, as evidenced
          by the commandment, "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's goods" (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++20%3A17"
            >Ex. 20:17</a
          >). Moreover the same law forbade all kinds of sin; and these too are
          contrary to reason. Consequently it is evident that it was a good law.
          The Apostle argues in the same way (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7"
            >Rm. 7</a
          >): "I am delighted," says he (verse 22), "with the law of God,
          according to the inward man": and again (verse 16): "I consent to the
          law, that is good."<br />

          Sed notandum est quod bonum diversos gradus habet, ut Dionysius dicit,
          IV cap. de Div. Nom., est enim aliquod bonum perfectum, et aliquod
          bonum imperfectum. Perfecta quidem bonitas est, in his quae ad finem
          ordinantur, quando aliquid est tale quod per se sufficiens est
          inducere ad finem, imperfectum autem bonum est quod operatur aliquid
          ad hoc quod perveniatur ad finem, non tamen sufficit ad hoc quod ad
          finem perducat. Sicut medicina perfecte bona est quae hominem sanat,
          imperfecta autem est quae hominem adiuvat, sed tamen sanare non
          potest. Est autem sciendum quod est alius finis legis humanae, et
          alius legis divinae. Legis enim humanae finis est temporalis
          tranquillitas civitatis, ad quem finem pervenit lex cohibendo
          exteriores actus, quantum ad illa mala quae possunt perturbare
          pacificum statum civitatis. Finis autem legis divinae est perducere
          hominem ad finem felicitatis aeternae; qui quidem finis impeditur per
          quodcumque peccatum, et non solum per actus exteriores, sed etiam per
          interiores. Et ideo illud quod sufficit ad perfectionem legis humanae,
          ut scilicet peccata prohibeat et poenam apponat, non sufficit ad
          perfectionem legis divinae, sed oportet quod hominem totaliter faciat
          idoneum ad participationem felicitatis aeternae. Quod quidem fieri non
          potest nisi per gratiam spiritus sancti, per quam diffunditur caritas
          in cordibus nostris, quae legem adimplet, gratia enim Dei vita
          aeterna, ut dicitur Rom. VI. Hanc autem gratiam lex vetus conferre non
          potuit, reservabatur enim hoc Christo, quia, ut dicitur Ioan. I, lex
          per Moysen data est; gratia et veritas per Iesum Christum facta est.
          Et inde est quod lex vetus bona quidem est, sed imperfecta; secundum
          illud Heb. VII, nihil ad perfectum adduxit lex.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          But it must be noted that the good has various degrees, as Dionysius
          states (Div. Nom. iv): for there is a perfect good, and an imperfect
          good. In things ordained to an end, there is perfect goodness when a
          thing is such that it is sufficient in itself to conduce to the end:
          while there is imperfect goodness when a thing is of some assistance
          in attaining the end, but is not sufficient for the realization
          thereof. Thus a medicine is perfectly good, if it gives health to a
          man; but it is imperfect, if it helps to cure him, without being able
          to bring him back to health. Again it must be observed that the end of
          human law is different from the end of Divine law. For the end of
          human law is the temporal tranquillity of the state, which end law
          effects by directing external actions, as regards those evils which
          might disturb the peaceful condition of the state. On the other hand,
          the end of the Divine law is to bring man to that end which is
          everlasting happiness; which end is hindered by any sin, not only of
          external, but also of internal action. Consequently that which
          suffices for the perfection of human law, viz. the prohibition and
          punishment of sin, does not suffice for the perfection of the Divine
          law: but it is requisite that it should make man altogether fit to
          partake of everlasting happiness. Now this cannot be done save by the
          grace of the Holy Ghost, whereby "charity" which fulfilleth the law...
          "is spread abroad in our hearts" (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A5"
            >Rm. 5:5</a
          >): since "the grace of God is life everlasting" (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++6%3A23"
            >Rm. 6:23</a
          >). But the Old Law could not confer this grace, for this was reserved
          to Christ; because, as it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++1%3A17"
            >Jn. 1:17</a
          >), the law was given "by Moses, grace and truth came by Jesus
          Christ." Consequently the Old Law was good indeed, but imperfect,
          according to Heb. 7:19: "The law brought nothing to perfection."<br />

          pointedly, "and judgments in which they shall not live"; i.e. whereby
          they are unable to obtain life; and so the text goes on: "And I
          polluted them," i.e. showed them to be polluted, "in their own gifts,

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The law is said to have been
          deadly, as being not the cause, but the occasion of death, on account
          of its imperfection: in so far as it did not confer grace enabling man
          to fulfil what is prescribed, and to avoid what it forbade. Hence this
          occasion was not given to men, but taken by them. Wherefore the
          Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++5%3A11"
            >Rm. 5:11</a
          >): "Sin, taking occasion by the commandment, seduced me, and by it
          killed me." In the same sense when it is said that "the law entered in
          that sin might abound," the conjunction "that" must be taken as
          consecutive and not final: in so far as men, taking occasion from the
          law, sinned all the more, both because a sin became more grievous
          after law had forbidden it, and because concupiscence increased, since
          we desire a thing the more from its being forbidden.<br />

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Old Law was given by the good God,
          Who is the Father of Our Lord Jesus Christ. For the Old Law ordained
          men to Christ in two ways. First by bearing witness to Christ;
          wherefore He Himself says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++24%3A44"
            >Lk. 24:44</a
          >): "All things must needs be fulfilled, which are written in the
          law... and in the prophets, and in the psalms, concerning Me": and (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A46"
            >Jn. 5:46</a
          >): "If you did believe Moses, you would perhaps believe Me also; for
          he wrote of Me." Secondly, as a kind of disposition, since by
          withdrawing men from idolatrous worship, it enclosed [concludebat]
          them in the worship of one God, by Whom the human race was to be saved
          through Christ. Wherefore the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gal++3%3A23"
            >Gal. 3:23</a
          >): "Before the faith came, we were kept under the law shut up
          [conclusi], unto that faith which was to be revealed." Now it is
          evident that the same thing it is, which gives a disposition to the
          end, and which brings to the end; and when I say "the same," I mean
          that it does so either by itself or through its subjects. For the
          devil would not make a law whereby men would be led to Christ, Who was
          to cast him out, according to Mt. 12:26: "If Satan cast out Satan, his
          kingdom is divided" [Vulg.: 'he is divided against himself'].
          Therefore the Old Law was given by the same God, from Whom came
          salvation to man, through the grace of Christ.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod lex data est a Deo per Angelos. Et praeter
          generalem rationem, quam Dionysius assignat, in IV cap. Cael. Hier.,
          quod divina debent deferri ad homines mediantibus Angelis, specialis
          ratio est quare legem veterem per Angelos dari oportuit. Dictum est
          enim quod lex vetus imperfecta erat, sed disponebat ad salutem
          perfectam generis humani, quae futura erat per Christum. Sic autem
          videtur in omnibus potestatibus et artibus ordinatis, quod ille qui
          est superior, principalem et perfectum actum operatur per seipsum; ea
          vero quae disponunt ad perfectionem ultimam, operatur per suos
          ministros; sicut navifactor compaginat navem per seipsum, sed
          praeparat materiam per artifices subministrantes. Et ideo conveniens
          fuit ut lex perfecta novi testamenti daretur immediate per ipsum Deum
          hominem factum; lex autem vetus per ministros Dei, scilicet per
          Angelos, daretur hominibus. Et per hunc modum apostolus, in principio
          ad Heb., probat eminentiam novae legis ad veterem, quia in novo
          testamento locutus est nobis Deus in filio suo, in veteri autem
          testamento est sermo factus per Angelos.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Law was given by God through the
          angels. And besides the general reason given by Dionysius (Coel. Hier.
          iv), viz. that "the gifts of God should be brought to men by means of
          the angels," there is a special reason why the Old Law should have
          been given through them. For it has been stated (<a
            href="FS098.html#FSQ98ATHEP1"
            >Articles [1]</a
          >,2) that the Old Law was imperfect, and yet disposed man to that
          perfect salvation of the human race, which was to come through Christ.
          Now it is to be observed that wherever there is an order of powers or
          arts, he that holds the highest place, himself exercises the principal
          and perfect acts; while those things which dispose to the ultimate
          perfection are effected by him through his subordinates: thus the
          ship-builder himself rivets the planks together, but prepares the
          material by means of the workmen who assist him under his direction.
          Consequently it was fitting that the perfect law of the New Testament
          should be given by the incarnate God immediately; but that the Old Law
          should be given to men by the ministers of God, i.e. by the angels. It
          is thus that the Apostle at the beginning of his epistle to the
          Hebrews (1:2) proves the excellence of the New Law over the Old;
          because in the New Testament "God... hath spoken to us by His Son,"
          whereas in the Old Testament "the word was spoken by angels" (<a

          is that the angel spoke as personating the Lord.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (Gen. ad lit.
          xii, 27), it is stated in Exodus that "the Lord spoke to Moses face to
          face"; and shortly afterwards we read, "Show me Thy glory. Therefore
          He perceived what he saw and he desired what he saw not." Hence he did
          not see the very Essence of God; and consequently he was not taught by
          Him immediately. Accordingly when Scripture states that "He spoke to
          him face to face," this is to be understood as expressing the opinion
          of the people, who thought that Moses was speaking with God mouth to
          mouth, when God spoke and appeared to him, by means of a subordinate
          creature, i.e. an angel and a cloud. Again we may say that this vision
          "face to face" means some kind of sublime and familiar contemplation,
          inferior to the vision of the Divine Essence.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b>
          Respect of persons takes place in those things which are given
          according to due; but it has no place in those things which are
          bestowed gratuitously. Because he who, out of generosity, gives of his
          own to one and not to another, is not a respecter of persons: but if
          he were a dispenser of goods held in common, and were not to
          distribute them according to personal merits, he would be a respecter
          of persons. Now God bestows the benefits of salvation on the human
          race gratuitously: wherefore He is not a respecter of persons, if He
          gives them to some rather than to others. Hence Augustine says (De
          Praedest. Sanct. viii): "All whom God teaches, he teaches out of pity;
          but whom He teaches not, out of justice He teaches not": for this is
          due to the condemnation of the human race for the sin of the first

          et superbis, qui per legem compescuntur et domantur, imponitur etiam
          bonis, qui, per legem instructi, adiuvantur ad implendum quod
          intendunt. Conveniens igitur fuit tali tempore legem veterem dari, ad
          superbiam hominum convincendam. De duobus enim homo superbiebat,
          scilicet de scientia, et de potentia. De scientia quidem, quasi ratio
          naturalis ei posset sufficere ad salutem. Et ideo ut de hoc eius
          superbia convinceretur permissus est homo regimini suae rationis
          absque adminiculo legis scriptae, et experimento homo discere potuit
          quod patiebatur rationis defectum, per hoc quod homines usque ad
          idololatriam et turpissima vitia circa tempora Abrahae sunt prolapsi.
          Et ideo post haec tempora fuit necessarium legem scriptam dari in
          remedium humanae ignorantiae, quia per legem est cognitio peccati, ut
          dicitur Rom. III. Sed postquam homo est instructus per legem, convicta
          est eius superbia de infirmitate, dum implere non poterat quod
          cognoscebat. Et ideo, sicut apostolus concludit, ad Rom. VIII, quod
          impossibile erat legi, in qua infirmabatur per carnem, misit Deus
          filium suum, ut iustificatio legis impleretur in nobis.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It was most fitting for the Law to be
          given at the time of Moses. The reason for this may be taken from two
          things in respect of which every law is imposed on two kinds of men.
          Because it is imposed on some men who are hard-hearted and proud, whom
          the law restrains and tames: and it is imposed on good men, who,
          through being instructed by the law, are helped to fulfil what they
          desire to do. Hence it was fitting that the Law should be given at
          such a time as would be appropriate for the overcoming of man's pride.
          For man was proud of two things, viz. of knowledge and of power. He
          was proud of his knowledge, as though his natural reason could suffice
          him for salvation: and accordingly, in order that his pride might be
          overcome in this matter, man was left to the guidance of his reason
          without the help of a written law: and man was able to learn from
          experience that his reason was deficient, since about the time of
          Abraham man had fallen headlong into idolatry and the most shameful
          vices. Wherefore, after those times, it was necessary for a written
          law to be given as a remedy for human ignorance: because "by the Law
          is the knowledge of sin" (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++3%3A20"
            >Rm. 3:20</a
          >). But, after man had been instructed by the Law, his pride was
          convinced of his weakness, through his being unable to fulfil what he
          knew. Hence, as the Apostle concludes (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A3,4"
            >Rm. 8:3,4</a
          >), "what the Law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh,
          God sent [Vulg.: 'sending'] His own Son... that the justification of
          the Law might be fulfilled in us."<br />

          With regard to good men, the Law was given to them as a help; which
          was most needed by the people, at the time when the natural law began

          that this help should be bestowed on men in an orderly manner, so that
          they might be led from imperfection to perfection; wherefore it was

          to be given at once after the sin of the first man: both because man

          need of the Old Law; because as yet the dictate of the natural law was
          not darkened by habitual sinning.<br />

          household precepts: but when Abraham's descendants had multiplied, so
          as to form a people, and when they had been freed from slavery, it was
          fitting that they should be given a law; for "slaves are not that part
          of the people or state to which it is fitting for the law to be
          directed," as the Philosopher says (Polit. iii, 2,4,5).<br />
