          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod consentire pertineat solum ad
          partem animae apprehensivam. Augustinus enim, XII de Trin., consensum
          attribuit superiori rationi. Sed ratio nominat apprehensivam virtutem.
          Ergo consentire pertinet ad apprehensivam virtutem.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that consent belongs only to
          the apprehensive part of the soul. For Augustine (De Trin. xii, 12)
          ascribes consent to the higher reason. But the reason is an
          apprehensive power. Therefore consent belongs to an apprehensive
          power.<br />

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, consent is "co-sense." But
              sense is an apprehensive power. Therefore consent is the act of an

                  intellectum, qui est vis apprehensiva. Ergo et consentire ad

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as assent is an

                  assent belongs to the intellect, which is an apprehensive
                  power. Therefore consent also belongs to an apprehensive

                      that of which he judges, there is no sentence," i.e.
                      consent. But affection belongs to the appetitive power.
                      Therefore consent does also.<br />

                          applicationem sensus ad aliquid. Est autem proprium
                          sensus quod cognoscitivus est rerum praesentium, vis
                          enim imaginativa est apprehensiva similitudinum
                          corporalium, etiam rebus absentibus quarum sunt
                          similitudines; intellectus autem apprehensivus est
                          universalium rationum, quas potest apprehendere
                          indifferenter et praesentibus et absentibus
                          singularibus. Et quia actus appetitivae virtutis est

                          dicitur, sentite de domino in bonitate. Et secundum
                          hoc, consentire est actus appetitivae virtutis.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Consent implies
                          application of sense to something. Now it is proper to
                          sense to take cognizance of things present; for the
                          imagination apprehends the similitude of corporeal
                          things, even in the absence of the things of which
                          they bear the likeness; while the intellect apprehends
                          universal ideas, which it can apprehend indifferently,
                          whether the singulars be present or absent. And since
                          the act of an appetitive power is a kind of
                          inclination to the thing itself, the application of
                          the appetitive power to the thing, in so far as it
                          cleaves to it, gets by a kind of similitude, the name
                          of sense, since, as it were, it acquires direct
                          knowledge of the thing to which it cleaves, in so far
                          as it takes complacency in it. Hence it is written
                          (Wis. 1:1): "Think of [Sentite] the Lord in goodness."
                          And on these grounds consent is an act of the
                          appetitive power.<br />

                              Augustinus attribuit consensum rationi, accipit
                              rationem secundum quod in ea includitur voluntas.

                                      "Assentire" [to assent] is, to speak, "ad
                                      aliud sentire" [to feel towards
                                      something]; and thus it implies a certain
                                      distance from that to which assent is
                                      given. But "consentire" [to consent] is
                                      "to feel with," and this implies a certain
                                      union to the object of consent. Hence the
                                      will, to which it belongs to tend to the
                                      thing itself, is more properly said to
                                      consent: whereas the intellect, whose act
                                      does not consist in a movement towards the
                                      thing, but rather the reverse, as we have
                                      stated in the FP, Question [16], Article
                                      [1]; FP, Question [27], Article [4]; FP,
                                      Question [59], Article [2], is more
                                      properly said to assent: although one word
                                      is wont to be used for the other [*In
                                      Latin rather than in English.]. We may
                                      also say that the intellect assents, in so
                                      far as it is moved by the will.<br />

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Consent, properly
                          speaking, is not in irrational animals. The reason of
                          this is that consent implies an application of the
                          appetitive movement to something as to be done. Now to
                          apply the appetitive movement to the doing of
                          something, belongs to the subject in whose power it is
                          to move the appetite: thus to touch a stone is an
                          action suitable to a stick, but to apply the stick so
                          that it touch the stone, belongs to one who has the
                          power of moving the stick. But irrational animals have
                          not the command of the appetitive movement; for this
                          is in them through natural instinct. Hence in the
                          irrational animal, there is indeed the movement of the
                          appetite, but it does not apply that movement to some
                          particular thing. And hence it is that the irrational
                          animal is not properly said to consent: this is proper
                          to the rational nature, which has the command of the
                          appetitive movement, and is able to apply or not to
                          apply it to this or that thing.<br />

                                  follow from several things, it is not removed
                                  by the fact that one of them is removed; thus

                      amat quod ex consilio iudicatum est. Sed consilium non est
                      nisi de his quae sunt ad finem. Ergo nec consensus.

                      <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Damascene says (De Fide
                      Orth. ii, 22) that the "sentence," i.e. the consent, takes
                      place "when a man approves and embraces the judgment of
                      his counsel." But counsel is only about the means.

                          simplicis voluntatis. De his autem quae sunt post

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Consent is the
                          application of the appetitive movement to something
                          that is already in the power of him who causes the
                          application. Now the order of action is this: First
                          there is the apprehension of the end; then the desire
                          of the end; then the counsel about the means; then the
                          desire of the means. Now the appetite tends to the
                          last end naturally: wherefore the application of the
                          appetitive movement to the apprehended end has not the
                          nature of consent, but of simple volition. But as to
                          those things which come under consideration after the
                          last end, in so far as they are directed to the end,
                          they come under counsel: and so counsel can be applied
                          to them, in so far as the appetitive movement is
                          applied to the judgment resulting from counsel. But
                          the appetitive movement to the end is not applied to
                          counsel: rather is counsel applied to it, because
                          counsel presupposes the desire of the end. On the
                          other hand, the desire of the means presupposes the
                          decision of counsel. And therefore the application of
                          the appetitive movement to counsel's decision is
                          consent, properly speaking. Consequently, since
                          counsel is only about the means, consent, properly
                          speaking, is of nothing else but the means.<br />

                          iudicamus; de his vero quae ad rationes humanas
                          pertinent, iudicamus secundum rationes divinas, quae
                          pertinent ad rationem superiorem. Et ideo quandiu
                          incertum est an secundum rationes divinas resistatur
                          vel non, nullum iudicium rationis habet rationem
                          finalis sententiae. Finalis autem sententia de agendis
                          est consensus in actum. Et ideo consensus in actum
                          pertinet ad rationem superiorem, secundum tamen quod
                          in ratione voluntas includitur, sicut supra dictum
                          est.

                          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The final decision
                          belongs to him who holds the highest place, and to
                          whom it belongs to judge of the others; for as long as
                          judgment about some matter remains to be pronounced,
                          the final decision has not been given. Now it is
                          evident that it belongs to the higher reason to judge
                          of all: since it is by the reason that we judge of
                          sensible things; and of things pertaining to human
                          principles we judge according to Divine principles,
                          which is the function of the higher reason. Wherefore
                          as long as a man is uncertain whether he resists or
                          not, according to Divine principles, no judgment of
                          the reason can be considered in the light of a final
                          decision. Now the final decision of what is to be done
                          is consent to the act. Therefore consent to the act
                          belongs to the higher reason; but in that sense in
                          which the reason includes the will, as stated above

                              <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Consent to
                              delight in the work done belongs to the higher
                              reason, as also does consent to the work; but
                              consent to delight in thought belongs to the lower
                              reason, just as to the lower reason it belongs to
                              think. Nevertheless the higher reason exercises
                              judgment on the fact of thinking or not thinking,
                              considered as an action; and in like manner on the
                              delight that results. But in so far as the act of
                              thinking is considered as ordained to a further
                              act, it belongs to the lower reason. For that
                              which is ordained to something else, belongs to a
                              lower art or power than does the end to which it
                              is ordained: hence the art which is concerned with
                              the end is called the master or principal art.<br />
