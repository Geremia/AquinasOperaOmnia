    Whether there was any cause for the ceremonial precepts?

          Ad primum sic proceditur. Videtur quod caeremonialia praecepta non
          habeant causam. Quia super illud Ephes. II, legem mandatorum decretis
          evacuans, dicit Glossa, idest, evacuans legem veterem quantum ad
          carnales observantias, decretis, idest praeceptis evangelicis, quae ex
          ratione sunt. Sed si observantiae veteris legis ex ratione erant,
          frustra evacuarentur per rationabilia decreta novae legis. Non ergo
          caeremoniales observantiae veteris legis habebant aliquam rationem.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b>Objection 1:</b> It would seem that there was no cause for the
          ceremonial precepts. Because on
          <a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph.+2:15,"
            >Eph. 2:15,</a
          >
          "Making void the law of the commandments," the gloss says, (i.e.)
          "making void the Old Law as to the carnal observances, by substituting
          decrees, i.e. evangelical precepts, which are based on reason." But if
          the observances of the Old Law were based on reason, it would have
          been useless to void them by the reasonable decrees of the New Law.
          Therefore there was no reason for the ceremonial observances of the
          Old Law.
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, vetus lex successit legi naturae. Sed in lege naturae
              fuit aliquod praeceptum quod nullam rationem habebat nisi ut
              hominis obedientia probaretur; sicut Augustinus dicit, VIII super
              Gen. ad Litt., de prohibitione ligni vitae. Ergo etiam in veteri
              lege aliqua praecepta danda erant in quibus hominis obedientia
              probaretur, quae de se nullam rationem haberent

              <b>Objection 2:</b> Further, the Old Law succeeded the law of
              nature. But in the law of nature there was a precept for which
              there was no reason save that man's obedience might be tested; as
              Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 6,13), concerning the
              prohibition about the tree of life. Therefore in the Old Law there
              should have been some precepts for the purpose of testing man's
              obedience, having no reason in themselves.

                  Praeterea, opera hominis dicuntur moralia secundum quod sunt a
                  ratione. Si igitur caeremonialium praeceptorum sit aliqua
                  ratio, non different a moralibus praeceptis. Videtur ergo quod
                  caeremonialia praecepta non habeant aliquam causam, ratio enim
                  praecepti ex aliqua causa sumitur

                  <b>Objection 3:</b> Further, man's works are called moral
                  according as they proceed from reason. If therefore there is
                  any reason for the ceremonial precepts, they would not differ
                  from the moral precepts. It seems therefore that there was no
                  cause for the ceremonial precepts: for the reason of a precept
                  is taken from some cause.

                      praecepta Dei. Ergo sunt lucida. Quod non esset nisi

                        >Ps. 18:9</a

                      enlightening the eyes." But the ceremonial precepts are
                      commandments of God. Therefore they are lightsome: and yet
                      they would not be so, if they had no reasonable cause.
                      Therefore the ceremonial precepts have a reasonable cause.

                          Respondeo dicendum quod, cum sapientis sit ordinare,
                          secundum philosophum, in I Metaphys., ea quae ex
                          divina sapientia procedunt, oportet esse ordinata, ut
                          apostolus dicit, ad Rom. XIII. Ad hoc autem quod
                          aliqua sint ordinata, duo requiruntur. Primo quidem,
                          quod aliqua ordinentur ad debitum finem, qui est
                          principium totius ordinis in rebus agendis, ea enim
                          quae casu eveniunt praeter intentionem finis, vel quae
                          non serio fiunt sed ludo, dicimus esse inordinata.
                          Secundo oportet quod id quod est ad finem, sit
                          proportionatum fini. Et ex hoc sequitur quod ratio
                          eorum quae sunt ad finem, sumitur ex fine, sicut ratio
                          dispositionis serrae sumitur ex sectione, quae est
                          finis eius, ut dicitur in II Physic. Manifestum est
                          autem quod praecepta caeremonialia, sicut et omnia
                          alia praecepta legis, sunt ex divina sapientia
                          instituta, unde dicitur Deut. IV, haec est sapientia
                          vestra et intellectus coram populis. Unde necesse est
                          dicere quod praecepta caeremonialia sint ordinata ad
                          aliquem finem, ex quo eorum rationabiles causae
                          assignari possunt.

                          <b>I answer that,</b> Since, according to the
                          Philosopher (Metaph. i, 2), it is the function of a
                          "wise man to do everything in order," those things
                          which proceed from the Divine wisdom must needs be
                          well ordered, as the Apostle states (<a

                          sight of nations." Consequently we must needs say that
                          the ceremonial precepts were ordained to a certain
                          end, wherefrom their reasonable causes can be

                                      cause in their relation to something else,
                                      as stated above.

    Whether the ceremonial precepts have a literal cause or merely a figurative

          Ad secundum sic proceditur. Videtur quod praecepta caeremonialia non
          habeant causam litteralem, sed figuralem tantum. Inter praecepta enim
          caeremonialia praecipua erant circumcisio, et immolatio agni
          paschalis. Sed utrumque istorum non habebat nisi causam figuralem,
          quia utrumque istorum datum est in signum. Dicitur enim Gen. XVII,
          circumcidetis carnem praeputii vestri, ut sit in signum foederis inter
          me et vos. Et de celebratione phase dicitur Exod. XIII, erit quasi
          signum in manu tua, et quasi monumentum ante oculos tuos. Ergo multo
          magis alia caeremonialia non habent nisi causam figuralem.

          <b>Objection 1:</b> It would seem that the ceremonial precepts have
          not a literal, but merely a figurative cause. For among the ceremonial
          precepts, the chief was circumcision and the sacrifice of the paschal
          lamb. But neither of these had any but a figurative cause: because
          each was given as a sign. For it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex.+13:9"
            >Ex. 13:9</a
          >): "It shall be as a sign in thy hand, and as a memorial before thy
          eyes." Therefore much more did the other ceremonial precepts have none
          but a figurative reason.

                  particular way or not, it seems that it has not a literal
                  cause. Now there are certain points in the ceremonial
                  precepts, which appear to be a matter of indifference, as to
                  whether they be done in one way or in another: for instance,
                  the number of animals to be offered, and other such particular
                  circumstances. Therefore there is no literal cause for the
                  precepts of the Old Law.

                      Now in the stories of the Old Testament, besides the
                      mystical or figurative, there is the literal sense.
                      Therefore the ceremonial precepts had also literal,
                      besides their figurative causes.

                          Finis autem praeceptorum caeremonialium est duplex,
                          ordinabatur enim ad cultum Dei pro tempore illo, et ad
                          figurandum Christum; sicut etiam verba prophetarum sic

                          veteris legis dupliciter accipi possunt. Uno modo, ex

                          rememoranda aliqua Dei beneficia; sive ad insinuandam

                          Christum. Et sic habent rationes figurales et
                          mysticas, sive accipiantur ex ipso Christo et
                          Ecclesia, quod pertinet ad allegoriam; sive ad mores
                          populi Christiani, quod pertinet ad moralitatem; sive
                          ad statum futurae gloriae, prout in eam introducimur
                          per Christum, quod pertinet ad anagogiam.

                          Accordingly the reasons for the ceremonial precepts of
                          the Old Law can be taken in two ways. First, in
                          respect of the Divine worship which was to be observed
                          for that particular time: and these reasons are
                          literal: whether they refer to the shunning of
                          idolatry; or recall certain Divine benefits; or remind
                          men of the Divine excellence; or point out the
                          disposition of mind which was then required in those
                          who worshipped God. Secondly, their reasons can be
                          gathered from the point of view of their being
                          ordained to foreshadow Christ: and thus their reasons
                          are figurative and mystical: whether they be taken
                          from Christ Himself and the Church, which pertains to
                          the allegorical sense; or to the morals of the
                          Christian people, which pertains to the moral sense;
                          or to the state of future glory, in as much as we are
                          brought thereto by Christ, which refers to the
                          anagogical sense.

                              Ad primum ergo dicendum quod, sicut intellectus

                              the literal sense, because the words are employed
                              in order to convey that particular meaning; so
                              also the meaning of those legal ceremonies which
                              commemorated certain Divine benefits, on account
                              of which they were instituted, and of others
                              similar which belonged to that time, does not go
                              beyond the order of literal causes. Consequently

                              of the Passover was its signification of the
                              delivery from Egypt, or that circumcision was a
                              sign of God's covenant with Abraham, we assign the

          Ad tertium sic proceditur. Videtur quod non possit conveniens ratio
          assignari caeremoniarum quae ad sacrificia pertinent. Ea enim quae in
          sacrificium offerebantur, sunt illa quae sunt necessaria ad
          sustentandam humanam vitam, sicut animalia quaedam, et panes quidam.
          Sed tali sustentamento Deus non indiget; secundum illud Psalmi XLIX,
          numquid manducabo carnes taurorum, aut sanguinem hircorum potabo? Ergo
          inconvenienter huiusmodi sacrificia Deo offerebantur.

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no suitable cause can be
          assigned for the ceremonies pertaining to sacrifices. For those things
          which were offered in sacrifice, are those which are necessary for
          sustaining human life: such as certain animals and certain loaves. But
          God needs no such sustenance; according to Ps. 49:13: "Shall I eat the
          flesh of bullocks? Or shall I drink the blood of goats?" Therefore
          such sacrifices were unfittingly offered to God.<br />

              Praeterea, in sacrificium divinum non offerebantur nisi de tribus
              generibus animalium quadrupedum, scilicet de genere bovum, ovium
              et caprarum; et de avibus, communiter quidem turtur et columba;
              specialiter autem in emundatione leprosi fiebat sacrificium de
              passeribus. Multa autem alia animalia sunt eis nobiliora. Cum
              igitur omne quod est optimum Deo sit exhibendum, videtur quod non
              solum de istis rebus fuerint Deo sacrificia offerenda.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, only three kinds of quadrupeds
              were offered in sacrifice to God, viz. oxen, sheep and goats; of
              birds, generally the turtledove and the dove; but specially, in
              the cleansing of a leper, an offering was made of sparrows. Now
              many other animals are more noble than these. Since therefore
              whatever is best should be offered to God, it seems that not only
              of these three should sacrifices have been offered to Him.<br />

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no sufficient reason can
          be assigned for the ceremonies of the Old Law that pertain to holy
          things. For Paul said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+17%3A24"
            >Acts 17:24</a
          >): "God Who made the world and all things therein; He being Lord of
          heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made by hands." It was
          therefore unfitting that in the Old Law a tabernacle or temple should
          be set up for the worship of God.<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, status veteris legis non fuit immutatus nisi per
              Christum. Sed tabernaculum designabat statum veteris legis. Non
              ergo debuit mutari per aedificationem alicuius templi.
            </td>
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the state of the Old Law was
              not changed except by Christ. But the tabernacle denoted the state
              of the Old Law. Therefore it should not have been changed by the
              building of a temple.<br />
              <tr valign="top">
                <td style="text-align: justify">
                  Praeterea, divina lex praecipue etiam debet homines inducere
                  ad divinum cultum. Sed ad augmentum divini cultus pertinet
                  quod fiant multa altaria et multa templa, sicut patet in nova
                  lege. Ergo videtur quod etiam in veteri lege non debuit esse
                  solum unum templum aut unum tabernaculum sed multa.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Divine Law, more than
                  any other indeed, should lead man to the worship of God. But
                  an increase of divine worship requires multiplication of
                  altars and temples; as is evident in regard to the New Law.
                  Therefore it seems that also under the Old Law there should
                  have been not only one tabernacle or temple, but many.<br />

                      should worship above all His unity and simplicity.
                      Therefore it seems unbecoming for the tabernacle or temple
                      to be divided by means of veils.<br />

                                                      which are distinct from

          Ad quintum sic proceditur. Videtur quod sacramentorum veteris legis

          cultores idolorum in eorum cultu se incidebant usque ad effusionem
          sanguinis, dicitur enim III Reg. XVIII, quod incidebant se, iuxta
          ritum suum, cultris et lanceolis, donec perfunderentur sanguine.
          Propter quod dominus mandavit, Deut. XIV, non vos incidetis, nec

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there can be no suitable
          cause for the sacraments of the Old Law. Because those things that are
          done for the purpose of divine worship should not be like the
          observances of idolaters: since it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++12%3A31"
            >Dt. 12:31</a
          >): "Thou shalt not do in like manner to the Lord thy God: for they
          have done to their gods all the abominations which the Lord
          abhorreth." Now worshippers of idols used to knive themselves to the
          shedding of blood: for it is related (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Kgs++18%3A28"
            >3 Kgs. 18:28</a
          >) that they "cut themselves after their manner with knives and
          lancets, till they were all covered with blood." For this reason the
          Lord commanded (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++14%3A1"
            >Dt. 14:1</a
          >): "You shall not cut yourselves nor make any baldness for the dead."
          Therefore it was unfitting for circumcision to be prescribed by the
          Law (Lev. 12:3).<br />

              Praeterea, ea quae in cultum divinum fiunt, debent honestatem et
              gravitatem habere; secundum illud Psalmi XXXIV, in populo gravi
              laudabo te. Sed ad levitatem quandam pertinere videtur ut homines
              festinanter comedant. Inconvenienter igitur praeceptum est, Exod.
              XII, ut comederent festinanter agnum paschalem. Et alia etiam
              circa eius comestionem sunt instituta, quae videntur omnino
              irrationabilia esse.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those things which are done
              for the worship of God should be marked with decorum and gravity;
              according to Ps. 34:18: "I will praise Thee in a grave [Douay:
              'strong'] people." But it seems to savor of levity for a man to
              eat with haste. Therefore it was unfittingly commanded (<a
                href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ex++12%3A11"
                >Ex. 12:11</a
              >) that they should eat the Paschal lamb "in haste." Other things
              too relative to the eating of the lamb were prescribed, which seem
              altogether unreasonable.<br />

                  Cor. V, Pascha nostrum immolatus est Christus. Ergo etiam
                  debuerunt esse aliqua sacramenta in lege quae praefigurarent
                  alia sacramenta novae legis, sicut confirmationem et extremam
                  unctionem et matrimonium, et alia sacramenta.

                  <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the Old

                  according to 1 Cor. 5:7: "Christ our Pasch is sacrificed."
                  Therefore there should also have been some sacraments of the

                      as far as God is concerned, no bodily thing is reputed
                      impure, because all bodies are God's creatures; and "every

                                                          this institution was
                                                          brought about—for all
                                                          in general, by
                                                          circumcision, without
                                                          which no one was

                                                          The second thing
                                                          required was the use
                                                          of those things that

          Ad sextum sic proceditur. Videtur quod observantiarum caeremonialium
          nulla fuerit rationabilis causa. Quia ut apostolus dicit, I ad Tim.
          IV, omnis creatura Dei est bona, et nihil reiiciendum quod cum

          <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there was no reasonable
          cause for the ceremonial observances. Because, as the Apostle says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++4%3A4"
            >1 Tim. 4:4</a
          >), "every creature of God is good, and nothing to be rejected that is
          received with thanksgiving." It was therefore unfitting that they
          should be forbidden to eat certain foods, as being unclean according
          to Lev. 11 [*Cf. Dt. 14].<br />
          <tr valign="top">
            <td style="text-align: justify">
              Praeterea, sicut animalia dantur in cibum hominis, ita etiam et
              herbae, unde dicitur Gen. IX, quasi olera virentia dedi vobis
              omnem carnem. Sed in herbis lex non distinxit aliquas immundas,
              cum tamen aliquae illarum sint maxime nocivae, ut puta venenosae.
              Ergo videtur quod nec de animalibus aliqua debuerint prohiberi
              tanquam immunda.

              <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as animals are given to
              man for food, so also are herbs: wherefore it is written (<a

                >Gn. 9:3</a
              >): "As the green herbs have I delivered all" flesh "to you." But
              the Law did not distinguish any herbs from the rest as being
              unclean, although some are most harmful, for instance, those that
              are poisonous. Therefore it seems that neither should any animals
              have been prohibited as being unclean.<br />

                  immundum. Sed ex sanguine generatur caro. Cum igitur non omnes
                  carnes prohiberentur tanquam immundae, pari ratione nec

                  thing generated therefrom is unclean. But flesh is generated
                  from blood. Since therefore all flesh was not prohibited as
                  unclean, it seems that in like manner neither should blood
                  have been forbidden as unclean; nor the fat which is

                      since after death they "have no more that they can do":
                      which would not be true if after death harm might come to

                                                  assist at the burial of one's
                                                  friends: wherefore Tobias is
                                                  commended for so doing (Tob.
                                                  1:20, seqq.). In like manner
                                                  it is sometimes an act of
                                                  piety to marry a loose woman,
                                                  because she is thereby
                                                  delivered from sin and infamy.
                                                  Therefore it seems
                                                  inconsistent for these things
                                                  to be forbidden to priests
                                                  (Lev. 21).<br />
