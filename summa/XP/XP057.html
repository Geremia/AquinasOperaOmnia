<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider legal relationship which is by adoption. Under this 
head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP057.html#XPQ57A1THEP1">(1)</a> What is adoption?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP057.html#XPQ57A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether one contracts through it a tie that is an impediment to 
marriage?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP057.html#XPQ57A3THEP1">(3)</a> Between which persons is this tie contracted.

<H3 Align="Left">Whether adoption is rightly defined?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that adoption is not rightly defined: "Adoption is 
the act by which a person lawfully takes for his child or grandchild and 
so on one who does not belong to him." For the child should be subject to 
its father. Now, sometimes the person adopted does not come under the 
power of the adopter. Therefore adoption is not always the taking of 
someone as a child.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Parents should lay up for their children" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=2+Cor++12%3A14">2 Cor. 12:14</a>). But the adoptive father does not always necessarily lay up for 
his adopted child, since sometimes the adopted does not  inherit the 
goods of the adopter. Therefore adoption is not the taking of someone as 
a child.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, adoption, whereby someone is taken as a child, is 
likened to natural procreation whereby a child is begotten naturally. 
Therefore whoever is competent to beget a child naturally is competent to 
adopt. But this is untrue, since neither one who is not his own master, 
nor one who is not twenty-five years of age, nor a woman can adopt, and 
yet they can beget a child naturally. Therefore, properly speaking, 
adoption is not the taking of someone as a child.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, to take as one's child one who is not one's own seems 
necessary in order to supply the lack of children begotten naturally. Now 
one who is unable to beget, through being a eunuch or impotent, suffers 
especially from the absence of children of his own begetting. Therefore 
he is especially competent to adopt someone as his child. But he is not 
competent to adopt. Therefore adoption is not the taking of someone as 
one's child.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, in spiritual relationship, where someone is taken as a 
child without carnal procreation, it is of no consequence whether an 
older person become the father of a younger, or "vice versa," since a 
youth can baptize an old man and "vice versa." Therefore, if by adoption 
a person is taken as a child without being carnally begotten, it would 
make no difference whether an older person adopted a younger, or a 
younger an older person; which is not true. Therefore the same conclusion 
follows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, there is no difference of degree between adopted and 
adopter. Therefore whoever is adopted, is adopted as a child; and 
consequently it is not right to say that one may be adopted as a 
grandchild.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, adoption is a result of love, wherefore God is said to 
have adopted us as children through charity. Now we should have greater 
charity towards those who are connected with us than towards strangers. 
Therefore adoption should be not of a stranger but of someone connected 
with us.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Art imitates nature and supplies the defect of nature 
where nature is deficient. Hence just as a man begets by natural 
procreation, so by positive law which is the art of what is good and 
just, one person can take to himself another as a child in likeness to 
one that is his child by nature, in order to take the place of the 
children he has lost, this being the chief reason why adoption was 
introduced. And since taking implies a term "wherefrom," for which reason 
the taker is not the thing taken, it follows that the person taken as a 
child must be a stranger. Accordingly, just as natural procreation has a 
term "whereto," namely the form which is the end of generation, and a 
term "wherefrom," namely the contrary form, so legal generation has a 
term "whereto," namely a child or grandchild, and a term "wherefrom," 
namely, a stranger. Consequently the above definition  includes the genus 
of adoption, for it is described as a "lawful taking," and the term 
"wherefrom," since it is said to be the taking of "a stranger," and the 
term "whereto," because it says, "as a child or grandchild ."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The sonship of adoption is an imitation of natural sonship. 
Wherefore there are two species of adoption, one which imitates natural 
sonship perfectly, and this is called "arrogatio," whereby the person 
adopted is placed under the power of the adopter; and one who is thus 
adopted inherits from his adopted father if the latter die intestate, nor 
can his father legally deprive him of a fourth part of his inheritance. 
But no one can adopt in this way except one who is his own master, one 
namely who has no father or, if he has, is of age. There can be no 
adoption of this kind without the authority of the sovereign. The other 
kind of adoption imitates natural sonship imperfectly, and is called 
"simple adoption," and by this the adopted does not come under the power 
of the adopter: so that it is a disposition to perfect adoption, rather 
than perfect adoption itself. In this way even one who is not his own 
master can adopt, without the consent of the sovereign and with the 
authority of a magistrate: and one who is thus adopted does not inherit 
the estate of the adopter, nor is the latter bound to bequeath to him any 
of his goods in his will, unless he will.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Natural procreation is directed to the production of the 
species; wherefore anyone in whom the specific nature is not hindered is 
competent to be able to beget naturally. But adoption is directed to 
hereditary succession, wherefore those alone are competent to adopt who 
have the power to dispose of their estate. Consequently one who is not 
his own master, or who is less than twenty-five years of age, or a woman, 
cannot adopt anyone, except by special permission of the sovereign.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> An inheritance cannot pass to posterity through one who has 
a perpetual impediment from begetting: hence for this very reason it 
ought to pass to those who ought to succeed to him by right of 
relationship; and consequently he cannot adopt, as neither can he beget. 
Moreover greater is sorrow for children lost than for children one has 
never had. Wherefore those who are impeded from begetting need no solace 
for their lack of children as those who have had and have lost them, or 
could have had them but have them not by reason of some accidental 
impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Spiritual relationship is contracted through a sacrament 
whereby the faithful are born again in Christ, in Whom there is no 
difference between male and female, bondman and free, youth and old age 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Gal++3%3A28;+Col++3:11">Gal. 3:28; Col. 3:11</a>). Wherefore anyone can indifferently become 
another's godfather. But adoption aims at hereditary succession and a 
certain subjection of the adopted to the adopter: and it is not fitting 
that older persons should be subjected to younger in the care of the 
household. Consequently a  younger person cannot adopt an older; but 
according to law the adopted person must be so much younger than the 
adopter, that he might have been the child of his natural begetting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> One may lose one's grandchildren and so forth even as one 
may lose one's children. Wherefore since adoption was introduced as a 
solace for children lost, just as someone may be adopted in place of a 
child, so may someone be adopted in place of a grandchild and so on.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[1] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> A relative ought to succeed by right of relationship; and 
therefore such a person is not competent to be chosen to succeed by 
adoption. And if a relative, who is not competent to inherit the estate, 
be adopted, he is adopted not as a relative, but as a stranger lacking 
the right of succeeding to the adopter's goods.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a tie that is an impediment to marriage is contracted through adoption?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not contracted through adoption a tie 
that is an impediment to marriage. For spiritual care is more excellent 
than corporeal care. But no tie of relationship is contracted through 
one's being subjected to another's spiritual care: else all those who 
dwell in the parish would be related to the parish priest and would be 
unable to marry his son. Neither therefore can this result from adoption 
which places the adopted under the care of the adopter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no tie of relationship results from persons conferring a 
benefit on another. But adoption is nothing but the conferring of a 
benefit. Therefore no tie of relationship results from adoption.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a natural father provides for his child chiefly in three 
things, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. viii, 11,12), namely by giving 
him being, nourishment and education; and hereditary succession is 
subsequent to these. Now no tie of relationship is contracted by one's 
providing for a person's nourishment and education, else a person would 
be related to his nourishers, tutors and masters, which is false. 
Therefore neither is any relationship contracted through adoption by 
which one inherits another's estate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the Church are not subject to human 
laws. Now marriage is a sacrament of the Church. Since then adoption was 
introduced by human law, it would seem that a tie contracted from 
adoption cannot be an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Relationship is an impediment to marriage. Now a kind 
of relationship results from adoption, namely legal relationship, as 
evidenced by its definition, for "legal relationship is a connection 
arising out of adoption." Therefore  adoption results in a tie which is 
an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the same is proved by the authorities quoted in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 42).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Divine law especially forbids marriage between those 
persons who have to live together lest, as Rabbi Moses observes (Doc. 
Perp. iii, 49), if it were lawful for them to have carnal intercourse, 
there should be more room for concupiscence to the repression of which 
marriage is directed. And since the adopted child dwells in the house of 
his adopted father like one that is begotten naturally human laws forbid 
the contracting of marriage between the like, and this prohibition is 
approved by the Church. Hence it is that legal adoption is an impediment 
to marriage. This suffices for the Replies to the first three Objections, 
because none of those things entails such a cohabitation as might be an 
incentive to concupiscence. Therefore they do not cause a relationship 
that is an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The prohibition of a human law would not suffice to make an 
impediment to marriage, unless the authority of the Church intervenes by 
issuing the same prohibition.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether legal relationship is contracted only between the adopting father and the adopted child?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a relationship of this kind is contracted only 
between the adopting father and the adopted child. For it would seem that 
it ought above all to be contracted between the adopting father and the 
natural mother of the adopted, as happens in spiritual relationship. Yet 
there is no legal relationship between them. Therefore it is not 
contracted between any other persons besides the adopter and adopted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the relationship that impedes marriage is a perpetual 
impediment. But there is not a perpetual impediment between the adopted 
son and the naturally begotten daughter of the adopted; because when the 
adoption terminates at the death of the adopter, or when the adopted 
comes of age, the latter can marry her. Therefore he was not related to 
her in such a way as to prevent him from marrying her.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, spiritual relationship passes to no person incapable of 
being a god-parent; wherefore it does not pass to one who is not 
baptized. Now a woman cannot adopt, as stated above (<A Href="XP057.html#XPQ57A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 2). 
Therefore legal relationship does not pass from husband to wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, spiritual relationship is stronger than legal. But 
spiritual relationship does not pass to a grandchild. Neither, therefore, 
does legal relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Legal relationship is more in agreement with  carnal 
union or procreation than spiritual relationship is. But spiritual 
relationship passes to another person. Therefore legal relationship does 
so also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the same is proved by the authorities quoted in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 42).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Legal relationship is of three kinds. The first is in the 
descending order as it were, and is contracted between the adoptive 
father and the adopted child, the latter's child grandchild and so on; 
the second is between the adopted child and the naturally begotten child; 
the third is like a kind of affinity, and is between the adoptive father 
and the wife of the adopted son, or contrariwise between the adopted son 
and the wife of the adoptive father. Accordingly the first and third 
relationships are perpetual impediments to marriage: but the second is 
not, but only so long as the adopted person remains under the power of 
the adoptive father, wherefore when the father dies or when the child 
comes of age, they can be married.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By spiritual generation the son is not withdrawn from the 
father's power, as in the case of adoption, so that the godson remains 
the son of both at the same time, whereas the adopted son does not. Hence 
no relationship is contracted between the adoptive father and the natural 
mother or father, as was the case in spiritual relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Legal relationship is an impediment to marriage on account 
of the parties dwelling together: hence when the need for dwelling 
together ceases, it is not unreasonable that the aforesaid tie cease, for 
instance when he ceases to be under the power of the same father. But the 
adoptive father and his wife always retain a certain authority over their 
adopted son and his wife, wherefore the tie between them remains.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even a woman can adopt by permission of the sovereign, 
wherefore legal relationship passes also to her. Moreover the reason why 
spiritual relationship does not pass to a non-baptized person is not 
because such a person cannot be a god-parent but because he is not a fit 
subject of spirituality.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[57] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> By spiritual relationship the son is not placed under the 
power and care of the godfather, as in legal relationship: because it is 
necessary that whatever is in the son's power pass under the power of the 
adoptive father. Wherefore if a father be adopted the children and 
grandchildren who are in the power of the person adopted are adopted also.<br>
