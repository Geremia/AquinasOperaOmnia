<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the plurality of wives. Under this head there are 
five points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is against the natural law to have several wives?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this was ever lawful?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is against the natural law to have a concubine?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether it is a mortal sin to have intercourse with a concubine?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not against the natural law to have 
several wives. For custom does not prejudice the law of nature. But "it 
was not a sin" to have several wives "when this was the custom," 
according to Augustine (De Bono Conjug. xv) as quoted in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 33). Therefore it is not contrary to the natural law to have 
several wives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever acts in opposition to the natural law, disobeys 
a commandment, for the law of nature has its commandments even as the 
written law has. Now Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xv; De Civ. Dei xv, 
38) that "it was not contrary to a commandment" to have several wives, 
"because by no law was it forbidden." Therefore it is not against the 
natural law to have several wives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, marriage is chiefly directed to the begetting of 
offspring. But one man may get children of several women, by causing them 
to be pregnant. Therefore It is not against the natural law to have 
several wives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, "Natural right is that which nature has taught all 
animals," as stated at the beginning of the Digests (1, i, ff. De just. 
et jure). Now nature has not taught all animals that one male should be 
united to but one female, since with many animals the one male is united 
to several females. Therefore it is not against the natural law to have 
several wives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (De Gener. Animal. i, 20), 
in the begetting of offspring the male is to the female as agent to 
patient, and as the craftsman is to his material. But it is not against 
the order of nature for one agent to act on several patients, or for one 
craftsman to work in several materials. Therefore neither is it contrary 
to the law of nature for one husband to have many wives.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> On the contrary, That which was instilled into man at the 
formation of human nature would seem especially to belong to the natural 
law. Now it was instilled into him at the very formation of human nature 
that one man should have one wife, according to Gn. 2:24, "They shall be 
two in one flesh." Therefore it is of natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, it is contrary to the law of nature that man should bind 
himself to the impossible, and that what is given to one should be given 
to another. Now when a man contracts with a wife, he gives her the power 
of his body, so that he is bound to pay her the debt when she asks. 
Therefore it is against the law of nature that he should afterwards give 
the power of his body to another, because it would be impossible for him 
to pay both were both to ask at the same time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, "Do not to another what thou wouldst not were done to 
thyself" [*Cf. Tobias 4:16] is a precept of the natural law. But a 
husband would by no means be willing for his wife to have another 
husband. Therefore he would be acting against the law of nature, were he 
to have another wife in addition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Obj. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, whatever is against the natural desire is contrary to 
the natural law. Now a husband's jealousy of his wife and the wife's 
jealousy of her husband are natural, for they are found in all. 
Therefore, since jealousy is "love impatient of sharing the beloved," it 
would seem to be contrary to the natural  law that several wives should 
share one husband.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> All natural things are imbued with certain principles 
whereby they are enabled not only to exercise their proper actions, but 
also to render those actions proportionate to their end, whether such 
actions belong to a thing by virtue of its generic nature, or by virtue 
of its specific nature: thus it belongs to a magnet to be borne downwards 
by virtue of its generic nature, and to attract iron by virtue of its 
specific nature. Now just as in those things which act from natural 
necessity the principle of action is the form itself, whence their proper 
actions proceed proportionately to their end, so in things which are 
endowed with knowledge the principles of action are knowledge and 
appetite. Hence in the cognitive power there needs to be a natural 
concept, and in the appetitive power a natural inclination, whereby the 
action befitting the genus or species is rendered proportionate to the 
end. Now since man, of all animals, knows the aspect of the end, and the 
proportion of the action to the end, it follows that he is imbued with a 
natural concept, whereby he is directed to act in a befitting manner, and 
this is called "the natural law" or "the natural right," but in other 
animals "the natural instinct." For brutes are rather impelled by the 
force of nature to do befitting actions, than guided to act on their own 
judgment. Therefore the natural law is nothing else than a concept 
naturally instilled into man, whereby he is guided to act in a befitting 
manner in his proper actions, whether they are competent to him by virtue 
of his generic nature, as, for instance, to beget, to eat, and so on, or 
belong to him by virtue of his specific nature, as, for instance, to 
reason and so forth. Now whatever renders an action improportionate to 
the end which nature intends to obtain by a certain work is said to be 
contrary to the natural law. But an action may be improportionate either 
to the principal or to the secondary end, and in either case this happens 
in two ways. First, on account of something which wholly hinders the end; 
for instance a very great excess or a very great deficiency in eating 
hinders both the health of the body, which is the principal end of food, 
and aptitude for conducting business, which is its secondary end. 
Secondly, on account of something that renders the attainment of the 
principal or secondary end difficult, or less satisfactory, for instance 
eating inordinately in respect of undue time. Accordingly if an action be 
improportionate to the end, through altogether hindering the principal 
end directly, it is forbidden by the first precepts of the natural law, 
which hold the same place in practical matters, as the general concepts 
of the mind in speculative matters. If, however, it be in any way 
improportionate to the secondary end, or again to the principal end, as 
rendering its attainment difficult or less satisfactory, it is forbidden, 
not indeed by the first precepts of the natural law, but by the second 
which are derived from the first even as conclusions in speculative 
matters receive our assent by virtue of self-known principles: and thus 
the act in question is said to be against the law of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Now marriage has for its principal end the begetting and rearing of 
children, and this end is competent to man according to  his generic 
nature, wherefore it is common to other animals (Ethic. viii, 12), and 
thus it is that the "offspring" is assigned as a marriage good. But for 
its secondary end, as the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 12), it has, 
among men alone, the community of works that are a necessity of life, as 
stated above (<A Href="XP041.html#XPQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="XP041.html#XPQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). And in reference to this they owe one another 
"fidelity" which is one of the goods of marriage. Furthermore it has 
another end, as regards marriage between believers, namely the 
signification of Christ and the Church: and thus the "sacrament" is said 
to be a marriage good. Wherefore the first end corresponds to the 
marriage of man inasmuch as he is an animal: the second, inasmuch as he 
is a man; the third, inasmuch as he is a believer. Accordingly plurality 
of wives neither wholly destroys nor in any way hinders the first end of 
marriage, since one man is sufficient to get children of several wives, 
and to rear the children born of them. But though it does not wholly 
destroy the second end, it hinders it considerably for there cannot 
easily be peace in a family where several wives are joined to one 
husband, since one husband cannot suffice to satisfy the requisitions of 
several wives, and again because the sharing of several in one occupation 
is a cause of strife: thus "potters quarrel with one another" 
[*Aristotle, Rhet. ii, 4], and in like manner the several wives of one 
husband. The third end, it removes altogether, because as Christ is one, 
so also is the Church one. It is therefore evident from what has been 
said that plurality of wives is in a way against the law of nature, and 
in a way not against it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Custom does not prejudice the law of nature as regards the 
first precepts of the latter, which are like the general concepts of the 
mind in speculative matters. But those which are drawn like conclusions 
from these custom enforces, as Tully declares (De Inv. Rhet. ii), or 
weakens. Such is the precept of nature in the matter of having one wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Tully says (De Inv. Rhet. ii), "fear of the law and 
religion have sanctioned those things that come from nature and are 
approved by custom." Wherefore it is evident that those dictates of the 
natural law, which are derived from the first principles as it were of 
the natural law, have not the binding force of an absolute commandment, 
except when they have been sanctioned by Divine or human law. This is 
what Augustine means by saying that "they did not disobey the 
commandments of the law, since it was not forbidden by any law."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Third Objection follows from what has been said.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Natural right has several significations. First a right is 
said to be natural by its principle, because it is instilled by nature: 
and thus Tully defines it (De Inv. Rhet. ii) when he says: "Natural right 
is not the result of opinion but the product of an innate force." And 
since even in natural things certain movements are called natural, not 
that they be from an intrinsic principle, but because they are from a 
higher moving  principle---thus the movements that are caused in the 
elements by the impress of heavenly bodies are said to be natural, as the 
Commentator states (De Coelo et Mundo iii, 28), therefore those things 
that are of Divine right are said to be of natural right, because they 
are caused by the impress and influence of a higher principle, namely 
God. Isidore takes it in this sense, when he says (Etym. v) that "the 
natural right is that which is contained in the Law and the Gospel." 
Thirdly, right is said to be natural not only from its principle but also 
from its matter, because it is about natural things. And since nature is 
contradistinguished with reason, whereby man is a man, it follows that if 
we take natural right in its strictest sense, those things which are 
dictated by natural reason and pertain to man alone are not said to be of 
natural right, but only those which are dictated by natural reason and 
are common to man and other animals. Thus we have the aforesaid 
definition, namely: "Natural right is what nature has taught all 
animals." Accordingly plurality of wives, though not contrary to natural 
right taken in the third sense, is nevertheless against natural right 
taken in the second sense, because it is forbidden by the Divine law. It 
is also against natural right taken in the first sense, as appears from 
what has been said, for such is nature's dictate to every animal 
according to the mode befitting its nature. Wherefore also certain 
animals, the rearing of whose offspring demands the care of both, namely 
the male and female, by natural instinct cling to the union of one with 
one, for instance the turtle-dove, the dove, and so forth.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The Reply to the Fifth Objection is clear from what has been said.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since, however, the arguments adduced "on the contrary side" would seem 
to show that plurality of wives is against the first principles of the 
natural law, we must reply to them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly we reply to the Sixth Objection that human nature was 
founded without any defect, and consequently it is endowed not only with 
those things without which the principal end of marriage is impossible of 
attainment, but also with those without which the secondary end of 
marriage could not be obtained without difficulty: and in this way it 
sufficed man when he was first formed to have one wife, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> In marriage the husband gives his wife power of his body, 
not in all respects, but only in those things that are required by 
marriage. Now marriage does not require the husband to pay the debt every 
time his wife asks for it, if we consider the principal end for which 
marriage was instituted, namely the good of the offspring, but only as 
far as is necessary for impregnation. But in so far as it is instituted 
as a remedy (which is its secondary end), marriage does require the debt 
to be paid at all times on being asked for. Hence it is evident that by 
taking several wives a man does not bind himself to the impossible, 
considering the principal end of marriage; and therefore plurality of 
wives is not against the first principles of the natural law. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> This precept of the natural law, "Do not to another what 
thou wouldst not were done to thyself," should be understood with the 
proviso that there be equal proportion. For if a superior is unwilling to 
be withstood by his subject, he is not therefore bound not to withstand 
his subject. Hence it does not follow in virtue of this precept that as a 
husband is unwilling for his wife to have another husband, he must not 
have another wife: because for one man to have several wives is not 
contrary to the first principles of the natural law, as stated above: 
whereas for one wife to have several husbands is contrary to the first 
principles of the natural law, since thereby the good of the offspring 
which is the principal end of marriage is, in one respect, entirely 
destroyed, and in another respect hindered. For the good of the offspring 
means not only begetting, but also rearing. Now the begetting of 
offspring, though not wholly voided (since a woman may be impregnated a 
second time after impregnation has already taken place, as stated in De 
Gener. Animal. vii. 4), is nevertheless considerably hindered, because 
this can scarcely happen without injury either to both fetus or to one of 
them. But the rearing of the offspring is altogether done away, because 
as a result of one woman having several husbands there follows 
uncertainty of the offspring in relation to its father, whose care is 
necessary for its education. Wherefore the marriage of one wife with 
several husbands has not been sanctioned by any law or custom, whereas 
the converse has been.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[1] R.O. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> The natural inclination in the appetitive power follows the 
natural concept in the cognitive power. And since it is not so much 
opposed to the natural concept for a man to have several wives as for a 
wife to have several husbands, it follows that a wife's love is not so 
averse to another sharing the same husband with her, as a husband's love 
is to another sharing the same wife with him. Consequently both in man 
and in other animals the male is more jealous of the female than "vice 
versa."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was ever lawful to have several wives?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it can never have been lawful to have several 
wives. For, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. v, 7), "The natural law 
has the same power at all times and places." Now plurality of wives is 
forbidden by the natural law, as stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore as it is 
unlawful now, it was unlawful at all times.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it was ever lawful, this could only be because it was 
lawful either in itself, or by dispensation. If the former, it would also 
be lawful now; if the latter, this is impossible, for according to 
Augustine (Contra Faust. xxvi, 3), "as God is the founder of nature, He 
does nothing contrary to the principles which He has planted in nature." 
Since then God has planted in our nature the principle that one man 
should be united to one wife, it would seem that He has never dispensed 
man from  this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a thing be lawful by dispensation, it is only lawful 
for those who receive the dispensation. Now we do not read in the Law of 
a general dispensation having been granted to all. Since then in the Old 
Testament all who wished to do so, without any distinction, took to 
themselves several wives, nor were reproached on that account, either by 
the law or by the prophets, it would seem that it was not made lawful by 
dispensation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, where there is the same reason for dispensation, the 
same dispensation should be given. Now we cannot assign any other reason 
for dispensation than the multiplying of the offspring for the worship of 
God, and this is necessary also now. Therefore this dispensation would be 
still in force, especially as we read nowhere of its having been recalled.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, in granting a dispensation the greater good should not 
be overlooked for the sake of a lesser good. Now fidelity and the 
sacrament, which it would seem impossible to safeguard in a marriage 
where one man is joined to several wives, are greater goods than the 
multiplication of the offspring. Therefore this dispensation ought not to 
have been granted with a view to this multiplication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++3:19">Gal. 3:19</a>) that the Law "was set because 
of transgressors [Vulg.: 'transgressions']," namely in order to prohibit 
them. Now the Old Law mentions plurality of wives without any prohibition 
thereof, as appears from Dt. 21:15, "If a man have two wives," etc. 
Therefore they were not transgressors through having two wives; and so it 
was lawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, this is confirmed by the example of the holy patriarchs, who 
are stated to have had several wives, and yet were most pleasing to God, 
for instance Jacob, David, and several others. Therefore at one time it 
was lawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 7,8), plurality of wives is 
said to be against the natural law, not as regards its first precepts, 
but as regards the secondary precepts, which like conclusions are drawn 
from its first precepts. Since, however, human acts must needs vary 
according to the various conditions of persons, times, and other 
circumstances, the aforesaid conclusions do not proceed from the first 
precepts of the natural law, so as to be binding in all cases, but only 
in the majority. for such is the entire matter of Ethics according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. i, 3,7). Hence, when they cease to be binding, it is 
lawful to disregard them. But because it is not easy to determine the 
above variations, it belongs exclusively to him from whose authority he 
derives its binding force to permit the non-observance of the law in 
those cases to which the force of the law ought not to extend, and this 
permission is called a dispensation. Now the law prescribing the one wife 
was framed not by man but by God, nor was it ever given by word or in 
writing, but was imprinted on the  heart, like other things belonging in 
any way to the natural law. Consequently a dispensation in this matter 
could be granted by God alone through an inward inspiration, vouchsafed 
originally to the holy patriarchs, and by their example continued to 
others, at a time when it behooved the aforesaid precept not to be 
observed, in order to ensure the multiplication of the offspring to be 
brought up in the worship of God. For the principal end is ever to be 
borne in mind before the secondary end. Wherefore, since the good of the 
offspring is the principal end of marriage, it behooved to disregard for 
a time the impediment that might arise to the secondary ends, when it was 
necessary for the offspring to be multiplied; because it was for the 
removal of this impediment that the precept forbidding a plurality of 
wives was framed, as stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The natural law, considered in itself, has the same force 
at all times and places; but accidentally on account of some impediment 
it may vary at certain times and places, as the Philosopher (Ethic. i, 
3,7) instances in the case of other natural things. For at all times and 
places the right hand is better than the left according to nature, but it 
may happen accidentally that a person is ambidextrous, because our nature 
is variable; and the same applies to the natural, just as the Philosopher 
states (Ethic. i, 3,7).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In a Decretal (De divortiis, cap. Gaudemus) it is asserted 
that is was never lawful to have several wives without having a 
dispensation received through Divine inspiration. Nor is the dispensation 
thus granted a contradiction to the principles which God has implanted in 
nature, but an exception to them, because those principles are not 
intended to apply to all cases but to the majority, as stated. Even so it 
is not contrary to nature when certain occurrences take place in natural 
things miraculously, by way of exception to more frequent occurrences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Dispensation from a law should follow the quality of the 
law. Wherefore, since the law of nature is imprinted on the heart, it was 
not necessary for a dispensation from things pertaining to the natural 
law to be given under the form of a written law but by internal 
inspiration.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When Christ came it was the time of the fulness of the 
grace of Christ, whereby the worship of God was spread abroad among all 
nations by a spiritual propagation. Hence there is not the same reason 
for a dispensation as before Christ's coming, when the worship of God was 
spread and safeguarded by a carnal propagation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[2] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The offspring, considered as one of the marriage goods, 
includes the keeping of faith with God, because the reason why it is 
reckoned a marriage good is because it is awaited with a view to its 
being brought up in the worship of God. Now the faith to be kept with God 
is of greater import than the faith to be kept with a wife, which is 
reckoned a marriage good, and than the  signification which pertains to 
the sacrament, since the signification is subordinate to the knowledge of 
faith. Hence it is not unfitting if something is taken from the two other 
goods for the sake of the good of the offspring. Nor are they entirely 
done away, since there remains faith towards several wives; and the 
sacrament remains after a fashion, for though it did not signify the 
union of Christ with the Church as one, nevertheless the plurality of 
wives signified the distinction of degrees in the Church, which 
distinction is not only in the Church militant but also in the Church 
triumphant. Consequently their marriages signified somewhat the union of 
Christ not only with the Church militant, as some say, but also with the 
Church triumphant where there are "many mansions" [*Jn. 19:2].<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is against the natural law to have a concubine?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that to have a concubine is not against the natural 
law. For the ceremonies of the Law are not of the natural law. But 
fornication is forbidden (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Acts+15:29">Acts 15:29</a>) in conjunction with ceremonies of 
the law which for the time were being imposed on those who were brought 
to the faith from among the heathens. Therefore simple fornication which 
is intercourse with a concubine is not against the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, positive law is an outcome of the natural law, as Tully 
says (De Invent. ii). Now fornication was not forbidden by positive law; 
indeed according to the ancient laws women used to be sentenced to be 
taken to brothels. Therefore it is not against the natural law to have a 
concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the natural law does not forbid that which is given 
simply, to be given for a time or under certain restrictions. Now one 
unmarried woman may give the power of her body for ever to an unmarried 
man, so that he may use her when he will. Therefore it is not against the 
law of nature, if she give him power of her body for a time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whoever uses his own property as he will, injures no 
one. But a bondswoman is her master's property. Therefore if her master 
use her as he will, he injures no one: and consequently it is not against 
the natural law to have a concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, everyone may give his own property to another. Now the 
wife has power of her husband's body (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:4">1 Cor. 7:4</a>). Therefore if his wife 
be willing, the husband can have intercourse with another woman without 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to all laws the children born of a concubine 
are children of shame. But this would not be so unless the union of which 
they are born were naturally shameful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, as stated above (<A Href="XP041.html#XPQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>, <A Href="XP041.html#XPQ41A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), marriage is natural. But this 
would not be so if without prejudice to the natural law a man  could be 
united to a woman otherwise than by marriage. Therefore it is against the 
natural law to have a concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), an action is said to be against 
the natural law, if it is not in keeping with the due end intended by 
nature, whether through not being directed thereto by the action of the 
agent, or through being directed thereto by the action of the agent, or 
through being in itself improportionate to that end. Now the end which 
nature intends in sexual union is the begetting and rearing of the 
offspring. and that this good might be sought after, it attached pleasure 
to the union; as Augustine says (De Nup. et Concup. i, 8). Accordingly to 
make use of sexual intercourse on account of its inherent pleasure, 
without reference to the end for which nature intended it, is to act 
against nature, as also is it if the intercourse be not such as may 
fittingly be directed to that end. And since, for the most part, things 
are denominated from their end, as being that which is of most 
consequence to them, just as the marriage union took its name from the 
good of the offspring [*Cf. Question [44], Article [2]], which is the end chiefly sought 
after in marriage, so the name of concubine is expressive of that union 
where sexual intercourse is sought after for its own sake. Moreover even 
though sometimes a man may seek to have offspring of such an intercourse, 
this is not befitting to the good of the offspring, which signifies not 
only the begetting of children from which they take their being, but also 
their rearing and instruction, by which means they receive nourishment 
and learning from their parents, in respect of which three things the 
parents are bound to their children, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. 
viii, 11,12). Now since the rearing and teaching of the children remain a 
duty of the parents during a long period of time, the law of nature 
requires the father and mother to dwell together for a long time, in 
order that together they may be of assistance to their children. Hence 
birds that unite together in rearing their young do not sever their 
mutual fellowship from the time when they first come together until the 
young are fully fledged. Now this obligation which binds the female and 
her mate to remain together constitutes matrimony. Consequently it is 
evident that it is contrary to the natural law for a man to have 
intercourse with a woman who is not married to him, which is the 
signification of a concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Among the Gentiles the natural law was obscured in many 
points: and consequently they did not think it wrong to have intercourse 
with a concubine, and in many cases practiced fornication as though it 
were lawful, as also other things contrary to the ceremonial laws of the 
Jews, though not contrary to the law of nature. Wherefore the apostles 
inserted the prohibition of fornication among that of other ceremonial 
observances, because in both cases there was a difference of opinion 
between Jews and Gentiles.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This law was the result of the darkness just mentioned, 
into which the Gentiles had fallen, by not giving due honor to God as 
stated in Rm. 1:21, and did not proceed from the  instinct of the natural 
law. Hence, when the Christian religion prevailed, this law was abolished.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In certain cases no evil results ensue if a person 
surrenders his right to a thing whether absolutely or for a time, so that 
in neither case is the surrender against the natural law. But that does 
not apply to the case in point, wherefore the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Injury is opposed to justice. Now the natural law forbids 
not only injustice, but also whatever is opposed to any of the virtues: 
for instance it is contrary to the natural law to eat immoderately, 
although by doing so a man uses his own property without injury to 
anyone. Moreover although a bondswoman is her master's property that she 
may serve him, she is not his that she may be his concubine. And again it 
depends how a person makes use of his property. For such a man does an 
injury to the offspring he begets, since such a union is not directed to 
its good, as stated above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[3] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The wife has power of her husband's body, not simply and in 
all respects, but only in relation to marriage, and consequently she 
cannot transfer her husband's body to another to the detriment of the 
good of marriage.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is a mortal sin to have intercourse with a concubine?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not a mortal sin to have intercourse 
with a concubine. For a lie is a greater sin than simple fornication: and 
a proof of this is that Juda, who did not abhor to commit fornication 
with Thamar, recoiled from telling a lie, saying (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++38:23">Gn. 38:23</a>): "Surely she 
cannot charge us with a lie." But a lie is not always a mortal sin. 
Neither therefore is simple fornication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a deadly sin should be punished with death. But the Old 
Law did not punish with death intercourse with a concubine, save in a 
certain case (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++22:25">Dt. 22:25</a>). Therefore it is not a deadly sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxiii, 12), the sins of 
the flesh are less blameworthy than spiritual sins. Now pride and 
covetousness, which are spiritual sins, are not always mortal sins. 
Therefore fornication, which is a sin of the flesh, is not always a 
mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, where the incentive is greater the sin is less grievous, 
because he sins more who is overcome by a lighter temptation. But 
concupiscence is the greatest incentive to lust. Therefore since lustful 
actions are not always mortal sins, neither is simple fornication a 
mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Nothing but mortal sin excludes from the  kingdom of 
God. But fornicators are excluded from the kingdom of God (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++6:9,10">1 Cor. 6:9,10</a>). Therefore simple fornication is a mortal sin.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, mortal sins alone are called crimes. Now all fornication is a 
crime according to Tobias 4:13, "Take heed to keep thyself . . . from all 
fornication, and beside thy wife never endure to know crime." Therefore, 
etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As we have already stated (Sent. ii, D, 42, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>), 
those sins are mortal in their genus which violate the bond of friendship 
between man and God, and between man and man; for such sins are against 
the two precepts of charity which is the life of the soul. Wherefore 
since the intercourse of fornication destroys the due relations of the 
parent with the offspring that is nature's aim in sexual intercourse, 
there can be no doubt that simple fornication by its very nature is a 
mortal sin even though there were no written law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It often happens that a man who does not avoid a mortal 
sin, avoids a venial sin to which he has not so great an incentive. Thus, 
too, Juda avoided a lie while he avoided not fornication. Nevertheless 
that would have been a pernicious lie, for it would have involved an 
injury if he had not kept his promise.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A sin is called deadly, not because it is punished with 
temporal, but because it is punished with eternal death. Hence also 
theft, which is a mortal sin, and many other sins are sometimes not 
punished with temporal death by the law. The same applies to fornication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as not every movement of pride is a mortal sin, so 
neither is every movement of lust, because the first movements of lust 
and the like are venial sins, even sometimes marriage intercourse. 
Nevertheless some acts of lust are mortal sins, while some movements of 
pride are venial: since the words quoted from Gregory are to be 
understood as comparing vices in their genus and not in their particular 
acts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A circumstance is the more effective in aggravating a sin 
according as it comes nearer to the nature of sin. Hence although 
fornication is less grave on account of the greatness of its incentive, 
yet on account of the matter about which it is, it has a greater gravity 
than immoderate eating, because it is about those things which tighten 
the bond of human fellowship, as stated above. Hence the argument does 
not prove.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it was ever lawful to have a concubine?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it has been sometimes lawful to have a 
concubine. For just as the natural law requires a man to have but one 
wife, so does it forbid him to have a concubine. Yet at times it has been 
lawful to have several wives. Therefore it has also  been lawful to have 
a concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a woman cannot be at the same time a slave and a wife; 
wherefore according to the Law (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++21:11,+seqq+">Dt. 21:11, seqq.</a>) a bondswoman gained her 
freedom by the very fact of being taken in marriage. Now we read that 
certain men who were most beloved of God, for instance Abraham and Jacob, 
had intercourse with their bondswomen. Therefore these were not wives, 
and consequently it was sometime lawful to have a concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a woman who is taken in marriage cannot be cast out, and 
her son should have a share in the inheritance. Yet Abraham sent Agar 
away, and her son was not his heir (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++21:14">Gn. 21:14</a>). Therefore she was not 
Abraham's wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Things opposed to the precepts of the decalogue were 
never lawful. Now to have a concubine is against a precept of the 
decalogue, namely, "Thou shalt not commit adultery." Therefore it was 
never lawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Ambrose says in his book on the patriarchs (De Abraham i, 4): 
"What is unlawful to a wife is unlawful to a husband." But it is never 
lawful for a wife to put aside her own husband and have intercourse with 
another man. Therefore it was never lawful for a husband to have a 
concubine.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Rabbi Moses says (Doc. Perp. iii, 49) that before the 
time of the Law fornication was not a sin; and he proved his assertion 
from the fact that Juda had intercourse with Thamar. But this argument is 
not conclusive. For there is no need to excuse Jacob's sons from mortal 
sin, since they were accused to their father of a most wicked crime (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gn++37:2">Gn. 37:2</a>), and consented kill Joseph and to sell him. Wherefore we must say 
that since it is against the natural law to have a concubine outside 
wedlock, as stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), it was never lawful either in itself or 
by dispensation. For as we have shown (Doc. Perp. iii, 49) intercourse 
with a woman outside wedlock is an action improportionate to the good of 
the offspring which is the principal end of marriage: and consequently it 
is against the first precepts of the natural law which admit of no 
dispensation. Hence wherever in the Old Testament we read of concubines 
being taken by such men as we ought to excuse from mortal sin, we must 
needs understand them to have been taken in marriage, and yet to have 
been called concubines, because they had something of the character of a 
wife and something of the character of a concubine. In so far as marriage 
is directed to its principal end, which is the good of the offspring, the 
union of wife and husband is indissoluble or at least of a lasting 
nature, as shown above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), and in regard to this there is no 
dispensation. But in regard to the secondary end, which is the management 
of the household and community of works, the wife is united to the 
husband as his mate: and this was lacking in those who were known as 
concubines. For in this respect a dispensation was possible, since it is 
the secondary end of marriage. And from this point of view they bore some 
resemblance to concubines, and for this reason they  were known as such.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 7,8) to have several wives is not 
against the first precepts of the natural law, as it is to have a 
concubine; wherefore the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The patriarchs of old by virtue of the dispensation which 
allowed them several wives, approached their bondswomen with the 
disposition of a husband towards his wife. For these women were wives as 
to the principal and first end of marriage, but not as to the other union 
which regards the secondary end, to which bondage is opposed since a 
woman cannot be at once mate and slave.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[65] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As in the Mosaic law it was allowable by dispensation to 
grant a bill of divorce in order to avoid wife-murder (as we shall state 
further on, Question [67], Article [6]), so by the same dispensation Abraham was allowed 
to send Agar away, in order to signify the mystery which the Apostle 
explains (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Gal++4:22,+seqq+">Gal. 4:22, seqq.</a>). Again, that this son did not inherit belongs 
to the mystery, as explained in the same place. Even so Esau, the son of 
a free woman, did not inherit (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Rm++9:13,+seqq+">Rm. 9:13, seqq.</a>). In like manner on 
account of the mystery it came about that the sons of Jacob born of bond 
and free women inherited, as Augustine says (Tract. xi in Joan.) because 
"sons and heirs are born to Christ both of good ministers denoted by the 
free woman and of evil ministers denoted by the bondswoman."
