    OF THOSE WHO WILL JUDGE AND OF THOSE WHO WILL BE JUDGED AT THE GENERAL
    JUDGMENT (EIGHT ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider who will judge and who will be judged at the general
    judgment. Under this head there are eight points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any men will judge
    together with Christ?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the judicial power
    corresponds to voluntary poverty?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the angels also will
    judge?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the demons will carry out
    the Judge's sentence on the damned?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether all men will come up for
    judgment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether any of the good will be
    judged?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether any of the wicked will be
    judged?
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether any men will judge together with Christ?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no men will judge with Christ.
    For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A22,23"
      >Jn. 5:22,23</a
    >): "The Father... hath given all judgment to the Son, that all men may
    honor the Son." Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, whoever judges has authority over that
    which he judges. Now those things about which the coming judgment will have
    to be, such as human merits and demerits, are subject to Divine authority
    alone. Therefore no one is competent to judge of those things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this judgment will take place not
    vocally but mentally. Now the publication of merits and demerits in the
    hearts of all men (which is like an accusation or approval), or the
    repayment of punishment and reward (which is like the pronouncement of the
    sentence) will be the work of God alone. Therefore none but Christ Who is
    God will judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A28"
      >Mt. 19:28</a
    >): "You also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes of
    Israel." Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, "The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of His people"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++3%3A14">Is. 3:14</a>).
    Therefore it would seem that others also will judge together with Christ.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> To judge has several significations. First it
    is used causally as it were, when we say it of that which proves that some
    person ought to be judged. In this sense the expression is used of certain
    people in comparison, in so far as some are shown to be deserving of
    judgment through being compared with others: for instance (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++12%3A41"
      >Mt. 12:41</a
    >): "The men of Nineve shall rise in judgment with this generation, and
    shall condemn it." To rise in judgment thus is common to the good and the
    wicked. Secondly, the expression "to judge" is used equivalently, so to say;
    for consent to an action is considered equivalent to doing it. Wherefore
    those who will consent with Christ the Judge, by approving His sentence,
    will be said to judge. In this sense it will belong to all the elect to
    judge: wherefore it is written (Wis. 3:7,8): "The just... shall judge
    nations." Thirdly, a person is said to judge assessorially and by
    similitude, because he is like the judge in that his seat* is raised above
    the others: and thus assessors are said to judge. [*An "assessor" is one who
    "sits by" the judge.] Some say that the perfect to whom judiciary power is
    promised (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A28"
      >Mt. 19:28</a
    >) will judge in this sense, namely that they will be raised to the dignity
    of assessors, because they will appear above others at the judgment, and go
    forth "to meet Christ, into the air." But this apparently does not suffice
    for the fulfilment of our Lord's promise (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A28"
      >Mt. 19:28</a
    >): "You shall sit... judging," for He would seem to make "judging"
    something additional to "sitting." Hence there is a fourth way of judging,
    which will be competent to perfect men as containing the decrees of Divine
    justice according to which men will be judged: thus a book containing the
    law might be said to judge: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++20%3A12"
      >Apoc. 20:12</a
    >): "(Judgment took her seat*) and the books were opened." [*The words in
    brackets are not in the Vulgate. Apoc. 20:4 we find: "I saw seats, and they
    sat upon them and judgment was given to them."] Richard of St. Victor
    expounds this judging in this way (De judic. potest.), wherefore he says:
    "Those who persevere in Divine contemplation, who read every day the book of
    wisdom, transcribe, so to speak, in their hearts whatever they grasp by
    their clear insight of the truth"; and further on: "What else are the hearts
    of those who judge, divinely instructed in all truth, but a codex of the
    law?" Since, however, judging denotes an action exercised on another person,
    it follows that, properly speaking, he is said to judge who pronounces
    judgment on another. But this happens in two ways. First, by his own
    authority: and this belongs to the one who has dominion and power over
    others, and to whose ruling those who are judged are subject, wherefore it
    belongs to him to pass judgment on them. In this sense to judge belongs to
    God alone. Secondly, to judge is to acquaint others of the sentence
    delivered by another's authority, that is to announce the verdict already
    given. In this way perfect men will judge, because they will lead others to
    the knowledge of Divine justice, that these may know what is due to them on
    account of their merits: so that this very revelation of justice is called
    judgment. Hence Richard of St. Victor says (De judic. potest.) that for "the
    judges to open the books of their decree in the presence of those who are to
    be judged signifies that they open their hearts to the gaze of all those who
    are below them, and that they reveal their knowledge in whatever pertains to
    the judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This objection considers the judgment of
    authority which belongs to Christ alone: and the same answer applies to the
    Second Objection.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There is no reason why some of the
    saints should not reveal certain things to others, either by way of
    enlightenment, as the higher angels enlighten the lower [*Cf. FP, Question
    [106]],: or by way of speech as the lower angels speak to the higher [*Cf.
    FP, Question [107], Article [2]].<br />

    Whether the judicial power corresponds to voluntary poverty?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the judicial power does not
    correspond to voluntary poverty. For it was promised to none but the twelve
    apostles (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A28"
      >Mt. 19:28</a
    >): "You shall sit on twelve seats, judging," etc. Since then those who are
    voluntarily poor are not all apostles, it would seem that the judicial power
    is not competent to all.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to offer sacrifice to God of one's own
    body is more than to do so of outward things. Now martyrs and also virgins
    offer sacrifice to God of their own body. whereas the voluntarily poor offer
    sacrifice of outward things. Therefore the sublimity of the judicial power
    is more in keeping with martyrs and virgins than with those who are
    voluntarily poor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A45"
      >Jn. 5:45</a
    >): "There is one that accuseth you, Moses in whom you trust---because you
    believe not his voice," according to a gloss, and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++12%3A48"
      >Jn. 12:48</a
    >): "The word that I have spoken shall judge him in the last day." Therefore
    the fact that a man propounds a law, or exhorts men by word to lead a good
    life, gives him the right to judge those who scorn his utterances. But this
    belongs to doctors. Therefore it is more competent to doctors than to those
    who are poor voluntarily.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Christ through being judged unjustly
    merited as man to be judge of all in His human nature [*Cf. TP, Question
    [59], Article [6]], according to Jn. 5:27, "He hath given Him power to do
    judgment, because He is the Son of man." Now those who suffer persecution
    for justice' sake are judged unjustly. Therefore the judicial power is
    competent to them rather than to the voluntarily poor.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, a superior is not judged by his
    inferior. Now many who will have made lawful use of riches will have greater
    merit than many of the voluntarily poor. Therefore the voluntarily poor will
    not judge where those are to be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+36%3A6"
      >Job 36:6</a
    >): "He saveth not the wicked, and He giveth judgment to the poor."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, a gloss on Mt. 19:28, "You who have left all things' [*Vulg.: 'You
    who have followed Me']" says: "Those who left all things and followed God
    will be the judges; those who made right use of what they had lawfully will
    be judged," and thus the same conclusion follows as before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judicial power is due especially to poverty
    on three counts. First, by reason of congruity, since voluntary poverty
    belongs to those who despise all the things of the world and cleave to
    Christ alone. Consequently there is nothing in them to turn away their
    judgment from justice, so that they are rendered competent to be judges as
    loving the truth of justice above all things. Secondly, by reason of merit,
    since exaltation corresponds by way of merit to humility. Now of all the
    things that make man contemptible in this world humility is the chief: and
    for this reason the excellence of judicial power is promised to the poor, so
    that he who humbles himself for Christ's sake shall be exalted. Thirdly,
    because poverty disposes a man to the aforesaid manner of judging. For the
    reason why one of the saints will be said to judge as stated above [*Cf.
    Article [1]], is that he will have the heart instructed in all Divine truth
    which he will be thus able to make known to others. Now in the advancement
    to perfection, the first thing that occurs to be renounced is external
    wealth, because this is the last thing of all to be acquired. And that which
    is last in the order of generation is the first in the order of destruction:
    wherefore among the beatitudes whereby we advance to perfection, the first
    place is given to poverty. Thus judicial power corresponds to poverty, in so
    far as this is the disposition to the aforesaid perfection. Hence also it is
    that this same power is not promised to all who are voluntarily poor, but to
    those who leave all and follow Christ in accordance with the perfection of
    life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx),
    "we must not imagine that because He says that they will sit on twelve seats
    only twelve men will judge with Him. else since we read that Matthias was
    appointed apostle in the place of the traitor Judas, Paul who worked more
    than the rest will have nowhere to sit as judge." Hence "the number twelve,"
    as he states (De Civ. Dei xx), "signifies the whole multitude of those who
    will judge, because the two parts of seven, namely three and four, being
    multiplied together make twelve." Moreover twelve is a perfect number, being
    the double of six, which is a perfect number.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Or, speaking literally, He spoke to the twelve apostles in whose person he
    made this promise to all who follow them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Virginity and martyrdom do not dispose
    man to retain the precepts of Divine justice in his heart in the same degree
    as poverty does: even so, on the other hand, outward riches choke the word
    of God by the cares which they entail (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++8%3A14"
      >Lk. 8:14</a
    >). Or we may reply that poverty does not suffice alone to merit judicial
    power, but is the fundamental part of that perfection to which the judicial
    power corresponds. Wherefore among those things regarding perfection which
    follow after poverty we may reckon both virginity and martyrdom and all the
    works of perfection: yet they do not rank as high as poverty, since the
    beginning of a thing is its chief part.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He who propounded the law or urged men
    to good will judge, in the causal (Cf.
    <a href="XP089.html#XPQ89A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) sense, because others
    will be judged in reference to the words he has uttered or propounded. Hence
    the judicial power does not properly correspond to preaching or teaching. or
    we may reply that, as some say, three things are requisite for the judicial
    power; first, that one renounce temporal cares, lest the mind be hindered
    from the contemplation of wisdom; secondly that one possess Divine justice
    by way of habit both as to knowledge and as to observance; thirdly that one
    should have taught others this same justice; and this teaching will be the
    perfection whereby a man merits to have judicial power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Christ humbled Himself in that He was
    judged unjustly; for "He was offered because it was His own will" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++53%3A7"
      >Is. 53:7</a
    >): and by His humility He merited His exaltation to judicial power, since
    all things are made subject to Him (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A8,9"
      >Phil. 2:8,9</a
    >). Hence, judicial power is more due to them who humble themselves of their
    own will by renouncing temporal goods, on account of which men are honored
    by worldlings, than to those who are humbled by others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> An inferior cannot judge a superior by
    his own authority, but he can do so by the authority of a superior, as in
    the case of a judge-delegate. Hence it is not unfitting that it be granted
    to the poor as an accidental reward to judge others, even those who have
    higher merit in respect of the essential reward.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the angels will judge?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels will judge. For it
    is written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++25%3A31"
      >Mt. 25:31</a
    >): "When the Son of man shall come in His majesty, and all the angels with
    Him." Now He is speaking of His coming to judgment. Therefore it would seem
    that also the angels will judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the orders of the angels take their
    names from the offices which they fulfill. Now one of the angelic orders is
    that of the Thrones, which would seem to pertain to the judicial power,
    since a throne is the "judicial bench, a royal seat, a professor's chair"
    [*Cf. St. Isidore, Etym. vii, 5]. Therefore some of the angels will
    judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, equality with the angels is promised the
    saints after this life (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >). If then men will have this power of judging, much more will the angels
    have it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A27"
      >Jn. 5:27</a
    >): "He hath given Him power to judgment, because He is the Son of man." But
    the angels have not the human nature in common with Him. Neither therefore
    do they share with Him in the judicial power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the same person is not judge and judge's minister. Now in this
    judgment the angels will act as ministers of the Judge and, according to Mt.
    13:41: "The Son of man shall send His angels and they shall gather out of
    His kingdom all scandals." Therefore the angels will not judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judge's assessors must be conformed to the
    judge. Now judgment is ascribed to the Son of man because He will appear to
    all, both good and wicked, in His human nature, although the whole Trinity
    will judge by authority. Consequently it behooves also the Judge's assessors
    to have the human nature, so as to be visible to all, both good and wicked.
    Hence it is not fitting for the angels to judge, although in a certain sense
    we may say that the angels will judge, namely by approving the sentence
    [*Cf. Article [1]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As a gloss on this passage observes, the
    angels will come with Christ, not to judge, but "as witnesses of men's deeds
    because it was under their guardianship that men did well or ill."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The name of Thrones is given to angels
    in reference to the judgment which God is ever pronouncing, by governing all
    things with supreme justice: of which judgment angels are in a way the
    executors and promulgators. On the other hand, the judgment of men by the
    man Christ will require human assessors.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Equality with angels is promised to men
    as regards the essential reward. But nothing hinders an accidental reward
    from being bestowed on men to the exclusion of the angels, as in the case of
    the virgins' and martyrs' crowns: and the same may be said of the judicial
    power.<br />

    Whether the demons will carry out the sentence of the Judge on the
    damned?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the demons will not carry out
    the sentence of the Judge on the damned after the day of judgment. For,
    according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A24"
      >1 Cor. 15:24</a
    >): "He will then bring to naught [*Vulg.: 'When He shall have brought to
    naught', etc.] all principality, and power, and virtue." Therefore all
    supremacy will cease then. But the carrying out of the Judge's sentence
    implies some kind of supremacy. Therefore after the judgment day the demons
    will not carry out the Judge's sentence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the demons sinned more grievously than
    men. Therefore it is not just that men should be tortured by demons.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as the demons suggest evil things
    to men, so good angels suggest good things. Now it will not be the duty of
    the good angels to reward the good, but this will be done by God,
    immediately by Himself. Therefore neither will it be the duty of the demons
    to punish the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Sinners have subjected themselves to the
    devil by sinning. Therefore it is just that they should be subjected to him
    in their punishments, and punished by him as it were.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Master in the text of Sentent. iv, D, 47
    mentions two opinions on this question, both of which seem consistent with
    Divine justice, because it is just for man to be subjected to the devil for
    having sinned, and yet it is unjust for the demon to be over him.
    Accordingly the opinion which holds that after the judgment day the demons
    will not be placed over men to punish them, regards the order of Divine
    justice on the part of the demons punishing; while the contrary opinion
    regards the order of Divine justice on the part of the men punished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Which of these opinions is nearer the truth we cannot know for certain. Yet
    I think it truer to say that just as, among the saved, order will be
    observed so that some will be enlightened and perfected by others (because
    all the orders of the heavenly hierarchies will continue for ever) [*Cf. FP,
    Question [108], Articles [7],8], so, too, will order be observed in
    punishments, men being punished by demons, lest the Divine order, whereby
    the angels are placed between the human nature and the Divine, be entirely
    set aside. Wherefore just as the Divine illuminations are conveyed to men by
    the good angels, so too the demons execute the Divine justice on the wicked.
    Nor does this in any way diminish the punishment of the demons, since even
    in torturing others they are themselves tortured, because then the
    fellowship of the unhappy will not lessen but will increase unhappiness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The supremacy which, it is declared,
    will be brought to nought by Christ in the time to come must be taken in the
    sense of the supremacy which is in keeping with the state of this world:
    wherein men are placed over men, angels over men, angels over angels, demons
    over demons, and demons over men; in every case so as either to lead towards
    the end or to lead astray from the end. But then when all things will have
    attained to that end there will be no supremacy to lead astray from the end
    or to lead to it, but only that which maintains in the end, good or evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the demerit of the demons does
    not require that they be placed over men, since they made men subject to
    them unjustly, yet this is required by the order of their nature in relation
    to human nature: since "natural goods remain in them unimpaired" as
    Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The good angels are not the cause of the
    principal reward in the elect, because all receive this immediately from
    God. Nevertheless the angels are the cause of certain accidental rewards in
    men, in so far as the higher angels enlighten those beneath them, both
    angels and men, concerning certain hidden things of God, which do not belong
    to the essence of beatitude. In like manner the damned will receive their
    principal punishment immediately from God, namely the everlasting banishment
    from the Divine vision: but there is no reason why the demons should not
    torture men with other sensible punishments. There is, however, this
    difference: that merit exalts, whereas sin debases. Wherefore since the
    angelic nature is higher than the human, some on account of the excellence
    of their merit will be so far exalted as to be raised above the angels both
    in nature and rewards [*Cf. FP, Question [108], Article [8] ], so that some
    angels will be enlightened by some men. On the other hand, no human sinners
    will, on account of a certain degree of virtue, attain to the eminence that
    attaches to the nature of the demons.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether all men will be present at the judgment?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that men will not all be present at
    the judgment. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A28"
      >Mt. 19:28</a
    >): "You... shall sit on twelve seats, judging the twelve tribes of Israel."
    But all men do not belong to those twelve tribes. Therefore it would seem
    that men will not all be present at the judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the same apparently is to be gathered
    from Ps. 1:5, "The wicked shall not rise again in judgment."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a man is brought to judgment that his
    merits may be discussed. But some there are who have acquired no merits,
    such as children who died before reaching the perfect age. Therefore they
    need not be present at the judgment. Now there are many such. Therefore it
    would seem that not all will be present.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A42"
      >Acts 10:42</a
    >) that Christ "was appointed by God to be judge of the living and of the
    dead." Now this division comprises all men, no matter how the living be
    distinct from the dead. Therefore all men will be present at the
    judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++1%3A7"
      >Apoc. 1:7</a
    >): "Behold He cometh with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him." Now
    this would not be so unless all were present at the judgment. Therefore,
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judicial power was bestowed on Christ as
    man, in reward for the humility which He showed forth in His passion. Now in
    His passion He shed His blood for all in point of sufficiency, although
    through meeting with an obstacle in some, it had not its effect in all.
    Therefore it is fitting that all men should assemble at the judgment, to see
    His exaltation in His human nature, in respect of which "He was appointed by
    God to be judge of the living and of the dead."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 5),
    "it does not follow from the saying, 'Judging the twelve tribes of Israel,'
    that the tribe of Levi, which is the thirteenth, is not to be judged, or
    that they will judge that people alone, and not other nations." The reason
    why all other nations are denoted by the twelve tribes is because they were
    called by Christ to take the place of the twelve tribes.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The words, "The wicked shall not rise in
    judgment," if referred to all sinners, mean that they will not arise to
    judge. But if the wicked denote unbelievers, the sense is that they will not
    arise to be judged, because they are "already judged" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A18"
      >Jn. 3:18</a
    >). All, however, will rise again to assemble at the judgment and witness
    the glory of the Judge.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Even children who have died before
    reaching the perfect age will be present at the judgment, not to be judged,
    but to see the Judge's glory.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the good will be judged at the judgment?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that none of the good will be
    judged at the judgment. For it is declared (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A18"
      >Jn. 3:18</a
    >) that "he that believeth in Him is not judged." Now all the good believed
    in Him. Therefore they will not be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those who are uncertain of their bliss
    are not blessed: whence Augustine proves (Gen. ad lit. xi) that the demons
    were never blessed. But the saints are now blessed. Therefore they are
    certain of their bliss. Now what is certain is not submitted to judgment.
    Therefore the good will not be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fear is incompatible with bliss. But the
    last judgment, which above all is described as terrible, cannot take place
    without inspiring fear into those who are to be judged. Hence Gregory
    observes on Job 41:16 "When he shall raise him up, the angels shall fear,"
    etc. (Moral. xxxiv): "Consider how the conscience of the wicked will then be
    troubled when even the just are disturbed about their life." Therefore the
    blessed will not be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It would seem that all the good will be
    judged, since it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++5%3A10"
      >2 Cor. 5:10</a
    >): "We must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that
    every one may receive the proper things of the body, according as he hath
    done, whether it be good or evil." Now there is nothing else to be judged.
    Therefore all, even the good, will be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the "general" includes all. Now this is called the general
    judgment. Therefore all will be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judgment comprises two things, namely the
    discussion of merits and the payment of rewards. As regards the payment of
    rewards, all will be judged, even the good, since the Divine sentence will
    appoint to each one the reward corresponding to his merit. But there is no
    discussion of merits save where good and evil merits are mingled together.
    Now those who build on the foundation of faith, "gold, silver, and precious
    stones" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++3%3A12"
      >1 Cor. 3:12</a
    >), by devoting themselves wholly to the Divine service, and who have no
    notable admixture of evil merit, are not subjected to a discussion of their
    merits. Such are those who have entirely renounced the things of the world
    and are solicitously thoughtful of the things that are of God: wherefore
    they will be saved but will not be judged. Others, however, build on the
    foundation of faith, wood, hay, stubble [*Cf. FS, Question [89], Article
    [2]]; they, in fact, love worldly things and are busy about earthly
    concerns, yet so as to prefer nothing to Christ, but strive to redeem their
    sins with alms, and these have an admixture of good with evil merits. Hence
    they are subjected to a discussion of their merits, and consequently in this
    account will be judged, and yet they will be saved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Since punishment is the effect of
    justice, while reward is the effect of mercy, it follows that punishment is
    more especially ascribed antonomastically to judgment which is the act of
    justice; so that judgment is sometimes used to express condemnation. It is
    thus that we are to understand the words quoted, as a gloss on the passage
    remarks.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The merits of the elect will be
    discussed, not to remove the uncertainty of their beatitude from the hearts
    of those who are to be judged, but that it may be made manifest to us that
    their good merits outweigh their evil merits, and thus God's justice be
    proved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Gregory is speaking of the just who will
    still be in mortal flesh, wherefore he had already said: "Those who will
    still be in the body, although already brave and perfect, yet through being
    still in the flesh must needs be troubled with fear in the midst of such a
    whirlwind of terror." Hence it is clear that this fear refers to the time
    immediately before the judgment, most terrible indeed to the wicked, but not
    to the good, who will have no apprehension of evil.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The arguments in the contrary sense consider judgment as regards the payment
    of rewards.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether the wicked will be judged?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that none of the wicked will be
    judged. For even as damnation is certain in the case of unbelievers, so is
    it in the case of those who die in mortal sin. Now it is declared because of
    the certainty of damnation (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++3%3A18"
      >Jn. 3:18</a
    >): "He that believeth not is already judged." Therefore in like manner
    neither will other sinners be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the voice of the Judge is most terrible
    to those who are condemned by His judgment. Now according to the text of
    Sentent. iv, D, 47 and in the words of Gregory (Moral. xxvi) "the Judge will
    not address Himself to unbelievers." If therefore He were to address Himself
    to the believers about to be condemned, the unbelievers would reap a benefit
    from their unbelief, which is absurd.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It would seem that all the wicked are to be
    judged, because all the wicked will be sentenced to punishment according to
    the degree of their guilt. But this cannot be done without a judicial
    pronouncement. Therefore all the wicked will be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judgment as regards the sentencing to
    punishment for sin concerns all the wicked. whereas the judgment as regards
    the discussion of merits concerns only believers. Because in unbelievers the
    foundation of faith is lacking, without which all subsequent works are
    deprived of the perfection of a right intention, so that in them there is no
    admixture of good and evil works or merits requiring discussion. But
    believers in whom the foundation of faith remains, have at least a
    praiseworthy act of faith, which though it is not meritorious without
    charity, yet is in itself directed to merit, and consequently they will be
    subjected to the discussion of merits. Consequently, believers who were at
    least counted as citizens of the City of God will be judged as citizens, and
    sentence of death will not be passed on them without a discussion of their
    merits; whereas unbelievers will be condemned as foes, who are wont among
    men to be exterminated without their merits being discussed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although it is certain that those who
    die in mortal sin will be damned, nevertheless since they have an admixture
    of certain things connected with meriting well, it behooves, for the
    manifestation of Divine justice, that their merits be subjected to
    discussion, in order to make it clear that they are justly banished from the
    city of the saints, of which they appeared outwardly to be citizens.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Considered under this special aspect the
    words addressed to the believers about to be condemned will not be terrible,
    because they will reveal in them certain things pleasing to them, which it
    will be impossible to find in unbelievers, since "without faith it is
    impossible to please God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Heb++11%3A6"
      >Heb. 11:6</a
    >). But the sentence of condemnation which will be passed on them all will
    be terrible to all of them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The argument in the contrary sense considered the judgment of
    retribution.<br />

    Whether at the coming judgment the angels will be judged?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the angels will be judged at
    the coming judgment. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++6%3A3"
      >1 Cor. 6:3</a
    >): "Know you not that we shall judge angels?" But this cannot refer to the
    state of the present time. Therefore it should refer to the judgment to
    come.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written concerning Behemoth or
    Leviathan, whereby the devil is signified (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+40%3A28"
      >Job 40:28</a
    >): "In the sight of all he shall be cast down"; and (Mk. 1:24)* the demon
    cried out to Christ: "Why art Thou come to destroy us before the time?" for,
    according to a gloss, "the demons seeing our Lord on earth thought they were
    to be judged forthwith." [*The reference should be Mt. 8:29: 'Art Thou come
    hither to torment us before the time?' The text of Mark reads: 'Art Thou
    come to destroy us?'] Therefore it would seem that a final judgment is in
    store for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++2%3A4"
      >2 Pt. 2:4</a
    >): "God spared not the angels that sinned, but delivered them drawn down by
    infernal ropes to the lower hell, unto torments, to be reserved unto
    judgment." Therefore it seems that the angels will be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Nahum 1:9) according to the
    Septuagint version: "God will not judge the same thing a second time." But
    the wicked angels are already judged, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++16%3A11"
      >Jn. 16:11</a
    >): "The prince of this world is already judged." Therefore the angels will
    not be judged in the time to come.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, goodness and wickedness are more perfect in the angels than in men
    who are wayfarers. Now some men, good and wicked, will not be judged as
    stated in the text of Sentent. iv, D, 47. Therefore neither will good or
    wicked angels be judged.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The judgment of discussion nowise concerns
    either the good or the wicked angels, since neither is any evil to be found
    in the good angels, nor is any good liable to judgment to be found in the
    wicked angels. But if we speak of the judgment of retribution, we must
    distinguish a twofold retribution. One corresponds to the angels' personal
    merits and was made to both from the beginning when some were raised to
    bliss, and others plunged into the depths of woe. The other corresponds to
    the merits, good or evil, procured through the angels, and this retribution
    will be made in the judgment to come, because the good angels will have an
    increased joy in the salvation of those whom they have prompted to deeds of
    merit, while the wicked will have an increase of torment through the
    manifold downfall of those whom they have incited to evil deeds.
    Consequently the judgment will not regard the angels directly, neither as
    judging nor as judged, but only men; but it will regard the angels
    indirectly somewhat, in so far as they were concerned in men's deeds.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This saying of the Apostle refers to the
    judgment of comparison, because certain men will be found to be placed
    higher than the angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The demons will then be cast down in the
    sight of all because they will be imprisoned for ever in the dungeon of
    hell, so that they will no more be free to go out, since this was permitted
    to them only in so far as they were directed by Divine providence to try the
    life of man.<br />

  <p>The same answer applies to the Third Objection.</p>
