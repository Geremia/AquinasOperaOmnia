<H3 Align="Center">OF THE QUALITIES REQUIRED OF THOSE WHO RECEIVE THIS SACRAMENT (FIVE ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must next consider the qualities required of those who receive the 
sacrament of Order. Under this head there are five points of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP036.html#XPQ36A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether goodness of life is required of those who receive this 
sacrament?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP036.html#XPQ36A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the knowledge of the whole of Sacred Writ is required?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP036.html#XPQ36A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the degree of Orders is obtained by mere merit of life?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP036.html#XPQ36A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether he who raises the unworthy to Orders sins?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP036.html#XPQ36A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether one who is in sin can without committing a sin exercise the 
Order he has received?<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that goodness of life is not required of those who 
receive Orders. For by Orders a man is ordained to the dispensation of 
the sacraments. But the sacraments can be administered by good and 
wicked. Therefore goodness of life is not requisite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the service of God in the sacraments is no greater than 
service offered to Him in the body. Now our Lord did not cast aside the 
sinful and notorious woman from rendering Him a bodily service (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Lk++7">Lk. 7</a>). 
Therefore neither should the like be debarred from His service in the 
sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by every grace a remedy is given against sin. Now those 
who are in sin should not be refused a remedy that may avail them. Since 
then grace is given in the sacrament of order, it would seem that this 
sacrament ought also to be conferred on sinners.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> "Whosoever of the seed of Aaron throughout their 
families hath a blemish, he shall not offer bread to his God neither 
shall he approach to minister to him [*Vulg.: 'Say to Aaron: Whosoever of 
thy seed,'etc.]" (Lev. 21:17,18). Now "blemish signifies all kinds of 
vice" according to a gloss. Therefore he who is shackled by any vice 
should not be admitted to the ministry of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, Jerome commenting on the words of Titus 2:15, "Let no man 
despise thee," says that "not only should bishops, priests, and deacons 
take very great care to be examples of speech and conduct to those over 
whom they are placed, but also the lower grades, and without exception 
all who serve the household of God, since it is most disastrous to the 
Church if the laity be better than the clergy." Therefore holiness of 
life is requisite in all the Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iii), "even as the more 
subtle and clear essences, being filled by the outpouring of the solar 
radiance, like the sun enlighten other bodies with their brilliant light, 
so in all things pertaining to God a man must not dare to become a leader 
of others, unless in all his habits he be most deiform and godlike." 
Wherefore, since in every order a man is appointed to lead others in 
Divine things, he who  being conscious of mortal sin presents himself for 
Orders is guilty of presumption and sins mortally. Consequently holiness 
of life is requisite for Orders, as a matter of precept, but not as 
essential to the sacrament; and if a wicked man be ordained, he receives 
the Order none the less, and yet with sin withal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as the sinner dispenses sacraments validly, so does he 
receive validly the sacrament of Orders, and as he dispenses unworthily, 
even so he receives unworthily.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The service in point consisted only in the exercise of 
bodily homage, which even sinners can offer lawfully. It is different 
with the spiritual service to which the ordained are appointed, because 
thereby they are made to stand between God and the people. Wherefore they 
should shine with a good conscience before God, and with a good name 
before men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Certain medicines require a robust constitution, else it is 
mortally dangerous to take them; others can be given to the weakly. So 
too in spiritual things certain sacraments are ordained as remedies for 
sin, and the like are to be given to sinners, as Baptism and Penance, 
while others, which confer the perfection of grace, require a man made 
strong by grace.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether knowledge of all Holy Writ is required?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that knowledge of all Holy Writ is required. For 
one from whose lips we seek the law, should have knowledge of the law. 
Now the laity seek the law at the mouth of the priest (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Malachi+2:7">Malachi 2:7</a>). 
Therefore he should have knowledge of the whole law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "being always ready to satisfy everyone that asketh you 
a reason of that faith and hope in you [*Vulg.: 'Of that hope which is in 
you; St. Thomas apparently took his reading from Bede]." Now to give a 
reason for things pertaining to faith and hope belongs to those who have 
perfect knowledge of Holy Writ. Therefore the like knowledge should be 
possessed by those who are placed in Orders, and to whom the aforesaid 
words are addressed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one is competent to read what he understands not, 
since to read without intelligence is "negligence,"* as Cato declares 
(Rudiment.). [*"Legere et non intelligere est negligere." The play on the 
words is more evident in Latin.] Now it belongs to the reader (which is 
the lower Order) to read the Old Testament, as stated in the text (Sent. 
iv, D, 24). Therefore he should understand the whole of the Old 
Testament; and much more those in the higher Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Many are raised to the priesthood even who know nothing 
at all of these things, even in many religious Orders. Therefore 
apparently this knowledge is not required.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, we read in the Lives of the Fathers that some who were monks 
were raised to the priesthood, being of a most holy life. Therefore the 
aforesaid knowledge is not required in those to be ordained.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> For any human act to be rightly ordered there must needs 
be the direction of reason. Wherefore in order that a man exercise the 
office of an Order, it is necessary for him to have as much knowledge as 
suffices for his direction in the act of that Order. And consequently one 
who is to be raised to Orders is required to have that knowledge, and to 
be instructed in Sacred Scripture, not the whole, but more or less, 
according as his office is of a greater or lesser extent---to wit, that 
those who are placed over others, and receive the care of souls, know 
things pertaining to the doctrine of faith and morals, and that others 
know whatever concerns the exercise of their Order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A priest exercises a twofold action: the one, which is 
principal, over the true body of Christ; the other, which is secondary, 
over the mystical body of Christ. The second act depends on the first, 
but not conversely. Wherefore some are raised to the priesthood, to whom 
the first act alone is deputed, for instance those religious who are not 
empowered with the care of souls. The law is not sought at the mouth of 
these, they are required only for the celebration of the sacraments; and 
consequently it is enough for them to have such knowledge as enables them 
to observe rightly those things that regard the celebration of the 
sacrament. Others are raised to exercise the other act which is over the 
mystical body of Christ, and it is at the mouth of these that the people 
seek the law; wherefore they ought to possess knowledge of the law, not 
indeed to know all the difficult points of the law (for in these they 
should have recourse to their superiors), but to know what the people 
have to believe and fulfill in the law. To the higher priests, namely the 
bishops, it belongs to know even those points of the law which may offer 
some difficulty, and to know them the more perfectly according as they 
are in a higher position.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reason that we have to give for our faith and hope does 
not denote one that suffices to prove matters of faith and hope, since 
they are both of things invisible; it means that we should be able to 
give general proofs of the probability of both, and for this there is not 
much need of great knowledge.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The reader has not to explain Holy Writ to the people (for 
this belongs to the higher orders), but merely to voice the words. 
Therefore he is not required to have so much knowledge as to understand 
Holy Writ, but only to know how to pronounce it correctly. And since such 
knowledge is obtained easily and from many persons, it may be supposed 
with probability that the ordained will acquire that knowledge even if he 
have it not already, especially if it appear that he is on the road to 
acquire it.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man obtains the degrees of Order by the merit of one's life?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man obtains the degrees of order by the mere 
merit of his life. For, according to Chrysostom [*Hom. xliii in the Opus 
Imperfectum, wrongly ascribed to St. John Chrysostom], "not every priest 
is a saint, but every saint is a priest." Now a man becomes a saint by 
the merit of his life. Consequently he thereby also becomes a priest, and 
"a fortiori" has he the other Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in natural things, men obtain a higher degree from the 
very fact that they are near God, and have a greater share of His favors, 
as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. iv). Now it is by merit of holiness and 
knowledge that a man approaches nearer to God and receives more of His 
favors. Therefore by this alone he is raised to the degree of Orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Holiness once possessed can be lost. But when once a 
man is ordained he never loses his order. Therefore order does not 
consist in the mere merit of holiness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A cause should be proportionate to its effect. And 
consequently as in Christ, from Whom grace comes down on all men, there 
must needs be fulness of grace; so in the ministers of the Church, to 
whom it belongs, not to give grace, but to give the sacraments of grace, 
the degree of order does not result from their having grace, but from 
their participating in a sacrament of grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Chrysostom is speaking of the priest in reference to the 
reason for which he is so called, the word "sacerdos" signifying 
dispenser of holy things [sacra dans]: for in this sense every righteous 
man, in so far as he assists others by the sacraments, may be called a 
priest. But he is not speaking according to the actual meaning of the 
words; for this word "sacerdos" [priest] is employed to signify one who 
gives sacred things by dispensing the sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Natural things acquire a degree of superiority over others, 
from the fact that they are able to act on them by virtue of their form; 
wherefore from the very fact that they have a higher form, they obtain a 
higher degree. But the ministers of the Church are placed over others, 
not to confer anything on them by virtue of their own holiness (for this 
belongs to God alone), but as ministers, and as instruments, so to say, 
of the outpouring from the Head to the members. Hence the comparison 
fails as regards the dignity of Order, although it applies as to 
congruity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether he who raises the unworthy to Orders commits a sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that he who raises the unworthy to orders commits 
no sin. For a bishop needs assistants appointed to the lesser offices. 
But he would be unable to find them in sufficient  number, if he were to 
require of them such qualifications as the saints enumerate. Therefore if 
he raise some who are not qualified, he would seem to be excusable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Church needs not only ministers for the dispensation 
of things spiritual, but also for the supervision of temporalities. But 
sometimes men without knowledge or holiness of life may be useful for the 
conduct of temporal affairs, either because of their worldly power, or on 
account of their natural industry. Therefore seemingly the like can be 
promoted without sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, everyone is bound to avoid sin, as far as he can. If 
therefore a bishop sins in promoting the unworthy, he is bound to take 
the utmost pains to know whether those who present themselves for Orders 
be worthy, by making a careful inquiry about their morals and knowledge, 
and yet seemingly this is not done anywhere.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is worse to raise the wicked to the sacred ministry, 
than not to correct those who are raised already. But Heli sinned 
mortally by not correcting his sons for their wickedness; wherefore "he 
fell backwards . . . and died" (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Sam++4:18">1 Kgs. 4:18</a>). Therefore he who promotes 
the unworthy does not escape sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, spiritual things must be set before temporal things in the 
Church. Now a man would commit a mortal sin were he knowingly to endanger 
the temporalities of the Church. Much more therefore is it a mortal sin 
to endanger spiritual things. But whoever promotes the unworthy endangers 
spiritual things, since according to Gregory (Hom. xii in Evang.) "if a 
man's life is contemptible, his preaching is liable to be despised"; and 
for the same reason all the spiritual things that he dispenses. Therefore 
he who promotes the unworthy sins mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Our Lord describes the faithful servant whom He has set 
"over His household to give them their measure of wheat." Hence he is 
guilty of unfaithfulness who gives any man Divine things above his 
measure: and whoso promotes the unworthy does this. Wherefore he commits 
a mortal crime, as being unfaithful to his sovereign Lord, especially 
since this is detrimental to the Church and to the Divine honor which is 
promoted by good ministers. For a man would be unfaithful to his earthly 
lord were he to place unworthy subjects in his offices.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God never so abandons His Church that apt ministers are not 
to be found sufficient for the needs of the people, if the worthy be 
promoted and the unworthy set aside. And though it were impossible to 
find as many ministers as there are now, it were better to have few good 
ministers than many bad ones, as the blessed Clement declares in his 
second epistle to James the brother of the Lord.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Temporal things are not to be sought but for the sake of 
spiritual things. Wherefore all temporal advantage should  count for 
nothing, and all gain be despised for the advancement of spiritual good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is at least required that the ordainer know that nothing 
contrary to holiness is in the candidate for ordination. But besides this 
he is required to take the greatest care, in proportion to the Order or 
office to be enjoined, so as to be certain of the qualifications of those 
to be promoted, at least from the testification of others. This is the 
meaning of the Apostle when he says (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Tim++5:22">1 Tim. 5:22</a>): "Impose not hands 
lightly on any man."<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one who is in sin can without sin exercise the 
order he has received. For since, by virtue of his office, he is bound to 
exercise his order, he sins if he fails to do so. If therefore he sins by

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a dispensation is a relaxation of the law. Therefore

has received, it would be lawful for him to do so by dispensation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever co-operates with another in a mortal sin, sins

who receives or demands any Divine thing from him also sins mortally: and 
this seems absurd.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if he sins by exercising his order, it follows that 
every act of his order that he performs is a mortal sin; and consequently 
since many acts concur in the one exercise of his order, it would seem 
that he commits many mortal sins: which seems very hard.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Dionysius says (Ep. ad Demophil.): "It seems 
presumptuous for such a man, one to wit who is not enlightened, to lay 
hands on priestly things; he is not afraid nor ashamed, all unworthy that 
he is to take part in Divine things, with the thought that God does not 
see what he sees in himself; he thinks, by false pretense, to cheat Him 
Whom he falsely calls his Father; he dares to utter in the person of 
Christ, words polluted by his infamy, I will not call them prayers, over 
the Divine symbols." Therefore a priest is a blasphemer and a cheat if he 
exercises his order unworthily, and thus he sins mortally: and in like 
manner any other person in orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, holiness of life is required in one who receives an order, that 
he may be qualified to exercise it. Now a man sins mortally if he present 
himself for orders in mortal sin. Much more therefore does he sin 
mortally whenever he exercises his order. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The law prescribes (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?Dt++16:20">Dt. 16:20</a>) that "man should follow 
justly after that which is just." Wherefore whoever fulfills unworthily 
the duties of his order follows unjustly after that which is just, and 
acts contrary to a precept of the law, and thereby sins mortally. Now 
anyone who exercises a sacred office in mortal sin, without doubt does so 
unworthily. Hence it is clear that he sins mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He is not perplexed as though he were in the necessity of 
sinning; for he can renounce his sin, or resign his office whereby he was 
bound to the exercise of his order.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The natural law allows of no dispensation; and it is of 
natural law that man handle holy things holily. Therefore no one can 
dispense from this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> So long as a minister of the Church who is in mortal sin is 
recognized by the Church, his subject must receive the sacraments from 
him, since this is the purpose for which he is bound to him. 
Nevertheless, outside the case of necessity, it would not be safe to 
induce him to an execution of his Order, as long as he is conscious of 
being in mortal sin, which conscience, however, he can lay aside since a 
man is repaired in an instant by Divine grace.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[36] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> When any man performs an action as a minister of the Church 
while in a state of mortal sin, he sins mortally, and as often as he 
performs that action, since, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. i), "it is 
wrong for the unclean even to touch the symbols," i.e. the sacramental 
signs. Hence when they touch sacred things in the exercise of their 
office they sin mortally. It would be otherwise if they were to touch 
some sacred thing or perform some sacred duty in a case of necessity, 
when it would be allowable even to a layman, for instance if they were to 
baptize in a case of urgency, or gather up the Lord's body should it be 
cast to the ground.<br>
