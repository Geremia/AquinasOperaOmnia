    OF THE MARRIAGE GOODS* (SIX ARTICLES) [*"Bona matrimonii," variously
    rendered marriage goods, marriage blessings, and advantages of marriage.]<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider the marriage goods. Under this head there
    are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether certain goods are
    necessary in order to excuse marriage?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether those assigned are
    sufficient?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the sacrament is the
    principal among the goods?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether the marriage act is
    excused from sin by the aforesaid goods?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether it can ever be excused
    from sin without them?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether in their absence it is
    always a mortal sin?

    Whether certain blessings are necessary in order to excuse marriage?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that certain blessings are not
    necessary in order to excuse marriage. For just as the preservation of the
    individual which is effected by the nutritive power is intended by nature,
    so too is the preservation of the species which is effected by marriage; and
    indeed so much the more as the good of the species is better and more
    exalted than the good of the individual. But no goods are necessary to
    excuse the act of the nutritive power. Neither therefore are they necessary
    to excuse marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    viii, 12) the friendship between husband and wife is natural, and includes
    the virtuous, the useful, and the pleasant. But that which is virtuous in
    itself needs no excuse. Therefore neither should any goods be assigned for
    the excuse of matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, matrimony was instituted as a remedy and
    as an office, as stated above (<a href="XP042.html#XPQ42OUTP1"
      >Question [42]</a
    >, <a href="XP042.html#XPQ42A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Now it needs no
    excuse in so far as it is instituted as an office, since then it would also
    have needed an excuse in paradise, which is false, for there, as Augustine
    says, "marriage would have been without reproach and the marriage-bed
    without stain" (Gen. ad lit. ix). In like manner neither does it need an
    excuse in so far as it is intended as a remedy, any more than the other
    sacraments which were instituted as remedies for sin. Therefore matrimony
    does not need these excuses.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the virtues are directed to whatever can
    be done aright. If then marriage can be righted by certain goods, it needs
    nothing else to right it besides the virtues of the soul; and consequently
    there is no need to assign to matrimony any goods whereby it is righted, any
    more than to other things in which the virtues direct us.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Wherever there is indulgence, there must
    needs be some reason for excuse. Now marriage is allowed in the state of
    infirmity "by indulgence" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A6"
      >1 Cor. 7:6</a
    >). Therefore it needs to be excused by certain goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the intercourse of fornication and that of marriage are of the same
    species as regards the species of nature. But the intercourse of fornication
    is wrong in itself. Therefore, in order that the marriage intercourse be not
    wrong, something must be added to it to make it right, and draw it to
    another moral species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> No wise man should allow himself to lose a
    thing except for some compensation in the shape of an equal or better good.
    Wherefore for a thing that has a loss attached to it to be eligible, it
    needs to have some good connected with it, which by compensating for that
    loss makes that thing ordinate and right. Now there is a loss of reason
    incidental to the union of man and woman, both because the reason is carried
    away entirely on account of the vehemence of the pleasure, so that it is
    unable to understand anything at the same time, as the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. vii, 11); and again because of the tribulation of the flesh which
    such persons have to suffer from solicitude for temporal things (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A28"
      >1 Cor. 7:28</a
    >). Consequently the choice of this union cannot be made ordinate except by
    certain compensations whereby that same union is righted. and these are the
    goods which excuse marriage and make it right.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In the act of eating there is not such
    an intense pleasure overpowering the reason as in the aforesaid action, both
    because the generative power, whereby original sin is transmitted, is
    infected and corrupt, whereas the nutritive power, by which original sin is
    not transmitted, is neither corrupt nor infected; and again because each one
    feels in himself a defect of the individual more than a defect of the
    species. Hence, in order to entice a man to take food which supplies a
    defect of the individual, it is enough that he feel this defect; but in
    order to entice him to the act whereby a defect of the species is remedied,
    Divine providence attached pleasure to that act, which moves even irrational
    animals in which there is not the stain of original sin. Hence the
    comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> These goods which justify marriage
    belong to the nature of marriage, which consequently needs them, not as
    extrinsic causes of its rectitude, but as causing in it that rectitude which
    belongs to it by nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the very fact that marriage is
    intended as an office or as a remedy it has the aspect of something useful
    and right; nevertheless both aspects belong to it from the fact that it has
    these goods by which it fulfills the office and affords a remedy to
    concupiscence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> An act of virtue may derive its
    rectitude both from the virtue as its elicitive principle, and from its
    circumstances as its formal principles; and the goods of marriage are
    related to marriage as circumstances to an act of virtue which owes it to
    those circumstances that it can be an act of virtue.<br />

    Whether the goods of marriage are sufficiently enumerated?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the goods of marriage are
    insufficiently enumerated by the Master (Sent. iv, D, 31), namely "faith,
    offspring, and sacrament." For the object of marriage among men is not only
    the begetting and feeding of children, but also the partnership of a common
    life, whereby each one contributes his share of work to the common stock, as
    stated in Ethic. viii, 12. Therefore as the offspring is reckoned a good of
    matrimony, so also should the communication of works.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the union of Christ with the Church,
    signified by matrimony, is the effect of charity. Therefore charity rather
    than faith should be reckoned among the goods of matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in matrimony, just as it is required
    that neither party have intercourse with another, so is it required that the
    one pay the marriage debt to the other. Now the former pertains to faith
    according to the Master (Sent. iv, D, 31). Therefore justice should also be
    reckoned among the goods of marriage on account of the payment of the
    debt.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in matrimony as signifying the union of
    Christ with the Church, just as indivisibility is required, so also is
    unity, whereby one man has one wife. But the sacrament which is reckoned
    among the three marriage goods pertains to indivisibility. Therefore there
    should be something else pertaining to unity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> On the other hand, it would seem that they are
    too many. For one virtue suffices to make one act right. Now faith is one
    virtue. Therefore it was not necessary to add two other goods to make
    marriage right.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, the same cause does not make a thing
    both useful and virtuous, since the useful and the virtuous are opposite
    divisions of the good. Now marriage derives its character of useful from the
    offspring. Therefore the offspring should not be reckoned among the goods
    that make marriage virtuous.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, nothing should be reckoned as a property
    or condition of itself. Now these goods are reckoned to be conditions of
    marriage. Therefore since matrimony is a sacrament, the sacrament should not
    be reckoned a condition of matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Matrimony is instituted both as an office of
    nature and as a sacrament of the Church. As an office of nature it is
    directed by two things, like every other virtuous act. one of these is
    required on the part of the agent and is the intention of the due end, and
    thus the "offspring" is accounted a good of matrimony; the other is required
    on the part of the act, which is good generically through being about a due
    matter; and thus we have "faith," whereby a man has intercourse with his
    wife and with no other woman. Besides this it has a certain goodness as a
    sacrament, and this is signified by the very word "sacrament."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Offspring signifies not only the
    begetting of children, but also their education, to which as its end is
    directed the entire communion of works that exists between man and wife as
    united in marriage, since parents naturally "lay up" for their "children"
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A14"
      >2 Cor. 12:14</a
    >); so that the offspring like a principal end includes another, as it were,
    secondary end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Faith is not taken here as a theological
    virtue, but as part of justice, in so far as faith [fides] signifies the
    suiting of deed to word [fiant dicta] by keeping one's promises; for since
    marriage is a contract it contains a promise whereby this man is assigned to
    this woman.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Just as the marriage promise means that
    neither party is to have intercourse with a third party, so does it require
    that they should mutually pay the marriage debt. The latter is indeed the
    chief of the two, since it follows from the power which each receives over
    the other. Consequently both these things pertain to faith, although the
    Book of Sentences mentions that which is the less manifest.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> By sacrament we are to understand not
    only indivisibility, but all those things that result from marriage being a
    sign of Christ's union with the Church. We may also reply that the unity to
    which the objection refers pertains to faith, just as indivisibility belongs
    to the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Faith here does not denote a virtue, but
    that condition of virtue which is a part of justice and is called by the
    name of faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Just as the right use of a useful good
    derives its rectitude not from the useful but from the reason which causes
    the right use, so too direction to a useful good may cause the goodness of
    rectitude by virtue of the reason causing the right direction; and in this
    way marriage, through being directed to the offspring, is useful, and
    nevertheless righteous, inasmuch as it is directed aright.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> As the Master says (Sent. iv, D, 31),
    sacrament here does not mean matrimony itself, but its indissolubility,
    which is a sign of the same thing as matrimony is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that although marriage is a sacrament, marriage as
    marriage is not the same as marriage as a sacrament, since it was instituted
    not only as a sign of a sacred thing, but also as an office of nature. Hence
    the sacramental aspect is a condition added to marriage considered in
    itself, whence also it derives its rectitude. Hence its sacramentality, if I
    may use the term, is reckoned among the goods which justify marriage; and
    accordingly this third good of marriage, the sacrament to wit, denotes not
    only its indissolubility, but also whatever pertains to its
    signification.<br />

    Whether the sacrament is the chief of the marriage goods?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the "sacrament" is not the
    chief of the marriage goods. For the end is principal in everything. Now the
    end of marriage is the offspring. Therefore the offspring is the chief
    marriage good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in the specific nature the difference is
    more important than the genus, even as the form is more important than
    matter in the composition of a natural thing. Now "sacrament" refers to
    marriage on the part of its genus, while "offspring" and "faith" refer
    thereto on the part of the difference whereby it is a special kind of
    sacrament. Therefore these other two are more important than sacrament in
    reference to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as we find marriage without
    "offspring" and without "faith," so do we find it without indissolubility,
    as in the case where one of the parties enters religion before the marriage
    is consummated. Therefore neither from this point of view is "sacrament" the
    most important marriage good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, an effect cannot be more important than
    its cause. Now consent, which is the cause of matrimony, is often changed.
    Therefore the marriage also can be dissolved and consequently inseparability
    is not always a condition of marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the sacraments which produce an
    everlasting effect imprint a character. But no character is imprinted in
    matrimony. Therefore it is not conditioned by a lasting inseparability.
    Consequently just as there is marriage without "offspring" so is there
    marriage without "sacrament," and thus the same conclusion follows as
    above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> That which has a place in the definition of a
    thing is most essential thereto. Now inseparability, which pertains to
    sacrament, is placed in the definition of marriage (<a
      href="XP044.html#XPQ44OUTP1"
      >Question [44]</a
    >, <a href="XP044.html#XPQ44A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), while offspring and
    faith are not. Therefore among the other goods sacrament is the most
    essential to matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the Divine power which works in the sacraments is more efficacious
    than human power. But "offspring" and "faith" pertain to matrimony as
    directed to an office of human nature, whereas "sacrament" pertains to it as
    instituted by God. Therefore sacrament takes a more important part in
    marriage than the other two.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This or that may be more important to a thing
    in two ways, either because it is more essential or because it is more
    excellent. If the reason is because it is more excellent, then "sacrament"
    is in every way the most important of the three marriage goods, since it
    belongs to marriage considered as a sacrament of grace; while the other two
    belong to it as an office of nature; and a perfection of grace is more
    excellent than a perfection of nature. If, however, it is said to be more
    important because it is more essential, we must draw a distinction; for
    "faith" and "offspring" can be considered in two ways. First, in themselves,
    and thus they regard the use of matrimony in begetting children and
    observing the marriage compact; while inseparability, which is denoted by
    "sacrament," regards the very sacrament considered in itself, since from the
    very fact that by the marriage compact man and wife give to one another
    power the one over the other in perpetuity, it follows that they cannot be
    put asunder. Hence there is no matrimony without inseparability, whereas
    there is matrimony without "faith" and "offspring," because the existence of
    a thing does not depend on its use; and in this sense "sacrament" is more
    essential to matrimony than "faith" and "offspring." Secondly, "faith" and
    "offspring" may be considered as in their principles, so that "offspring"
    denote the intention of having children, and "faith" the duty of remaining
    faithful, and there can be no matrimony without these also, since they are
    caused in matrimony by the marriage compact itself, so that if anything
    contrary to these were expressed in the consent which makes a marriage, the
    marriage would be invalid. Taking "faith" and "offspring" in this sense, it
    is clear that "offspring" is the most essential thing in marriage, secondly
    "faith," and thirdly "sacrament"; even as to man it is more essential to be
    in nature than to be in grace, although it is more excellent to be in
    grace.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The end as regards the intention stands
    first in a thing, but as regards the attainment it stands last. It is the
    same with "offspring" among the marriage goods; wherefore in a way it is the
    most important and in another way it is not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sacrament, even as holding the third
    place among the marriage goods, belongs to matrimony by reason of its
    difference; for it is called "sacrament" from its signification of that
    particular sacred thing which matrimony signifies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> According to Augustine (De Bono Conjug.
    ix), marriage is a good of mortals, wherefore in the resurrection "they
    shall neither marry nor be married" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++22%3A30"
      >Mt. 22:30</a
    >). Hence the marriage bond does not last after the life wherein it is
    contracted, and consequently it is said to be inseparable, because it cannot
    be sundered in this life, but either by bodily death after carnal union, or
    by spiritual death after a merely spiritual union.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although the consent which makes a
    marriage is not everlasting materially, i.e. in regard to the substance of
    the act, since that act ceases and a contrary act may succeed it,
    nevertheless formally speaking it is everlasting, because it is a consent to
    an ever lasting bond, else it would not make a marriage, for a consent to
    take a woman for a time makes no marriage. Hence it is everlasting formally,
    inasmuch as an act takes its species from its object; and thus it is that
    matrimony derives its inseparability from the consent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> In those sacraments wherein a character
    is imprinted, power is given to perform spiritual actions; but in matrimony,
    to perform bodily actions. Wherefore matrimony by reason of the power which
    man and wife receive over one another agrees with the sacraments in which a
    character is imprinted, and from this it derives its inseparability, as the
    Master says (Sent. iv, D, 31); yet it differs from them in so far as that
    power regards bodily acts; hence it does not confer a spiritual
    character.<br />

    Whether the marriage act is excused by the aforesaid goods?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the marriage act cannot be
    altogether excused from sin by the aforesaid goods. For whoever allows
    himself to lose a greater good for the sake of a lesser good sins because he
    allows it inordinately. Now the good of reason which is prejudiced in the
    marriage act is greater than these three marriage goods. Therefore the
    aforesaid goods do not suffice to excuse marriage intercourse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a moral good be added to a moral evil
    the sum total is evil and not good, since one evil circumstance makes an
    action evil, whereas one good circumstance does not make it good. Now the
    marriage act is evil in itself, else it would need no excuse. Therefore the
    addition of the marriage goods cannot make the act good.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, wherever there is immoderate passion
    there is moral vice. Now the marriage goods cannot prevent the pleasure in
    that act from being immoderate. Therefore they cannot excuse it from being a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, according to Damascene (De Fide Orth.
    ii, 15), shame is only caused by a disgraceful deed. Now the marriage goods
    do not deprive that deed of its shame. Therefore they cannot excuse it from
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The marriage act differs not from fornication
    except by the marriage goods. If therefore these were not sufficient to
    excuse it marriage would be always unlawful; and this is contrary to what
    was stated above (<a href="XP041.html#XPQ41OUTP1">Question [41]</a>,
    <a href="XP041.html#XPQ41A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the marriage goods are related to its act as its due circumstances,
    as stated above (<a href="XP049.html#XPQ49A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 4).
    Now the like circumstances are sufficient to prevent an action from being
    evil. Therefore these goods can excuse marriage so that it is nowise a
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> An act is said to be excused in two ways.
    First, on the part of the agent, so that although it be evil it is not
    imputed as sin to the agent, or at least not as so grave a sin. thus
    ignorance is said to excuse a sin wholly or partly. Secondly, an act is said
    to be excused on its part, so that, namely, it is not evil; and it is thus
    that the aforesaid goods are said to excuse the marriage act. Now it is from
    the same cause that an act is not morally evil, and that it is good, since
    there is no such thing as an indifferent act, as was stated in the Second
    Book (Sent. ii, D, 40; FS,
    <a href="XP018.html#XPQ18OUTP1">Question [18]</a>,
    <a href="XP018.html#XPQ18A9THEP1">Article [9]</a>). Now a human act is said
    to be good in two ways. In one way by goodness of virtue, and thus an act
    derives its goodness from those things which place it in the mean. This is
    what "faith" and "offspring" do in the marriage act, as stated above (<a
      href="XP049.html#XPQ49A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >). In another way, by goodness of the "sacrament," in which way an act is
    said to be not only good, but also holy, and the marriage act derives this
    goodness from the indissolubility of the union, in respect of which it
    signifies the union of Christ with the Church. Thus it is clear that the
    aforesaid goods sufficiently excuse the marriage act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> By the marriage act man does not incur
    harm to his reason as to habit, but only as to act. Nor is it unfitting that
    a certain act which is generically better be sometimes interrupted for some
    less good act; for it is possible to do this without sin, as in the case of
    one who ceases from the act of contemplation in order meanwhile to devote
    himself to action.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This argument would avail if the evil
    that is inseparable from carnal intercourse were an evil of sin. But in this
    case it is an evil not of sin but of punishment alone, consisting in the
    rebellion of concupiscence against reason; and consequently the conclusion
    does not follow.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The excess of passion that amounts to a
    sin does not refer to the passion's quantitative intensity, but to its
    proportion to reason; wherefore it is only when a passion goes beyond the
    bounds of reason that it is reckoned to be immoderate. Now the pleasure
    attaching to the marriage act, while it is most intense in point of
    quantity, does not go beyond the bounds previously appointed by reason
    before the commencement of the act, although reason is unable to regulate
    them during the pleasure itself.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The turpitude that always accompanies
    the marriage act and always causes shame is the turpitude of punishment, not
    of sin, for man is naturally ashamed of any defect.<br />

    Whether the marriage act can be excused without the marriage goods?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the marriage act can be
    excused even without the marriage goods. For he who is moved by nature alone
    to the marriage act, apparently does not intend any of the marriage goods,
    since the marriage goods pertain to grace or virtue. Yet when a person is
    moved to the aforesaid act by the natural appetite alone, seemingly he
    commits no sin, for nothing natural is an evil, since "evil is contrary to
    nature and order," as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. iv). Therefore the marriage
    act can be excused even without the marriage goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who has intercourse with his wife in
    order to avoid fornication, does not seemingly intend any of the marriage
    goods. Yet he does not sin apparently, because marriage was granted to human
    weakness for the very purpose of avoiding fornication (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7%3A2,6"
      >1 Cor. 7:2,6</a
    >). Therefore the marriage act can be excused even without the marriage
    goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, he who uses as he will that which is his
    own does not act against justice, and thus seemingly does not sin. Now
    marriage makes the wife the husband's own, and "vice versa." Therefore, if
    they use one another at will through the instigation of lust, it would seem
    that it is no sin; and thus the same conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that which is good generically does not
    become evil unless it be done with an evil intention. Now the marriage act
    whereby a husband knows his wife is generically good. Therefore it cannot be
    evil unless it be done with an evil intention. Now it can be done with a
    good intention, even without intending any marriage good, for instance by
    intending to keep or acquire bodily health. Therefore it seems that this act
    can be excused even without the marriage goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> If the cause be removed the effect is
    removed. Now the marriage goods are the cause of rectitude in the marriage
    act. Therefore the marriage act cannot be excused without them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the aforesaid act does not differ from the act of fornication
    except in the aforesaid goods. But the act of fornication is always evil.
    Therefore the marriage act also will always be evil unless it be excused by
    the aforesaid goods.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as the marriage goods, in so far as they
    consist in a habit, make a marriage honest and holy, so too, in so far as
    they are in the actual intention, they make the marriage act honest, as
    regards those two marriage goods which relate to the marriage act. Hence
    when married persons come together for the purpose of begetting children, or
    of paying the debt to one another (which pertains to "faith") they are
    wholly excused from sin. But the third good does not relate to the use of
    marriage, but to its excuse, as stated above (<a
      href="XP049.html#XPQ49A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >); wherefore it makes marriage itself honest, but not its act, as though
    its act were wholly excused from sin, through being done on account of some
    signification. Consequently there are only two ways in which married persons
    can come together without any sin at all, namely in order to have offspring,
    and in order to pay the debt; otherwise, it is always at least a venial
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The offspring considered as a marriage
    good includes something besides the offspring as a good intended by nature.
    For nature intends offspring as safeguarding the good of the species,
    whereas the offspring as a good of the sacrament of marriage includes
    besides this the directing of the child to God. Wherefore the intention of
    nature which intends the offspring must needs be referred either actually or
    habitually to the intention of having an offspring, as a good of the
    sacrament: otherwise the intention would go no further than a creature; and
    this is always a sin. Consequently whenever nature alone moves a person to
    the marriage act, he is not wholly excused from sin, except in so far as the
    movement of nature is further directed actually or habitually to the
    offspring as a good of the sacrament. Nor does it follow that the
    instigation of nature is evil, but that it is imperfect unless it be further
    directed to some marriage good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> If a man intends by the marriage act to
    prevent fornication in his wife, it is no sin, because this is a kind of
    payment of the debt that comes under the good of "faith." But if he intends
    to avoid fornication in himself, then there is a certain superfluity, and
    accordingly there is a venial sin, nor was the sacrament instituted for that
    purpose, except by indulgence, which regards venial sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> One due circumstance does not suffice to
    make a good act, and consequently it does not follow that, no matter how one
    use one's own property, the use is good, but when one uses it as one ought
    according to all the circumstances.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although it is not evil in itself to
    intend to keep oneself in good health, this intention becomes evil, if one
    intend health by means of something that is not naturally ordained for that
    purpose; for instance if one sought only bodily health by the sacrament of
    baptism, and the same applies to the marriage act in the question at
    issue.<br />

    Whether it is a mortal sin for a man to have knowledge of his wife, with the
    intention not of a marriage good but merely of pleasure?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that whenever a man has knowledge
    of his wife, with the intention not of a marriage good but merely of
    pleasure, he commits a mortal sin. For according to Jerome (Comment. in Eph.
    5:25), as quoted in the text (Sent. iv, D, 31), "the pleasure taken in the
    embraces of a wanton is damnable in a husband." Now nothing but mortal sin
    is said to be damnable. Therefore it is always a mortal sin to have
    knowledge of one's wife for mere pleasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, consent to pleasure is a mortal sin, as
    stated in the Second Book (Sent. ii, D, 24). Now whoever knows his wife for
    the sake of pleasure consents to the pleasure. Therefore he sins
    mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, whoever fails to refer the use of a
    creature to God enjoys a creature, and this is a mortal sin. But whoever
    uses his wife for mere pleasure does not refer that use to God. Therefore he
    sins mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no one should be excommunicated except
    for a mortal sin. Now according to the text (Sent. ii, D, 24) a man who
    knows his wife for mere pleasure is debarred from entering the Church, as
    though he were excommunicate. Therefore every such man sins mortally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> As stated in the text (Sent. ii, D, 24),
    according to Augustine (Contra Jul. ii, 10; De Decem Chord. xi; Serm. xli,
    de Sanct.), carnal intercourse of this kind is one of the daily sins, for
    which we say the "Our Father." Now these are not mortal sins. Therefore,
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is no mortal sin to take food for mere pleasure. Therefore in
    like manner it is not a mortal sin for a man to use his wife merely to
    satisfy his desire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some say that whenever pleasure is the chief
    motive for the marriage act it is a mortal sin; that when it is an indirect
    motive it is a venial sin; and that when it spurns the pleasure altogether
    and is displeasing, it is wholly void of venial sin; so that it would be a
    mortal sin to seek pleasure in this act, a venial sin to take the pleasure
    when offered, but that perfection requires one to detest it. But this is
    impossible, since according to the Philosopher (Ethic. x, 3,4) the same
    judgment applies to pleasure as to action, because pleasure in a good action
    is good, and in an evil action, evil; wherefore, as the marriage act is not
    evil in itself, neither will it be always a mortal sin to seek pleasure
    therein. Consequently the right answer to this question is that if pleasure
    be sought in such a way as to exclude the honesty of marriage, so that, to
    wit, it is not as a wife but as a woman that a man treats his wife, and that
    he is ready to use her in the same way if she were not his wife, it is a
    mortal sin; wherefore such a man is said to be too ardent a lover of his
    wife, because his ardor carries him away from the goods of marriage. If,
    however, he seek pleasure within the bounds of marriage, so that it would
    not be sought in another than his wife, it is a venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man seeks wanton pleasure in his wife
    when he sees no more in her that he would in a wanton.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Consent to the pleasure of the
    intercourse that is a mortal sin is itself a mortal sin; but such is not the
    consent to the marriage act.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although he does not actually refer the
    pleasure to God, he does not place his will's last end therein; otherwise he
    would seek it anywhere indifferently. Hence it does not follow that he
    enjoys a creature; but he uses a creature actually for his own sake, and
    himself habitually, though not actually, for God's sake.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The reason for this statement is not
    that man deserves to be excommunicated for this sin, but because he renders
    himself unfit for spiritual things, since in that act, he becomes flesh and
    nothing more.<br />
