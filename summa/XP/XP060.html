    Whether it is lawful for a man to kill his wife if she be discovered in the
    act of adultery?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem lawful for a man to kill his wife
    if she be discovered in the act of adultery. For the Divine law commanded
    adulterous wives to be stoned. Now it is not a sin to fulfill the Divine
    law. Neither therefore is it a sin to kill one's own wife if she be an
    adulteress.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which the law can rightly do, can
    be rightly done by one whom the law has commissioned to do it. But the law
    can rightly kill an adulterous wife or any other person deserving of death.
    Since then the law has commissioned the husband to kill his wife if she be
    discovered in the act of adultery, it would seem that he can rightly do
    so.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the husband has greater power over his
    adulterous wife than over the man who committed adultery with her. Now if
    the husband strike a cleric whom he found with his wife he is not
    excommunicated. Therefore it would seem lawful for him even to kill his own
    wife if she be discovered in adultery.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the husband is bound to correct his
    wife. But correction is given by inflicting a just punishment. Since then
    the just punishment of adultery is death, because it is a capital sin, it
    would seem lawful for a husband to kill his adulterous wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 37)
    that "the Church of God is never bound by the laws of this world, for she
    has none but a spiritual sword." Therefore it would seem that he who wishes
    to belong to the Church cannot rightly take advantage of the law which
    permits a man to kill his wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, husband and wife are judged on a par. But it is not lawful for a
    wife to kill her husband if he be discovered in adultery. Neither therefore
    may a husband kill his wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It happens in two ways that a husband kills his
    wife. First, by a civil judgment; and thus there is no doubt that a husband,
    moved by zeal for justice and not by vindictive anger or hatred can, without
    sin, bring a criminal accusation of adultery upon his wife before a secular
    court, and demand that she receive capital punishment as appointed by the
    law; just as it is lawful to accuse a person of murder or any other crime.
    Such an accusation however cannot be made in an ecclesiastical court,
    because, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 37), the Church does not wield
    a material sword. Secondly, a husband can kill his wife himself without her
    being convicted in court, and thus to kill her outside of the act of
    adultery is not lawful, neither according to civil law nor according to the
    law of conscience, whatever evidence he may have of her adultery. The civil
    law however considers it, as though it were lawful, that he should kill her
    in the very act, not by commanding him to do so, but by not inflicting on
    him the punishment for murder, on account of the very great provocation
    which the husband receives by such a deed to kill his wife. But the Church
    is not bound in this matter by human laws, neither does she acquit him of
    the debt of eternal punishment, nor of such punishment as may be awarded him
    by an ecclesiastical tribunal for the reason that he is quit of any
    punishment to be inflicted by a secular court. Therefore in no case is it
    lawful for a husband to kill his wife on his own authority.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The law has committed the infliction of
    this punishment not to private individuals, but to public persons, who are
    deputed to this by their office. Now the husband is not his wife's judge:
    wherefore he may not kill her, but may accuse her in the judge's
    presence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The civil law has not commissioned the
    husband to kill his wife by commanding him to do so, for thus he would not
    sin, just as the judge's deputy does not sin by killing the thief condemned
    to death: but it has permitted this by not punishing it. For which reason it
    has raised certain obstacles to prevent the husband from killing his
    wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This does not prove that it is lawful
    simply, but that it is lawful as regards immunity from a particular kind of
    punishment, since excommunication is also a kind of punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There are two kinds of community: the
    household, such as a family; and the civil community, such as a city or
    kingdom. Accordingly, he who presides over the latter kind of community, a
    king for instance, can punish an individual both by correcting and by
    exterminating him, for the betterment of the community with whose care he is
    charged. But he who presides over a community of the first kind, can inflict
    only corrective punishment, which does not extend beyond the limits of
    amendment, and these are exceeded by the punishment of death. Wherefore the
    husband who exercises this kind of control over his wife may not kill her,
    but he may accuse or chastise her in some other way.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether wife-murder is an impediment to marriage?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that wife-murder is not an
    impediment to marriage. For adultery is more directly opposed to marriage
    than murder is. Now adultery is not an impediment to marriage. Neither
    therefore is wife-murder.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a more grievous sin to kill one's
    mother than one's wife, for it is never lawful to strike one's mother,
    whereas it is sometimes lawful to strike one's wife. But matricide is not an
    impediment to marriage. Neither therefore is wife-murder.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is a greater sin for a man to kill
    another man's wife on account of adultery than to kill his own wife,
    inasmuch as he has less motive and is less concerned with her correction.
    But he who kills another man's wife is not hindered from marrying. Neither
    therefore is he who kills his own wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the cause be removed, the effect is
    removed. But the sin of murder can be removed by repentance. Therefore the
    consequent impediment to marriage can be removed also: and consequently it
    would seem that after he has done penance he is not forbidden to marry.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A canon (caus. xxxiii, qu. ii, can.
    Interfectores) says: "The slayers of their own wives must be brought back to
    penance, and they are absolutely forbidden to marry." Further, in whatsoever
    a man sins, in that same must he be punished. But he who kills his wife sins
    against marriage. Therefore he must be punished by being deprived of
    marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By the Church's decree wife-murder is an
    impediment to marriage. Sometimes however it forbids the contracting of
    marriage without voiding the contract, when to wit the husband kills his
    wife on account of adultery or even through hatred; nevertheless if there be
    fear lest he should prove incontinent, he may be dispensed by the Church so
    as to marry lawfully. Sometimes it also voids the contract, as when a man
    kills his wife in order to marry her with whom he has committed adultery,
    for then the law declares him simply unfit to marry her, so that if he
    actually marry her his marriage is void. He is not however hereby rendered
    simply unfit by law in relation to other women: wherefore if he should have
    married another, although he sin by disobeying the Church's ordinance, the
    marriage is nevertheless not voided for this reason.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Murder and adultery in certain cases
    forbid the contracting of marriage and void the contract, as we say here in
    regard to wife-murder, and shall say further on (Sent. iv,
    <a href="XP062.html#XPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="XP062.html#XPQ62A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>) in regard to adultery. We
    may also reply that wife-murder is contrary to the substance of wedlock,
    whereas adultery is contrary to the good of fidelity due to marriage. Hence
    adultery is not more opposed to marriage than wife-murder, and the argument
    is based on a false premiss.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Simply speaking it is a more grievous
    sin to kill one's mother than one's wife, as also more opposed to nature,
    since a man reveres his mother naturally. Consequently he is less inclined
    to matricide and more prone to wife-murder; and it is to repress this
    proneness that the Church has forbidden marriage to the man who has murdered
    his wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Such a man does not sin against marriage
    as he does who kills his own wife; wherefore the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> It does not follow that because guilt
    has been remitted therefore the entire punishment is remitted, as evidenced
    by irregularity. For repentance does not restore a man to his former
    dignity, although it can restore him to his former state of grace, as stated
    above (<a href="XP038.html#XPQ38OUTP1">Question [38]</a>,
    <a href="XP038.html#XPQ38A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, ad 3).<br />
