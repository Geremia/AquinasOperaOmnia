  <h3 align="center">OF THE OBJECT OF CONTRITION (SIX ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the object of contrition. Under this head there are six
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a man should be contrite on
    account of his punishment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether, on account of original
    sin?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether, for every actual sin he
    has committed?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether, for actual sins he will
    commit?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether, for the sins of others?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP002.html#XPQ2A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether, for each single mortal
    sin?

    Whether man should be contrite on account of the punishment, and not only on
    account of his sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man should be contrite on
    account of the punishment, and not only on account of his sin. For Augustine
    says in De Poenitentia [*Cf. Hom. 50 inter 1]: "No man desires life
    everlasting unless he repent of this mortal life." But the morality of this
    life is a punishment. Therefore the penitent should be contrite on account
    of his punishments also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. iv, D, 16, cap.
    i), quoting Augustine (De vera et falsa Poenitentia [*Work of an unknown
    author]), that the penitent should be sorry for having deprived himself of
    virtue. But privation of virtue is a punishment. Therefore contrition is
    sorrow for punishments also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> No one holds to that for which he is sorry.
    But a penitent, by the very signification of the word, is one who holds to
    his punishment [*"Poenitens," i.e. "poenam tenens"]. Therefore he is not
    sorry on account of his punishment, so that contrition which is penitential
    sorrow is not on account of punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), contrition implies the
    crushing of something hard and whole. Now this wholeness and hardness is
    found in the evil of fault, since the will, which is the cause thereof in
    the evil-doer, sticks to its own ground*, and refuses to yield to the
    precept of the law, wherefore displeasure at a suchlike evil is called
    metaphorically "contrition." [*There is a play on the words here---'integer'
    (whole) and 'in suis terminis' (to its own ground)]. But this metaphor
    cannot be applied to evil of punishment, because punishment simply denotes a
    lessening, so that it is possible to have sorrow for punishment but not
    contrition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to St. Augustine, penance
    should be on account of this mortal life, not by reason of its mortality
    (unless penance be taken broadly for every kind of sorrow); but by reason of
    sins, to which we are prone on account of the weakness of this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sorrow for the loss of virtue through
    sin is not essentially the same as contrition, but is its principle. For
    just as we are moved to desire a thing on account of the good we expect to
    derive from it, so are we moved to be sorry for something on account of the
    evil accruing to us therefrom.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether contrition should be on account of original sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contrition should be on
    account of original sin. For we ought to be contrite on account of actual
    sin; not by reason of the act, considered as a kind of being, but by reason
    of its deformity, since the act, regarded in its substance, is a good, and
    is from God. Now original sin has a deformity, even as actual sin has.
    Therefore we should be contrite on its account also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by original sin man has been turned away
    from God, since in punishment thereof he was to be deprived of seeing God.
    But every man should be displeased at having been turned away from God.
    Therefore man should be displeased at original sin; and so he ought to have
    contrition for it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The medicine should be proportionate to the
    disease. Now we contracted original sin without willing to do so. Therefore
    it is not necessary that we should be cleansed from it by an act of the
    will, such as contrition is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition is sorrow, as stated above (<a
      href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), respecting and, so
    to speak, crushing the hardness of the will. Consequently it can regard
    those sins only which result in us through the hardness of our will. And as
    original sin was not brought upon us by our own will, but contracted from
    the origin of our infected nature, it follows that, properly speaking, we
    cannot have contrition on its account, but only displeasure or sorrow.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Contrition is for sin, not by reason of
    the mere substance of the act, because it does not derive the character of
    evil therefrom; nor again, by reason of its deformity alone, because
    deformity, of itself, does not include the notion of guilt, and sometimes
    denotes a punishment. But contrition ought to be on account of sin, as
    implying deformity resulting from an act of the will; and this does not
    apply to original sin, so that contrition does not apply to it.
  </p>
  <p>
    The same Reply avails for the Second Objection, because contrition is due to
    aversion of the will.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether we should have contrition for every actual sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we have no need to have
    contrition for every actual sin we have committed. For contraries are healed
    by their contraries. Now some sins are committed through sorrow, e.g. sloth
    and envy. Therefore their remedy should not be sorrow, such as contrition
    is, but joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrition is an act of the will, which
    cannot refer to that which is not known. But there are sins of which we have
    no knowledge, such as those we have forgotten. Therefore we cannot have
    contrition for them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by voluntary contrition those sins are
    blotted out which we committed voluntarily. But ignorance takes away
    voluntariness, as the Philosopher declares (Ethic. iii, 1). Therefore
    contrition need not cover things which have occurred through ignorance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we need not be contrite for a sin which
    is not removed by contrition. Now some sins are not removed by contrition,
    e.g. venial sins, that remain after the grace of contrition. Therefore there
    is no need to have contrition for all one's past sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Penance is a remedy for all actual sins. But
    penance cannot regard some sins, without contrition regarding them also, for
    it is the first part of Penance. Therefore contrition should be for all
    one's past sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, no sin is forgiven a man unless he be justified. But justification
    requires contrition, as stated above (<a href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="../FS.html">FS</a>, Question [113]). Therefore it is necessary to
    have contrition for all one's sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Every actual sin is caused by our will not
    yielding to God's law, either by transgressing it, or by omitting it, or by
    acting beside it: and since a hard thing is one that is disposed not to give
    way easily, hence it is that a certain hardness of the will is to be found
    in every actual sin. Wherefore, if a sin is to be remedied, it needs to be
    taken away by contrition which crushes it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As clearly shown above (<a
      href="XP002.html#XPQ2A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >, ad 1), contrition is opposed to sin, in so far as it proceeds from the
    choice of the will that had failed to obey the command of God's law, and not
    as regards the material part of sin: and it is on this that the choice of
    the will falls. Now the will's choice falls not only on the acts of the
    other powers, which the will uses for its own end, but also on the will's
    own proper act: for the will wills to will something. Accordingly the will's
    choice falls on that pain or sadness which is to be found in the sin of envy
    and the like, whether such pain be in the senses or in the will itself.
    Consequently the sorrow of contrition is opposed to those sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One may forget a thing in two ways,
    either so that it escapes the memory altogether, and then one cannot search
    for it; or so that it escapes from the memory in part, and in part remains,
    as when I remember having heard something in general, but know not what it
    was in particular, and then I search my memory in order to discover it.
    Accordingly a sin also may be forgotten in two ways, either so as to remain
    in a general, but not in a particular remembrance, and then a man is bound
    to bethink himself in order to discover the sin, because he is bound to have
    contrition for each individual mortal sin. And if he is unable to discover
    it, after applying himself with due care, it is enough that he be contrite
    for it, according as it stands in his knowledge, and indeed he should grieve
    not only for the sin, but also for having forgotten it, because this is
    owing to his neglect. If, however, the sin has escaped from his memory
    altogether, then he is excused from his duty through being unable to fulfill
    it, and it is enough that he be contrite in general for everything wherein
    he has offended God. But when this inability is removed, as when the sin is
    recalled to his memory, then he is bound to have contrition for that sin in
    particular, even as a poor man, who cannot pay a debt, is excused, and yet
    is bound to, as soon as he can.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If ignorance were to remove altogether
    the will to do evil, it will excuse, and there would be no sin: and
    sometimes it does not remove the will altogether, and then it does not
    altogether excuse, but only to a certain extent: wherefore a man is bound to
    be contrite for a sin committed through ignorance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A venial sin can remain after contrition
    for a mortal sin, but not after contrition for the venial sin: wherefore
    contrition should also cover venial sins even as penance does, as stated
    above (Sent. iv, D, 16, Question [2], Article [2], qu. 2; XP, Question [87],
    Article [1]).<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether a man is bound to have contrition for his future sins?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is bound to have
    contrition for his future sins also. For contrition is an act of the
    free-will: and the free-will extends to the future rather than to the past,
    since choice, which is an act of the free-will, is about future contingents,
    as stated in Ethic. iii. Therefore contrition is about future sins rather
    than about past sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin is aggravated by the result that
    ensues from it: wherefore Jerome says [*St. Basil asserts this implicitly in
    De Vera Virgin.] that the punishment of Arius is not yet ended, for it is
    yet possible for some to be ruined through his heresy, by reason of whose
    ruin his punishment would be increased: and the same applies to a man who is
    judged guilty of murder, if he has committed a murderous assault, even
    before his victim dies. Now the sinner ought to be contrite during that
    intervening time. Therefore the degree of his contrition ought to be
    proportionate not only to his past act, but also to its eventual result: and
    consequently contrition regards the future.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Contrition is a part of penance. But penance
    always regards the past: and therefore contrition does also, and
    consequently is not for a future sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In every series of things moving and moved
    ordained to one another, we find that the inferior mover has its proper
    movement, and besides this, it follows, in some respect, the movement of the
    superior mover: this is seen in the movement of the planets, which, in
    addition to their proper movements, follow the movement of the first heaven.
    Now, in all the moral virtues, the first mover is prudence, which is called
    the charioteer of the virtues. Consequently each moral virtue, in addition
    to its proper movement, has something of the movement of prudence: and
    therefore, since penance is a moral virtue, as it is a part of justice, in
    addition to its own act, it acquires the movement of prudence. Now its
    proper movement is towards its proper object, which is a sin committed.
    Wherefore its proper and principal act, viz. contrition, essentially regards
    past sins alone; but, inasmuch as it acquires something of the act of
    prudence, it regards future sins indirectly, although it is not essentially
    moved towards those future sins. For this reason, he that is contrite, is
    sorry for his past sins, and is cautious of future sins. Yet we do not speak
    of contrition for future sins, but of caution, which is a part of prudence
    conjoined to penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The free-will is said to regard future
    contingents, in so far as it is concerned with acts, but not with the object
    of acts: because, of his own free-will, a man can think about past and
    necessary things, and yet the very act of thinking, in so far as it is
    subject to the free-will, is a future contingent. Hence the act the
    contrition also is a future contingent, in so far as it is subject to the
    free-will; and yet its object can be something past.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The consequent result which aggravates a
    sin was already present in the act as in its cause; wherefore when the sin
    was committed, its degree of gravity was already complete, and no further
    guilt accrued to it when the result took place. Nevertheless some accidental
    punishment accrues to it, in the respect of which the damned will have the
    more motives of regret for the more evils that have resulted from their
    sins. It is in this sense that Jerome [*Basil] speaks. Hence there is not
    need for contrition to be for other than past sins.<br />

    Whether a man ought to have contrition for another's sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought to have contrition
    for another's sin. For one should not ask forgiveness for a sin unless one
    is contrite for it. Now forgiveness is asked for another's sin in Ps. 18:13:
    "From those of others spare thy servant." Therefore a man ought to be
    contrite for another's sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man is bound, ought of charity, to love
    his neighbor as himself. Now, through love of himself, he both grieves for
    his ills, and desires good things. Therefore, since we are bound to desire
    the goods of grace for our neighbor, as for ourselves, it seems that we
    ought to grieve for his sins, even as for our own. But contrition is nothing
    else than sorrow for sins. Therefore man should be contrite for the sins of
    others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Contrition is an act of the virtue of
    penance. But no one repents save for what he has done himself. Therefore no
    one is contrite for others' sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The same thing is crushed [conteritur] which
    hitherto was hard and whole. Hence contrition for sin must needs be in the
    same subject in which the hardness of sin was hitherto: so that there is no
    contrition for the sins of others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophet prays to be spared from the
    sins of others, in so far as, through fellowship with sinners, a man
    contracts a stain by consenting to their sins: thus it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++17%3A27"
      >Ps. 17:27</a
    >): "With the perverse thou wilt be perverted."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> We ought to grieve for the sins of
    others, but not to have contrition for them, because not all sorrow for past
    sins is contrition, as is evident for what has been said already.<br />

    Whether it is necessary to have contrition for each mortal sin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary to have
    contrition for each mortal sin. For the movement of contrition in
    justification is instantaneous: whereas a man cannot think of every mortal
    sin in an instant. Therefore it is not necessary to have contrition for each
    mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrition should be for sins, inasmuch
    as they turn us away from God, because we need not be contrite for turning
    to creatures without turning away from God. Now all mortal sins agree in
    turning us away from God. Therefore one contrition for all is sufficient.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, mortal sins have more in common with one
    another, than actual and original sin. Now one Baptism blots out all sins
    both actual and original. Therefore one general contrition blots out all
    mortal sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> For diverse diseases there are diverse
    remedies, since "what heals the eye will not heal the foot," as Jerome says
    (Super Marc. ix, 28). But contrition is the special remedy for one mortal
    sin. Therefore one general contrition for all mortal sins does not
    suffice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, contrition is expressed by confession. But it is necessary to
    confess each mortal sin. Therefore it is necessary to have contrition for
    each mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition may be considered in two ways, as to
    its origin, and as to its term. By origin of contrition I mean the process
    of thought, when a man thinks of his sin and is sorry for it, albeit not
    with the sorrow of contrition, yet with that of attrition. The term of
    contrition is when that sorrow is already quickened by grace. Accordingly,
    as regards the origin of contrition, a man needs to be contrite for each sin
    that he calls to mind; but as regards its term, it suffices for him to have
    one general contrition for all, because then the movement of his contrition
    acts in virtue of all his preceding dispositions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although all mortal sins agree in
    turning man away from God, yet they differ in the cause and mode of
    aversion, and in the degree of separation from God; and this regards the
    different ways in which they turn us to creatures.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism acts in virtue of Christ's
    merit, Who had infinite power for the blotting out of all sins; and so for
    all sins one Baptism suffices. But in contrition, in addition to the merit
    of Christ, an act of ours is requisite, which must, therefore, correspond to
    each sin, since it has not infinite power for contrition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    It may also be replied that Baptism is a spiritual generation; whereas
    Penance, as regards contrition and its other parts, is a kind of spiritual
    healing by way of some alteration. Now it is evident in the generation of a
    body, accompanied by corruption of another body, that all the accidents
    contrary to the thing generated, and which were the accidents of the thing
    corrupted, are removed by the one generation: whereas in alteration, only
    that accident is removed which was contrary to the accident which is the
    term of the alteration. In like manner, one Baptism blots out all sins
    together and introduces a new life; whereas Penance does not blot out each
    sin, unless it be directed to each. For this reason it is necessary to be
    contrite for, and to confess each sin.<br />
