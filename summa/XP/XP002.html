</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the object of contrition. Under this head there are 
six points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a man should be contrite on account of his punishment?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether, on account of original sin?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether, for every actual sin he has committed?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether, for actual sins he will commit?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether, for the sins of others?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether, for each single mortal sin?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that man should be contrite on account of the 
punishment, and not only on account of his sin. For Augustine says in De 
Poenitentia [*Cf. Hom. 50 inter 1]: "No man desires life everlasting 
unless he repent of this mortal life." But the morality of this life is a 
punishment. Therefore the penitent should be contrite on account of his 
punishments also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Master says (Sent. iv, D, 16, cap. i), quoting 
Augustine (De vera et falsa Poenitentia [*Work of an unknown author]), 
that the penitent should be sorry for having deprived himself of virtue. 
But privation of virtue is a punishment. Therefore contrition is sorrow 
for punishments also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> No one holds to that for which he is sorry. But a 
penitent, by the very signification of the word, is one who holds to his 
punishment [*"Poenitens," i.e. "poenam tenens"]. Therefore he is not 
sorry on account of his punishment, so that contrition which is 
penitential sorrow is not on account of punishment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), contrition implies the 
crushing of something hard and whole. Now this wholeness and hardness is 
found in the evil of fault, since the will, which is the cause thereof in 
the evil-doer, sticks to its own ground*, and refuses to yield to the 
precept of the law, wherefore displeasure at a suchlike evil is called 
metaphorically "contrition." [*There is a play on the words 
here---'integer' (whole) and 'in suis terminis' (to its own ground)]. But 
this metaphor cannot be applied  to evil of punishment, because 
punishment simply denotes a lessening, so that it is possible to have 
sorrow for punishment but not contrition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to St. Augustine, penance should be on account of 
this mortal life, not by reason of its mortality (unless penance be taken 
broadly for every kind of sorrow); but by reason of sins, to which we are 
prone on account of the weakness of this life.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sorrow for the loss of virtue through sin is not 
essentially the same as contrition, but is its principle. For just as we 
are moved to desire a thing on account of the good we expect to derive 
from it, so are we moved to be sorry for something on account of the evil 
accruing to us therefrom.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether contrition should be on account of original sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contrition should be on account of original 
sin. For we ought to be contrite on account of actual sin; not by reason 
of the act, considered as a kind of being, but by reason of its 
deformity, since the act, regarded in its substance, is a good, and is 
from God. Now original sin has a deformity, even as actual sin has. 
Therefore we should be contrite on its account also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by original sin man has been turned away from God, since 
in punishment thereof he was to be deprived of seeing God. But every man 
should be displeased at having been turned away from God. Therefore man 
should be displeased at original sin; and so he ought to have contrition 
for it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The medicine should be proportionate to the disease. 
Now we contracted original sin without willing to do so. Therefore it is 
not necessary that we should be cleansed from it by an act of the will, 
such as contrition is.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition is sorrow, as stated above (<A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,2), 
respecting and, so to speak, crushing the hardness of the will. 
Consequently it can regard those sins only which result in us through the 
hardness of our will. And as original sin was not brought upon us by our 
own will, but contracted from the origin of our infected nature, it 
follows that, properly speaking, we cannot have contrition on its 
account, but only displeasure or sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Contrition is for sin, not by reason of the mere substance 
of the act, because it does not derive the character of evil therefrom; 
nor again, by reason of its deformity alone, because deformity, of 
itself, does not include the notion of guilt, and sometimes denotes a 
punishment. But contrition ought to be on account of sin, as implying 
deformity resulting from an act of the will; and this does not apply to 
original sin, so that contrition does not apply to it. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The same Reply avails for the Second Objection, because contrition is 
due to aversion of the will.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether we should have contrition for every actual sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that we have no need to have contrition for every 
actual sin we have committed. For contraries are healed by their 
contraries. Now some sins are committed through sorrow, e.g. sloth and 
envy. Therefore their remedy should not be sorrow, such as contrition is, 
but joy.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrition is an act of the will, which cannot refer to 
that which is not known. But there are sins of which we have no 
knowledge, such as those we have forgotten. Therefore we cannot have 
contrition for them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, by voluntary contrition those sins are blotted out which 
we committed voluntarily. But ignorance takes away voluntariness, as the 
Philosopher declares (Ethic. iii, 1). Therefore contrition need not cover 
things which have occurred through ignorance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, we need not be contrite for a sin which is not removed 
by contrition. Now some sins are not removed by contrition, e.g. venial 
sins, that remain after the grace of contrition. Therefore there is no 
need to have contrition for all one's past sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Penance is a remedy for all actual sins. But penance 
cannot regard some sins, without contrition regarding them also, for it 
is the first part of Penance. Therefore contrition should be for all 
one's past sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, no sin is forgiven a man unless he be justified. But 
justification requires contrition, as stated above (<A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>; <A Href="../FS.html">FS</a>, 
Question [113]). Therefore it is necessary to have contrition for all one's sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every actual sin is caused by our will not yielding to 
God's law, either by transgressing it, or by omitting it, or by acting 
beside it: and since a hard thing is one that is disposed not to give way 
easily, hence it is that a certain hardness of the will is to be found in 
every actual sin. Wherefore, if a sin is to be remedied, it needs to be 
taken away by contrition which crushes it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As clearly shown above (<A Href="XP002.html#XPQ2A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), contrition is opposed 
to sin, in so far as it proceeds from the choice of the will that had 
failed to obey the command of God's law, and not as regards the material 
part of sin: and it is on this that the choice of the will falls. Now the 
will's choice falls not only on the acts of the other powers, which the 
will uses for its own end, but also  on the will's own proper act: for 
the will wills to will something. Accordingly the will's choice falls on 
that pain or sadness which is to be found in the sin of envy and the 
like, whether such pain be in the senses or in the will itself. 
Consequently the sorrow of contrition is opposed to those sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One may forget a thing in two ways, either so that it 
escapes the memory altogether, and then one cannot search for it; or so 
that it escapes from the memory in part, and in part remains, as when I 
remember having heard something in general, but know not what it was in 
particular, and then I search my memory in order to discover it. 
Accordingly a sin also may be forgotten in two ways, either so as to 
remain in a general, but not in a particular remembrance, and then a man 
is bound to bethink himself in order to discover the sin, because he is 
bound to have contrition for each individual mortal sin. And if he is 
unable to discover it, after applying himself with due care, it is enough 
that he be contrite for it, according as it stands in his knowledge, and 
indeed he should grieve not only for the sin, but also for having 
forgotten it, because this is owing to his neglect. If, however, the sin 
has escaped from his memory altogether, then he is excused from his duty 
through being unable to fulfill it, and it is enough that he be contrite 
in general for everything wherein he has offended God. But when this 
inability is removed, as when the sin is recalled to his memory, then he 
is bound to have contrition for that sin in particular, even as a poor 
man, who cannot pay a debt, is excused, and yet is bound to, as soon as 
he can.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If ignorance were to remove altogether the will to do evil, 
it will excuse, and there would be no sin: and sometimes it does not 
remove the will altogether, and then it does not altogether excuse, but 
only to a certain extent: wherefore a man is bound to be contrite for a 
sin committed through ignorance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A venial sin can remain after contrition for a mortal sin, 
but not after contrition for the venial sin: wherefore contrition should 
also cover venial sins even as penance does, as stated above (Sent. iv, 
D, 16, Question [2], Article [2], qu. 2; XP, Question [87], Article [1]).<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a man is bound to have contrition for his future sins?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man is bound to have contrition for his 
future sins also. For contrition is an act of the free-will: and the 
free-will extends to the future rather than to the past, since choice, 
which is an act of the free-will, is about future contingents, as stated 
in Ethic. iii. Therefore contrition is about future sins rather than 
about past sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, sin is aggravated by the result that ensues from it: 
wherefore Jerome says [*St. Basil asserts this implicitly in De Vera 
Virgin.] that the punishment of Arius is not yet ended, for it is yet 
possible for some to be ruined through his heresy, by  reason of whose 
ruin his punishment would be increased: and the same applies to a man who 
is judged guilty of murder, if he has committed a murderous assault, even 
before his victim dies. Now the sinner ought to be contrite during that 
intervening time. Therefore the degree of his contrition ought to be 
proportionate not only to his past act, but also to its eventual result: 
and consequently contrition regards the future.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Contrition is a part of penance. But penance always 
regards the past: and therefore contrition does also, and consequently is 
not for a future sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In every series of things moving and moved ordained to 
one another, we find that the inferior mover has its proper movement, and 
besides this, it follows, in some respect, the movement of the superior 
mover: this is seen in the movement of the planets, which, in addition to 
their proper movements, follow the movement of the first heaven. Now, in 
all the moral virtues, the first mover is prudence, which is called the 
charioteer of the virtues. Consequently each moral virtue, in addition to 
its proper movement, has something of the movement of prudence: and 
therefore, since penance is a moral virtue, as it is a part of justice, 
in addition to its own act, it acquires the movement of prudence. Now its 
proper movement is towards its proper object, which is a sin committed. 
Wherefore its proper and principal act, viz. contrition, essentially 
regards past sins alone; but, inasmuch as it acquires something of the 
act of prudence, it regards future sins indirectly, although it is not 
essentially moved towards those future sins. For this reason, he that is 
contrite, is sorry for his past sins, and is cautious of future sins. Yet 
we do not speak of contrition for future sins, but of caution, which is a 
part of prudence conjoined to penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The free-will is said to regard future contingents, in so 
far as it is concerned with acts, but not with the object of acts: 
because, of his own free-will, a man can think about past and necessary 
things, and yet the very act of thinking, in so far as it is subject to 
the free-will, is a future contingent. Hence the act the contrition also 
is a future contingent, in so far as it is subject to the free-will; and 
yet its object can be something past.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The consequent result which aggravates a sin was already 
present in the act as in its cause; wherefore when the sin was committed, 
its degree of gravity was already complete, and no further guilt accrued 
to it when the result took place. Nevertheless some accidental punishment 
accrues to it, in the respect of which the damned will have the more 
motives of regret for the more evils that have resulted from their sins. 
It is in this sense that Jerome [*Basil] speaks. Hence there is not need 
for contrition to be for other than past sins.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a man ought to have contrition for another's 
sin. For one should not ask forgiveness for a sin unless one is contrite 
for it. Now forgiveness is asked for another's sin in Ps. 18:13: "From 
those of others spare thy servant." Therefore a man ought to be contrite 
for another's sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, man is bound, ought of charity, to love his neighbor as 
himself. Now, through love of himself, he both grieves for his ills, and 
desires good things. Therefore, since we are bound to desire the goods of 
grace for our neighbor, as for ourselves, it seems that we ought to 
grieve for his sins, even as for our own. But contrition is nothing else 
than sorrow for sins. Therefore man should be contrite for the sins of 
others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[5] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Contrition is an act of the virtue of penance. But no

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The same thing is crushed [conteritur] which hitherto was 
hard and whole. Hence contrition for sin must needs be in the same 
subject in which the hardness of sin was hitherto: so that there is no 
contrition for the sins of others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prophet prays to be spared from the sins of others, in 
so far as, through fellowship with sinners, a man contracts a stain by 
consenting to their sins: thus it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Ps++17:27">Ps. 17:27</a>): "With the

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is necessary to have contrition for each mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not necessary to have contrition for 
each mortal sin. For the movement of contrition in justification is 
instantaneous: whereas a man cannot think of every mortal sin in an 
instant. Therefore it is not necessary to have contrition for each mortal 
sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrition should be for sins, inasmuch as they turn us 
away from God, because we need not be contrite for turning to creatures 
without turning away from God. Now all mortal sins agree in turning us 
away from God. Therefore one contrition for all is sufficient.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, mortal sins have more in common with one another, than 
actual and original sin. Now one Baptism blots out all sins both actual 
and original. Therefore one general contrition blots out all mortal sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> For diverse diseases there are diverse  remedies, since 
"what heals the eye will not heal the foot," as Jerome says (Super Marc. 
ix, 28). But contrition is the special remedy for one mortal sin. 
Therefore one general contrition for all mortal sins does not suffice.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, contrition is expressed by confession. But it is necessary to 
confess each mortal sin. Therefore it is necessary to have contrition for 
each mortal sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition may be considered in two ways, as to its 
origin, and as to its term. By origin of contrition I mean the process of 
thought, when a man thinks of his sin and is sorry for it, albeit not 
with the sorrow of contrition, yet with that of attrition. The term of 
contrition is when that sorrow is already quickened by grace. 
Accordingly, as regards the origin of contrition, a man needs to be 
contrite for each sin that he calls to mind; but as regards its term, it 
suffices for him to have one general contrition for all, because then the 
movement of his contrition acts in virtue of all his preceding 
dispositions.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although all mortal sins agree in turning man away from 
God, yet they differ in the cause and mode of aversion, and in the degree 
of separation from God; and this regards the different ways in which they 
turn us to creatures.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Baptism acts in virtue of Christ's merit, Who had infinite 
power for the blotting out of all sins; and so for all sins one Baptism 
suffices. But in contrition, in addition to the merit of Christ, an act 
of ours is requisite, which must, therefore, correspond to each sin, 
since it has not infinite power for contrition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[2] A[6] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; It may also be replied that Baptism is a spiritual generation; whereas 
Penance, as regards contrition and its other parts, is a kind of 
spiritual healing by way of some alteration. Now it is evident in the 
generation of a body, accompanied by corruption of another body, that all 
the accidents contrary to the thing generated, and which were the 
accidents of the thing corrupted, are removed by the one generation: 
whereas in alteration, only that accident is removed which was contrary 
to the accident which is the term of the alteration. In like manner, one 
Baptism blots out all sins together and introduces a new life; whereas 
Penance does not blot out each sin, unless it be directed to each. For 
this reason it is necessary to be contrite for, and to confess each sin.<br>
