<H3 Align="Center">OF THE DEFINITION, CONGRUITY AND CAUSE OF EXCOMMUNICATION (FOUR ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now treat of excommunication: we shall consider: (1) the 
definition, congruity and cause of excommunication; (2) who has the power 
to excommunicate; (3) communication with excommunicated persons; (4) 
absolution from excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are four points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP021.html#XPQ21A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether excommunication is suitably defined?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP021.html#XPQ21A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether the Church should excommunicate anyone?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP021.html#XPQ21A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether anyone should be excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?

<H3 Align="Left">Whether excommunication is suitably defined as separation from the communion of the Church, etc?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that excommunication is unsuitably defined by some 
thus: "Excommunication is separation from the communion of the Church, as 
to fruit and general suffrages." For the suffrages of the Church avail 
for those for whom they are offered. But the Church prays for those who 
are outside the Church, as, for instance, for heretics and pagans. 
Therefore she prays also for the excommunicated, since they are outside 
the Church, and so the suffrages of the Church avail for them.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, no one loses the suffrages of the Church except by his 
own fault. Now excommunication is not a fault, but a punishment. 
Therefore excommunication does not deprive a man of the general suffrages 
of the Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fruit of the Church seems to be the same as the 
Church's suffrages, for it cannot mean the fruit of temporal goods, since 
excommunication does not deprive a man of these. Therefore there is no 
reason for mentioning both.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there is a kind of excommunication called minor*, by 
which man is not deprived of the suffrages of the Church. [*Minor 
excommunication is no longer recognized by Canon Law.] Therefore this 
definition is unsuitable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> When a man enters the Church by Baptism, he is admitted 
to two things, viz. the body of the faithful and the participation of the 
sacraments: and this latter presupposes the former, since the faithful 
are united together in the participation of the sacraments. Consequently 
a person may be expelled from the Church in two ways. First, by being 
deprived merely of the participation of the sacraments, and this is the 
minor  excommunication. Secondly, by being deprived of both, and this is 
the major excommunication, of which the above is the definition. Nor can 
there be a third, consisting in the privation of communion with the 
faithful, but not of the participation of the sacraments, for the reason 
already given, because, to wit, the faithful communicate together in the 
sacraments. Now communion with the faithful is twofold. One consists in 
spiritual things, such as their praying for one another, and meeting 
together for the reception of sacred things; while another consists in 
certain legitimate bodily actions. These different manners of communion 
are signified in the verse which declares that those who are 
excommunicate are deprived of---<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; "os, orare, vale, communio, mensa."
"Os," i.e. we must not give them tokens of goodwill; "orare," i.e. we 
must not pray with them; "vale," we must not give them marks of respect; 
"communio," i.e. we must not communicate with them in the sacraments; 
"mensa," i.e. we must not take meals with them. Accordingly the above 
definition includes privation of the sacraments in the words "as to the 
fruit," and from partaking together with the faithful in spiritual 
things, in the words, "and the general prayers of the Church."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Another definition is given which expresses the privation of both kinds 
of acts, and is as follows: "Excommunication is the privation of all 
lawful communion with the faithful."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Prayers are said for unbelievers, but they do not receive 
the fruit of those prayers unless they be converted to the faith. In like 
manner prayers may be offered up for those who are excommunicated, but 
not among the prayers that are said for the members of the Church. Yet 
they do not receive the fruit so long as they remain under the 
excommunication, but prayers are said for them that they may receive the 
spirit of repentance, so that they may be loosed from excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> One man's prayers profit another in so far as they can 
reach to him. Now the action of one man may reach to another in two ways. 
First, by virtue of charity which unites all the faithful, making them 
one in God, according to Ps. 118:63: "I am a partaker with all them that 
fear Thee." Now excommunication does not interrupt this union, since no 
man can be justly excommunicated except for a mortal sin, whereby a man 
is already separated from charity, even without being excommunicated. An 
unjust excommunication cannot deprive a man of charity, since this is one 
of the greatest of all goods, of which a man cannot be deprived against 
his will. Secondly, through the intention of the one who prays, which 
intention is directed to the person he prays for, and this union is 
interrupted by excommunication, because by passing sentence of 
excommunication, the Church severs a man from the whole body of the 
faithful, for whom she prays. Hence those prayers of the Church which are 
offered up for the whole Church, do not profit those who are 
excommunicated. Nor can prayers be said  for them among the members of 
the Church as speaking in the Church's name, although a private 
individual may say a prayer with the intention of offering it for their 
conversion.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The spiritual fruit of the Church is derived not only from 
her prayers, but also from the sacraments received and from the faithful 
dwelling together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The minor excommunication does not fulfill all the 
conditions of excommunication but only a part of them, hence the 
definition of excommunication need not apply to it in every respect, but 
only in some.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether the Church should excommunicate anyone?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Church ought not to excommunicate anyone, 
because excommunication is a kind of curse, and we are forbidden to curse 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A14">Rm. 12:14</a>). Therefore the Church should not excommunicate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the Church Militant should imitate the Church 
Triumphant. Now we read in the epistle of Jude (verse 9) that "when 
Michael the Archangel disputing with the devil contended about the body 
of Moses, he durst not bring against him the judgment of railing speech, 
but said: The Lord command thee." Therefore the Church Militant ought not 
to judge any man by cursing or excommunicating him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man should be given into the hands of his enemies, 
unless there be no hope for him. Now by excommunication a man is given 
into the hands of Satan, as is clear from 1 Cor. 5:5. Since then we 
should never give up hope about anyone in this life, the Church should 
not excommunicate anyone.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++5%3A5">1 Cor. 5:5</a>) ordered a man to be 
excommunicated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++18%3A17">Mt. 18:17</a>) about the man who refuses to hear the 
Church: "Let him be to thee as the heathen or publican." But heathens are 
outside the Church. Therefore they also who refuse to hear the Church, 
should be banished from the Church by excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The judgment of the Church should be conformed to the 
judgment of God. Now God punishes the sinner in many ways, in order to 
draw him to good, either by chastising him with stripes, or by leaving 
him to himself so that being deprived of those helps whereby he was kept 
out of evil, he may acknowledge his weakness, and humbly return to God 
Whom he had abandoned in his pride. In both these respects the Church by 
passing sentence of excommunication imitates the judgment of God. For by 
severing a man from the communion of the faithful that he may blush with 
shame, she imitates the judgment whereby God chastises man with stripes;  
and by depriving him of prayers and other spiritual things, she imitates 
the judgment of God in leaving man to himself, in order that by humility 
he may learn to know himself and return to God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A curse may be pronounced in two ways: first, so that the 
intention of the one who curses is fixed on the evil which he invokes or 
pronounces, and cursing in this sense is altogether forbidden. Secondly, 
so that the evil which a man invokes in cursing is intended for the good 
of the one who is cursed, and thus cursing is sometimes lawful and 
salutary: thus a physician makes a sick man undergo pain, by cutting him, 
for instance, in order to deliver him from his sickness.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The devil cannot be brought to repentance, wherefore the 
pain of excommunication cannot do him any good.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> From the very fact that a man is deprived of the prayers of 
the Church, he incurs a triple loss, corresponding to the three things 
which a man acquires through the Church's prayers. For they bring an 
increase of grace to those who have it, or merit grace for those who have 
it not; and in this respect the Master of the Sentences says (Sent. iv, 
D, 18): "The grace of God is taken away by excommunication." They also 
prove a safeguard of virtue; and in this respect he says that "protection 
is taken away," not that the excommunicated person is withdrawn 
altogether from God's providence, but that he is excluded from that 
protection with which He watches over the children of the Church in a 
more special way. Moreover, they are useful as a defense against the 
enemy, and in this respect he says that "the devil receives greater power 
of assaulting the excommunicated person, both spiritually and 
corporally." Hence in the early Church, when men had to be enticed to the 
faith by means of outward signs (thus the gift of the Holy Ghost was 
shown openly by a visible sign), so too excommunication was evidenced by 
a person being troubled in his body by the devil. Nor is it unreasonable 
that one, for whom there is still hope, be given over to the enemy, for 
he is surrendered, not unto damnation, but unto correction, since the 
Church has the power to rescue him from the hands of the enemy, whenever 
he is willing.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether anyone should be excommunicated for inflicting temporal harm?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no man should be excommunicated for inflicting 
a temporal harm. For the punishment should not exceed the fault. But the 
punishment of excommunication is the privation of a spiritual good, which 
surpasses all temporal goods. Therefore no man should be excommunicated 
for temporal injuries.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we should render to no man evil for evil, according to 
the precept of the Apostle (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A17">Rm. 12:17</a>). But this would be rendering evil 
for evil, if a man were to be excommunicated for doing such an injury. 
Therefore this ought by no means to be done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Peter sentenced Ananias and Saphira to death for 
keeping back the price of their piece of land (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+5%3A1-10">Acts 5:1-10</a>). Therefore it 
is lawful for the Church to excommunicate for temporal injuries.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> By excommunication the ecclesiastical judge excludes a 
man, in a sense, from the kingdom. Wherefore, since he ought not to 
exclude from the kingdom others than the unworthy, as was made clear from 
the definition of the keys (<A Href="XP017.html#XPQ17OUTP1">Question [17]</a>, <A Href="XP017.html#XPQ17A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>), and since no one becomes 
unworthy, unless, through committing a mortal sin, he lose charity which 
is the way leading to the kingdom, it follows that no man should be 
excommunicated except for a mortal sin. And since by injuring a man in 
his body or in his temporalities, one may sin mortally and act against 
charity, the Church can excommunicate a man for having inflicted temporal 
injury on anyone. Yet, as excommunication is the most severe punishment, 
and since punishments are intended as remedies, according to the 
Philosopher (Ethic. ii), and again since a prudent physician begins with 
lighter and less risky remedies, therefore excommunication should not be 
inflicted, even for a mortal sin, unless the sinner be obstinate, either 
by not coming up for judgment, or by going away before judgment is 
pronounced, or by failing to obey the decision of the court. For then, 
if, after due warning, he refuse to obey, he is reckoned to be obstinate, 
and the judge, not being able to proceed otherwise against him, must 
excommunicate him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A fault is not measured by the extent of the damage a man 
does, but by the will with which he does it, acting against charity. 
Wherefore, though the punishment of excommunication exceeds the harm 
done, it does not exceed the measure of the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> When a man is corrected by being punished, evil is not 
rendered to him, but good: since punishments are remedies, as stated 
above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether an excommunication unjustly pronounced has any effect?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that an excommunication which is pronounced 
unjustly has no effect at all. Because excommunication deprives a man of 
the protection and grace of God, which cannot be forfeited unjustly. 
Therefore excommunication has no effect if it be unjustly pronounced.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Jerome says (on Mt. 16:19: "I will give to thee the 
keys"): "It is a pharisaical severity to reckon as really bound or 
loosed, that which is bound or loosed unjustly." But that severity was 
proud and erroneous. Therefore an unjust excommunication has no effect.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Gregory (Hom. xxvi in Evang.), "the 
sentence of the pastor is to be feared whether it be just or unjust." Now 
there would be no reason to fear an unjust  excommunication if it did not 
hurt. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> An excommunication may be unjust for two reasons. First, 
on the part of its author, as when anyone excommunicates through hatred 
or anger, and then, nevertheless, the excommunication takes effect, 
though its author sins, because the one who is excommunicated suffers 
justly, even if the author act wrongly in excommunicating him. Secondly, 
on the part of the excommunication, through there being no proper cause, 
or through the sentence being passed without the forms of law being 
observed. In this case, if the error, on the part of the sentence, be 
such as to render the sentence void, this has no effect, for there is no 
excommunication; but if the error does not annul the sentence, this takes 
effect, and the person excommunicated should humbly submit (which will be 
credited to him as a merit), and either seek absolution from the person 
who has excommunicated him, or appeal to a higher judge. If, however, he 
were to contemn the sentence, he would "ipso facto" sin mortally.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But sometimes it happens that there is sufficient cause on the part of 
the excommunicator, but not on the part of the excommunicated, as when a 
man is excommunicated for a crime which he has not committed, but which 
has been proved against him: in this case, if he submit humbly, the merit 
of his humility will compensate him for the harm of excommunication.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a man cannot lose God's grace unjustly, yet he can 
unjustly lose those things which on our part dispose us to receive grace. 
for instance, a man may be deprived of the instruction which he ought to 
have. It is in this sense that excommunication is said to deprive a man 
of God's grace, as was explained above (<A Href="XP021.html#XPQ21A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[21] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Jerome is speaking of sin not of its punishments, which can 
be inflicted unjustly by ecclesiastical superiors.<br>
