  <h3 align="center">OF THE BILL OF DIVORCE (SEVEN ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the bill of divorce, under which head there are seven
    points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the indissolubility of
    marriage is of natural law?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether by dispensation it may
    become lawful to put away a wife?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it was lawful under the
    Mosaic law?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether a wife who has been
    divorced may take another husband?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether the husband can marry
    again the wife whom he has divorced?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether the cause of divorce was
    hatred of the wife?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A7THEP1">(7)</a> Whether the reasons for divorce
    had to be written on the bill?

    Whether inseparableness of the wife is of natural law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that inseparableness of the wife is
    not of natural law. For the natural law is the same for all. But no law save
    Christ's has forbidden the divorcing of a wife. Therefore inseparableness of
    a wife is not of natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments are not of the natural
    law. But the indissolubility of marriage is one of the marriage goods.
    Therefore it is not of the natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the union of man and woman in marriage
    is chiefly directed to the begetting, rearing, and instruction of the
    offspring. But all things are complete by a certain time. Therefore after
    that time it is lawful to put away a wife without prejudice to the natural
    law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the good of the offspring is the
    principal end of marriage. But the indissolubility of marriage is opposed to
    the good of the offspring, because, according to philosophers, a certain man
    cannot beget offspring of a certain woman, and yet he might beget of
    another, even though she may have had intercourse with another man.
    Therefore the indissolubility of marriage is against rather than according
    to the natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Those things which were assigned to nature
    when it was well established in its beginning belong especially to the law
    of nature. Now the indissolubility of marriage is one of these things
    according to Mt. 19:4,6. Therefore it is of natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is of natural law that man should not oppose himself to God. Yet
    man would, in a way, oppose himself to God if he were to sunder "what God
    hath joined together." Since then the indissolubility of marriage is
    gathered from this passage (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A6"
      >Mt. 19:6</a
    >) it would seem that it is of natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By the intention of nature marriage is directed
    to the rearing of the offspring, not merely for a time, but throughout its
    whole life. Hence it is of natural law that parents should lay up for their
    children, and that children should be their parents' heirs (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Cor++12%3A14"
      >2 Cor. 12:14</a
    >). Therefore, since the offspring is the common good of husband and wife,
    the dictate of the natural law requires the latter to live together for ever
    inseparably: and so the indissolubility of marriage is of natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ's law alone brought mankind "to
    perfection" [*Cf. Heb. 7:19] by bringing man back to the state of the
    newness of nature. Wherefore neither Mosaic nor human laws could remove all
    that was contrary to the law of nature, for this was reserved exclusively to
    "the law of the spirit of life" [*Cf. Rm. 8:2].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Indissolubility belongs to marriage in
    so far as the latter is a sign of the perpetual union of Christ with the
    Church, and in so far as it fulfills an office of nature that is directed to
    the good of the offspring, as stated above. But since divorce is more
    directly incompatible with the signification of the sacrament than with the
    good of the offspring, with which it is incompatible consequently, as stated
    above (<a href="XP065.html#XPQ65OUTP1">Question [65]</a>,
    <a href="XP065.html#XPQ65A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 5), the
    indissolubility of marriage is implied in the good of the sacrament rather
    than in the good of the offspring, although it may be connected with both.
    And in so far as it is connected with the good of the offspring, it is of
    the natural law, but not as connected with the good of the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    The Reply to the Third Objection may be gathered from what has been said.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Marriage is chiefly directed to the
    common good in respect of its principal end, which is the good of the
    offspring; although in respect of its secondary end it is directed to the
    good of the contracting party, in so far as it is by its very nature a
    remedy for concupiscence. Hence marriage laws consider what is expedient for
    all rather than what may be suitable for one. Therefore although the
    indissolubility of marriage hinder the good of the offspring with regard to
    some individual, it is proportionate with the good of the offspring
    absolutely speaking: and for this reason the argument does not prove.<br />

    Whether it may have been lawful by dispensation to put away a wife?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It seems that it could not be lawful by
    dispensation to put away a wife. For in marriage anything that is opposed to
    the good of the offspring is against the first precepts of the natural law,
    which admit of no dispensation. Now such is the putting away of a wife, as
    stated above (<a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore,
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a concubine differs from a wife
    especially in the fact that she is not inseparably united. But by no
    dispensation could a man have a concubine. Therefore by no dispensation
    could he put his wife away.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, men are as fit to receive a dispensation
    now as of old. But now a man cannot receive a dispensation to divorce his
    wife. Neither, therefore, could he in olden times.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Abraham carnally knew Agar with the
    disposition of a husband towards his wife, as stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="XP065.html#XPQ65A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>, ad 2,3). Now by Divine
    command he sent her away, and yet sinned not. Therefore it could be lawful
    by dispensation for a man to put away his wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the commandments, especially those which in
    some way are of natural law, a dispensation is like a change in the natural
    course of things: and this course is subject to a twofold change. First, by
    some natural cause whereby another natural cause is hindered from following
    its course: it is thus in all things that happen by chance less frequently
    in nature. In this way, however, there is no variation in the course of
    those natural things which happen always, but only in the course of those
    which happen frequently. Secondly, by a cause altogether supernatural, as in
    the case of miracles: and in this way there can be a variation in the course
    of nature, not only in the course which is appointed for the majority of
    cases, but also in the course which is appointed for all cases, as instanced
    by the sun standing still at the time of Josue, and by its turning back at
    the time of Ezechias, and by the miraculous eclipse at the time of Christ's
    Passion [*Jos. 10:14; 4 Kgs. 20:10; Is. 38:8; Mt. 27:15]. In like manner the
    reason for a dispensation from a precept of the law of nature is sometimes
    found in the lower causes, and in this way a dispensation may bear upon the
    secondary precepts of the natural law, but not on the first precepts because
    these are always existent as it were, as stated above (<a
      href="XP065.html#XPQ65OUTP1"
      >Question [65]</a
    >, <a href="XP065.html#XPQ65A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) in reference to the
    plurality of wives and so forth. But sometimes this reason is found in the
    higher causes, and then a dispensation may be given by God even from the
    first precepts of the natural law, for the sake of signifying or showing
    some Divine mystery, as instanced in the dispensation vouchsafed to Abraham
    in the slaying of his innocent son. Such dispensations, however, are not
    granted to all generally, but to certain individual persons, as also happens
    in regard to miracles. Accordingly, if the indissolubility of marriage is
    contained among the first precepts of the natural law, it could only be a
    matter of dispensation in this second way; but, if it be one of the second
    precepts of the natural law, it could be a matter of dispensation even in
    the first way. Now it would seem to belong rather to the secondary precepts
    of the natural law. For the indissolubility of marriage is not directed to
    the good of the offspring, which is the principal end of marriage, except in
    so far as parents have to provide for their children for their whole life,
    by due preparation of those things that are necessary in life. Now this
    preparation does not pertain to the first intention of nature, in respect of
    which all things are common. And therefore it would seem that to put away
    one's wife is not contrary to the first intention of nature, and
    consequently that it is contrary not to the first but to the second precepts
    of the natural law. Therefore, seemingly, it can be a matter of dispensation
    even in the first way.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The good of the offspring, in so far as
    it belongs to the first intention of nature, includes procreation,
    nourishment, and instruction, until the offspring comes to perfect age. But
    that provision be made for the children by bequeathing to them the
    inheritance or other goods belongs seemingly to the second intention of the
    natural law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> To have a concubine is contrary to the
    good of the offspring, in respect of nature's first intention in that good,
    namely the rearing and instruction of the child, for which purpose it is
    necessary that the parents remain together permanently; which is not the
    case with a concubine, since she is taken for a time. Hence the comparison
    fails. But in respect of nature's second intention, even the having of a
    concubine may be a matter of dispensation as evidenced by Osee 1.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although indissolubility belongs to the
    second intention of marriage as fulfilling an office of nature, it belongs
    to its first intention as a sacrament of the Church. Hence, from the moment
    it was made a sacrament of the Church, as long as it remains such it cannot
    be a matter of dispensation, except perhaps by the second kind of
    dispensation.<br />

    Whether it was lawful to divorce a wife under the Mosaic law?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was lawful to divorce a
    wife under the Mosaic law. For one way of giving consent is to refrain from
    prohibiting when one can prohibit. It is also unlawful to consent to what is
    unlawful. Since then the Mosaic law did not forbid the putting away of a
    wife and did no wrong by not forbidding it, for "the law... is holy" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A12"
      >Rm. 7:12</a
    >), it would seem that divorce was at one time lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the prophets spoke inspired by the Holy
    Ghost, according to 2 Pt. 1:21. Now it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Malachi+2%3A16"
      >Malachi 2:16</a
    >): "When thou shalt hate her, put her away." Since then that which the Holy
    Ghost inspires is not unlawful, it would seem that it was not always
    unlawful to divorce a wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom [*Hom. xxxii in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] says that even as the
    apostles permitted second marriages, so Moses allowed the bill of divorce.
    But second marriages are not sinful. Therefore neither was it sinful under
    the Mosaic law to divorce a wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, our Lord said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++19%3A8"
      >Mt. 19:8</a
    >) that Moses granted the Jews the bill of divorce by reason of the hardness
    of their heart. But their hardness of heart did not excuse them from sin.
    Neither therefore did the law about the bill of divorce.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Chrysostom says [*Hom. xxxii in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] that "Moses, by
    granting the bill of divorce, did not indicate the justice of God, but
    deprived their sin of its guilt, for while the Jews acted as though they
    were keeping the law, their sin seemed to be no sin."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> on this point there are two opinions. For some
    say that under the Law those who put away their wives, after giving them a
    bill of divorce, were not excused from sin, although they were excused from
    the punishment which they should have suffered according to the Law: and
    that for this reason Moses is stated to have permitted the bill of divorce.
    Accordingly they reckon four kinds of permission: one by absence of precept,
    so that when a greater good is not prescribed, a lesser good is said to be
    permitted: thus the Apostle by not prescribing virginity, permitted marriage
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++7">1 Cor. 7</a>). The
    second is by absence of prohibition: thus venial sins are said to be
    permitted because they are not forbidden. The third is by absence of
    prevention, and thus all sins are said to be permitted by God, in so far as
    He does not prevent them whereas He can. The fourth is by omission of
    punishment, and in this way the bill of divorce was permitted in the Law,
    not indeed for the sake of obtaining a greater good, as was the dispensation
    to have several wives, but for the sake of preventing a greater evil, namely
    wife-murder to which the Jews were prone on account of the corruption of
    their irascible appetite. Even so they were allowed to lend money for usury
    to strangers, on account of corruption in their concupiscible appetite, lest
    they should exact usury of their brethren; and again on account of the
    corruption of suspicion in the reason they were allowed the sacrifice of
    jealousy, lest mere suspicion should corrupt their judgment. But because the
    Old Law, though it did not confer grace, was given that it might indicate
    sin, as the saints are agreed in saying, others are of opinion that if it
    had been a sin for a man to put away his wife, this ought to have been
    indicated to him, at least by the law or the prophets: "Show My people their
    wicked doings" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++58%3A1"
      >Is. 58:1</a
    >): else they would seem to have been neglected, if those things which are
    necessary for salvation and which they knew not were never made known to
    them: and this cannot be admitted, because the righteousness of the Law
    observed at the time of the Law would merit eternal life. For this reason
    they say that although to put away one's wife is wrong in itself, it
    nevertheless became lawful by God's permitting it, and they confirm this by
    the authority of Chrysostom, who says [*Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum
    falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] that "the Lawgiver by permitting
    divorce removed the guilt from the sin." Although this opinion has some
    probability the former is more generally held: wherefore we must reply to
    the arguments on both sides [*Cf. FS, Question [105], Article [4], ad 8; FS,
    Question [108], Article [3], ad 2; Contra Gentes iii, cap. 123].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He who can forbid, sins not by omitting
    to forbid if he has no hope of correcting, but fears by forbidding to
    furnish the occasion of a greater evil. Thus it happened to Moses: wherefore
    acting on Divine authority he did not forbid the bill of divorce.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The prophets, inspired by the Holy
    Ghost, said that a wife ought to be put away, not as though this were a
    command of the Holy Ghost, but as being permitted lest greater evils should
    be perpetrated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This likeness of permission must not be
    applied to every detail, but only to the cause which was the same in both
    cases, since both permissions were granted in order to avoid some form of
    wickedness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although their hardness of heart excused
    them not from sin, the permission given on account of that hardness excused
    them. For certain things are forbidden those who are healthy in body, which
    are not forbidden the sick, and yet the sick sin not by availing themselves
    of the permission granted to them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A good may be omitted in two ways.
    First, in order to obtain a greater good, and then the omission of that good
    becomes virtuous by being directed to a greater good; thus Jacob rightly
    omitted to have only one wife, on account of the good of the offspring. In
    another way a good is omitted in order to avoid a greater evil, and then if
    this is done with the authority of one who can grant a dispensation, the
    omission of that good is not sinful, and yet it does not also become
    virtuous. In this way the indissolubility of marriage was suspended in the
    law of Moses in order to avoid a greater evil, namely wife-murder. Hence
    Chrysostom says that "he removed the guilt from the sin." For though divorce
    remained inordinate, for which reason it is called a sin, it did not incur
    the debt of punishment, either temporal or eternal, in so far as it was done
    by Divine permission: and thus its guilt was taken away from it. And
    therefore he says again [*Hom. xxxii in the Opus Imperfectum falsely
    ascribed to St. John Chrysostom] that "divorce was permitted, an evil
    indeed, yet lawful." Those who hold the first opinion understand by this
    only that divorce incurred the debt of temporal punishment.<br />

    Whether it was lawful for a divorced wife to have another husband?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it was lawful for a divorced
    wife to have another husband. For in divorce the husband did a greater wrong
    by divorcing his wife than the wife by being divorced. But the husband
    could, without sin, marry another wife. Therefore the wife could without
    sin, marry another husband.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine, speaking about bigamy, says
    (De Bono Conjug. xv, xviii) that "when it was the manner it was no sin." Now
    at the time of the Old Law it was the custom for a wife after divorce to
    marry another husband: "When she is departed and marrieth another husband,"
    etc. Therefore the wife sinned not by marrying another husband.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, our Lord showed that the justice of the
    New Testament is superabundant in comparison with the justice of the Old
    Testament (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5">Mt. 5</a>).
    Now He said that it belongs to the superabundant justice of the New
    Testament that the divorced wife marry not another husband (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++5%3A32"
      >Mt. 5:32</a
    >). Therefore it was lawful in the Old Law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, are the words of Mt. 5:32, "He
    that shall marry her that is put away committeth adultery." Now adultery was
    never permitted in the Old Law. Therefore it was not lawful for the divorced
    wife to have another husband.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++24%3A3"
      >Dt. 24:3</a
    >) that a divorced woman who marries another husband "is defiled, and is
    become abominable before the Lord." Therefore she sinned by marrying another
    husband.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the first above mentioned opinion
    (<a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>), she sinned by marrying
    another husband after being divorced, because her first marriage still held
    good. For "the woman... whilst her husband liveth, is bound to the law of
    her husband" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++7%3A2"
      >Rm. 7:2</a
    >): and she could not have several husbands at one time. But according to
    the second opinion, just as it was lawful by virtue of the Divine
    dispensation for a husband to divorce his wife, so could the wife marry
    another husband, because the indissolubility of marriage was removed by
    reason of the divine dispensation: and as long as that indissolubility
    remains the saying of the Apostle holds.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Accordingly to reply to the arguments on either side:</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It was lawful for a husband to have
    several wives at one time by virtue of the divine dispensation: wherefore
    having put one away he could marry another even though the former marriage
    were not dissolved. But it was never lawful for a wife to have several
    husbands. Wherefore the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In this saying of Augustine manner [mos]
    does not signify custom but good manners; in the same sense a person is said
    to have manners [morigeratus] because he has good manners; and "moral"
    philosophy takes its name from the same source.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Our Lord shows the superabundance of the
    New Law over the Old in respect of the counsels, not only as regards those
    things which the Old Law permitted, but also as regards those things which
    were forbidden in the Old Law, and yet were thought by many to be permitted
    on account of the precepts being incorrectly explained---for instance that
    of the hatred towards our enemies. and so is it in the matter of divorce.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The saying of our Lord refers to the
    time of the New Law, when the aforesaid permission was recalled. In the same
    way we are to understand the statement of Chrysostom [*Hom. xii in the Opus
    Imperfectum falsely ascribed to St. John Chrysostom], who says that "a man
    who divorces his wife according to the law is guilty of four crimes: for in
    God's sight he is a murderer," in so far as he has the purpose of killing
    his wife unless he divorce her; "and because he divorces her without her
    having committed fornication," in which case alone the law of the Gospel
    allows a man to put away his wife; "and again, because he makes her an
    adulteress, and the man whom she marries an adulterer."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A gloss observes here: "She is defiled
    and abominable, namely in the judgment of him who first put her away as
    being defiled," and consequently it does not follow that she is defiled
    absolutely speaking; or she is said to be defiled just as a person who had
    touched a dead or leprous body was said to be unclean with the uncleanness,
    not of sin, but of a certain legal irregularity. Wherefore a priest could
    not marry a widow or a divorced woman.<br />

    Whether a husband could lawfully take back the wife he had divorced?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a husband could lawfully take
    back the wife he had divorced. For it is lawful to undo what was ill done.
    But for the husband to divorce his wife was ill done. Therefore it was
    lawful for him to undo it, by taking back his wife.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it has always been lawful to be
    indulgent to the sinner, because this is a moral precept, which obtains in
    every law. Now the husband by taking back the wife he had divorced was
    indulgent to one who had sinned. Therefore this also was lawful.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the reason given (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++24%3A4"
      >Dt. 24:4</a
    >) for its being unlawful to take back a divorced wife was "because she is
    defiled." But the divorced wife is not defiled except by marrying another
    husband. Therefore at least it was lawful to take back a divorced wife
    before she married again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++24%3A4"
      >Dt. 24:4</a
    >) that "the former husband cannot take her again," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the law concerning the bill of divorce two
    things were permitted, namely for the husband to put away the wife, and for
    the divorced wife to take another husband; and two things were commanded,
    namely that the bill of divorce should be written, and secondly that the
    husband who divorced his wife could not take her back. According to those
    who hold the first opinion (<a href="XP067.html#XPQ67A3THEP1">Article [3]</a
    >) this was done in punishment of the woman who married again, and that it
    was by this sin that she was defiled: but according to the others it was
    done that a husband might not be too ready to divorce his wife if he could
    nowise take her back afterwards.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In order to prevent the evil committed
    by a man in divorcing his wife, it was ordered that the husband could not
    take back his divorced wife, as stated above: and for this reason it was
    ordered by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It was always lawful to be indulgent to
    the sinner as regards the unkindly feelings of the heart, but not as regards
    the punishment appointed by God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> There are two opinions on this point.
    For some say that it was lawful for a divorced wife to be reconciled to her
    husband, unless she were joined in marriage to another husband. For then, on
    account of the adultery to which she had voluntarily yielded, it was
    assigned to her in punishment that she should not return to her former
    husband. Since, however, the law makes no distinction in its prohibition,
    others say that from the moment that she was put away she could not be taken
    back, even before marrying again, because the defilement must be understood
    not in reference to sin, but as explained above (<a
      href="XP067.html#XPQ67A4THEP1"
      >Article [4]</a
    >, ad 3).<br />

    Whether the reason for divorce was hatred for the wife?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the reason for divorce was
    hatred for the wife. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Malachi+2%3A16"
      >Malachi 2:16</a
    >): "When thou shalt hate her put her away." Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++24%3A1"
      >Dt. 24:1</a
    >): "If... she find not favor in his eyes, for some uncleanness," etc.
    Therefore the same conclusion follows as before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> On the contrary, Barrenness and fornication are
    more opposed to marriage than hatred. Therefore they ought to have been
    reasons for divorce rather than hatred.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, hatred may be caused by the virtue of
    the person hated. Therefore, if hatred is a sufficient reason, a woman could
    be divorced on account of her virtue, which is absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, "If a man marry a wife and afterwards
    hate her, and seek occasions to put her away"* alleging that she was not a
    virgin when he married her, should he fail to prove this, he shall be
    beaten, and shall be condemned in a hundred sicles of silver, and he shall
    be unable to put her away all the days of his life (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++22%3A13-19"
      >Dt. 22:13-19</a
    >). [*The rest of the passage is apparently quoted from memory.] Therefore
    hatred is not a sufficient reason for divorce.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is the general opinion of holy men that the
    reason for permission being given to divorce a wife was the avoidance of
    wife-murder. Now the proximate cause of murder is hatred: wherefore the
    proximate cause of divorce was hatred. But hatred proceeds, like love, from
    a cause. Wherefore we must assign to divorce certain remote causes which
    were a cause of hatred. For Augustine says in his gloss (De Serm. Dom. in
    Monte i, 14): "In the Law there were many causes for divorcing a wife:
    Christ admitted none but fornication: and He commands other grievances to be
    borne for conjugal fidelity and chastity." Such causes are imperfections
    either of body, as sickness or some notable deformity, or in soul as
    fornication or the like which amounts to moral depravity. Some, however,
    restrict these causes within narrower limits, saying with sufficient
    probability that it was not lawful to divorce a wife except for some cause
    subsequent to the marriage; and that not even then could it be done for any
    such cause, but only for such as could hinder the good of the offspring,
    whether in body as barrenness, or leprosy and the like, or in soul, for
    instance if she were a woman of wicked habits which her children through
    continual contact with her would imitate. There is however a gloss on Dt.
    24:1, "If... she find not favor in his eyes," which would seem to restrict
    them yet more, namely to sin, by saying that there "uncleanness" denotes
    sin: but "sin" in the gloss refers not only to the morality of the soul but
    also to the condition of the body. Accordingly we grant the first two
    objections.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Barrenness and other like things are
    causes of hatred, and so they are remote causes of divorce.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> No one is hateful on account of virtue
    as such, because goodness is the cause of love. Wherefore the argument does
    not hold.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The husband was punished in that case by
    being unable to put away his wife for ever, just as in the case when he had
    corrupted a maid (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++22%3A28-30"
      >Dt. 22:28-30</a

    Whether the causes of divorce had to be written in the bill?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the causes of divorce had to
    be written in the bill: because the husband was absolved from the punishment
    of the law by the written bill of divorce. But this would seem altogether
    unjust, unless sufficient causes were alleged for a divorce. Therefore it
    was necessary for them to be written in the bill.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, seemingly this document was of no use
    except to show the causes for divorce. Therefore, if they were not written
    down, the bill was delivered for no purpose.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the Master says that it was so in the
    text (Sent. iv, D, 33).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The causes for divorce were either sufficient
    or not. If they were sufficient, the wife was debarred from a second
    marriage, though this was allowed her by the Law. If they were insufficient,
    the divorce was proved to be unjust, and therefore could not be effected.
    Therefore the causes for divorce were by no means particularized in the
    bill.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The causes for divorce were not particularized
    in the bill, but were indicated in a general way, so as to prove the justice
    of the divorce. According to Josephus (Antiq. iv, 6) this was in order that
    the woman, having the written bill of divorce, might take another husband,
    else she would not have been believed. Wherefore according to him it was
    written in this wise: "I promise never to have thee with me again." But
    according to Augustine (Contra Faust. xix, 26) the bill was put into writing
    in order to cause a delay, and that the husband might be dissuaded by the
    counsel of the notaries to refrain from his purpose of divorce.
