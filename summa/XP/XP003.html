<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contrition is not the greatest possible sorrow 
in the world. For sorrow is the sensation of hurt. But some hurts are 
more keenly felt than the hurt of sin, e.g. the hurt of a wound. 
Therefore contrition is not the greatest sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we judge of a cause according to its effect. Now the 
effect of sorrow is tears. Since therefore sometimes a contrite person 
does not shed outward tears for his sins, whereas he weeps for the death 
of a friend, or for a blow, or the like, it seems that contrition is not 
the greatest sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the more a thing is mingled with its contrary, the less 
its intensity. But the sorrow of contrition has a considerable admixture 
of joy, because the contrite man rejoices in his delivery, in the hope of 
pardon, and in many like things. Therefore his sorrow is very slight.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the sorrow of contrition is a kind of displeasure. But 
there are many things more displeasing to the contrite than their past 
sins; for they would not prefer to suffer the pains of hell rather than 
to sin. nor to have suffered, nor yet to suffer all manner of temporal 
punishment; else few would be found contrite. Therefore the sorrow of 
contrition is not the greatest.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> According to Augustine (De Civ. Dei xiv, 7, 9), "all 
sorrow is based on love." Now the love of charity, on which the sorrow of 
contrition is based, is the greatest love. Therefore the sorrow of 
contrition is the greatest sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, sorrow is for evil. Therefore the greater the evil, the greater 
the sorrow. But the fault is a greater evil than its punishment. 
Therefore contrition which is sorrow for fault, surpasses all other 
sorrow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>, <A Href="XP001.html#XPQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1), there is a twofold 
sorrow in contrition: one is in the will, and is the very essence of 
contrition, being nothing else than displeasure at past sin, and this 
sorrow, in contrition, surpasses all other sorrows. For the more pleasing 
a thing is, the more displeasing is its contrary. Now the last end is 
above all things pleasing: wherefore sin, which turns us away from the 
last end, should be, above all things, displeasing. The other sorrow is 
in the sensitive part, and is caused by the former sorrow either from 
natural necessity, in so far as the lower powers follow the movements of 
the higher, or from choice, in so far as a penitent excites in himself 
this sorrow for his sins. In neither of these ways is such sorrow, of 
necessity, the greatest, because the lower powers are more deeply moved 
by  their own objects than through redundance from the higher powers. 
Wherefore the nearer the operation of the higher powers approaches to the 
objects of the lower powers, the more do the latter follow the movement 
of the former. Consequently there is greater pain in the sensitive part, 
on account of a sensible hurt, than that which redounds into the 
sensitive part from the reason; and likewise, that which redounds from 
the reason when it deliberates on corporeal things, is greater than that 
which redounds from the reason in considering spiritual things. Therefore 
the sorrow which results in the sensitive part from the reason's 
displeasure at sin, is not greater than the other sorrows of which that 
same part is the subject: and likewise, neither is the sorrow which is 
assumed voluntarily greater than other sorrows---both because the lower 
appetite does not obey the higher appetite infallibly, as though in the 
lower appetite there should arise a passion of such intensity and of such 
a kind as the higher appetite might ordain---and because the passions are 
employed by the reason, in acts of virtue, according to a certain 
measure, which the sorrow that is without virtue sometimes does not 
observe, but exceeds.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Just as sensible sorrow is on account of the sensation of 
hurt, so interior sorrow is on account of the thought of something 
hurtful. Therefore, although the hurt of sin is not perceived by the 
external sense, yet it is perceived to be the most grievous hurt by the 
interior sense or reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Affections of the body are the immediate result of the 
sensitive passions and, through them, of the emotions of the higher 
appetite. Hence it is that bodily tears flow more quickly from sensible 
sorrow, or even from a thing that hurts the senses, than from the 
spiritual sorrow of contrition.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The joy which a penitent has for his sorrow does not lessen 
his displeasure (for it is not contrary to it), but increases it, 
according as every operation is increased by the delight which it causes, 
as stated in Ethic. x, 5. Thus he who delights in learning a science, 
learns the better, and, in like manner, he who rejoices in his 
displeasure, is the more intensely displeased. But it may well happen 
that this joy tempers the sorrow that results from the reason in the 
sensitive part.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The degree of displeasure at a thing should be 
proportionate to the degree of its malice. Now the malice of mortal sin 
is measured from Him against Whom it is committed, inasmuch as it is 
offensive to Him; and from him who sins, inasmuch as it is hurtful to 
him. And, since man should love God more than himself, therefore he 
should hate sin, as an offense against God, more than as being hurtful to 
himself. Now it is hurtful to him chiefly because it separates him from 
God; and in this respect the separation from God which is a punishment, 
should be more displeasing than the sin itself, as causing this hurt 
(since what is hated on account of something else, is less hated), but 
less than the sin, as an offense against God. Again, among all the 
punishments of malice a certain order is observed according to the  
degree of the hurt. Consequently, since this is the greatest hurt, 
inasmuch as it consists in privation of the greatest good, the greatest 
of all punishments will be separation from God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, with regard to this displeasure, it is necessary to observe that 
there is also an accidental degree of malice, in respect of the present 
and the past; since what is past, is no more, whence it has less of the 
character of malice or goodness. Hence it is that a man shrinks from 
suffering an evil at the present, or at some future time, more than he 
shudders at the past evil: wherefore also, no passion of the soul 
corresponds directly to the past, as sorrow corresponds to present evil, 
and fear to future evil. Consequently, of two past evils, the mind 
shrinks the more from that one which still produces a greater effect at 
the present time, or which, it fears, will produce a greater effect in 
the future, although in the past it was the lesser evil. And, since the 
effect of the past sin is sometimes not so keenly felt as the effect of 
the past punishment, both because sin is more perfectly remedied than 
punishment, and because bodily defect is more manifest than spiritual 
defect, therefore even a man, who is well disposed, sometimes feels a 
greater abhorrence of his past punishment than of his past sin, although 
he would be ready to suffer the same punishment over again rather than 
commit the same sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must also observe, in comparing sin with punishment, that some 
punishments are inseparable from offense of God, e.g. separation from 
God; and some also are everlasting, e.g. the punishment of hell. 
Therefore the punishment to which is connected offense of God is to be 
shunned in the same way as sin; whereas that which is everlasting is 
simply to be shunned more than sin. If, however, we separate from these 
punishments the notion of offense, and consider only the notion of 
punishment, they have the character of malice, less than sin has as an 
offense against God: and for this reason should cause less displeasure.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must, however, take note that, although the contrite should be thus 
disposed, yet he should not be questioned about his feelings, because man 
cannot easily measure them. Sometimes that which displeases least seems 
to displease most, through being more closely connected with some 
sensible hurt, which is more known to us.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the sorrow of contrition cannot be too great. 
For no sorrow can be more immoderate than that which destroys its own 
subject. But the sorrow of contrition, if it be so great as to cause 
death or corruption of the body, is praiseworthy. For Anselm says (Orat. 
lii): "Would that such were the exuberance of my inmost soul, as to dry 
up the marrow of my body"; and Augustine [*De Contritione Cordis, work of 
an unknown author] confesses that "he deserves to blind his eyes with 
tears."  Therefore the sorrow of contrition cannot be too great.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sorrow of contrition results from the love of 
charity. But the love of charity cannot be too great. Neither, therefore, 
can the sorrow of contrition be too great.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> On the contrary, Every moral virtue is destroyed by excess and 
deficiency. But contrition is an act of a moral virtue, viz. penance, 
since it is a part of justice. Therefore sorrow for sins can be too great.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition, as regards the sorrow in the reason, i.e. the 
displeasure, whereby the sin is displeasing through being an offense 
against God, cannot be too great; even as neither can the love of charity 
be too great, for when this is increased the aforesaid displeasure is 
increased also. But, as regards the sensible sorrow, contrition may be 
too great, even as outward affliction of the body may be too great. In 
all these things the rule should be the safeguarding of the subject, and 
of that general well-being which suffices for the fulfillment of one's 
duties; hence it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++12%3A1">Rm. 12:1</a>): "Let your sacrifice be reasonable 
[*Vulg.: 'Present your bodies . . . a reasonable sacrifice']."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Anselm desired the marrow of his body to be dried up by the 
exuberance of his devotion, not as regards the natural humor, but as to 
his bodily desires and concupiscences. And, although Augustine 
acknowledged that he deserved to lose the use of his bodily eyes on 
account of his sins, because every sinner deserves not only eternal, but 
also temporal death, yet he did not wish his eyes to be blinded.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This objection considers the sorrow which is in the reason: 
while the Third considers the sorrow of the sensitive part.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether sorrow for one sin should be greater than for another?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that sorrow for one sin need not be greater than 
for another. For Jerome (Ep. cviii) commends Paula for that "she deplored 
her slightest sins as much as great ones." Therefore one need not be more 
sorry for one sin than for another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the movement of contrition is instantaneous. Now one 
instantaneous movement cannot be at the same time more intense and more 
remiss. Therefore contrition for one sin need not be greater than for 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, contrition is for sin chiefly as turning us away from 
God. But all mortal sins agree in turning us away from God, since they 
all deprive us of grace whereby the soul is united to God. Therefore we 
should have equal contrition for all mortal sins. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dt++25%3A2">Dt. 25:2</a>): "According to the measure of 
the sin, shall the measure also of the stripes be." Now, in contrition, 
the stripes are measured according to the sins, because to contrition is 
united the purpose of making satisfaction. Therefore contrition should be 
for one sin more than for another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, man should be contrite for that which he ought to have avoided. 
But he ought to avoid one sin more than another, if that sin is more 
grievous, and it be necessary to do one or the other. Therefore, in like 
manner, he ought to be more sorry for one, viz. the more grievous, than 
for the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We may speak of contrition in two ways: first, in so far 
as it corresponds to each single sin, and thus, as regards the sorrow in 
the higher appetite, a man ought to be more sorry for a more grievous 
sin, because there is more reason for sorrow, viz. the offense against 
God, in such a sin than in another, since the more inordinate the act is, 
the more it offends God. In like manner, since the greater sin deserves a 
greater punishment, the sorrow also of the sensitive part, in so far as 
it is voluntarily undergone for sin, as the punishment thereof, ought to 
be greater where the sin is greater. But in so far as the emotions of the 
lower appetite result from the impression of the higher appetite, the 
degree of sorrow depends on the disposition of the lower faculty to the 
reception of impressions from the higher faculty, and not on the 
greatness of the sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] Body Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, contrition may be taken in so far as it is directed to all 
one's sins together, as in the act of justification. Such contrition 
arises either from the consideration of each single sin, and thus 
although it is but one act, yet the distinction of the sins remains 
virtually therein; or, at least, it includes the purpose of thinking of 
each sin; and in this way too it is habitually more for one than for 
another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Paula is commended, not for deploring all her sins equally, 
but because she grieved for her slight sins as much as though they were 
grave sins, in comparison with other persons who grieve for their sins: 
but for graver sins she would have grieved much more.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In that instantaneous movement of contrition, although it 
is not possible to find an actually distinct intensity in respect of each 
individual sin, yet it is found in the way explained above; and also in 
another way, in so far as, in this general contrition, each individual 
sin is related to that particular motive of sorrow which occurs to the 
contrite person, viz. the offense against God. For he who loves a whole, 
loves its parts potentially although not actually, and accordingly he 
loves some parts more and some less, in proportion to their relation to 
the whole; thus he who loves a community, virtually loves each one more 
or less according to their respective relations to the common good. In 
like manner he who is sorry for having offended God,  implicitly grieves 
for his different sins in different ways, according as by them he 
offended God more or less.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[3] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although each mortal sin turns us away from God and 
deprives us of His grace, yet some remove us further away than others, 
inasmuch as through their inordinateness they become more out of harmony 
with the order of the Divine goodness, than others do.<br>
