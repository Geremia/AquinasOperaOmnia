    OF BIGAMY AND OF THE IRREGULARITY CONTRACTED THEREBY (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider bigamy and the irregularity contracted
    thereby. Under this head there are five points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP066.html#XPQ66A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether irregularity attaches to
    the bigamy that consists in having two successive wives?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP066.html#XPQ66A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether irregularity is contracted
    by one who has two wives at once?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP066.html#XPQ66A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether irregularity is contracted
    by marrying one who is not a virgin?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP066.html#XPQ66A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether bigamy is removed by
    Baptism?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP066.html#XPQ66A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether a dispensation can be
    granted to a bigamous person?

  <h3 align="left">Whether irregularity attaches to bigamy?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that irregularity is not attached
    to the bigamy that consists in having two wives successively. For multitude
    and unity are consequent upon being. Since then non-being does not cause
    plurality, a man who has two wives successively, the one in being, the other
    in non-being, does not thereby become the husband of more than one wife, so
    as to be debarred, according to the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++3%3A2;+Titus+1:6"
      >1 Tim. 3:2; Titus 1:6</a
    >), from the episcopate.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man who commits fornication with
    several women gives more evidence of incontinence than one who has several
    wives successively. Yet in the first case a man does not become irregular.
    Therefore neither in the second should he become irregular.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if bigamy causes irregularity, this is
    either because of the sacrament, or because of the carnal intercourse. Now
    it is not on account of the former, for if a man had contracted marriage by
    words of the present and, his wife dying before the consummation of the
    marriage, he were to marry another, he would become irregular, which is
    against the decree of Innocent III (cap. Dubium, De bigamia). Nor again is
    it on account of the second, for then a man who had committed fornication
    with several women would become irregular: which is false. Therefore bigamy
    nowise causes irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By the sacrament of order a man is appointed to
    the ministry of the sacraments; and he who has to administer the sacraments
    to others must suffer from no defect in the sacraments. Now there is a
    defect in a sacrament when the entire signification of the sacrament is not
    found therein. And the sacrament of marriage signifies the union of Christ
    with the Church, which is the union of one with one. Therefore the perfect
    signification of the sacrament requires the husband to have only one wife,
    and the wife to have but one husband; and consequently bigamy, which does
    away with this, causes irregularity. And there are four kinds of bigamy: the
    first is when a man has several lawful wives successively; the second is
    when a man has several wives at once, one in law, the other in fact; the
    third, when he has several successively, one in law, the other in fact; the
    fourth, when a man marries a widow. Accordingly irregularity attaches to all
    of these.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    There is another consequent reason assigned, since those who receive the
    sacrament of order should be signalized by the greatest spirituality, both
    because they administer spiritual things, namely the sacraments, and because
    they teach spiritual things, and should be occupied in spiritual matters.
    Wherefore since concupiscence is most incompatible with spirituality,
    inasmuch as it makes a man to be wholly carnal, they should give no sign of
    persistent concupiscence, which does indeed show itself in bigamous persons,
    seeing that they were unwilling to be content with one wife. The first
    reason however is the better.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The multitude of several wives at the
    same time is a multitude simply, wherefore a multitude of this kind is
    wholly inconsistent with the signification of the sacrament, so that the
    sacrament is voided on that account. But the multitude of several successive
    wives is a multitude relatively, wherefore it does not entirely destroy the
    signification of the sacrament, nor does it void the sacrament in its
    essence but in its perfection, which is required of those who are the
    dispensers of sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although those who are guilty of
    fornication give proof of greater concupiscence, theirs is not a so
    persistent concupiscence, since by fornication one party is not bound to the
    other for ever; and consequently no defect attaches to the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> As stated above, bigamy causes
    irregularity, because it destroys the perfect signification of the
    sacrament: which signification is seated both in the union of minds, as
    expressed by the consent, and in the union of bodies. Wherefore bigamy must
    affect both of these at the same time in order to cause irregularity. Hence
    the decree of Innocent III disposes of the statement of the Master (Sent.
    iv, D, 27), namely that consent alone by words of the present is sufficient
    to cause irregularity.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether irregularity results from bigamy, when one husband has two wives,
    one in law, the other in fact?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that irregularity does not result
    from bigamy when one husband has two wives at the same time, one in law and
    one in fact. For when the sacrament is void there can be no defect in the
    sacrament. Now when a man marries a woman in fact but not in law there is no
    sacrament, since such a union does not signify the union of Christ with the
    Church. Therefore since irregularity does not result from bigamy except on
    account of a defect in the sacrament, it would seem that no irregularity
    attaches to bigamy of this kind.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a man has intercourse with a woman
    whom he has married in fact and not in law, he commits fornication if he has
    not a lawful wife, or adultery if he has. But a man does not become
    irregular by dividing his flesh among several women by fornication or
    adultery. Therefore neither does he by the aforesaid kind of bigamy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man, before knowing
    carnally the woman he has married in law, marries another in fact and not in
    law, and knows her carnally, whether the former woman be living or dead. Now
    this man has contracted marriage with several women either in law or in
    fact, and yet he is not irregular, since he has not divided his flesh among
    several women. Therefore irregularity is not contracted by reason of the
    aforesaid kind of bigamy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Irregularity is contracted in the two second
    kinds of bigamy, for although in the one there is no sacrament, there is a
    certain likeness to a sacrament. Wherefore these two kinds are secondary,
    and the first is the principal kind in causing irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although there is no sacrament in this
    case there is a certain likeness to a sacrament, whereas there is no such
    likeness in fornication or adultery. Hence the comparison fails.
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the Second Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In this case the man is not reckoned a
    bigamist, because the first marriage lacked its perfect signification.
    Nevertheless if, by the judgment of the Church, he be compelled to return to
    his first wife and carnally to know her, he becomes irregular forthwith,
    because the irregularity is the result not of the sin but of imperfect
    signification.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether irregularity is contracted by marrying one who is not a virgin?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that irregularity is not contracted
    by marrying one who is not a virgin. For a man's own defect is a greater
    impediment to him than the defect of another. But if the man himself who
    marries is not a virgin he does not become irregular. Therefore much less
    does he if his wife is not a virgin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it may happen that a man marries a woman
    after corrupting her. Now, seemingly, such a man does not become irregular,
    since he has not divided his flesh among several, nor has his wife done so,
    and yet he marries a woman who is not a virgin. Therefore this kind of
    bigamy does not cause irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man can become irregular except
    voluntarily. But sometimes a man marries involuntarily one who is not a
    virgin, for instance when he thinks her a virgin and afterwards, by knowing
    her carnally, finds that she is not. Therefore this kind does not always
    cause irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, unlawful intercourse after marriage is
    more guilty than before marriage. Now if a wife, after the marriage has been
    consummated, has intercourse with another man, her husband does not become
    irregular, otherwise he would be punished for his wife's sin. Moreover, it
    might happen that, after knowing of this, he pays her the debt at her
    asking, before she is accused and convicted of adultery. Therefore it would
    seem that this kind of bigamy does not cause irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says (Regist. ii, ep. 37): "We
    command thee never to make unlawful ordinations, nor to admit to holy orders
    a bigamist, or one who has married a woman that is not a virgin, or one who
    is unlettered, or one who is deformed in his limbs, or bound to do penance
    or to perform some civil duty, or who is in any state of subjection."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In the union of Christ with the Church unity is
    found on either side. Consequently whether we find division of the flesh on
    the part of the husband, or on the part of the wife, there is a defect of
    sacrament. There is, however, a difference, because on the part of the
    husband it is required that he should not have married another wife, but not
    that he should be a virgin, whereas on the part of the wife it is also
    required that she be a virgin. The reason assigned by those versed in the
    Decretals is because the bridegroom signifies the Church militant which is
    entrusted to the care of a bishop, and in which there are many corruptions,
    while the spouse signifies Christ Who was a virgin: wherefore virginity on
    the part of the spouse, but not on the part of the bridegroom, is required
    in order that a man be made a bishop. This reason, however, is expressly
    contrary to the words of the Apostle (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A25"
      >Eph. 5:25</a
    >): "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ also loved the Church," which show
    that the bride signifies the Church, and the bridegroom Christ; and again he
    says (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eph++5%3A23"
      >Eph. 5:23</a
    >): "Because the husband is the head of the wife, as Christ is the head of
    the Church." Wherefore others say that Christ is signified by the
    bridegroom, and that the bride signifies the Church triumphant in which
    there is no stain. Also that the synagogue was first united to Christ as a
    concubine; so that the sacrament loses nothing of its signification if the
    bridegroom previously had a concubine. But this is most absurd, since just
    as the faith of ancients and of moderns is one, so is the Church one.
    Wherefore those who served God at the time of the synagogue belonged to the
    unity of the Church in which we serve God. Moreover this is expressly
    contrary to Jer. 3:14, Ezech. 16:8, Osee 2:16, where the espousals of the
    synagogue are mentioned explicitly: so that she was not as a concubine but
    as a wife. Again, according to this, fornication would be the sacred sign
    [sacramentum] of that union, which is absurd. Wherefore heathendom, before
    being espoused to Christ in the faith of the Church, was corrupted by the
    devil through idolatry. Hence we must say otherwise that irregularity is
    caused by a defect in the sacrament itself. Now when corruption of the flesh
    occurs outside wedlock on account of a preceding marriage, it causes no
    defect in the sacrament on the part of the person corrupted, but it causes a
    defect in the other person, because the act of one who contracts marriage
    terminates not in himself, but in the other party, wherefore it takes its
    species from its term, which, moreover, in regard to that act, is the matter
    as it were of the sacrament. Consequently if a woman were able to receive
    orders, just as her husband becomes irregular through marrying one who is
    not a virgin, but not through his not being a virgin when he marries, so
    also would a woman become irregular if she were to marry a man who is not a
    virgin, but not if she were no longer a virgin when she married ---unless
    she had been corrupted by reason of a previous marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>This suffices for the Reply to the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In this case opinions differ. It is,
    however, more probable that he is not irregular, because he has not divided
    his flesh among several women.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Irregularity is not the infliction of a
    punishment, but the defect of a sacrament. Consequently it is not always
    necessary for bigamy to be voluntary in order to cause irregularity. Hence a
    man who marries a woman, thinking her to be a virgin, whereas she is not,
    becomes irregular by knowing her carnally.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> If a woman commits fornication after
    being married, her husband does not become irregular on that account, unless
    he again knows her carnally after she has been corrupted by adultery, since
    otherwise the corruption of the wife nowise affects the marriage act of the
    husband. But though he be compelled by law to pay her the debt, or if he do
    so at her request, being compelled by his own conscience, even before she is
    convicted of adultery, he becomes irregular, albeit opinions differ on this
    point. However, what we have said is more probable, since here it is not a
    question of sin, but of signification only.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether bigamy is removed by Baptism?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that bigamy is removed by Baptism.
    For Jerome says in his commentary on the Epistle to Titus (1:6, "the husband
    of one wife") that if a man has had several wives before receiving Baptism,
    or one before and another after Baptism, he is not a bigamist. Therefore
    bigamy is removed by Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who does what is more, does what is
    less. Now Baptism removes all sin, and sin is a greater thing than
    irregularity. Therefore it removes irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Baptism takes away all punishment
    resulting from an act. Now such is the irregularity of bigamy. Therefore,
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a bigamist is irregular because he is
    deficient in the representation of Christ. Now by Baptism we are fully
    conformed to Christ. Therefore this irregularity is removed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, the sacraments of the New Law are more
    efficacious than the sacraments of the Old Law. But the sacraments of the
    Old Law removed irregularities according to the Master's statement (Sent.
    iv,). Therefore Baptism also, being the most efficacious of the sacraments
    of the New Law, removes the irregularity consequent upon bigamy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xviii):
    "Those understand the question more correctly who maintain that a man who
    has married a second wife, though he was a catechumen or even a pagan at the
    time, cannot be ordained, because it is a question of a sacrament, not of a
    sin."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, according to the same authority (De Bono Conjug. xviii) "a woman
    who has been corrupted while a catechumen or a pagan cannot after Baptism be
    consecrated among God's virgins." Therefore in like manner one who was a
    bigamist before Baptism cannot be ordained.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Baptism removes sin, but does not dissolve
    marriage. Wherefore since irregularity results from marriage, it cannot be
    removed by Baptism, as Augustine says (De Bono Conjug. xviii).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In this case Jerome's opinion is not
    followed: unless perhaps he wished to explain that he means that a
    dispensation should be more easily granted.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It does not follow that what does a
    greater thing, does a lesser, unless it be directed to the latter. This is
    not so in the case in point, because Baptism is not directed to the removal
    of an irregularity.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This must be understood of punishments
    consequent upon actual sin, which are, or have yet to be, inflicted: for one
    does not recover virginity by Baptism, nor again undivision of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Baptism conforms a man to Christ as
    regards the virtue of the mind, but not as to the condition of the body,
    which is effected by virginity or division of the flesh.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Those irregularities were contracted
    through slight and temporary causes, and consequently they could be removed
    by those sacraments. Moreover the latter were ordained for that purpose,
    whereas Baptism is not.<br />

    Whether it is lawful for a bigamist to receive a dispensation?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unlawful for a bigamist to be
    granted a dispensation. For it is said (Extra, De bigamis, cap. Nuper): "It
    is not lawful to grant a dispensation to clerics who, as far as they could
    do so, have taken to themselves a second wife."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is not lawful to grant a dispensation
    from the Divine law. Now whatever is in the canonical writings belongs to
    the Divine law. Since then in canonical Scripture the Apostle says (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++3%3A2"
      >1 Tim. 3:2</a
    >): "It behooveth... a bishop to be... the husband of one wife," it would
    seem that a dispensation cannot be granted in this matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one can receive a dispensation in
    what is essential to a sacrament. But it is essential to the sacrament of
    order that the recipient be not irregular, since the signification which is
    essential to a sacrament is lacking in one who is irregular. Therefore he
    cannot be granted a dispensation in this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, what is reasonably done cannot be
    reasonably undone. If, therefore, a bigamist can lawfully receive a
    dispensation, it was unreasonable that he should be irregular: which is
    inadmissible.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Lucius granted a dispensation to the
    bishop of Palermo who was a bigamist, as stated in the gloss on can. Lector,
    dist. 34.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Pope Martin [*Martinus Bracarensis: cap. xliii] says: "If a Reader
    marry a widow, let him remain a Reader, or if there be need for it, he may
    receive the Subdiaconate, but no higher order: and the same applies if he
    should be a bigamist." Therefore he may at least receive a dispensation as
    far as the Subdiaconate.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Irregularity attaches to bigamy not by natural,
    but by positive law; nor again is it one of the essentials of order that a
    man be not a bigamist, which is evident from the fact that if a bigamist
    present himself for orders, he receives the character. Wherefore the Pope
    can dispense altogether from such an irregularity; but a bishop, only as
    regards the minor orders, though some say that in order to prevent religious
    wandering abroad he can dispense therefrom as regards the major orders in
    those who wish to serve God in religion.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This Decretal shows that there is the
    same difficulty against granting a dispensation in those who have married
    several wives in fact, as if they had married them in law; but it does not
    prove that the Pope has no power to grant a dispensation in such cases.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This is true as regards things belonging
    to the natural law, and those which are essential to the sacraments, and to
    faith. But in those which owe their institution to the apostles, since the
    Church has the same power now as then of setting up and of putting down, she
    can grant a dispensation through him who holds the primacy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not every signification is essential to
    a sacrament, but that alone which belongs to the sacramental effect,* and
    this is not removed by irregularity. [*Leonine edition reads "officium,"
    some read "effectum"; the meaning is the same, and is best rendered as
    above.]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In particular cases there is no ratio
    that applies to all equally, on account of their variety. Hence what is
    reasonably established for all, in consideration of what happens in the
    majority of cases, can be with equal reason done away in a certain definite
    case.<br />
