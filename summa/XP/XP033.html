    OF THE REPETITION OF THIS SACRAMENT (TWO ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the repetition of this sacrament: under which head
    there are two points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP033.html#XPQ33A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether this sacrament ought to be
    repeated?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP033.html#XPQ33A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it ought to be repeated
    during the same sickness?

  <h3 align="left">Whether this sacrament ought to be repeated?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament ought not to be
    repeated. For the anointing of a man is of greater import than the anointing
    of a stone. But the anointing of an altar is not repeated, unless the altar
    be shattered. Neither, therefore, should Extreme Unction, whereby a man is
    anointed, be repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, nothing comes after what is extreme. But
    this unction is called extreme. Therefore it should not be repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> This sacrament is a spiritual healing applied
    under the form of a bodily cure. But a bodily cure is repeated. Therefore
    this sacrament also can be repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> No sacramental or sacrament, having an effect
    that lasts for ever, can be repeated, because this would imply that the
    sacrament had failed to produce that effect; and this would be derogatory to
    the sacrament. On the other hand a sacrament whose effect does not last for
    ever, can be repeated without disparaging that sacrament, in order that the
    lost effect may be recovered. And since health of body and soul, which is
    the effect of this sacrament, can be lost after it has been effected, it
    follows that this sacrament can, without disparagement thereto, be
    repeated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The stone is anointed in order that the
    altar may be consecrated, and the stone remains consecrated, as long as the
    altar remains, hence it cannot be anointed again. But a man is not
    consecrated by being anointed, since it does not imprint a character on him.
    Hence there is no comparison.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> What men think to be extreme is not
    always extreme in reality. It is thus that this sacrament is called Extreme
    Unction, because it ought not to be given save to those whose death men
    think to be nigh.<br />

    Whether this sacrament ought to be repeated during the same sickness?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament ought not to be
    repeated during the same sickness. For one disease demands one remedy. Now
    this sacrament is a spiritual remedy. Therefore it ought not to be repeated
    for one sickness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a sick man could be anointed more
    than once during one disease, this might be done for a whole day: which is
    absurd.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Sometimes a disease lasts long after the
    sacrament has been received, so that the remnants of sin, against which
    chiefly this sacrament is given, would be contracted. Therefore it ought to
    be given again.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament regards not only the sickness,
    but also the state of the sick man, because it ought not to be given except
    to those sick people who seem, in man's estimation, to be nigh to death. Now
    some diseases do not last long; so that if this sacrament is given at the
    time that the sick man is in a state of danger of death, he does not leave
    that state except the disease be cured, and thus he needs not to be anointed
    again. But if he has a relapse, it will be a second sickness, and he can be
    anointed again. on the other hand some diseases are of long duration, as
    hectic fever, dropsy and the like, and those who lie sick of them should not
    be anointed until they seem to be in danger of death. And if the sick man
    escape that danger while the disease continues, and be brought again thereby
    to the same state of danger, he can be anointed again, because it is, as it
    were, another state of sickness, although strictly speaking, it is not
    another sickness. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections.<br />
