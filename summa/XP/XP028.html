<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the solemn rite of Penance: under which  head there 
are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP028.html#XPQ28A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether a penance can be published or solemnized?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP028.html#XPQ28A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a solemn penance can be repeated?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP028.html#XPQ28A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether public penance should be imposed on women?

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a penance should not be published or 
solemnized. Because it is not lawful for a priest, even through fear, to 
divulge anyone's sin, however notorious it may be. Now a sin is published 
by a solemn penance. Therefore a penance should not be solemnized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the judgment should follow the nature of the tribunal. 
Now penance is a judgment pronounced in a secret tribunal. Therefore it 
should not be published or solemnized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, "Every deficiency is made good by penance" as Ambrose 
[*Cf. Hypognost. iii, among the spurious works ascribed to St. Augustine] 
states. Now solemnization has a contrary effect, since it involves the 
penitent in many deficiencies: for a layman cannot be promoted to the 
ranks of the clergy nor can a cleric be promoted to higher orders, after 
doing solemn penance. Therefore Penance should not be solemnized.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Penance is a sacrament. Now some kind of solemnity is 
observed in every sacrament. Therefore there should be some solemnity in 
Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the medicine should suit the disease. Now a sin is sometimes 
public, and by its example draws many to sin. Therefore the penance which 
is its medicine should also be public and solemn so as to give 
edification to many.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some penances should be public and solemn for four 
reasons. First, so that a public sin may have a public remedy; secondly, 
because he who has committed a very grave crime deserves the greatest 
confusion even in this life; thirdly, in order that it may deter others; 
fourthly, that he may be an example of repentance, lest those should 
despair, who have committed grievous sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The priest does not divulge the confession by imposing such 
a penance, though people may suspect the penitent of having committed 
some great sin. For a man is not certainly taken to be guilty, because he 
is punished, since sometimes one does penance for another: thus we read 
in the Lives of the Fathers of a certain man who, in order to incite his 
companion to do penance, did penance together with him. And if the sin be 
public, the penitent, by fulfilling his penance, shows that he has been 
to confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A solemn penance, as to its imposition, does not  go beyond 
the limits of a secret tribunal, since, just as the confession is made 
secretly, so the penance is imposed secretly. It is the execution of the 
penance, that goes beyond the limits of the secret tribunal: and there is 
nothing objectionable in this.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although Penance cancels all deficiencies, by restoring man 
to his former state of grace, yet it does not always restore him to his 
former dignity. Hence women after doing penance for fornication are not 
given the veil, because they do not recover the honor of virginity. In 
like manner, after doing public penance, a sinner does not recover his 
former dignity so as to be eligible for the clerical state and a bishop 
who would ordain such a one ought to be deprived of the power of 
ordaining, unless perhaps the needs of the Church or custom require it. 
In that case such a one would be admitted to minor orders by way of 
exception, but not to the sacred orders. First, on account of the dignity 
of the latter; secondly, for fear of relapse; thirdly, in order to avoid 
the scandal which the people might take through recollection of his 
former sins; fourthly, because he would not have the face to correct 
others, by reason of the publicity of his own sin.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a solemn penance can be repeated?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a solemn penance can be repeated. For those 
sacraments which do not imprint a character, can be solemnized a second 
time, such as the Eucharist, Extreme Unction and the like. But Penance 
does not imprint a character, therefore it can be solemnized over again.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, penance is solemnized on account of the gravity and 
publicity of the sin. Now, after doing penance, a person may commit the 
same sins over again, or even more grievous sins. Therefore the solemn 
penance should be imposed again.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Solemn penance signifies the expulsion of the first man 
from paradise. Now this was done but once. Therefore solemn penance 
should be imposed once only.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Solemn penance ought not to be repeated, for three 
reasons. First, lest frequency bring it into contempt. Secondly, on 
account of its signification; for it signifies the expulsion of the first 
man from paradise, which happened only once; thirdly, because the 
solemnization indicates, in a way, that one makes profession of continual 
repentance. Wherefore repetition is inconsistent with solemnization. And 
if the sinner fall again, he is not precluded from doing penance, but a 
solemn penance should not be imposed on him again.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In those sacraments which are solemnized again and again, 
repetition is not inconsistent with solemnity, as it is in the present 
case. Hence the comparison fails.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although, if we consider his crime, he ought to do the same 
penance again, yet the repeated solemnization is not  becoming, for the 
reasons stated above.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether solemn penance should be imposed on women and clerics, and whether any priest can impose it?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that solemn penance should not be imposed on women. 
Because, when this penance is imposed on a man, he has to cut his hair 
off. But this becomes not a woman, according to 1 Cor. 11:15. Therefore 
she should not do solemn penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> It also seems that it ought to be imposed on clerics. For it is 
enjoined on account of a grievous crime. Now the same sin is more 
grievous in a cleric than in a layman. Therefore it ought to be imposed 
on a cleric more than on a layman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> It also seems that it can be imposed by any priest. Because to 
absolve in the tribunal of Penance belongs to one who has the keys. Now 
an ordinary priest has the keys. Therefore he can administer this penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Every solemn penance is public, but not vice versa. For 
solemn penance is done as follows: "On the first day of Lent, these 
penitents clothed in sackcloth, with bare feet, their faces to the 
ground, and their hair shorn away, accompanied by their priests, present 
themselves to the bishop of the city at the door of the church. Having 
brought them into the church the bishop with all his clergy recites the 
seven penitential psalms, and then imposes his hand on them, sprinkles 
them with holy water, puts ashes on their heads, covers their shoulders 
with a hairshirt, and sorrowfully announces to them that as Adam was 
expelled from paradise, so are they expelled from the church. He then 
orders the ministers to put them out of the church, and the clergy follow 
reciting the responsory: 'In the sweat of thy brow,' etc. Every year on 
the day of our Lord's Supper they are brought back into the church by 
their priests, and there shall they be until the octave day of Easter, 
without however being admitted to Communion or to the kiss of peace. This 
shall be done every year as long as entrance into the church is forbidden 
them. The final reconciliation is reserved to the bishop, who alone can 
impose solemn penance" [*Cap. lxiv, dist. 50].<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; This penance can be imposed on men and women; but not on clerics, for 
fear of scandal. Nor ought such a penance to be imposed except for a 
crime which has disturbed the whole of the city.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand public but not solemn penance is that which is done in 
the presence of the Church, but without the foregoing solemnity, such as 
a pilgrimage throughout the world with a staff. A penance of this kind 
can be repeated, and can be imposed by a mere priest, even on a cleric. 
Sometimes however a solemn penance is taken to signify a public one: so 
that authorities speak of solemn penance in different senses. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The woman's hair is a sign of her subjection, a man's is 
not. Hence it is not proper for a woman to put aside her hair when doing 
penance, as it is for a man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although in the same kind of sin, a cleric offends more 
grievously than a layman, yet a solemn penance is not imposed on him, 
lest his orders should be an object of contempt. Thus deference is given 
not to the person but to his orders.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[28] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Grave sins need great care in their cure. Hence the 
imposition of a solemn penance, which is only applied for the most 
grievous sins, is reserved to the bishop.<br>
