</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem unfitting for impediments to be assigned to 
marriage. For marriage is a sacrament condivided with the others. But no 
impediments are assigned to the others. Neither therefore should they be 
assigned to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the less perfect a thing is the fewer its obstacles. Now 
matrimony is the least perfect of the sacraments. Therefore it should 
have either no impediments or very few.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, wherever there is disease, it is necessary to have a 
remedy for the disease. Now concupiscence, a remedy for which is 
permitted in matrimony (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:6">1 Cor. 7:6</a>), is in all. Therefore there should 
not be any impediment making it altogether unlawful for a particular 
person to marry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, unlawful means against the law. Now these  impediments 
that are assigned to matrimony are not against the natural law, because 
they are not found to be the same in each state of the human race, since 
more degrees of kindred come under prohibition at one time than at 
another. Nor, seemingly, can human law set impediments against marriage, 
since marriage, like the other sacraments, is not of human but of Divine 
institution. Therefore impediments should not be assigned to marriage, 
making it unlawful for a person to marry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, lawful and unlawful differ as that which is against the 
law from that which is not, and between these there is no middle term, 
since they are opposed according to affirmation and negation. Therefore 
there cannot be impediments to marriage, placing a person in a middle 
position between those who are lawful and those who are unlawful subjects 
of marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, union of man and woman is unlawful save in marriage. Now 
every unlawful union should be dissolved. Therefore if anything prevent a 
marriage being contracted, it will "de facto" dissolve it after it has 
been contracted; and thus impediments should not be assigned to marriage, 
which hinder it from being contracted, and dissolve it after it has been 
contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 7:</i></b> Further, no impediment can remove from a thing that which is part 
of its definition. Now indissolubility is part of the definition of 
marriage. Therefore there cannot be any impediments which annul a 
marriage already contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 8:</i></b> On the other hand, it would seem that there should be an infinite 
number of impediments to marriage. For marriage is a good. Now good may 
be lacking in an infinite number of ways, as Dionysius says (Div. Nom. 
iii). Therefore there is an infinite number of impediments to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Obj. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, the impediments to marriage arise from the conditions of 
individuals. But such like conditions are infinite in number. Therefore 
the impediments to marriage are also infinite.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 1/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In marriage, as in other sacraments, there are certain 
things essential to marriage, and others that belong to its 
solemnization. And since even without the things that pertain to its 
solemnization it is still a true sacrament, as also in the case of the 
other sacraments, it follows that the impediments to those things that 
pertain to the solemnization of this sacrament do not derogate from the 
validity of the marriage. These impediments are said to hinder the 
contracting of marriage, but they do not dissolve the marriage once 
contracted; such are the veto of the Church, or the holy seasons. Hence 
the verse:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  "The veto of the Church and holy tide
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Forbid the knot, but loose it not if tied."
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 2/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; On the other hand, those impediments which regard the  essentials of 
marriage make a marriage invalid, wherefore they are said not only to 
hinder the contracting of marriage, but to dissolve it if contracted; and 
they are contained in the following verse:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Error, station, vow, kinship, crime,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Difference of worship, force, holy orders,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  Marriage bond, honesty, affinity, impotence,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;  All these forbid marriage, and annul it though
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;   contracted."
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 3/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason for this number may be explained as follows: Marriage may be 
hindered either on the part of the contract or in regard to the 
contracting parties. If in the first way, since the marriage contract is 
made by voluntary consent, and this is incompatible with either ignorance 
or violence, there will be two impediments to marriage, namely "force," 
i.e. compulsion, and "error" in reference to ignorance. Wherefore the 
Master pronounced on these two impediments when treating of the cause of 
matrimony (Sent. iv, DD 29,30). Here, however, he is treating of the 
impediments as arising from the contracting parties, and these may be 
differentiated as follows. A person may be hindered from contracting 
marriage either simply, or with some particular person. If simply, so 
that he be unable to contract marriage with any woman, this can only be 
because he is hindered from performing the marriage act. This happens in 
two ways. First, because he cannot "de facto," either through being 
altogether unable---and thus we have the impediment of "impotence"---or 
through being unable to do so freely, and thus we have the impediment of 
the "condition of slavery." Secondly, because he cannot do it lawfully, 
and this because he is bound to continence, which happens in two ways, 
either through his being bound on account of the office he has undertaken 
to fulfill---and thus we have the impediment of "Order"---or on account 
of his having taken a vow---and thus "Vow" is an impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] Body Para. 4/4-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; If, however, a person is hindered from marrying, not simply but in 
reference to a particular person, this is either because he is bound to 
another person, and thus he who is married to one cannot marry another, 
which constitutes the impediment of the "bond of marriage"---or through 
lack of proportion to the other party, and this for three reasons. First, 
on account of too great a distance separating them, and thus we have 
"difference of worship"; secondly, on account of their being too closely 
related, and thus we have three impediments, namely "kinship," then 
"affinity," which denotes the close relationship between two persons, in 
reference to a third united to one of them by marriage, and the "justice 
of public honesty," where we have a close relationship between two 
persons arising out of the betrothal of one of them to a third person; 
thirdly, on account of a previous undue union between him and the woman, 
and thus the "crime of adultery" previously committed with her is an 
impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> There may be impediments to the other sacraments also in 
the omission either of that which is essential, or of that which pertains 
to the solemnization of the sacrament, as stated above. However, 
impediments are assigned to matrimony rather than to the other sacraments 
for three reasons. First, because matrimony consists of two persons, and 
consequently can be impeded in more ways than the other sacraments which 
refer to one person taken individually; secondly, because matrimony has 
its cause in us and in God, while some of the other sacraments have their 
cause in God alone. Wherefore penance which in a manner has a cause in 
us, is assigned certain impediments by the Master (Sent. iv, D, 16), such 
as hypocrisy, the public games, and so forth; thirdly, because other 
sacraments are objects of command or counsel, as being more perfect 
goods, whereas marriage is a matter of indulgence, as being a less 
perfect good (<A Href="http://bible.gospelcom.net/bible?1+Cor++7:6">1 Cor. 7:6</a>). Wherefore, in order to afford an opportunity 
of proficiency towards a greater good, more impediments are assigned to 
matrimony than to the other sacraments.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The more perfect things can be hindered in more ways, in so 
far as more conditions are required for them. And if an imperfect thing 
requires more conditions, there will be more impediments to it; and thus 
it is in matrimony.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument would hold, were there no other and more 
efficacious remedies for the disease of concupiscence; which is false.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Persons are said to be unlawful subjects for marriage 
through being contrary to the law whereby marriage is established. Now 
marriage as fulfilling an office of nature is established by the natural 
law; as a sacrament, by the Divine law; as fulfilling an office of 
society, by the civil law. Consequently a person may be rendered an 
unlawful subject of marriage by any of the aforesaid laws. Nor does the 
comparison with the other sacraments hold, for they are sacraments only. 
And since the natural law is particularized in various ways according to 
the various states of mankind, and since positive law, too, varies 
according to the various conditions of men, the Master (Sent. iv, D, 34) 
asserts that at various times various persons have been unlawful subjects 
of marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The law may forbid a thing either altogether, or in part 
and in certain cases. Hence between that which is altogether according to 
the law and that which is altogether against the law (which are opposed 
by contrariety and not according to affirmation and negation), that which 
is somewhat according to the law and somewhat against the law is a middle 
term. For this reason certain persons hold a middle place between those 
who are simply lawful subjects and those who are simply unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Those impediments which do not annul a marriage already 
contracted sometimes hinder a marriage from being contracted, by 
rendering it not invalid but unlawful. And if it be contracted it is a 
true marriage although the contracting parties  sin; just as by 
consecrating after breaking one's fast one would sin by disobeying the 
Church's ordinance, and yet it would be a valid sacrament because it is 
not essential to the sacrament that the consecrator be fasting.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 7 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> When we say that the aforesaid impediments annul marriage 
already contracted, we do not mean that they dissolve a marriage 
contracted in due form, but that they dissolve a marriage contracted "de 
facto" and not "de jure." Wherefore if an impediment supervene after a 
marriage has been contracted in due form, it cannot dissolve the marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 8 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> The impediments that hinder a good accidentally are 
infinite in number, like all accidental causes. But the causes which of 
their own nature corrupt a certain good are directed to that effect, and 
determinate, even as are the causes which produce that good; for the 
causes by which a thing is destroyed and those by which it is made are 
either contrary to one another, or the same but taken in a contrary way.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[50] A[1] R.O. 9 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> The conditions of particular persons taken individually are 
infinite in number, but taken in general, they may be reduced to a 
certain number; as instanced in medicine and all operative arts, which 
consider the conditions of particular persons in whom acts are.<br>
