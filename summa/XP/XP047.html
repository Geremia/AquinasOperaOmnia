    OF COMPULSORY AND CONDITIONAL CONSENT (SIX ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider compulsory and conditional consent. Under this head
    there are six points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether compulsory consent is
    possible?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a constant man can be
    compelled by fear?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether compulsory consent
    invalidates marriage?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether compulsory consent makes a
    marriage as regards the party using compulsion?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether conditional consent makes
    a marriage?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP047.html#XPQ47A6THEP1">(6)</a> Whether one can be compelled by
    one's father to marry?

    ><br />
  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether a compulsory consent is possible?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that no consent can be compulsory.
    For, as stated above (Sent. ii, D, 25 [*FS,
    <a href="XP006.html#XPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>,
    <a href="XP006.html#XPQ6A4THEP1">Article [4]</a> ]) the free-will cannot be
    compelled. Now consent is an act of the free-will. Therefore it cannot be
    compulsory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, violent is the same as compulsory. Now,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 1), "a violent action is one the
    principle of which is without, the patient concurring not at all." But the
    principle of consent is always within. Therefore no consent can be
    compulsory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, every sin is perfected by consent. But
    that which perfects a sin cannot be compulsory, for, according to Augustine
    (De Lib. Arb. iii, 18), "no one sins in what he cannot avoid." Since then
    violence is defined by jurists (i, ff. de eo quod vi metusve) as the "force
    of a stronger being that cannot be repulsed," it would seem that consent
    cannot be compulsory or violent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, power is opposed to liberty. But
    compulsion is allied to power, as appears from a definition of Tully's in
    which he says that "compulsion is the force of one who exercises his power
    to detain a thing outside its proper bounds." Therefore the free-will cannot
    be compelled, and consequently neither can consent which is an act
    thereof.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> That which cannot be, cannot be an
    impediment. But compulsory consent is an impediment to matrimony, as stated
    in the text (Sent. iv, D, 29). Therefore consent can be compelled.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, in marriage there is a contract. Now the will can be compelled in
    the matter of contracts; for which reason the law adjudges that restitution
    should be made of the whole, for it does not ratify "that which was done
    under compulsion or fear" (Sent. iv, D[29]). Therefore in marriage also it
    is possible for the consent to be compulsory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Compulsion or violence is twofold. One is the
    cause of absolute necessity, and violence of this kind the Philosopher calls
    (Ethic. iii, 1) "violent simply," as when by bodily strength one forces a
    person to move; the other causes conditional necessity, and the Philosopher
    calls this a "mixed violence," as when a person throws his merchandise
    overboard in order to save himself. In the latter kind of violence, although
    the thing done is not voluntary in itself, yet taking into consideration the
    circumstances of place and time it is voluntary. And since actions are about
    particulars, it follows that it is voluntary simply, and involuntary in a
    certain respect (Cf. FS, <a href="XP006.html#XPQ6OUTP1">Question [6]</a>,
    <a href="XP006.html#XPQ6A6THEP1">Article [6]</a>). Wherefore this latter
    violence or compulsion is consistent with consent, but not the former. And
    since this compulsion results from one's fear of a threatening danger, it
    follows that this violence coincides with fear which, in a manner, compels
    the will, whereas the former violence has to do with bodily actions.
    Moreover, since the law considers not merely internal actions, but rather
    external actions, consequently it takes violence to mean absolute
    compulsion, for which reason it draws a distinction between violence and
    fear. Here, however, it is a question of internal consent which cannot be
    influenced by compulsion or violence as distinct from fear. Therefore as to
    the question at issue compulsion and fear are the same. Now, according to
    lawyers fear is "the agitation of the mind occasioned by danger imminent or
    future" (Ethic. iii, 1).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    This suffices for the Replies to the Objections; for the first set of
    arguments consider the first kind of compulsion, and the second set of
    arguments consider the second.<br />

  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether a constant man can be compelled by fear?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that "a constant man" [*Cap. Ad
    audientiam, De his quae vi.] cannot be compelled by fear. Because the nature
    of a constant man is not to be agitated in the midst of dangers. Since then
    fear is "agitation of the mind occasioned by imminent danger," it would seem
    that he is not compelled by fear.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "Of all fearsome things death is the
    limit," according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 6), as though it were the
    most perfect of all things that inspire fear. But the constant man is not
    compelled by death, since the brave face even mortal dangers. Therefore no
    fear influences a constant man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, of all dangers a good man fears most
    that which affects his good name. But the fear of disgrace is not reckoned
    to influence a constant man, because, according to the law (vii, ff, de eo
    quod metus, etc.), "fear of disgrace is not included under the ordinance,
    'That which is done through fear'" [*Dig. iv, 2, Quod metus causa].
    Therefore neither does any other kind of fear influence a constant man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, in him who is compelled by fear, fear
    leaves a sin, for it makes him promise what he is unwilling to fulfill, and
    thus it makes him lie. But a constant man does not commit a sin, not even a
    very slight one, for fear. Therefore no fear influences a constant man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Abraham and Isaac were constant. Yet they
    were influenced by fear, since on account of fear each said that his wife
    was his sister (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++12%3A12;+26:7"
      >Gn. 12:12; 26:7</a
    >).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, wherever there is mixed violence, it is fear that compels. But
    however constant a man may be he may suffer violence of that kind, for if he
    be on the sea, he will throw his merchandise overboard if menaced with
    shipwreck. Therefore fear can influence a constant man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> By fear influencing a man we mean his being
    compelled by fear. A man is compelled by fear when he does that which
    otherwise he would not wish to do, in order to avoid that which he fears.
    Now the constant differs from the inconstant man in two respects. First, in
    respect of the quality of the danger feared, because the constant man
    follows right reason, whereby he knows whether to omit this rather than
    that, and whether to do this rather than that. Now the lesser evil or the
    greater good is always to be chosen in preference; and therefore the
    constant man is compelled to bear with the lesser evil through fear of the
    greater evil, but he is not compelled to bear with the greater evil in order
    to avoid the lesser. But the inconstant man is compelled to bear with the
    greater evil through fear of a lesser evil, namely to commit sin through
    fear of bodily suffering; whereas on the contrary the obstinate man cannot
    be compelled even to permit or to do a lesser evil, in order to avoid a
    greater. Hence the constant man is a mean between the inconstant and the
    obstinate. Secondly, they differ as to their estimate of the threatening
    evil, for a constant man is not compelled unless for grave and probable
    reasons, while the inconstant man is compelled by trifling motives: "The
    wicked man seeth when no man pursueth" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++28%3A1"
      >Prov. 28:1</a
    >).
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The constant man, like the brave man, is
    fearless, as the Philosopher states (Ethic. iii, 4), not that he is
    altogether without fear, but because he fears not what he ought not to fear,
    or where, or when he ought not to fear.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Sin is the greatest of evils, and
    consequently a constant man can nowise be compelled to sin; indeed a man
    should die rather than suffer the like, as again the Philosopher says
    (Ethic. iii, 6,9). Yet certain bodily injuries are less grievous than
    certain others; and chief among them are those which relate to the person,
    such as death, blows, the stain resulting from rape, and slavery. Wherefore
    the like compel a constant man to suffer other bodily injuries. They are
    contained in the verse: "Rape, status, blows, and death." Nor does it matter
    whether they refer to his own person, or to the person of his wife or
    children, or the like.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although disgrace is a greater injury it
    is easy to remedy it. Hence fear of disgrace is not reckoned to influence a
    constant man according to law.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The constant man is not compelled to
    lie, because at the time he wishes to give; yet afterwards he wishes to ask
    for restitution, or at least to appeal to the judge, if he promised not to
    ask for restitution. But he cannot promise not to appeal, for since this is
    contrary to the good of justice, he cannot be compelled thereto, namely to
    act against justice.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether compulsory consent invalidates a marriage?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that compulsory consent does not
    invalidate a marriage. For just as consent is necessary for matrimony, so is
    intention necessary for Baptism. Now one who is compelled by fear to receive
    Baptism, receives the sacrament. Therefore one who is compelled by fear to
    consent is bound by his marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    iii, 1), that which is done on account of mixed violence is more voluntary
    than involuntary. Now consent cannot be compelled except by mixed violence.
    Therefore it is not entirely involuntary, and consequently the marriage is
    valid.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, seemingly he who has consented to
    marriage under compulsion ought to be counseled to stand to that marriage;
    because to promise and not to fulfill has an "appearance of evil," and the
    Apostle wishes us to refrain from all such things (1 Thess 5:22). But that
    would not be the case if compulsory consent invalidated a marriage
    altogether. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A Decretal says (cap. Cum locum, De sponsal.
    et matrim.): "Since there is no room for consent where fear or compulsion
    enters in, it follows that where a person's consent is required, every
    pretext for compulsion must be set aside." Now mutual contract is necessary
    in marriage. Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Matrimony signifies the union of Christ with the Church, which
    union is according to the liberty of love. Therefore it cannot be the result
    of compulsory consent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The marriage bond is everlasting. Hence
    whatever is inconsistent with its perpetuity invalidates marriage. Now the
    fear which compels a constant man deprives the contract of its perpetuity,
    since its complete rescission can be demanded. Wherefore this compulsion by
    fear which influences a constant man, invalidates marriage, but not the
    other compulsion. Now a constant man is reckoned a virtuous man who,
    according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 4), is a measure in all human
    actions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, some say that if there be consent although compulsory, the marriage
    is valid in conscience and in God's sight, but not in the eyes of the
    Church, who presumes that there was no inward consent on account of the
    fear. But this is of no account, because the Church should not presume a
    person to sin until it be proved; and he sinned if he said that he consented
    whereas he did not consent. Wherefore the Church presumes that he did
    consent, but judges this compulsory consent to be insufficient for a valid
    marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The intention is not the efficient cause
    of the sacrament in baptism, it is merely the cause that elicits the action
    of the agent; whereas the consent is the efficient cause in matrimony. Hence
    the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Not any kind of voluntariness suffices
    for marriage: it must be completely voluntary, because it has to be
    perpetual; and consequently it is invalidated by violence of a mixed
    nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He ought not always to be advised to
    stand to that marriage, but only when evil results are feared from its
    dissolution. Nor does he sin if he does otherwise, because there is no
    appearance of evil in not fulfilling a promise that one has made
    unwillingly.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether compulsory consent makes a marriage as regards the party who uses
    compulsion?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that compulsory consent makes a
    marriage, at least as regards the party who uses compulsion. For matrimony
    is a sign of a spiritual union. But spiritual union which is by charity may
    be with one who has not charity. Therefore marriage is possible with one who
    wills it not.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if she who was compelled consents
    afterwards, it will be a true marriage. But he who compelled her before is
    not bound by her consent. Therefore he was married to her by virtue of the
    consent he gave before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Matrimony is an equiparant relation. Now a
    relation of that kind is equally in both terms. Therefore if there is an
    impediment on the part of one, there will be no marriage on the part of the
    other.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since marriage is a kind of relation, and a
    relation cannot arise in one of the terms without arising in the other, it
    follows that whatever is an impediment to matrimony in the one, is an
    impediment to matrimony in the other; since it is impossible for a man to be
    the husband of one who is not his wife, or for a woman to be a wife without
    a husband, just as it is impossible to be a mother without having a child.
    Hence it is a common saying that "marriage is not lame."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the act of the lover can be
    directed to one who loves not, there can be no union between them, unless
    love be mutual. Wherefore the Philosopher says (Ethic. viii, 2) that
    friendship which consists in a kind of union requires a return of love.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Marriage does not result from the
    consent of her who was compelled before, except in so far as the other
    party's previous consent remains in force; wherefore if he were to withdraw
    his consent there would be no marriage.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether conditional consent makes a marriage?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not even a conditional consent
    makes a marriage, because a statement is not made simply if it is made
    subject to a condition. But in marriage the words expressive of consent must
    be uttered simply. Therefore a conditional consent makes no marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, marriage should be certain. But where a
    statement is made under a condition it is rendered doubtful. Therefore a
    like consent makes no marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> In other contracts an obligation is
    undertaken conditionally, and holds so long as the condition holds.
    Therefore since marriage is a contract, it would seem that it can be made by
    a conditional consent.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The condition made is either of the present or
    of the future. If it is of the present and is not contrary to marriage,
    whether it be moral or immoral, the marriage holds if the condition is
    verified, and is invalid if the condition is not verified. If, however, it
    be contrary to the marriage blessings, the marriage is invalid, as we have
    also said in reference to betrothals (<a href="XP043.html#XPQ43OUTP1"
      >Question [43]</a

    refer to the future, it is either necessary, as that the sun will rise
    tomorrow---and then the marriage is valid, because such future things are
    present in their causes---or else it is contingent, as the payment of a sum
    of money, or the consent of the parents, and then the judgment about a
    consent of this kind is the same as about a consent expressed in words of
    the future tense; wherefore it makes no marriage.<br />

    Whether one can be compelled by one's father's command to marry?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one can be compelled by one's
    father's command to marry. For it is written (Col. 3:20): "Children, obey
    your parents in all things." Therefore they are bound to obey them in this
    also.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Isaac charged Jacob (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++28%3A1"
      >Gn. 28:1</a
    >) not to take a wife from the daughters of Chanaan. But he would not have
    charged him thus unless he had the right to command it. Therefore a son is
    bound to obey his father in this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no one should promise, especially with
    an oath, for one whom he cannot compel to keep the promise. Now parents
    promise future marriages for their children, and even confirm their promise
    by oath. Therefore they can compel their children to keep that promise.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, our spiritual father, the Pope to wit,
    can by his command compel a man to a spiritual marriage, namely to accept a
    bishopric. Therefore a carnal father can compel his son to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A son may lawfully enter religion though his
    father command him to marry. Therefore he is not bound to obey him in
    this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, if he were bound to obey, a betrothal contracted by the parents
    would hold good without their children's consent. But this is against the
    law (cap. Ex litteris, De despon. impub.). Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since in marriage there is a kind of perpetual
    service, as it were, a father cannot by his command compel his son to marry,
    since the latter is of free condition: but he may induce him for a
    reasonable cause; and thus the son will be affected by his father's command
    in the same way as he is affected by that cause, so that if the cause be
    compelling as indicating either obligation or fitness, his father's command
    will compel him in the same measure: otherwise he may not compel him.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The words of the Apostle do not refer to
    those matters in which a man is his own master as the father is. Such is
    marriage by which the son also becomes a father.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There were other motives why Jacob was
    bound to do what Isaac commanded him, both on account of the wickedness of
    those women, and because the seed of Chanaan was to be cast forth from the
    land which was promised to the seed of the patriarchs. Hence Isaac could
    command this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> They do not swear except with the
    implied condition "if it please them"; and they are bound to induce them in
    good faith.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Some say that the Pope cannot command a
    man to accept a bishopric, because consent should be free. But if this be
    granted there would be an end of ecclesiastical order, for unless a man can
    be compelled to accept the government of a church, the Church could not be
    preserved, since sometimes those who are qualified for the purpose are
    unwilling to accept unless they be compelled. Therefore we must reply that
    the two cases are not parallel; for there is no bodily service in a
    spiritual marriage as there is in the bodily marriage; because the spiritual
    marriage is a kind of office for dispensing the public weal: "Let a man so
    account of us as of the ministers of Christ, and the dispensers of the
    mysteries of God" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++4%3A1"
      >1 Cor. 4:1</a
    >).<br />
