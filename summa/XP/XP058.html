</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider five impediments to marriage, namely the 
impediments of impotence, spell, frenzy or madness, incest, and defective 
age. Under this head there are five points of inquiry: 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether impotence is an impediment to marriage?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a spell is?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether frenzy or madness is?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether incest is?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that impotence is not an impediment to marriage. 
For carnal copulation is not essential to marriage, since marriage is 
more perfect when both parties observe continency by vow. But impotence 
deprives marriage of nothing save carnal copulation. Therefore it is not 
a diriment impediment to the marriage contract.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as impotence prevents carnal copulation so does 
frigidity. But frigidity is not reckoned an impediment to marriage. 
Therefore neither should impotence be reckoned as such.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all old people are frigid. Yet old people can marry. 
Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if the woman knows the man to be frigid when she marries 
him, the marriage is valid. Therefore frigidity, considered in itself, is 
not an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, calidity may prove a sufficient incentive to carnal 
copulation with one who is not a virgin, but not with one who is, because 
it happens to be so weak as to pass away quickly, and is therefore 
insufficient for the deflowering of a virgin. Or again it may move a man 
sufficiently in regard to a beautiful woman, but insufficiently in regard 
to an uncomely one. Therefore it would seem that frigidity, although it 
be an impediment in regard to one, is not an impediment absolutely.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, generally speaking woman is more frigid than man. But 
women are not debarred from marriage. Neither therefore should men be 
debarred on account of frigidity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated (Extra, De Frigidis et Malefic., cap. Quod 
Sedem): "Just as a boy who is incapable of marital intercourse is unfit 
to marry, so also those who are impotent are deemed most unfit for the 
marriage contract." Now persons affected with frigidity are the like. 
Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, no one can bind himself to the impossible. Now in marriage man 
binds himself to carnal copulation; because it is for this purpose that 
he gives the other party power over his body. Therefore a frigid person, 
being incapable of carnal copulation, cannot marry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In marriage there is a contract whereby one is bound to 
pay the other the marital debt: wherefore just as in other  contracts, 
the bond is unfitting if a person bind himself to what he cannot give or 
do, so the marriage contract is unfitting, if it be made by one who 
cannot pay the marital debt. This impediment is called by the general 
name of impotence as regards coition, and can arise either from an 
intrinsic and natural cause, or from an extrinsic and accidental cause, 
for instance spell, of which we shall speak later (<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). If it be due to 
a natural cause, this may happen in two ways. For either it is temporary, 
and can be remedied by medicine, or by the course of time, and then it 
does not void a marriage: or it is perpetual and then it voids marriage, 
so that the party who labors under this impediment remains for ever 
without hope of marriage, while the other may "marry to whom she will . . 
. in the Lord" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++7%3A39">1 Cor. 7:39</a>). In order to ascertain whether the 
impediment be perpetual or not, the Church has appointed a fixed time, 
namely three years, for putting the matter to a practical proof: and if 
after three years, during which both parties have honestly endeavored to 
fulfil their marital intercourse, the marriage remain unconsummated, the 
Church adjudges the marriage to be dissolved. And yet the Church is 
sometimes mistaken in this, because three years are sometimes 
insufficient to prove impotence to be perpetual. Wherefore if the Church 
find that she has been mistaken, seeing that the subject of the 
impediment has completed carnal copulation with another or with the same 
person, she reinstates the former marriage and dissolves the subsequent 
one, although the latter has been contracted with her permission. 
[*"Nowadays it is seldom necessary to examine too closely into this 
matter, as all cases arising from it are treated as far as possible under 
the form of dispensations of non-consummated marriages." Cf. Catholic 
Encyclopedia, article Canonical Impediments.]<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the act of carnal copulation is not essential to 
marriage, ability to fulfill the act is essential, because marriage gives 
each of the married parties power over the other's body in relation to 
marital intercourse.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Excessive calidity can scarcely be a perpetual impediment. 
If, however, it were to prove an impediment to marital intercourse for 
three years it would be adjudged to be perpetual. Nevertheless, since 
frigidity is a greater and more frequent impediment (for it not only 
hinders the mingling of seeds but also weakens the members which 
co-operate in the union of bodies), it is accounted an impediment rather 
than calidity, since all natural defects are reduced to frigidity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although old people have not sufficient calidity to 
procreate, they have sufficient to copulate. Wherefore they are allowed 
to marry, in so far as marriage is intended as a remedy, although it does 
not befit them as fulfilling an office of nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In all contracts it is agreed on all hands that anyone who 
is unable to satisfy an obligation is unfit to make a contract which 
requires the fulfilling of that obligation. Now this inability is of two 
kinds. First, because a person is unable to fulfill the obligation "de 
jure," and such inability renders the  contract altogether void, whether 
the party with whom he contracts knows of this or not. Secondly, because 
he is unable to fulfill "de facto"; and then if the party with whom he 
contracts knows of this and, notwithstanding, enters the contract, this 
shows that the latter seeks some other end from the contract, and the 
contract stands. But if he does not know of it the contract is void. 
Consequently frigidity which causes such an impotence that a man cannot 
"de facto" pay the marriage debt, as also the condition of slavery, 
whereby a man cannot "de facto" give his service freely, are impediments 
to marriage, when the one married party does not know that the other is 
unable to pay the marriage debt. But an impediment whereby a person 
cannot pay the marriage debt "de jure," for instance consanguinity, voids 
the marriage contract, whether the other party knows of it or not. For 
this reason the Master holds (Sent. iv, D, 34) that these two 
impediments, frigidity and slavery, make it not altogether unlawful for 
their subjects to marry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> A man cannot have a perpetual natural impediment in regard 
to one person and not in regard to another. But if he cannot fulfill the 
carnal act with a virgin, while he can with one who is not a virgin, the 
hymeneal membrane may be broken by a medical instrument, and thus he may 
have connection with her. Nor would this be contrary to nature, for it 
would be done not for pleasure but for a remedy. Dislike for a woman is 
not a natural cause, but an accidental extrinsic cause: and therefore we 
must form the same judgment in its regard as about spells, of which we 
shall speak further on (<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[1] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> The male is the agent in procreation, and the female is the 
patient, wherefore greater calidity is required in the male than in the 
female for the act of procreation. Hence the frigidity which renders the 
man impotent would not disable the woman. Yet there may be a natural 
impediment from another cause, namely stricture, and then we must judge 
of stricture in the woman in the same way as of frigidity in the man.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a spell cannot be an impediment to marriage. 
For the spells in question are caused by the operation of demons. But the 
demons have no more power to prevent the marriage act than other bodily 
actions; and these they cannot prevent, for thus they would upset the 
whole world if they hindered eating and walking and the like. Therefore 
they cannot hinder marriage by spells.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, God's work is stronger than the devil's. But a spell is 
the work of the devil. Therefore it cannot hinder marriage which is the 
work of God.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no impediment, unless it be perpetual, voids the 
marriage contract. But a spell cannot be a perpetual  impediment, for 
since the devil has no power over others than sinners, the spell will be 
removed if the sin be cast out, or by another spell, or by the exorcisms 
of the Church which are employed for the repression of the demon's power. 
Therefore a spell cannot be an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, carnal copulation cannot be hindered, unless there be an 
impediment to the generative power which is its principle. But the 
generative power of one man is equally related to all women. Therefore a 
spell cannot be an impediment in respect of one woman without being so 
also in respect of all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is stated in the Decretals (XXXIII, qu. 1, cap. iv): 
"If by sorcerers or witches . . . ," and further on, "if they be 
incurable, they must be separated."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the demons' power is greater than man's: "There is no power 
upon earth that can be compared with him who was made to fear no one" 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+41%3A24">Job 41:24</a>). Now through the action of man, a person may be rendered 
incapable of carnal copulation by some power or by castration; and this 
is an impediment to marriage. Therefore much more can this be done by the 
power of a demon.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 1/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have asserted that witchcraft is nothing in the 
world but an imagining of men who ascribed to spells those natural 
effects the causes of which are hidden. But this is contrary to the 
authority of holy men who state that the demons have power over men's 
bodies and imaginations, when God allows them: wherefore by their means 
wizards can work certain signs. Now this opinion grows from the root of 
unbelief or incredulity, because they do not believe that demons exist 
save only in the imagination of the common people, who ascribe to the 
demon the terrors which a man conjures from his thoughts, and because, 
owing to a vivid imagination, certain shapes such as he has in his 
thoughts become apparent to the senses, and then he believes that he sees 
the demons. But such assertions are rejected by the true faith whereby we 
believe that angels fell from heaven, and that the demons exist, and that 
by reason of their subtle nature they are able to do many things which we 
cannot; and those who induce them to do such things are called wizards.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 2/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Wherefore others have maintained that witchcraft can set up an 
impediment to carnal copulation, but that no such impediment is 
perpetual: hence it does not void the marriage contract, and they say 
that the laws asserting this have been revoked. But this is contrary to 
actual facts and to the new legislation which agrees with the old.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] Body Para. 3/3-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must therefore draw a distinction: for the inability to copulate 
caused by witchcraft is either perpetual and then it voids marriage, or 
it is not perpetual and then it does not void marriage. And in order to 
put this to practical proof the Church has fixed the space of three years 
in the same way as we have stated with regard to frigidity (<A Href="XP058.html#XPQ58A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). There 
is, however this  difference between a spell and frigidity, that a person 
who is impotent through frigidity is equally impotent in relation to one 
as to another, and consequently when the marriage is dissolved, he is not 
permitted to marry another woman. whereas through witchcraft a man may be 
rendered impotent in relation to one woman and not to another, and 
consequently when the Church adjudges the marriage to be dissolved, each 
party is permitted to seek another partner in marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The first corruption of sin whereby man became the slave of 
the devil was transmitted to us by the act of the generative power, and 
for this reason God allows the devil to exercise his power of witchcraft 
in this act more than in others. Even so the power of witchcraft is made 
manifest in serpents more than in other animals according to Gn. 3, since 
the devil tempted the woman through a serpent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> God's work may be hindered by the devil's work with God's 
permission; not that the devil is stronger than God so as to destroy His 
works by violence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Some spells are so perpetual that they can have no human 
remedy, although God might afford a remedy by coercing the demon, or the 
demon by desisting. For, as wizards themselves admit, it does not always 
follow that what was done by one kind of witchcraft can be destroyed by 
another kind, and even though it were possible to use witchcraft as a 
remedy, it would nevertheless be reckoned to be perpetual, since nowise 
ought one to invoke the demon's help by witchcraft. Again, if the devil 
has been given power over a person on account of sin, it does not follow 
that his power ceases with the sin, because the punishment sometimes 
continues after the fault has been removed. And again, the exorcisms of 
the Church do not always avail to repress the demons in all their 
molestations of the body, if God will it so, but they always avail 
against those assaults of the demons against which they are chiefly 
instituted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[2] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Witchcraft sometimes causes an impediment in relation to 
all, sometimes in relation to one only: because the devil is a voluntary 
cause not acting from natural necessity. Moreover, the impediment 
resulting from witchcraft may result from an impression made by the demon 
on a man's imagination, whereby he is deprived of the concupiscence that 
moves him in regard to a particular woman and not to another.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that madness is not an impediment to marriage. For 
spiritual marriage which is contracted in Baptism is more excellent than 
carnal marriage. But mad persons can be baptized. Therefore they can also 
marry.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, frigidity is an impediment to marriage because  it 
impedes carnal copulation, which is not impeded by madness. Therefore 
neither is marriage impeded thereby.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, marriage is not voided save by a perpetual impediment. 
But one cannot tell whether madness is a perpetual impediment. Therefore 
it does not void marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the impediments that hinder marriage are sufficiently 
contained in the verses given above (<A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>). But they contain no mention 
of madness. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Madness removes the use of reason more than error does. 
But error is an impediment to marriage. Therefore madness is also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, mad persons are not fit for making contracts. But marriage is a 
contract. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The madness is either previous or subsequent to marriage. 
If subsequent, it nowise voids the marriage, but if it be previous, then 
the mad person either has lucid intervals, or not. If he has, then 
although it is not safe for him to marry during that interval, since he 
would not know how to educate his children, yet if he marries, the 
marriage is valid. But if he has no lucid intervals, or marries outside a 
lucid interval, then, since there can be no consent without use of 
reason, the marriage will be invalid.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The use of reason is not necessary for Baptism as its 
cause, in which way it is necessary for matrimony. Hence the comparison 
fails. We have, however, spoken of the Baptism of mad persons (<A Href="../TP.html">TP</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP068.html#TPQ68OUTP1">Question [68]</a>, <A Href="../TP/TP068.html#TPQ68A12THEP1">Article [12]</a>).
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Madness impedes marriage on the part of the latter's cause 
which is the consent, although not on the part of the act as frigidity 
does. Yet the Master treats of it together with frigidity, because both 
are defects of nature (Sent. iv, D, 34).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A passing impediment which hinders the cause of marriage, 
namely the consent, voids marriage altogether. But an impediment that 
hinders the act must needs be perpetual in order to void the marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[3] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This impediment is reducible to error, since in either case 
there is lack of consent on the part of the reason.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether marriage is annulled by the husband committing incest with his wife's sister?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that marriage is not annulled by the husband 
committing incest with his wife's sister. For the wife should not be 
punished for her husband's sin. Yet she would be  punished if the 
marriage were annulled. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a greater sin to know one's own relative, than to 
know the relative of one's wife. But the former sin is not an impediment 
to marriage. Therefore neither is the second.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if this is inflicted as a punishment of the sin, it 
would seem, if the incestuous husband marry even after his wife's death, 
that they ought to be separated: which is not true.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, this impediment is not mentioned among those enumerated 
above (<A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>). Therefore it does not void the marriage contract.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> By knowing his wife's sister he contracts affinity, 
with his wife. But affinity voids the marriage contract. Therefore the 
aforesaid incest does also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, by whatsoever a man sinneth, by the same also is he punished. 
Now such a man sins against marriage. Therefore he ought to be punished 
by being deprived of marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> If a man has connection with the sister or other relative 
of his wife before contracting marriage, even after his betrothal, the 
marriage should be broken off on account of the resultant affinity. If, 
however, the connection take place after the marriage has been contracted 
and consummated, the marriage must not be altogether dissolved: but the 
husband loses his right to marital intercourse, nor can he demand it 
without sin. And yet he must grant it if asked, because the wife should 
not be punished for her husband's sin. But after the death of his wife he 
ought to remain without any hope of marriage, unless he receive a 
dispensation on account of his frailty, through fear of unlawful 
intercourse. If, however, he marry without a dispensation, he sins by 
contravening the law of the Church, but his marriage is not for this 
reason to be annulled. This suffices for the Replies to the Objections, 
for incest is accounted an impediment to marriage not so much for its 
being a sin as on account of the affinity which it causes. For this 
reason it is not mentioned with the other impediments, but is included in 
the impediment of affinity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether defective age is an impediment to marriage?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that deficient age is not an impediment to 
marriage. For according to the laws children are under the care of a 
guardian until their twenty-fifth year. Therefore it would seem that 
before that age their reason is not sufficiently mature to give consent, 
and consequently that ought seemingly to be the age fixed for marrying. 
Yet marriage can be contracted before that age. Therefore lack of the 
appointed age is not an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as the tie of religion is perpetual so is the 
marriage tie. Now according to the new legislation (cap. Non Solum, De 
regular. et transeunt.) no one can be professed before the fourteenth 
year of age. Therefore neither could a person marry if defective age were 
an impediment.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as consent is necessary for marriage on the part of 
the man, so is it on the part of the woman. Now a woman can marry before 
the age of fourteen. Therefore a man can also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, inability to copulate, unless it be perpetual and not 
known, is not an impediment to marriage. But lack of age is neither 
perpetual nor unknown. Therefore it is not an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, it is not included under any of the aforesaid 
impediments (<A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>), and consequently would seem not to be an impediment 
to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A Decretal (cap. Quod Sedem, De frigid et malefic.) 
says that "a boy who is incapable of marriage intercourse is unfit to 
marry." But in the majority of cases he cannot pay the marriage debt 
before the age of fourteen (De Animal. vii). Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, "There is a fixed limit of size and growth for all things in 
nature" according to the Philosopher (De Anima ii, 4): and consequently 
it would seem that, since marriage is natural, it must have a fixed age 
by defect of which it is impeded.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since marriage is effected by way of a contract, it comes 
under the ordinance of positive law like other contracts. Consequently 
according to law (cap. Tua, De sponsal. impub.) it is determined that 
marriage may not be contracted before the age of discretion when each 
party is capable of sufficient deliberation about marriage, and of mutual 
fulfilment of the marriage debt, and that marriages otherwise contracted 
are void. Now for the most part this age is the fourteenth year in males 
and the twelfth year in women: but since the ordinances of positive law 
are consequent upon what happens in the majority of cases, if anyone 
reach the required perfection before the aforesaid age, so that nature 
and reason are sufficiently developed to supply the lack of age, the 
marriage is not annulled. Wherefore if the parties who marry before the 
age of puberty have marital intercourse before the aforesaid age, their 
marriage is none the less perpetually indissoluble.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In matters to which nature inclines there is not required 
such a development of reason in order to deliberate, as in other matters: 
and therefore it is possible after deliberation to consent to marriage 
before one is able to manage one's own affairs in other matters without a 
guardian.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The same answer applies, since the religious vow  is about 
matters outside the inclination of nature, and which offer greater 
difficulty than marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is said that woman comes to the age of puberty sooner 
than man does (De Animal. ix); hence there is no parallel between the two.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In this case there is an impediment not only as to 
inability to copulate, but also on account of the defect of the reason, 
which is not yet qualified to give rightly that consent which is to 
endure in perpetuity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[58] A[5] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The impediment arising from defective age, like that which 
arises from madness, is reducible to the impediment of error; because a 
man has not yet the full use of his free-will.<br>
