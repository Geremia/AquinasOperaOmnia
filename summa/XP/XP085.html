<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider the clarity of the beatified bodies at the 
resurrection. Under this head there are three points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP085.html#XPQ85A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there will be clarity in the glorified bodies?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP085.html#XPQ85A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether this clarity will be visible to the non-glorified eye?

non-glorified body?<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that clarity is unbecoming to the glorified body. 
Because according to Avicenna (Natural. vi, 2), "every luminous body 
consists of transparent parts." But the parts of a glorified body will 
not be transparent, since in some of them, such as flesh and bones, earth 
is predominant. Therefore glorified bodies are not lightsome.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every lightsome body hides one that is behind it; 
wherefore one luminary behind another is eclipsed, and a flame of fire 
prevents one seeing what is behind it. But the glorified bodies will not 
hide that which is within them, for as Gregory says on Job 28:17, "Gold 
or crystal cannot equal it" (Moral. xviii, 48).  "There," that is in the 
heavenly country, "the grossness of the members will not hide one's mind 
from another's eyes, and the very harmony of the body will be evident to 
the bodily sight." Therefore those bodies will not be lightsome.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, light and color require a contrary disposition in their 
subject, since "light is the extreme point of visibility in an 
indeterminate body; color, in a determinate body" (De Sensu et Sensato 
iii). But glorified bodies will have color, for as Augustine says (De 
Civ. Dei xxii, 3), "the body's beauty is harmony of parts with a certain 
charm of color": and it will be impossible for the glorified bodies to 
lack beauty. Therefore the glorified bodies will not be lightsome.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, if there be clarity in the glorified bodies, it will 
need to be equal in all the parts of the body, just as all the parts will 
be equally impassible, subtle and agile. But this is not becoming, since 
one part has a greater disposition to clarity than another, for instance 
the eye than the hand, the spirits [*"Animalem," as though it were 
derived from "animus"---the mind. Cf. FS, Question [50], Article [1],3m; FS, Question [52], Article [1]
,3m] than the bones, the humors than the flesh or nerves. Therefore it 
would seem unfitting for those bodies to be lightsome.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++13%3A43">Mt. 13:43</a>): "The just shall shine as the 
sun in the kingdom of their Father," and (Wis. 3:7): "The just shall 
shine, and shall run to and fro like sparks among the reeds."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A43">1 Cor. 15:43</a>): "It is sown in dishonor, it shall 
rise in glory," which refers to clarity, as evidenced by the previous 
context where the glory of the rising bodies is compared to the clarity 
of the stars. Therefore the bodies of the saints will be lightsome.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> It is necessary to assert that after the resurrection the 
bodies of the saints will be lightsome, on account of the authority of 
Scripture which makes this promise. But the cause of this clarity is 
ascribed by some to the fifth or heavenly essence, which will then 
predominate in the human body. Since, however, this is absurd, as we have 
often remarked (<A Href="XP084.html#XPQ84OUTP1">Question [84]</a>, <A Href="XP084.html#XPQ84A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), it is better to say that this clarity will 
result from the overflow of the soul's glory into the body. For whatever 
is received into anything is received not according to the mode of the 
source whence it flows, but according to the mode of the recipient. 
Wherefore clarity which in the soul is spiritual is received into the 
body as corporeal. And consequently according to the greater clarity of 
the soul by reason of its greater merit, so too will the body differ in 
clarity, as the Apostle affirms (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15%3A41">1 Cor. 15:41</a>). Thus in the glorified 
body the glory of the soul will be known, even as through a crystal is 
known the color of a body contained in a crystal vessel, as Gregory says 
on Job 28:17, "Gold or crystal cannot equal it."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Avicenna is speaking of a body that has clarity through the 
nature of its component parts. It is not thus but rather by merit of 
virtue that the glorified body will have clarity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Gregory compares the glorified body to gold on account of 
clarity, and to crystal on account of its transparency. Wherefore 
seemingly we should say that they will be both transparent and lightsome; 
for that a lightsome body be not transparent is owing to the fact that 
the clarity of that body results from the density of the lightsome parts, 
and density is opposed to transparency. Then, however, clarity will 
result from another cause, as stated above: and the density of the 
glorified body will not deprive it of transparency, as neither does the 
density of a crystal deprive crystal.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Some, on the other hand, say that they are compared to crystal, not 
because they are transparent, but on account of this likeness, for as 
much as that which is enclosed in crystal is visible, so the glory of the 
soul enclosed in the glorified body will not be hidden. But the first 
explanation is better, because it safeguards better the dignity of the 
glorified body, and is more consistent with the words of Gregory.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The glory of the body will not destroy nature but will 
perfect it. Wherefore the body will retain the color due to it by reason 
of the nature of its component parts, but in addition to this it will 
have clarity resulting from the soul's glory. Thus we see bodies which 
have color by their nature aglow with the resplendence of the sun, or 
from some other cause extrinsic or intrinsic.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Even as the clarity of glory will overflow from the soul 
into the body according to the mode of the body, and is there otherwise 
than in the soul, so again it will overflow into each part of the soul 
according to the mode of that part. Hence it is not unreasonable that the 
different parts should have clarity in different ways, according as they 
are differently disposed thereto by their nature. Nor is there any 
comparison with the other gifts of the body, for the various parts of the 
body are not differently disposed in their regard.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the clarity of the glorified body is invisible 
to the non-glorified eye. For the visible object should be proportionate 
to the sight. But a non-glorified eye is not proportionate to see the 
clarity of glory, since this differs generically from the clarity of 
nature. Therefore the clarity of the glorified body will not be seen by a 
non-glorified eye.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the clarity of the glorified body will be  greater than 
the clarity of the sun is now, since the clarity of the sun also will 
then be greater than it is now, according to Is. 30:26, and the clarity 
of the glorified body will be much greater still, for which reason the 
sun and the entire world will receive greater clarity. Now a 
non-glorified eye is unable to gaze on the very orb of the sun on account 
of the greatness of its clarity. Therefore still less will it be able to 
gaze on the clarity of a glorified body.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a visible object that is opposite the eyes of the seer 
must needs be seen, unless there be some lesion to the eye. But the 
clarity of a glorified body that is opposite to non-glorified eyes is not 
necessarily seen by them: which is evident in the case of the disciples 
who saw our Lord's body after the resurrection, without witnessing its 
clarity. Therefore this clarity will be invisible to a non-glorified eye.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on Phil. 3:21, "Made like to the body of His 
glory," says: "It will be like the clarity which He had in the 
Transfiguration." Now this clarity was seen by the non-glorified eyes of 
the disciples. Therefore the clarity of the glorified body will be 
visible to non-glorified eyes also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the wicked will be tortured in the judgment by seeing the glory 
of the just, according to Wis. 5:2. But they would not fully see their 
glory unless they gazed on their clarity. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Some have asserted that the clarity of the glorified body 
will not be visible to the non-glorified eye, except by a miracle. But 
this is impossible, unless this clarity were so named equivocally, 
because light by its essence has a natural tendency to move the sight, 
and sight by its essence has a natural tendency to perceive light, even 
as the true is in relation to the intellect, and the good to the 
appetite. Wherefore if there were a sight altogether incapable of 
perceiving a light, either this sight is so named equivocally, or else 
this light is. This cannot be said in the point at issue, because then 
nothing would be made known to us when we are told that the glorified 
bodies will be lightsome: even so a person who says that a dog [*The dog 
star] is in the heavens conveys no knowledge to one who knows no other 
dog than the animal. Hence we must say that the clarity of a glorified 
body is naturally visible to the non-glorified eye.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The clarity of glory will differ generically from the 
clarity of nature, as to its cause, but not as to its species. Hence just 
as the clarity of nature is, by reason of its species, proportionate to 
the sight, so too will the clarity of glory be.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as a glorified body is not passible to a passion of 
nature but only to a passion of the soul [*Cf. Question [82], Article [1]], so in virtue 
of its property of glory it acts only by the action of the soul. Now 
intense clarity does not disturb the sight, in so far as it acts by the 
action of the soul, for thus it rather gives  delight, but it disturbs it 
in so far as it acts by the action of nature by heating and destroying 
the organ of sight, and by scattering the spirits* asunder. [*"Animalem," 
as though it were derived from "animus"---the mind. Cf. FS, Question [50], Article [1]
,3m; FS, Question [52], Article [1],3m.] Hence, though the clarity of a glorified body 
surpasses the clarity of the sun, it does not by its nature disturb the 
sight but soothes it: wherefore this clarity is compared to the 
jasper-stone (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++21%3A11">Apoc. 21:11</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The clarity of the glorified body results from the merit of 
the will and therefore will be subject to the will, so as to be seen or 
not seen according to its command. Therefore it will be in the power of 
the glorified body to show forth its clarity or to hide it: and this was 
the opinion of Praepositivus.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a glorified body will be necessarily seen by a 
non-glorified body. For the glorified bodies will be lightsome. Now a 
lightsome body reveals itself and other things. Therefore the glorified 
bodies will be seen of necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every body which hides other bodies that are behind it 
is necessarily perceived by the sight, from the very fact that the other 
things behind it are hidden. Now the glorified body will hide other 
bodies that are behind it from being seen, because it will be a colored 
body. Therefore it will be seen of necessity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as quantity is something in a body, so is the 
quality whereby a body is seen. Now quantity will not be subject to the 
will, so that the glorified body be able to be of greater or smaller 
quantity. Therefore neither will the quality of visibility be subject to 
the will, so that a body be able not to be seen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> our body will be glorified in being made like to the 
body of Christ after the resurrection. Now after the resurrection 
Christ's body was not necessarily seen; in fact it vanished from the 
sight of the disciples at Emmaus (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++24%3A31">Lk. 24:31</a>). Therefore neither will the 
glorified body be necessarily seen.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, there the body will be in complete obedience to the will. 
Therefore as the soul lists the body will be visible or invisible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A visible object is seen, inasmuch as it acts on the 
sight. Now there is no change in a thing through its acting or not acting 
on an external object. Wherefore a glorified body may be seen or not seen 
without any property pertaining to its perfection being changed. 
Consequently it will be in the power of a glorified soul for its body to 
be seen or not seen, even as any other action of the body will be in the 
soul's power; else the  glorified body would not be a perfectly obedient 
instrument of its principal agent.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This clarity will be obedient to the glorified body so that 
this will be able to show it or hide it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A body's color does not prevent its being transparent 
except in so far as it affects the sight, because the sight cannot be 
affected by two colors at the same time, so as to perceive them both 
perfectly. But the color of the glorified body will be completely in the 
power of the soul, so that it can thereby act or not act on the sight. 
Hence it will be in its power to hide or not to hide a body that is 
behind it.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[85] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Quantity is inherent to the glorified body itself, nor 
would it be possible for the quantity to be altered at the soul's bidding 
without the glorified body suffering some alteration incompatible with 
its impassibility. Hence there is no comparison between quantity and 
visibility, because even this quality whereby it is visible cannot be 
removed at the soul's bidding, but the action of that quality will be 
suspended, and thus the body will be hidden at the soul's command.<br>
