    OF THE SIGNS THAT WILL PRECEDE THE JUDGMENT (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must next consider the signs that will precede the judgment: and under
    this head there are three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP073.html#XPQ73A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether any signs will precede the
    Lord's coming to judgment?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP073.html#XPQ73A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether in very truth the sun and
    moon will be darkened?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP073.html#XPQ73A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether the powers of the heavens
    will be moved when the Lord shall come?<br />

    Whether any signs will precede the Lord's coming to judgment?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Lord's coming to judgment
    will not be preceded by any signs. Because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++5%3A3"
      >1 Thess. 5:3</a
    >): "When they shall say: Peace and security; then shall sudden destruction
    come upon them." Now there would be no peace and security if men were
    terrified by previous signs. Therefore signs will not precede that coming<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, signs are ordained for the manifestation
    of something. But His coming is to be hidden; wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Thess++5%3A2"
      >1 Thess. 5:2</a
    >): "The day of the Lord shall come as a thief in the night." Therefore
    signs ought not to precede it.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the time of His first coming was
    foreknown by the prophets, which does not apply to His second coming. Now no
    such signs preceded the first coming of Christ. Therefore neither will they
    precede the second.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++21%3A25"
      >Lk. 21:25</a
    >): "There shall be signs in the sun, and in the moon, and in the stars,"
    etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Jerome [*St. Peter Damian, Opuscul. xlix; he quotes St. Jerome, but
    the reference is not known.] mentions fifteen signs preceding the judgment.
    He says that on the "first" day all the seas will rise fifteen cubits above
    the mountains; in the "second" day all the waters will be plunged into the
    depths, so that scarcely will they be visible; on the "third" day they will
    be restored to their previous condition; on the "fourth" day all the great
    fishes and other things that move in the waters will gather together and,
    raising their heads above the sea, roar at one another contentiously; on the
    "fifth" day, all the birds of the air will gather together in the fields,
    wailing to one another, with neither bite nor sup; on the "sixth" day rivers
    of fire will arise towards the firmament rushing together from the west to
    the east; on the "seventh" day all the stars, both planets and fixed stars,
    will throw out fiery tails like comets; on the "eighth" day there will be a
    great earthquake, and all animals will be laid low; on the "ninth" day all
    the plants will be bedewed as it were with blood; on the "tenth" day all
    stones, little and great, will be divided into four parts dashing against
    one another; on the "eleventh" day all hills and mountains and buildings
    will be reduced to dust; on the "twelfth" day all animals will come from
    forest and mountain to the fields, roaring and tasting of nothing; on the
    "thirteenth" day all graves from east to west will open to allow the bodies
    to rise again; on the "fourteenth" day all men will leave their abode,
    neither understanding nor speaking, but rushing hither and thither like
    madmen; on the "fifteenth" day all will die and will rise again with those
    who died long before.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> When Christ shall come to judge He will appear
    in the form of glory, on account of the authority becoming a judge. Now it
    pertains to the dignity of judicial power to have certain signs that induce
    people to reverence and subjection: and consequently many signs will precede
    the advent of Christ when He shall come to judgment, in order that the
    hearts of men be brought to subjection to the coming judge, and be prepared
    for the judgment, being forewarned by those signs. But it is not easy to
    know what these signs may be: for the signs of which we read in the gospels,
    as Augustine says, writing to Hesychius about the end of the world (Ep.
    lxxx), refer not only to Christ's coming to judgment, but also to the time
    of the sack of Jerusalem, and to the coming of Christ in ceaselessly
    visiting His Church. So that, perhaps, if we consider them carefully, we
    shall find that none of them refers to the coming advent, as he remarks:
    because these signs that are mentioned in the gospels, such as wars, fears,
    and so forth, have been from the beginning of the human race: unless perhaps
    we say that at that time they will be more prevalent: although it is
    uncertain in what degree this increase will foretell the imminence of the
    advent. The signs mentioned by Jerome are not asserted by him; he merely
    says that he found them written in the annals of the Hebrews: and, indeed,
    they contain very little likelihood.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> According to Augustine (Ad Hesych., Ep.
    lxxx) towards the end of the world there will be a general persecution of
    the good by the wicked: so that at the same time some will fear, namely the
    good, and some will be secure, namely the wicked. The words: "When they
    shall say: Peace and security," refer to the wicked, who will pay little
    heed to the signs of the coming judgment: while the words of Lk. 21:26, "men
    withering away," etc., should be referred to the good.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    We may also reply that all these signs that will happen about the time of
    the judgment are reckoned to occur within the time occupied by the judgment,
    so that the judgment day contains them all. Wherefore although men be
    terrified by the signs appearing about the judgment day, yet before those
    signs begin to appear the wicked will think themselves to be in peace and
    security, after the death of Antichrist and before the coming of Christ,
    seeing that the world is not at once destroyed, as they thought hitherto.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The day of the Lord is said to come as a
    thief, because the exact time is not known, since it will not be possible to
    know it from those signs: although, as we have already said, all these most
    manifest sings which will precede the judgment immediately may be comprised
    under the judgment day.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> At His first advent Christ came
    secretly, although the appointed time was known beforehand by the prophets.
    Hence there was no need for such signs to appear at His first coming, as
    will appear at His second advent, when He will come openly, although the
    appointed time is hidden.<br />

    Whether towards the time of the judgment the sun and moon will be darkened
    in very truth?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that towards the time of the
    judgment the sun and moon will be darkened in very truth. For, as Rabanus
    says, commenting on Mt. 24:29 "nothing hinders us from gathering that the
    sun moon, and stars will then be deprived of their light, as we know
    happened to the sun at the time of our Lord's passion."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the light of the heavenly bodies is
    directed to the generation of inferior bodies, because by its means and not
    only by their movement they act upon this lower world as Averroes says (De
    Subst. Orbis.). But generation will cease then. Therefore neither will light
    remain in the heavenly bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, according to some the inferior bodies
    will be cleansed of the qualities by which they act. Now heavenly bodies act
    not only by movement, but also by light, as stated above (Objection [2]).
    Therefore as the movement of heaven will cease, so will the light of the
    heavenly bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> According to astronomers the sun and moon
    cannot be eclipsed at the same time. But this darkening of the sun and moon
    is stated to be simultaneous, when the Lord shall come to judgment.
    Therefore the darkening will not be in very truth due to a natural
    eclipse.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is not seemly for the same to be the cause of a thing's failing
    and increasing. Now when our Lord shall come the light of the luminaries
    will increase according to Is. 30:26, "The light of the moon shall be as the
    light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold." Therefore it
    is unfitting for the light of these bodies to cease when our Lord comes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> If we speak of the sun and moon in respect of
    the very moment of Christ's coming, it is not credible that they will be
    darkened through being bereft of their light, since when Christ comes and
    the saints rise again the whole world will be renewed, as we shall state
    further on (<a href="XP074.html#XPQ74OUTP1">Question [74]</a>). If, however,
    we speak of them in respect of the time immediately preceding the judgment,
    it is possible that by the Divine power the sun, moon, and other luminaries
    of the heavens will be darkened, either at various times or all together, in
    order to inspire men with fear.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Rabanus is speaking of the time
    preceding the judgment: wherefore he adds that when the judgment day is over
    the words of Isaias shall be fulfilled.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Light is in the heavenly bodies not only
    for the purpose of causing generation in these lower bodies, but also for
    their own perfection and beauty. Hence it does not follow that where
    generation ceases, the light of the heavenly bodies will cease, but rather
    that it will increase.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It does not seem probable that the
    elemental qualities will be removed from the elements, although some have
    asserted this. If, however, they be removed, there would still be no
    parallel between them and light, since the elemental qualities are in
    opposition to one another, so that their action is corruptive: whereas light
    is a principle of action not by way of opposition, but by way of a principle
    regulating things in opposition to one another and bringing them back to
    harmony. Nor is there a parallel with the movement of heavenly bodies, for
    movement is the act of that which is imperfect, wherefore it must needs
    cease when the imperfection ceases: whereas this cannot be said of light.<br />

    Whether the virtues of heaven will be moved when our Lord shall come?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the virtues of heaven will not
    be moved when our Lord shall come. For the virtues of heaven can de. note
    only the blessed angels. Now immobility is essential to blessedness.
    Therefore it will be impossible for them to be moved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, ignorance is the cause of wonder
    (Metaph. i, 2). Now ignorance, like fear, is far from the angels, for as
    Gregory says (Dial. iv, 33; Moral. ii, 3), "what do they not see, who see
    Him Who sees all." Therefore it will be impossible for them to be moved with
    wonder, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 48).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all the angels will be present at the
    Divine judgment; wherefore it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++7%3A11"
      >Apoc. 7:11</a
    >): "All the angels stood round about the throne." Now the virtues denote
    one particular order of angels. Therefore it should not be said of them
    rather than of others, that they are moved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+26%3A11"
      >Job 26:11</a
    >): "The pillars of heaven tremble, and dread at His beck." Now the pillars
    of heaven can denote only the virtues of heaven. Therefore the virtues of
    heaven will be moved.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++24%3A29"
      >Mt. 24:29</a
    >): "The stars shall fall from heaven, and the virtues [Douay: 'powers'] of
    heaven shall be moved."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Virtue is twofold as applied to the angels,
    [*Cf. FP, Question [108], Article [5], ad 1] as Dionysius states (Coel.
    Hier. xi). For sometimes the name of "virtues" is appropriated to one order,
    which according to him, is the middle order of the middle hierarchy, but
    according to Gregory (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv) is the highest order of the
    lowest hierarchy. In another sense it is employed to denote all the angels:
    and then they are said to the question at issue it may be taken either way.
    For in the text (Sent. iv, D, 48) it is explained according to the second
    acceptation, so as to denote all the angels: and then they are said to be
    moved through wonder at the renewing of the world, as stated in the text. It
    can also be explained in reference to virtue as the name of a particular
    order; and then that order is said to be moved more than the others by
    reason of the effect, since according to Gregory (Hom. in Evang. xxxiv) we
    ascribe to that order the working of miracles which especially will be
    worked about that time: or again, because that order---since, according to
    Dionysius (Coel. Hier. xi), it belongs to the middle hierarchy---is not
    limited in its power, wherefore its ministry must needs regard universal
    causes. Consequently the proper office of the virtues is seemingly to move
    the heavenly bodies which are the cause of what happens in nature here
    below. And again the very name denotes this, since they are called the
    "virtues of heaven." Accordingly they will be moved then, because they will
    no more produce their effect, by ceasing to move the heavenly bodies: even
    as the angels who are appointed to watch over men will no longer fulfill the
    office of guardians.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This movement changes nothing pertaining
    to their state; but refers either to their effects which may vary without
    any change on their part, or to some new consideration of things which
    hitherto they were unable to see by means of their concreated species, which
    change of thought is not taken from them by their state of blessedness.
    Hence Augustine says (Gen. ad lit. viii, 20) that "God moves the spiritual
    creature through time."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Wonder is wont to be about things
    surpassing our knowledge or ability: and accordingly the virtues of heaven
    will wonder at the Divine power doing such things, in so far as they fail to
    do or comprehend them. In this sense the blessed Agnes said that the "sun
    and moon wonder at His beauty": and this does not imply ignorance in the
    angels, but removes the comprehension of God from them.<br />
  </p>
  <p>The Reply to the Third Objection is clear from what has been said.</p>
