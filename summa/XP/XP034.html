    HOLY ORDERS (Questions [34]-40)<br />
    <br />
    OF THE SACRAMENT OF ORDER AS TO ITS ESSENCE AND ITS PARTS (FIVE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    In the next place we must consider the sacrament of Order: (1) Order in
    general; (2) the difference of Orders; (3) those who confer Orders; (4) the
    impediments to receiving Orders; (5) things connected with Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Concerning Order in general three points have to be considered: (1) Its
    essence, quiddity, and parts; (2) Its effect; (3) The recipients of
    Orders.<br />
  </p>
  <p>Under the first head there are five points of inquiry:</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP034.html#XPQ34A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether there should be Order in
    the Church?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP034.html#XPQ34A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether it is fittingly defined?
  </p>
  <p><a href="XP034.html#XPQ34A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is a sacrament?</p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP034.html#XPQ34A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether its form is expressed
    properly?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP034.html#XPQ34A5THEP1">(5)</a> Whether this sacrament has any
    matter?

  <h3 align="left">Whether there should be Order in the Church?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there should not be Order in
    the Church. For Order requires subjection and preeminence. But subjection
    seemingly is incompatible with the liberty whereunto we are called by
    Christ. Therefore there should not be Order in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, he who has received an Order becomes
    another's superior. But in the Church everyone should deem himself lower
    than another (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Phil++2%3A3"
      >Phil. 2:3</a
    >): "Let each esteem others better than themselves." Therefore Order should
    not be in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, we find order among the angels on
    account of their differing in natural and gratuitous gifts. But all men are
    one in nature, and it is not known who has the higher gifts of grace.
    Therefore Order should not be in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "Those things that are of God, are in order
    [*Vulg: 'Those (powers) that are, are ordained of God.']." Now the Church is
    of God, for He Himself built it with His blood. Therefore there ought to be
    Order in the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the state of the Church is between the state of nature and the
    state of glory. Now we find order in nature, in that some things are above
    others, and likewise in glory, as in the angels. Therefore there should be
    Order in the Church.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> God wished to produce His works in likeness to
    Himself, as far as possible, in order that they might be perfect, and that
    He might be known through them. Hence, that He might be portrayed in His
    works, not only according to what He is in Himself, but also according as He
    acts on others, He laid this natural law on all things, that last things
    should be reduced and perfected by middle things, and middle things by the
    first, as Dionysius says (Eccl. Hier. v). Wherefore that this beauty might
    not be lacking to the Church, He established Order in her so that some
    should deliver the sacraments to others, being thus made like to God in
    their own way, as co-operating with God; even as in the natural body, some
    members act on others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The subjection of slavery is
    incompatible with liberty; for slavery consists in lording over others and
    employing them for one's own profit. Such subjection is not required in
    Order, whereby those who preside have to seek the salvation of their
    subjects and not their own profit.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Each one should esteem himself lower in
    merit, not in office; and orders are a kind of office.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Order among the angels does not arise
    from difference of nature, unless accidentally, in so far as difference of
    grace results in them from difference of nature. But in them it results
    directly from their difference in grace; because their orders regard their
    participation of divine things, and their communicating them in the state of
    glory, which is according to the measure of grace, as being the end and
    effect, so to speak, of grace. on the other hand, the Orders of the Church
    militant regard the participation in the sacraments and the communication
    thereof, which are the cause of grace and, in a way, precede grace; and
    consequently our Orders do not require sanctifying grace, but only the power
    to dispense the sacraments; for which reason order does not correspond to
    the difference of sanctifying grace, but to the difference of power.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Order is properly defined?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that order is improperly defined by
    the Master (Sent. iv, D, 53), where it is said "Order is a seal of the
    Church, whereby spiritual power is conferred on the person ordained." For a
    part should not be described as the genus of the whole. Now the character
    which is denoted by the seal in a subsequent definition is a part of order,
    since it is placed in contradistinction with that which is either reality
    only, or sacrament only, since it is both reality and sacrament. Therefore
    seal should not be mentioned as the genus of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as a character is imprinted in the
    sacrament of order, so is it in the sacrament of Baptism. Now character was
    not mentioned in the definition of Baptism. Therefore neither should it be
    mentioned in the definition of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in Baptism there is also given a certain
    spiritual power to approach the sacraments; and again it is a seal, since it
    is a sacrament. Therefore this definition is applicable to Baptism; and
    consequently it is improperly applied to Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, Order is a kind of relation, and
    relation is realized in both its terms. Now the terms of the relation of
    order are the superior and the inferior. Therefore inferiors have order as
    well as superiors. Yet there is no power of preeminence in them, such as is
    mentioned here in the definition of Order, as appears from the subsequent
    explanation (Sent. iv, D, 53), where promotion to power is mentioned.
    Therefore Order is improperly defined there.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The Master's definition of Order applies to
    Order as a sacrament of the Church. Hence he mentions two things, namely the
    outward sign, a "kind of seal," i.e. a kind of sign, and the inward effect,
    "whereby spiritual power," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Seal stands here, not for the inward
    character, but for the outward action, which is the sign and cause of inward
    power; and this is also the sense of character in the other definition. If,
    however, it be taken for the inward character, the definition would not be
    unsuitable; because the division of a sacrament into those three things is
    not a division into integral parts, properly speaking; since what is reality
    only is not essential to the sacrament, and that which is the sacrament is
    transitory; while that which is sacrament and reality is said to remain.
    Wherefore it follows that inward character itself is essentially and
    principally the sacrament of Order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although in Baptism there is conferred a
    spiritual power to receive the other sacraments, for which reason it
    imprints a character, nevertheless this is not its principal effect, but the
    inward cleansing; wherefore Baptism would be given even though the former
    motive did not exist. On the other hand, order denotes power principally.
    Wherefore the character which is a spiritual power is included in the
    definition of Order, but not in that of Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In Baptism there is given a certain
    spiritual potentiality to receive, and consequently a somewhat passive
    potentiality. But power properly denotes active potentiality, together with
    some kind of preeminence. Hence this definition is not applicable to
    Baptism.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The word "order" is used in two ways.
    For sometimes it denotes the relation itself, and thus it is both in the
    inferior and in the superior, as the objection states; but it is not thus
    that we use the word here. On the other hand, it denotes the degree which
    results in the order taken in the first sense. And since the notion of order
    as relation is observed where we first meet with something higher than
    another, it follows that this degree of pre-eminence by spiritual power is
    called Order.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether Order is a sacrament?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Order is not a sacrament. For
    a sacrament, according to Hugh of St. Victor (De Sacram. i) "is a material
    element." Now Order denotes nothing of the kind, but rather relation or
    power; since Order is a part of power according to Isidore. Therefore it is
    not a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the sacraments do not concern the Church
    triumphant. Yet Order is there, as in the angels. Therefore it is not a
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as spiritual authority, which is
    Order, is given by means of consecration, so is secular authority, since
    kings also are anointed, as stated above (<a href="XP019.html#XPQ19OUTP1"
      >Question [19]</a
    >, <a href="XP019.html#XPQ19A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>, ad 2). But the kingly
    power is not a sacrament. Therefore neither is order of which we speak
    now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is mentioned by all among the seven
    sacraments of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, "the cause of a thing being such, is still more so." Now Order is
    the cause of man being the dispenser of the other sacraments. Therefore
    Order has more reason for being a sacrament than the others.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP029.html#XPQ29OUTP1"
      >Question [29]</a
    >, <a href="XP029.html#XPQ29A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="../TP.html">TP</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP060.html#TPQ60OUTP1">Question [60]</a>), a sacrament is
    nothing else than a sanctification conferred on man with some outward sign.
    Wherefore, since by receiving orders a consecration is conferred on man by
    visible signs, it is clear that Order is a sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although Order does not by its name
    express a material element, it is not conferred without some material
    element.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Power must needs be proportionate to the
    purpose for which it is intended. Now the communication of divine things,
    which is the purpose for which spiritual power is given, is not effected
    among the angels by means of sensible signs, as is the case among men. Hence
    the spiritual power that is Order is not bestowed on the angels by visible
    signs, as on men. Wherefore Order is a sacrament among men, but not among
    angels.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Not every blessing or consecration given
    to men is a sacrament, for both monks and abbots are blessed, and yet such
    blessings are not sacraments, and in like manner neither is the anointing of
    a king; because by such blessings men are not ordained to the dispensing of
    the divine sacraments, as by the blessing of Order. Hence the comparison
    fails.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the form of this sacrament is suitably expressed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the form of this sacrament is
    unsuitably set forth in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24). Because the sacraments
    take their efficacy from their form. Now the efficacy of the sacraments is
    from the divine power, which works our salvation in them in a most hidden
    manner. Therefore the form of this sacrament should include a mention of the
    divine power by the invocation of the Trinity, as in the other
    sacraments.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to command pertains to one who has
    authority. Now the dispenser of the sacrament exercises no authority, but
    only ministry. Therefore he should not use the imperative mood by saying:
    "Do" or "Receive" this or that, or some similar expression.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, mention should not be made in the
    sacramental form, except of such things as are essential to the sacrament.
    But the use of the power received is not essential to this sacrament, but is
    consequent upon it. Therefore it should not be mentioned in the form of this
    sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, all the sacraments direct us to an
    eternal reward. But the forms of the other sacraments make no mention of a
    reward. Therefore neither should any mention be made thereof in the form of
    this sacrament, as in the words: "Since thou wilt have a share, if
    faithfully," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This sacrament consists chiefly in the power
    conferred. Now power is conferred by power, as like proceeds from like; and
    again power is made known by its use, since powers are manifested by their
    acts. Wherefore in the form of order the use of order is expressed by the
    act which is commanded; and the conferring of power is expressed by
    employing the imperative mood.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The other sacraments are not ordained
    chiefly to effects similar to the power whereby the sacraments are
    dispensed, as this sacrament is. Hence in this sacrament there is a kind of
    universal communication. Wherefore in the other sacraments something is
    expressed on the part of the divine power to which the effect of the
    sacrament is likened, but not in this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> [There is a special reason why this
    sacrament, rather than the others, is conferred by employing the imperative
    mood. For]* although the bishop who is the minister of this sacrament has no
    authority in respect of the conferring of this sacrament, nevertheless he
    has some power with regard to the power of Order, which power he confers, in
    so far as it is derived, from his. [*The sentence in brackets is not in the
    Leonine edition.]<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The use of power is the effect of power
    in the genus of efficient cause, and from this point of view it has no
    reason to be mentioned in the definition of Order. But it is somewhat a
    cause in the genus of final cause, and from this point of view it can be
    placed in the definition of order.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> There is here a difference between this
    and the other sacraments. Because by this sacrament an office or the power
    to do something is conferred; and so it is fitting that mention be made of
    the reward to be obtained if it be administered faithfully. But in the other
    sacraments no such office or power to act is conferred, and so no mention of
    reward is made in them. Accordingly the recipient is somewhat passive in
    relation to the other sacraments, because he receives them for the
    perfecting of his own state only, whereas in relation to this sacrament he
    holds himself somewhat actively, since he receives it for the sake of
    exercising hierarchical duties in the Church. Wherefore although the other
    sacraments, from the very fact that they give grace, direct the recipient to
    salvation, properly speaking they do not direct him to a reward, in the same
    way as this sacrament does.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether this sacrament has any matter?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this sacrament has no matter.
    Because in every sacrament that has a matter the power that works in the
    sacrament is in the matter. But in the material objects which are used here,
    such as keys, candlesticks, and so forth, there is not apparently any power
    of sanctification. Therefore it has no matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in this sacrament the fulness of
    sevenfold grace is conferred, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 24), just
    as in Confirmation. But the matter of Confirmation requires to be
    consecrated beforehand. Since then the things which appear to be material in
    this sacrament are not consecrated beforehand, it would seem that they are
    not the matter of the sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in any sacrament that has matter there
    needs to be contact of matter with the recipient of the sacrament. Now, as
    some say, it is not essential to this sacrament that there be contact
    between the aforesaid material objects and the recipient of the sacrament,
    but only that they be presented to him. Therefore the aforesaid material
    objects are not the matter of this sacrament.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Every sacrament consists of things and words.
    Now in any sacrament the thing is the matter. Therefore the things employed
    in this sacrament are its matter.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, more is requisite to dispense the sacraments than to receive them.
    Yet Baptism, wherein the power is given to receive the sacraments, needs a
    matter. Therefore order also does, wherein the power is given to dispense
    them.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The matter employed outwardly in the sacraments
    signifies that the power which works in the sacraments comes entirely from
    without. Wherefore, since the effect proper to this sacrament, namely the
    character, is not received through any operation of the one who approaches
    the sacrament, as was the case in Penance, but comes wholly from without, it
    is fitting that it should have a matter, yet otherwise than the other
    sacraments that have matter; because that which is bestowed in the other
    sacraments comes from God alone, and not from the minister who dispenses the
    sacrament; whereas that which is conferred in this sacrament, namely the
    spiritual power, comes also from him who gives the sacrament, as imperfect
    from perfect power. Hence the efficacy of the other sacraments resides
    chiefly in the matter which both signifies and contains the divine power
    through the sanctification applied by the minister; whereas the efficacy of
    this sacrament resides chiefly with him who dispenses the sacrament. And the
    matter is employed to show the powers conferred in particular by one who has
    it completely, rather than to cause power; and this is clear from the fact
    that the matter is in keeping with the use of power. This suffices for the
    Reply to the First Objection.<br />

  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is necessary for the matter to be
    consecrated in the other sacraments, on account of the power it contains;
    but it is not so in the case in point.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If we admit this assertion, the reason
    for it is clear from what we have said; for since the power of order is
    received from the minister and not from the matter, the presenting of the
    matter is more essential to the sacrament than contact therewith. However,
    the words themselves of the form would seem to indicate that contact with
    the matter is essential to the sacrament, for it is said: "Receive" this or
    that.<br />
