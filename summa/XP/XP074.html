  </p>

  <h3 align="left">Whether the world is to be cleansed?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not to be any
    cleansing of the world. For only that which is unclean needs cleansing. Now
    God's creatures are not unclean, wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A15"
      >Acts 10:15</a
    >): "That which God hath cleansed, do not thou call common," i.e. unclean.
    Therefore the creatures of the world shall not be cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, according to Divine justice cleansing is
    directed to the removal of the uncleanness of sin, as instanced in the
    cleansing after death. But there can be no stain of sin in the elements of
    this world. Therefore, seemingly, they need not to be cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a thing is said to be cleansed when any
    foreign matter that depreciates it is removed therefrom: for the removal of
    that which ennobles a thing is not called a cleansing, but rather a
    diminishing. Now it pertains to the perfection and nobility of the elements
    that something of a foreign nature is mingled with them, since the form of a
    mixed body is more noble than the form of a simple body. Therefore it would
    seem nowise fitting that the elements of this world can possibly be
    cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> All renewal is effected by some kind of
    cleansing. But the elements will be renewed; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++21%3A1"
      >Apoc. 21:1</a
    >): "I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven and the first
    earth was gone." Therefore the elements shall be cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, a gloss [*St. Augustine, De Civ. Dei xx, 16] on 1 Cor. 7:31, "The
    fashion of this earth passeth away," says: "The beauty of this world will
    perish in the burning of worldly flames." Therefore the same conclusion
    follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Since the world was, in a way, made for man's
    sake, it follows that, when man shall be glorified in the body, the other
    bodies of the world shall also be changed to a better state, so that it is
    rendered a more fitting place for him and more pleasant to look upon. Now in
    order that man obtain the glory of the body, it behooves first of all those
    things to be removed which are opposed to glory. There are two, namely the
    corruption and stain of sin---because according to 1 Cor. 15:50, "neither
    shall corruption possess incorruption," and all the unclean shall be without
    the city of glory (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++22%3A15"
      >Apoc. 22:15</a
    >)---and again, the elements require to be cleansed from the contrary
    dispositions, ere they be brought to the newness of glory, proportionately
    to what we have said with regard to man. Now although, properly speaking, a
    corporeal thing cannot be the subject of the stain of sin, nevertheless, on
    account of sin corporeal things contract a certain unfittingness for being
    appointed to spiritual purposes; and for this reason we find that places
    where crimes have been committed are reckoned unfit for the performance of
    sacred actions therein, unless they be cleansed beforehand. Accordingly that
    part of the world which is given to our use contracts from men's sins a
    certain unfitness for being glorified, wherefore in this respect it needs to
    be cleansed. In like manner with regard to the intervening space, on account
    of the contact of the elements, there are many corruptions, generations and
    alterations of the elements, which diminish their purity: wherefore the
    elements need to be cleansed from these also, so that they be fit to receive
    the newness of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When it is asserted that every creature
    of God is clean we are to understand this as meaning that its substance
    contains no alloy of evil, as the Manichees maintained, saying that evil and
    good are two substances in some places severed from one another, in others
    mingled together. But it does not exclude a creature from having an
    admixture of a foreign nature, which in itself is also good, but is
    inconsistent with the perfection of that creature. Nor does this prevent
    evil from being accidental to a creature, although not mingled with it as
    part of its substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although corporeal elements cannot be
    the subject of sin, nevertheless, from the sin that is committed in them
    they contract a certain unfitness for receiving the perfection of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The form of a mixed body and the form of
    an element may be considered in two ways: either as regards the perfection
    of the species, and thus a mixed body is more perfect---or as regards their
    continual endurance; and thus the simple body is more noble, because it has
    not in itself the cause of corruption, unless it be corrupted by something
    extrinsic: whereas a mixed body has in itself the cause of its corruption,
    namely the composition of contraries. Wherefore a simple body, although it
    be corruptible in part is incorruptible as a whole, which cannot be said of
    a mixed body. And since incorruption belongs to the perfection of glory, it
    follows that the perfection of a simple is more in keeping with the
    perfection of glory, than the perfection of a mixed body, unless the mixed
    body has also in itself some principle of incorruption, as the human body
    has, the form of which is incorruptible. Nevertheless, although a mixed body
    is somewhat more noble than a simple body, a simple body that exists by
    itself has a more noble being than if it exist in a mixed body, because in a
    mixed body simple bodies are somewhat in potentiality, whereas, existing by
    themselves, they are in their ultimate perfection.<br />

    Whether the cleansing of the world will be effected by fire?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this cleansing will not be
    effected by fire. For since fire is a part of the world, it needs to be
    cleansed like the other parts. Now, the same thing should not be both
    cleanser and cleansed. Therefore it would seem that the cleansing will not
    be by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, just as fire has a cleansing virtue so
    has water. Since then all things are not capable of being cleansed by fire,
    and some need to be cleansed by water---which distinction is moreover
    observed by the Old Law---it would seem that fire will not at any rate
    cleanse all things.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, this cleansing would seem to consist in
    purifying the parts of the world by separating them from one another. Now
    the separation of the parts of the world from one another at the world's
    beginning was effected by God's power alone, for the work of distinction was
    carried out by that power: wherefore Anaxagoras asserted that the separation
    was effected by the act of the intellect which moves all things (cf.
    Aristotle, Phys. viii, 9). Therefore it would seem that at the end of the
    world the cleansing will be done immediately by God and not by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++49%3A3"
      >Ps. 49:3</a
    >): "A fire shall burn before Him, and a mighty tempest shall be around
    Him"; and afterwards in reference to the judgment (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++49%3A4"
      >Ps. 49:4</a
    >): "He shall call heaven from above, and the earth to judge His people."
    Therefore it would seem that the final cleansing of the world will be by
    means of fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++3%3A12"
      >2 Pt. 3:12</a
    >): "The heavens being on fire will be dissolved, and the elements shall
    melt with the burning heat." Therefore this cleansing will be effected by
    fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As stated above (<a
      href="XP074.html#XPQ74A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >) this cleansing of the world will remove from it the stain contracted from
    sin, and the impurity resulting from mixture, and will be a disposition to
    the perfection of glory; and consequently in this threefold respect it will
    be most fitting for it to be effected by fire. First, because since fire is
    the most noble of the elements, its natural properties are more like the
    properties of glory, and this is especially clear in regard to light.
    Secondly, because fire, on account of the efficacy of its active virtue, is
    not as susceptible as the other elements to the admixture of a foreign
    matter. Thirdly, because the sphere of fire is far removed from our abode;
    nor are we so familiar with the use of fire as with that of earth, water,
    and air, so that it is not so liable to depreciation. Moreover, it is most
    efficacious in cleansing and in separating by a process of rarefaction.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Fire is not employed by us in its proper
    matter (since thus it is far removed from us), but only in a foreign matter:
    and in this respect it will be possible for the world to be cleansed by fire
    as existing in its pure state. But in so far as it has an admixture of some
    foreign matter it will be possible for it to be cleansed; and thus it will
    be cleanser and cleansed under different aspects. and this is not
    unreasonable.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The first cleansing of the world by the
    deluge regarded only the stain of sin. Now the sin which was most prevalent
    then was the sin of concupiscence, and consequently it was fitting that the
    cleansing should be by means of its contrary, namely water. But the second
    cleansing regards both the stain of sin and the impurity of mixture, and in
    respect of both it is more fitting for it to be effected by fire than by
    water. For the power of water tends to unite rather than to separate;
    wherefore the natural impurity of the elements could not be removed by water
    as by fire. Moreover, at the end of the world the prevalent sin will be that
    of tepidity, as though the world were already growing old, because then,
    according to Mt. 24:12, "the charity of many shall grow cold," and
    consequently the cleansing will then be fittingly effected by fire. Nor is
    there any thing that cannot in some way be cleansed by fire: some things,
    however, cannot be cleansed by fire without being destroyed themselves, such
    as cloths and wooden vessels, and these the Law ordered to be cleansed with
    water; yet all these things will be finally destroyed by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> By the work of distinction things
    received different forms whereby they are distinct from one another: and
    consequently this could only be done by Him Who is the author of nature. But
    by the final cleansing things will be restored to the purity wherein they
    were created, wherefore created nature will be able to minister to its
    Creator to this effect; and for this reason is a creature employed as a
    minister, that it is ennobled thereby.<br />

  <h3 align="left">
    Whether the fire whereby the world will be cleansed will be of the same
    species with elemental fire?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fire in question is not of
    the same species as elemental fire. For nothing consumes itself. But that
    fire will consume the four elements according to a gloss on 2 Pt. 3:12.
    Therefore that fire will not be of the same species as elemental fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as power is made known by operation, so
    is nature made known by power. Now that fire will have a different power
    from the fire which is an element: because it will cleanse the universe,
    whereas this fire cannot do that. Therefore it will not be of the same
    species as this.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, in natural bodies those that are of the
    same species have the same movement. But that fire will have a different
    movement from the fire that is an element, because it will move in all
    directions so as to cleanse the whole. Therefore it is not of the same
    species.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 16), and his
    words are contained in a gloss on 1 Cor. 7:31, that "the fashion of this
    world will perish in the burning of worldly flames." Therefore that fire
    will be of the same nature as the fire which is now in the world.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, just as the future cleansing is to be by fire, so was the past
    cleansing by water: and they are both compared to one another, 2 Pt. 3:5.
    Now in the first cleansing the water was of the same species with elemental
    water. Therefore in like manner the fire of the second cleansing will be of
    the same species with elemental fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> We meet with three opinions on this question.
    For some say that the element of fire which is in its own sphere will come
    down to cleanse the world: and they explain this descent by way of
    multiplication, because the fire will spread through finding combustible
    matter on all sides. And this will result all the more then since the virtue
    of the fire will be raised over all the elements. Against this, however,
    would seem to be not only the fact that this fire will come down, but also
    the statement of the saints that it will rise up; thus (2 Pt. 3:10) it is
    declared that the fire of the judgment will rise as high as the waters of
    the deluge; whence it would seem to follow that this fire is situated
    towards the middle of the place of generation. Hence others say that this
    fire will be generated towards the intervening space through the focusing
    together of the rays of the heavenly bodies, just as we see them focused
    together in a burning-glass; for at that time in lieu of glasses there will
    be concave clouds, on which the rays will strike But this again does not
    seem probable: for since the effects of heavenly bodies depend on certain
    fixed positions and aspects, if this fire resulted from the virtue of the
    heavenly bodies, the time of this cleansing would be known to those who
    observe the movements of the stars and this is contrary to the authority of
    Scripture. Consequently others, following Augustine, say that "just as the
    deluge resulted from an outpouring of the waters of the world, so the
    fashion of this world will perish by a burning of worldly flames" (De Civ.
    Dei. xx, 16). This burning is nothing else but the assembly of all those
    lower and higher causes that by their nature have a kindling virtue: and
    this assembly will take place not in the ordinary course of things, but by
    the Divine power: and from all these causes thus assembled the fire that
    will burn the surface of this world will result. If we consider aright these
    opinions, we shall find that they differ as to the cause producing this fire
    and not as to its species. For fire, whether produced by the sun or by some
    lower heating cause, is of the same species as fire in its own sphere,
    except in so far as the former has some admixture of foreign matter. And
    this will of necessity be the case then, since fire cannot cleanse a thing,
    unless this become its matter in some way. Hence we must grant that the fire
    in question is simply of the same species as ours.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fire in question, although of the
    same species as ours, is not identically the same. Now we see that of two
    fires of the same species one destroys the other, namely the greater
    destroys the lesser, by consuming its matter. In like manner that fire will
    be able to destroy our fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as an operation that proceeds from
    the virtue of a thing is an indication of that virtue, so is its virtue an
    indication of its essence or nature, if it proceed from the essential
    principles of the thing. But an operation that does not proceed from the
    virtue of the operator does not indicate its virtue. This appears in
    instruments: for the action of an instrument shows forth the virtue of the
    mover rather than that of the instrument, since it shows forth the virtue of
    the agent in so far as the latter is the first principle of the action,
    whereas it does not show forth the virtue of the instrument, except in so
    far as it is susceptive of the influence of the principal agent as moving
    that instrument. In like manner a virtue that does not proceed from the
    essential principles of a thing does not indicate the nature of that thing
    except in the point of susceptibility. Thus the virtue whereby hot water can
    heat is no indication of the nature of water except in the point of its
    being receptive of heat. Consequently nothing prevents water that has this
    virtue from being of the same species as water that has it not. In like
    manner it is not unreasonable that this fire, which will have the power to
    cleanse the surface of the world, will be of the same species as the fire to
    which we are used, since the heating power therein arises, not from its
    essential principles but from the divine power or operation: whether we say
    that this power is an absolute quality, such as heat in hot water, or a kind
    of intention as we have ascribed to instrumental virtue (Sent. iv, D, 1, qu.
    1, <a href="XP074.html#XPQ74A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>) [*Cf. TP, Question
    [62], Article [4], ad 1]. The latter is more probable since that fire will
    not act save as the instrument of the Divine power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Of its own nature fire tends only
    upwards; but in so far as it pursues its matter, which it requires when it
    is outside its own sphere, it follows the site of combustible matter.
    Accordingly it is not unreasonable for it to take a circular or a downward
    course, especially in so far as it acts as the instrument of the Divine
    power.<br />

    Whether that fire will cleanse also the higher heavens?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that that fire will cleanse also
    the higher heavens. For it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++101%3A26,27"
      >Ps. 101:26,27</a
    >): "The heavens are the works of Thy hands: they shall perish but Thou
    remainest." Now the higher heavens also are the work of God's hands.
    Therefore they also shall perish in the final burning of the world.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++3%3A12"
      >2 Pt. 3:12</a
    >): "The heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the elements shall
    melt with the burning heat of fire." Now the heavens that are distinct from
    the elements are the higher heavens, wherein the stars are fixed. Therefore
    it would seem that they also will be cleansed by that fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the purpose of that fire will be to
    remove from bodies their indisposition to the perfection of glory. Now in
    the higher heaven we find this indisposition both as regards guilt, since
    the devil sinned there, and as regards natural deficiency, since a gloss on
    Rm. 8:22, "We know that every creature groaneth and is in labor even until
    now," says: "All the elements fulfill their duty with labor: even as it is
    not without labor that the sun and moon travel their appointed course."
    Therefore the higher heavens also will be cleansed by that fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> "The heavenly bodies are not receptive of
    impressions from without" [*Cf. Sent. Philosop. ex Arist. collect. lit.
    c.---Among the works of Bede].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, a gloss on 2 Thess. 1:8, "In a flame of fire giving vengeance,"
    says: "There will be in the world a fire that shall precede Him, and shall
    rise in the air to the same height as did the waters of the deluge." But the
    waters of the deluge did not rise to the height of the higher heavens but
    only 15 cubits higher than the mountain summits (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++7%3A20"
      >Gn. 7:20</a
    >). Therefore the higher heavens will not be cleansed by that fire.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The cleansing of the world will be for the
    purpose of removing from bodies the disposition contrary to the perfection
    of glory, and this perfection is the final consummation of the universe: and
    this disposition is to be found in all bodies, but differently in different
    bodies. For in some this indisposition regards something inherent to their
    substance: as in these lower bodies which by being mixed together fall away
    from their own purity. In others this indisposition does not regard
    something inherent to their substance; as in the heavenly bodies, wherein
    nothing is to be found contrary to the final perfection of the universe,
    except movement which is the way to perfection, and this not any kind of
    movement, but only local movement, which changes nothing intrinsic to a
    thing, such as its substance, quantity, or quality, but only its place which
    is extrinsic to it. Consequently there is no need to take anything away from
    the substance of the higher heavens, but only to set its movement at rest.
    Now local movement is brought to rest not by the action of a counter agent,
    but by the mover ceasing to move; and therefore the heavenly bodies will not
    be cleansed, neither by fire nor by the action of any creature, but in lieu
    of being cleansed they will be set at rest by God's will alone.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx,
    18,24): "Those words of the psalm refer to the aerial heavens which will be
    cleansed by the fire of the final conflagration." Or we may reply that if
    they refer also to the higher heavens, these are said to perish as regards
    their movement whereby now they are moved without cessation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Peter explains himself to which heavens
    he refers. For before the words quoted, he had said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++3%3A5-7"
      >2 Pt. 3:5-7</a
    >): "The heavens... first, and the earth... through water... perished...
    which... now, by the same word are kept in store, reserved unto fire unto
    the day of judgment." [*The entire text differs somewhat from St. Thomas's
    quotation; but the sense is the same.] Therefore the heavens to be cleansed
    are those which before were cleansed by the waters of the deluge, namely the
    aerial heavens.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This labor and service of the creature,
    that Ambrose ascribes to the heavenly bodies, is nothing else than the
    successive movements whereby they are subject to time, and the lack of that
    final consummation which they will attain in the end. Nor did the empyrean
    heaven contract any stain from the sin of the demons, because they were
    expelled from that heaven as soon as they sinned.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether that fire will consume the other elements?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fire in question will
    consume the other elements. For a gloss of Bede on 2 Pt. 3:12 says: "This
    exceeding great fire will engulf the four elements whereof the world
    consists: yet it will not so engulf all things that they will cease to be,
    but it will consume two of them entirely, and will restore two of them to a
    better fashion." Therefore it would seem that at least two of the elements
    are to be entirely destroyed by that fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++21%3A1"
      >Apoc. 21:1</a
    >): "The first heaven and the first earth have passed away and the sea is no
    more." Now the heaven here denotes the air, as Augustine states (De Civ. Dei
    xx, 18); and the sea denotes the gathering together of the waters. Therefore
    it would seem that these three elements will be wholly destroyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, fire does not cleanse except in so far
    as other things are made to be its matter. If, then, fire cleanses the other
    elements, they must needs become its matter. Therefore they must pass into
    its nature, and consequently be voided of their own nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the form of fire is the most noble of
    the forms to which elemental matter can attain. Now all things will be
    brought to the most noble state by this cleansing. Therefore the other
    elements will be wholly transformed into fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> A gloss on 1 Cor. 7:31, "The fashion of this
    world passeth away," says: "The beauty, not the substance, passeth." But the
    very substance of the elements belongs to the perfection of the world.
    Therefore the elements will not be consumed as to their substance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, this final cleansing that will be effected by fire will correspond
    to the first cleansing which was effected by water. Now the latter did not
    corrupt the substance of the elements. Therefore neither will the former
    which will be the work of fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> There are many opinions on this question. For
    some say that all the elements will remain as to their matter, while all
    will be changed as regards their imperfection; but that two of them will
    retain their respective substantial form, namely air and earth, while two of
    them, namely fire and water, will not retain their substantial form but will
    be changed to the form of heaven. In this way three elements, namely air,
    fire, and water, will be called "heaven"; although air will retain the same
    substantial form as it has now, since even now it is called "heaven."
    Wherefore (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++21%3A1"
      >Apoc. 21:1</a
    >) only heaven and earth are mentioned: "I saw," says he, "a new heaven and
    a new earth." But this opinion is altogether absurd: for it is opposed both
    to philosophy---which holds it impossible for the lower bodies to be in
    potentiality to the form of heaven, since they have neither a common matter,
    nor mutual contrariety---and to theology, since according to this opinion
    the perfection of the universe with the integrity of its parts will not be
    assured on account of two of the elements being destroyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Consequently "heaven" is taken to denote the fifth body, while all the
    elements are designated by "earth," as expressed in Ps. 148:7,8, "Praise the
    Lord from the earth" and afterwards, "fire, hail, snow, ice," etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Hence others say that all the elements will remain as to their substance,
    but that their active and passive qualities will be taken from them: even as
    they say too, that in a mixed body the elements retain their substantial
    form without having their proper qualities, since these are reduced to a
    mean, and a mean is neither of the extremes. And seemingly the following
    words of Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx, 16) would seem in agreement with this:
    "In this conflagration of the world the qualities of the corruptible
    elements that were befitting our corruptible bodies will entirely perish by
    fire: and the substance itself will have those qualities that become an
    immortal body."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    However, this does not seem probable, for since the proper qualities of the
    elements are the effects of their substantial form, it seems impossible, as
    long as the substantial forms remain, for the aforesaid qualities to be
    changed, except for a time by some violent action: thus in hot water we see
    that by virtue of its species it returns to the cold temperature which it
    had lost by the action of fire, provided the species of water remain.
    Moreover, these same elemental qualities belong to the second perfection of
    the elements, as being their proper passions: nor is it probable that in
    this final consummation the elements will lose anything of their natural
    perfection. Wherefore it would seem that the reply to this question should
    be that the elements will remain as to their substance and proper qualities,
    but that they will be cleansed both from the stain which they contracted
    from the sins of men, and from the impurity resulting in them through their
    mutual action and passion: because when once the movement of the first
    movable body ceases, mutual action and passion will be impossible in the
    lower elements: and this is what Augustine calls the "qualities of
    corruptible elements," namely their unnatural dispositions by reason of
    which they come near to corruption.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> That fire is said to engulf the four
    elements in so far as in some way it will cleanse them. But when it is said
    further that "it will consume two entirely," this does not mean that two of
    the elements are to be destroyed as to their substance, but that two will be
    more changed from the property which they have now. Some say that these two
    are fire and water which excel the others in their active qualities, namely
    heat and cold, which are the chief principles of corruption in other bodies;
    and since then there will be no action of fire and water which surpass the
    others in activity, they would seem especially to be changed from the virtue
    which they have now. Others, however, say that these two are air and water,
    on account of the various movements of these two elements, which movements
    they derive from the movement of the heavenly bodies. And since these
    movements will cease (such as the ebb and flow of the sea, and the
    disturbances of winds and so forth), therefore these elements especially
    will be changed from the property which they have now.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> As Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 16),
    when it is stated: "And the sea is no more," by the sea we may understand
    the present world of which he had said previously (De Civ. Dei xx, 13): "The
    sea gave up the dead that were in it." If, however, the sea be taken
    literally we must reply that by the sea two things are to be understood,
    namely the substance of the waters, and their disposition, as containing
    salt and as to the movement of the waves. The sea will remain, not as to
    this second, but as to the first.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This fire will not act save as the
    instrument of God's providence and power; wherefore it will not act on the
    other elements so as to consume them but only so as to cleanse them. Nor is
    it necessary for that which becomes the matter of fire, to be voided of its
    proper species entirely, as instanced by incandescent iron, which by virtue
    of its species that remains returns to its proper and former state as soon
    as it is taken from the furnace. It will be the same with the elements after
    they are cleansed by fire.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In the elemental parts we must consider
    not only what is befitting a part considered in itself, but also what is
    befitting it in its relation to the whole. I say, then, that although water
    would be more noble if it had the form of fire, as likewise would earth and
    air, yet the universe would be more imperfect, if all elemental matter were
    to assume the form of fire.<br />

    Whether all the elements will be cleansed by that fire?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that neither will all the elements
    be cleansed by that fire. Because that fire, as stated already (<a
      href="XP074.html#XPQ74A3THEP1"
      >Article [3]</a
    >), will not rise higher than the waters of the deluge. But the waters of
    the deluge did not reach to the sphere of fire. Therefore neither will the
    element of fire be cleansed by the final cleansing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a gloss on Apoc. 21:1, "I saw a new
    heaven," etc., says: "There can be no doubt that the transformation of the
    air and earth will be caused by fire; but it is doubtful about water, since
    it is believed to have the power of cleansing itself." Therefore at least it
    is uncertain that all the elements will be cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a place where there is an everlasting
    stain is never cleansed. Now there will always be a stain in hell. Since,
    then, hell is situated among the elements, it would seem that the elements
    will not be wholly cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, the earthly paradise is situated on the
    earth. Yet it will not be cleansed by fire, since not even the waters of the
    deluge reached it, as Bede says (Hexaem. i, ad Gen. 2:8), as is stated in
    Sentent. ii, D, 7. Therefore it would seem that the elements will not all be
    wholly cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The gloss quoted above (<a
      href="XP074.html#XPQ74A5THEP1"
      >Article [5]</a
    >, Objection [1]) on 2 Pt. 3:12 declares that "this fire will engulf the
    four elements."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some [*St. Bonaventure, Sentent. iv, D, 47,
    Article [2], Question [3]] say that the fire in question will rise to the
    summit of the space containing the four elements: so that the elements would
    be entirely cleansed both from the stain of sin by which also the higher
    parts of the elements were infected (as instanced by the smoke of idolatry
    which stained the higher regions), and again from corruption, since the
    elements are corruptible in all their parts. But this opinion is opposed to
    the authority of Scripture, because it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=2+Pt++3%3A7"
      >2 Pt. 3:7</a
    >) that those heavens are "kept in store unto fire," which were cleansed by
    water; and Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 18) that "the same world which
    perished in the deluge is reserved unto fire." Now it is clear that the
    waters of the deluge did not rise to the summit of the space occupied by the
    elements, but only 15 cubits above the mountain tops; and moreover it is
    known that vapors or any smoke whatever rising from the earth cannot pierce
    the entire sphere of fire so as to reach its summit; and so the stain of sin
    did not reach the aforesaid space. Nor can the elements be cleansed from
    corruptibility by the removal of something that might be consumed by fire:
    whereas it will be possible for the impurities of the elements arising from
    their mingling together to be consumed by fire. And these impurities are
    chiefly round about the earth as far as the middle of the air: wherefore the
    fire of the final conflagration will cleanse up to that point, since the
    waters of the deluge rose to a height which can be approximately calculated
    from the height of the mountains which they surpassed in a fixed measure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>We therefore grant the First Objection.</p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The reason for doubt is expressed in the
    gloss, because, to wit, water is believed to have in itself the power of
    cleansing, yet not such a power as will be competent to the future state, as
    stated above (<a href="XP074.html#XPQ74A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>;
    <a href="XP074.html#XPQ74A5A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 2).<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The purpose of this cleansing will be
    chiefly to remove all imperfection from the abode of the saints; and
    consequently in this cleansing all that is foul will be brought together to
    the place of the damned: so hell will not be cleansed, and the dregs of the
    whole earth will be brought thither, according to Ps. 74:9, "The dregs
    thereof are not emptied, all the sinners of the earth shall drink."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although the sin of the first man was
    committed in the earthly paradise, this is not the place of sinners, as
    neither is the empyrean heaven: since from both places man and devil were
    expelled forthwith after their sin. Consequently that place needs no
    cleansing.<br />

    Whether the fire of the final conflagration is to follow the judgment?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the fire of the final
    conflagration is to follow the judgment. For Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx, 30)
    gives the following order of the things to take place at the judgment,
    saying: "At this judgment we have learned that the following things will
    occur. Elias the Thesbite will appear, the Jews will believe, Antichrist
    will persecute, Christ will judge, the dead shall rise again, the good shall
    be separated from the wicked, the world shall be set on fire and shall be
    renewed." Therefore the burning will follow the judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 16):
    "After the wicked have been judged, and cast into everlasting fire, the
    figure of this world will perish in the furnace of worldly flames."
    Therefore the same conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, when the Lord comes to judgment He will
    find some men living, as appears from the words of 1 Thess. 4:16, where the
    Apostle speaking in their person says: "Then we who are alive, who remain
    unto the coming of the Lord [*Vulg.: 'who are left, shall be taken... to
    meet Christ'---the words "who remain," etc., are from 1 Thess. 4:14]." But
    it would not be so, if the burning of the world were to come first, since
    they would be destroyed by the fire. Therefore this fire will follow the
    judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is said that our Lord will come to
    judge the earth by fire, and consequently the final conflagration would seem
    to be the execution of the sentence of Divine judgment. Now execution
    follows judgment. Therefore that fire will follow the judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++96%3A3"
      >Ps. 96:3</a
    >): "A fire shall go before Him."
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the resurrection will precede the judgment, else every eye would
    not see Christ judging. Now the burning of the world will precede the
    resurrection, for the saints who will rise again will have spiritual and
    impassible bodies, so that it will be impossible for the fire to cleanse
    them, and yet the text (Sent. iv, D, 47) quotes Augustine (De Civ. Dei xx,
    18) as saying that "whatever needs cleansing in any way shall be cleansed by
    that fire." Therefore that fire will precede the judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The fire in question will in reality, as
    regards its beginning, precede the judgment. This can clearly be gathered
    from the fact that the resurrection of the dead will precede the judgment,
    since according to 1 Thess. 4:13-16, those who have slept "shall be taken
    up... in the clouds... into the air... to meet Christ coming to judgment."
    Now the general resurrection and the glorification of the bodies of the
    saints will happen at the same time; for the saints in rising again will
    assume a glorified body, as evidenced by 1 Cor. 15:43, "It is sown in
    dishonor, it shall rise in glory": and at the same time as the saints'
    bodies shall be glorified, all creatures shall be renewed, each in its own
    way, as appears from the statement (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++8%3A21"
      >Rm. 8:21</a
    >) that "the creature... itself shall be delivered from the servitude of
    corruption into the liberty of the glory of the children of God." Since then
    the burning of the world is a disposition to the aforesaid renewal, as
    stated above (<a href="XP074.html#XPQ74ATHEP1">Articles [1]</a>,4); it can
    clearly be gathered that this burning, so far as it shall cleanse the world,
    will precede the judgment, but as regards a certain action thereof, whereby
    it will engulf the wicked, it will follow the judgment.
  </p>

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Augustine is speaking not as one who
    decides the point, but as expressing an opinion. This is clear from his
    continuing thus: "That all these things are to happen is a matter of faith,
    but how and in what order we shall learn more then by experience of the
    things themselves than now by seeking a definite conclusion by arguing about
    them. Methinks, however, they will occur in the order I have given." Hence
    it is clear that he is speaking as offering his opinion. The same answer
    applies to the Second Objection.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All men shall die and rise again: yet
    those are said to be found alive who will live in the body until the time of
    the conflagration.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> That fire will not carry out the
    sentence of the judge except as regards the engulfing of the wicked: in this
    respect it will follow the judgment.<br />

    Whether that fire will have such an effect on men as is described?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this fire will not have such
    an effect on men as is described in the text (Sent. iv, D, 47). For a thing
    is said to be consumed when it is reduced to naught. Now the bodies of the
    wicked will not be reduced to naught, but will be kept for eternity, that
    they may bear an eternal punishment. Therefore this fire will not consume
    the wicked, as stated in the text.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if it be said that it will consume the
    bodies of the wicked by reducing them to ashes; on the contrary, as the
    bodies of the wicked, so will those of the good be brought to ashes: for it
    is the privilege of Christ alone that His flesh see not corruption.
    Therefore it will consume also the good who will then be found.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the stain of sin is more abundant in the
    elements, as combining together to the formation of the human body wherein
    is the corruption of the fomes [*Cf. FS, Question [83], Article [3]; FS,
    Question [91], Article [6]] even in the good, than in the elements existing
    outside the human body. Now the elements existing outside the human body
    will be cleansed on account of the stain of sin. Much therefore will the
    elements in the human body whether of the good or of the wicked need to be
    cleansed, and consequently the bodies of both will need to be destroyed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, as long as the state of the way lasts
    the elements act in like manner on the good and the wicked. Now the state of
    the way will still endure in that conflagration, since after this state of
    the way death will not be natural, and yet it will be caused by that fire.
    Therefore that fire will act equally on good and wicked; and consequently it
    does not seem that any distinction is made between them as to their being
    affected by that fire, as stated in the text.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, this fire will have done its work in a
    moment as it were. Yet there will be many among the living in whom there
    will be many things to be cleansed. Therefore that fire will not suffice for
    their cleansing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> This fire of the final conflagration, in so far
    as it will precede the judgment, will act as the instrument of Divine
    justice as well as by the natural virtue of fire. Accordingly, as regards
    its natural virtue, it will act in like manner on the wicked and good who
    will be alive, by reducing the bodies of both to ashes. But in so far as it
    acts as the instrument of Divine justice, it will act differently on
    different people as regards the sense of pain. For the wicked will be
    tortured by the action of the fire; whereas the good in whom there will be
    nothing to cleanse will feel no pain at all from the fire, as neither did
    the children in the fiery furnace (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++3"
      >Dan. 3</a
    >); although their bodies will not be kept whole, as were the bodies of the
    children: and it will be possible by God's power for their bodies to be
    destroyed without their suffering pain. But the good, in whom matter for
    cleansing will be found, will suffer pain from that fire, more or less
    according to their different merits.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    On the other hand, as regards the action which this fire will have after the
    judgment, it will act on the damned alone, since the good will all have
    impassible bodies.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Consumption there signifies being
    brought, not to nothing, but to ashes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although the bodies of the good will be
    reduced to ashes by the fire, they will not suffer pain thereby, as neither
    did the children in the Babylonian furnace. In this respect a distinction is
    drawn between the good and the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The elements that are in human bodies,
    even in the bodies of the elect, will be cleansed by fire. But this will be
    done, by God's power, without their suffering pain.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> This fire will act not only according to
    the natural power of the element, but also as the instrument of Divine
    justice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> There are three reasons why those who
    will be found living will be able to be cleansed suddenly. One is because
    there will be few things in them to be cleansed, since they will be already
    cleansed by the previous fears and persecutions. The second is because they
    will suffer pain both while living and of their own will: and pain suffered
    in this life voluntarily cleanses much more than pain inflicted after death,
    as in the case of the martyrs, because "if anything needing to be cleansed
    be found in them, it is cut off by the sickle of suffering," as Augustine
    says (De Unic. Bap. xiii), although the pain of martyrdom is of short
    duration in comparison with the pain endured in purgatory. The third is
    because the heat will gain in intensity what it loses in shortness of
    time.<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether that fire will engulf the wicked?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that that fire will not engulf the
    wicked. For a gloss on Malachi 3:3, "He shall purify the sons of Levi," says
    that "it is a fire consuming the wicked and refining the good"; and a gloss
    on 1 Cor. 3:13, "Fire shall try every man's work," says: "We read that there
    will be a twofold fire, one that will cleanse the elect and will precede the
    judgment, another that will torture the wicked." Now the latter is the fire
    of hell that shall engulf the wicked, while the former is the fire of the
    final conflagration. Therefore the fire of the final conflagration will not
    be that which will engulf the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that fire will obey God in the cleansing
    of the world: therefore it should receive its reward like the other
    elements, especially since fire is the most noble of the elements. Therefore
    it would seem that it ought not to be cast into hell for the punishment of
    the damned.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the fire that will engulf the wicked
    will be the fire of hell: and this fire was prepared from the beginning of
    the world for the damned; hence it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++25%3A41"
      >Mt. 25:41</a
    >): "Depart... you cursed... into everlasting fire which was prepared for
    the devil," etc., and (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++30%3A33"
      >Is. 30:33</a
    >): "Tophet is prepared from yesterday, prepared by the king," etc., where a
    gloss observes: "From yesterday, i.e. from the beginning---Tophet, i.e. the
    valley of hell." But this fire of the final conflagration was not prepared
    from the beginning, but will result from the meeting together of the fires
    of the world. Therefore that fire is not the fire of hell which will engulf
    the wicked.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> are the words of Ps. 96:3, where it is said
    of this fire that it "shall burn His enemies round about."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A10"
      >Dan. 7:10</a
    >): "A swift stream of fire issued forth from before Him"; and a gloss adds,
    "to drag sinners into hell." Now the passage quoted refers to that fire of
    which we are now speaking, as appears from a gloss which observes on the
    same words: "In order to punish the wicked and cleanse the good." Therefore
    the fire of the final conflagration will be plunged into hell together with
    the wicked<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The entire cleansing of the world and the
    renewal for the purpose of cleansing will be directed to the renewal of man:
    and consequently the cleansing and renewal of the world must needs
    correspond with the cleansing and renewal of mankind. Now mankind will be
    cleansed in one way by the separation of the wicked from the good: wherefore
    it is said (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++3%3A17"
      >Lk. 3:17</a
    >): "Whose fan is in His hand, and He will purge His poor, and will gather
    the wheat," i.e. the elect, "into His barn, but the chaff," i.e. the wicked,
    "He will burn with unquenchable fire." Hence it will be thus with the
    cleansing of the world, so that all that is ugly and vile will be cast with
    the wicked into hell, and all that is beautiful and noble will be taken up
    above for the glory of the elect: and so too will it be with the fire of
    that conflagration, as Basil says in Ps. 28:7, "The voice of the Lord
    divideth the flame of fire," because whatever fire contains of burning heat
    and gross matter will go down into hell for the punishment of the wicked,
    and whatever is subtle and lightsome will remain above for the glory of the
    elect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fire that will cleanse the elect
    before the judgment will be the same as the fire that will burn the world,
    although some say the contrary. For it is fitting that man, being a part of
    the world, be cleansed with the same fire as the world. They are, however,
    described as two fires, that will cleanse the good, and torture the wicked,
    both in reference to their respective offices, and somewhat in reference to
    their substance: since the substance of the cleansing fire will not all be
    cast into hell, as stated above.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> This fire will be rewarded because
    whatever it contains of gross matter will be separated from it, and cast
    into hell.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The punishment of the wicked, even as
    the glory of the elect, will be greater after the judgment than before.
    Wherefore, just as charity will be added to the higher creature in order to
    increase the glory of the elect, so too whatever is vile in creatures will
    be thrust down into hell in order to add to the misery of the damned.
    Consequently it is not unbecoming that another fire be added to the fire of
    the damned that was prepared from the beginning of the world.<br />
