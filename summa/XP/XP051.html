  <h3 align="center">OF THE IMPEDIMENT OF ERROR (TWO ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the impediments to matrimony in particular, and in the
    first place the impediment of error. Under this head there are two points of
    inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP051.html#XPQ51A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether error of its very nature
    is an impediment to matrimony?
  </p>
  <p><a href="XP051.html#XPQ51A2THEP1">(2)</a> What kind of error?</p>

    Whether it is right to reckon error as an impediment to marriage?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that error should not be reckoned
    in itself an impediment to marriage. For consent, which is the efficient
    cause of marriage, is hindered in the same way as the voluntary. Now the
    voluntary, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. iii, 1), may be hindered by
    ignorance. But ignorance is not the same as error, because ignorance
    excludes knowledge altogether, whereas error does not, since "error is to
    approve the false as though it were true," according to Augustine (De Trin.
    ix, 11). Therefore ignorance rather than error should have been reckoned
    here as an impediment to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, that which of its very nature can be an
    impediment to marriage is in opposition to the good of marriage. But error
    is not a thing of this kind. Therefore error is not by its very nature an
    impediment to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, just as consent is required for
    marriage, so is intention required for baptism. Now if one were to baptize
    John, thinking to baptize Peter, John would be baptized none the less.
    Therefore error does not annul matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there was true marriage between Lia and
    Jacob, and yet, in this case, there was error. Therefore error does not
    annul a marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said in the Digests (Si per errorem,
    ff. De jurisdic. omn. judic.): "What is more opposed to consent than error?"
    Now consent is required for marriage. Therefore error is an impediment to
    matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, consent denotes something voluntary. Now error is an obstacle to
    the voluntary, since "the voluntary," according to the Philosopher (Ethic.
    iii, 1), Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii, 24), and Gregory of Nyssa [*Nemesius]
    (De Nat. Hom. xxxii), "is that which has its principle in one who has
    knowledge of singulars which are the matter of actions." But this does not
    apply to one who is in error. Therefore error is an impediment to
    matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Whatever hinders a cause, of its very nature
    hinders the effect likewise. Now consent is the cause of matrimony, as
    stated above (<a href="XP045.html#XPQ45OUTP1">Question [45]</a>,
    <a href="XP045.html#XPQ45A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence whatever voids the
    consent, voids marriage. Now consent is an act of the will, presupposing an
    act of the intellect; and if the first be lacking, the second must needs be
    lacking also. Hence, when error hinders knowledge, there follows a defect in
    the consent also, and consequently in the marriage. Therefore it is possible
    according to the natural law for error to void marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Speaking simply, ignorance differs from
    error, because ignorance does not of its very nature imply an act of
    knowledge, while error supposes a wrong judgment of reason about something.
    However, as regards being an impediment to the voluntary, it differs not
    whether we call it ignorance or error, since no ignorance can be an
    impediment to the voluntary, unless it have error in conjunction with it,
    because the will's act presupposes an estimate or judgment about something
    which is the object of the will. Wherefore if there be ignorance there must
    needs be error; and for this reason error is set down as being the proximate
    cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although error is not of itself contrary
    to matrimony, it is contrary thereto as regards the cause of marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The character of baptism is not caused
    directly by the intention of the baptizer, but by the material element
    applied outwardly; and the intention is effective only as directing the
    material element to its effect; whereas the marriage tie is caused by the
    consent directly. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> According to the Master (Sent. iv, D,
    30) the marriage between Lia and Jacob was effected not by their coming
    together, which happened through an error, but by their consent, which
    followed afterwards. Yet both are clearly to be excused from sin (Sent. iv,
    D, 30).<br />

  <h3 align="left">Whether every error is an impediment to matrimony?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every error is an impediment
    to matrimony, and not, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 30), only error
    about the condition or the person. For that which applies to a thing as such
    applies to it in all its bearings. Now error is of its very nature an
    impediment to matrimony, as stated above (<a href="XP051.html#XPQ51A1THEP1"
      >Article [1]</a
    >). Therefore every error is an impediment to matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if error, as such, is an impediment to
    matrimony, the greater the error the greater the impediment. Now the error
    concerning faith in a heretic who disbelieves in this sacrament is greater
    than an error concerning the person. Therefore it should be a greater
    impediment than error about the person.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, error does not void marriage except as
    removing voluntariness. Now ignorance about any circumstance takes away
    voluntariness (Ethic. iii, 1). Therefore it is not only error about
    condition or person that is an impediment to matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, just as the condition of slavery is an
    accident affecting the person, so are bodily or mental qualities. But error
    regarding the condition is an impediment to matrimony. Therefore error
    concerning quality or fortune is equally an impediment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, just as slavery or freedom pertains to
    the condition of person, so do high and low rank, or dignity of position and
    the lack thereof. Now error regarding the condition of slavery is an
    impediment to matrimony. Therefore error about the other matters mentioned
    is also an impediment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, just as the condition of slavery is an
    impediment, so are difference of worship and impotence, as we shall say
    further on (<a href="XP052.html#XPQ52OUTP1">Question [52]</a>,
    <a href="XP052.html#XPQ52A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>;
    <a href="XP058.html#XPQ58OUTP1">Question [58]</a>,
    <a href="XP058.html#XPQ58A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="XP059.html#XPQ59OUTP1">Question [59]</a>,
    <a href="XP059.html#XPQ59A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Therefore just as error
    regarding the condition is an impediment, so also should error about those
    other matters be reckoned an impediment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 7:</i></b> On the other hand, it would seem that not even
    error about the person is an impediment to marriage. For marriage is a
    contract even as a sale is. Now in buying and selling the sale is not voided
    if one coin be given instead of another of equal value. Therefore a marriage
    is not voided if one woman be taken instead of another.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 8:</i></b> Further, it is possible for them to remain in
    this error for many years and to beget between them sons and daughters. But
    it would be a grave assertion to maintain that they ought to be separated
    then. Therefore their previous error did not void their marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 9:</i></b> Further, it might happen that the woman is
    betrothed to the brother of the man whom she thinks that she is consenting
    to marry, and that she has had carnal intercourse with him; in which case,
    seemingly, she cannot go back to the man to whom she thought to give her
    consent, but should hold on to his brother. Thus error regarding the person
    is not an impediment to marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Just as error, through causing involuntariness,
    is an excuse from sin, so on the same count is it an impediment to marriage.
    Now error does not excuse from sin unless it refer to a circumstance the
    presence or absence of which makes an action lawful or unlawful. For if a
    man were to strike his father with an iron rod thinking it to be of wood, he
    is not excused from sin wholly, although perhaps in part; but if a man were
    to strike his father, thinking to strike his son to correct him, he is
    wholly excused provided he take due care. Wherefore error, in order to void
    marriage, must needs be about the essentials of marriage. Now marriage
    includes two things, namely the two persons who are joined together, and the
    mutual power over one another wherein marriage consists. The first of these
    is removed by error concerning the person, the second by error regarding the
    condition, since a slave cannot freely give power over his body to another,
    without his master's consent. For this reason these two errors, and no
    others, are an impediment to matrimony.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It is not from its generic nature that
    error is an impediment to marriage, but from the nature of the difference
    added thereto; namely from its being error about one of the essentials to
    marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> An error of faith about matrimony is
    about things consequent upon matrimony, for instance on the question of its
    being a sacrament, or of its being lawful. Wherefore such error as these is
    no impediment to marriage, as neither does an error about baptism hinder a
    man from receiving the character, provided he intend to receive what the
    Church gives, although he believe it to be nothing.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> It is not any ignorance of a
    circumstance that causes the involuntariness which is an excuse from sin, as
    stated above; wherefore the argument does not prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Difference of fortune or of quality does
    not make a difference in the essentials to matrimony, as the condition of
    slavery does. Hence the argument does not prove.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Error about a person's rank, as such,
    does not void a marriage, for the same reason as neither does error about a
    personal quality. If, however, the error about a person's rank or position
    amounts to an error about the person, it is an impediment to matrimony.
    Hence, if the woman consent directly to this particular person, her error
    about his rank does not void the marriage; but if she intend directly to
    consent to marry the king's son, whoever he may be, then, if another man
    than the king's son be brought to her, there is error about the person, and
    the marriage will be void.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> Error is an impediment to matrimony,
    although it be about other impediments to marriage if it concern those
    things which render a person an unlawful subject of marriage. But (the
    Master) does not mention error about such things, because they are an
    impediment to marriage whether there be error about them or not; so that if
    a woman contract with a subdeacon, whether she know this or not, there is no
    marriage; whereas the condition of slavery is no impediment if the slavery
    be known. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 7:</i></b> In contracts money is regarded as the
    measure of other things (Ethic. v, 5), and not as being sought for its own
    sake. Hence if the coin paid is not what it is thought to be but another of
    equal value, this does not void the contract. But if there be error about a
    thing sought for its own sake, the contract is voided, for instance if one
    were to sell a donkey for a horse; and thus it is in the case in point.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 8:</i></b> No matter how long they have cohabited,
    unless she be willing to consent again, there is no marriage.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 9:</i></b> If she did not consent previously to
    marry his brother, she may hold to the one whom she took in error. Nor can
    she return to his brother, especially if there has been carnal intercourse
    between her and the man she took to husband. If, however, she had previously
    consented to take the first one in words of the present, she cannot have the
    second while the first lives. But she may either leave the second or return
    to the first; and ignorance of the fact excuses her from sin, just as she
    would be excused if after the consummation of the marriage a kinsman of her
    husband were to know her by fraud since she is not to be blamed for the
    other's deceit.<br />
