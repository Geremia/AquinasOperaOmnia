<H3 Align="Center">OF CONFESSION, AS REGARDS ITS NECESSITY (SIX ARTICLES)<br>
</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider confession, about which there are six points for 
our consideration: (1) The necessity of confession; (2) Its nature; (3) 
Its minister; (4) Its quality; (5) Its effect; (6) The seal of confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] Out. Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Under the first head there are six points of inquiry:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP006.html#XPQ6A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether confession is necessary for salvation?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP006.html#XPQ6A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether confession is according to the natural law?

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that confession is not necessary for salvation. For 
the sacrament of Penance is ordained for the sake of the remission of 
sin. But sin is sufficiently remitted by the infusion of grace. Therefore 
confession is not necessary in order to do penance for one's sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, we read of some being forgiven their sins without 
confession, e.g. Peter, Magdalen and Paul. But the grace that remits sins 
is not less efficacious now than it was then. Therefore neither is it 
necessary for salvation now that man should confess.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a sin which is contracted from another, should receive 
its remedy from another. Therefore actual sin, which a man has committed 
through his own act, must take its remedy from the man himself. Now 
Penance is ordained against such sins. Therefore confession is not 
necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, confession is necessary for a judicial sentence, in 
order that punishment may be inflicted in proportion to the offense. Now 
a man is able to inflict on himself a greater punishment than even that 
which might be inflicted on him by another. Therefore it seems that 
confession is not necessary for salvation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Boethius says (De Consol. i): "If you want the 
physician to be of assistance to you, you must make your disease known to 
him." But it is necessary for salvation that man should take medicine for 
his sins. Therefore it is necessary for salvation that man should make 
his disease known by means of confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in a civil court the judge is distinct from the accused. 
Therefore the sinner who is the accused ought not to be his own judge, 
but should be judged by another and consequently ought to confess to him.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Christ's Passion, without whose power, neither original 
nor actual sin is remitted, produces its effect in us through the 
reception of the sacraments which derive their efficacy from it. 
Wherefore for the remission of both actual and original sin, a sacrament 
of the Church is necessary, received either actually, or at least in 
desire, when a man fails to receive the sacrament actually, through an 
unavoidable obstacle, and not through contempt. Consequently those 
sacraments which are ordained as remedies for sin which is incompatible 
with salvation, are necessary for salvation: and so just as Baptism, 
whereby original sin is blotted out, is necessary for salvation, so also 
is the sacrament of Penance. And just as a man through asking to be 
baptized, submits to the ministers of the Church, to whom the 
dispensation of that sacrament belongs, even so, by confessing his sin, a 
man submits to a minister of the Church, that, through the sacrament of 
Penance dispensed by him, he may receive the pardon of his sins: nor can 
the minister apply a fitting remedy, unless he be  acquainted with the 
sin, which knowledge he acquires through the penitent's confession. 
Wherefore confession is necessary for the salvation of a man who has 
fallen into a mortal actual sin.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The infusion of grace suffices for the remission of sin; 
but after the sin has been forgiven, the sinner still owes a debt of 
temporal punishment. Moreover, the sacraments of grace are ordained in 
order that man may receive the infusion of grace, and before he receives 
them, either actually or in his intention, he does not receive grace. 
This is evident in the case of Baptism, and applies to Penance likewise. 
Again, the penitent expiates his temporal punishment by undergoing the 
shame of confession, by the power of the keys to which he submits, and by 
the enjoined satisfaction which the priest moderates according to the 
kind of sins made known to him in confession. Nevertheless the fact that 
confession is necessary for salvation is not due to its conducing to the 
satisfaction for sins, because this punishment to which one remains bound 
after the remission of sin, is temporal, wherefore the way of salvation 
remains open, without such punishment being expiated in this life: but it 
is due to its conducing to the remission of sin, as explained above.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although we do not read that they confessed, it may be that 
they did; for many things were done which were not recorded in writing. 
Moreover Christ has the power of excellence in the sacraments; so that He 
could bestow the reality of the sacrament without using the things which 
belong to the sacrament.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The sin that is contracted from another, viz. original sin, 
can be remedied by an entirely extrinsic cause, as in the case of 
infants: whereas actual sin, which a man commits of himself, cannot be 
expiated, without some operation on the part of the sinner. Nevertheless 
man is not sufficient to expiate his sin by himself, though he was 
sufficient to sin by himself, because sin is finite on the part of the 
thing to which it turns, in which respect the sinner returns to self; 
while, on the part of the aversion, sin derives infinity, in which 
respect the remission of sin must needs begin from someone else, because 
"that which is last in order of generation is first in the order of 
intention" (Ethic. iii). Consequently actual sin also must needs take its 
remedy from another.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Satisfaction would not suffice for the expiation of sin's 
punishment, by reason of the severity of the punishment which is enjoined 
in satisfaction, but it does suffice as being a part of the sacrament 
having the sacramental power; wherefore it ought to be imposed by the 
dispensers of the sacraments, and consequently confession is necessary.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether confession is according to the natural law?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that confession is according to the natural law. 
For Adam and Cain were bound to none but the precepts  of the natural 
law, and yet they are reproached for not confessing their sin. Therefore 
confession of sin is according to the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, those precepts which are common to the Old and New Law 
are according to the natural law. But confession was prescribed in the 
Old Law, as may be gathered from Is. 43:26: "Tell, if thou hast anything 
to justify thyself." Therefore it is according to the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Job was subject only to the natural law. But he 
confessed his sins, as appears from his words (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+31:33">Job 31:33</a>) "If, as a man, 
I have hid my sin." Therefore confession is according to the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Isidore says (Etym. v.) that the natural law is the 
same in all. But confession is not in all in the same way. Therefore it 
is not according to the natural law. Further, confession is made to one 
who has the keys. But the keys of the Church are not an institution of 
the natural law; neither, therefore, is confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The sacraments are professions of faith, wherefore they 
ought to be proportionate to faith. Now faith surpasses the knowledge of 
natural reason, whose dictate is therefore surpassed by the sacraments. 
And since "the natural law is not begotten of opinion, but a product of a 
certain innate power," as Tully states (De Inv. Rhet. ii), consequently 
the sacraments are not part of the natural law, but of the Divine law 
which is above nature. This latter, however, is sometimes called natural, 
in so far as whatever a thing derives from its Creator is natural to it, 
although, properly speaking, those things are said to be natural which 
are caused by the principles of nature. But such things are above nature 
as God reserves to Himself; and these are wrought either through the 
agency of nature, or in the working of miracles, or in the revelation of 
mysteries, or in the institution of the sacraments. Hence confession, 
which is of sacramental necessity, is according to Divine, but not 
according to natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Adam is reproached for not confessing his sin before God: 
because the confession which is made to God by the acknowledgment of 
one's sin, is according to the natural law. whereas here we are speaking 
of confession made to a man. We may also reply that in such a case 
confession of one's sin is according to the natural law, namely when one 
is called upon by the judge to confess in a court of law, for then the 
sinner should not lie by excusing or denying his sin, as Adam and Cain 
are blamed for doing. But confession made voluntarily to a man in order 
to receive from God the forgiveness of one's sins, is not according to 
the natural law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The precepts of the natural law avail in the same way in 
the law of Moses and in the New Law. But although there was  a kind of 
confession in the law of Moses, yet it was not after the same manner as 
in the New Law, nor as in the law of nature; for in the law of nature it 
was sufficient to acknowledge one's sin inwardly before God; while in the 
law of Moses it was necessary for a man to declare his sin by some 
external sign, as by making a sin-offering, whereby the fact of his 
having sinned became known to another man; but it was not necessary for 
him to make known what particular sin he had committed, or what were its 
circumstances, as in the New Law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Job is speaking of the man who hides his sin by denying it 
or excusing himself when he is accused thereof, as we may gather from a 
gloss [*Cf. Gregory, Moral. xxii, 9] on the passage.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that not all are bound to confession, for Jerome 
says on Is. 3:9 ("They have proclaimed abroad"), "their sin," etc.: 
"Penance is the second plank after shipwreck." But some have not suffered 
shipwreck after Baptism. Therefore Penance is not befitting them, and 
consequently neither is confession which is a part of Penance.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is to the judge that confession should be made in any 
court. But some have no judge over them. Therefore they are not bound to 
confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, some have none but venial sins. Now a man is not bound 
to confess such sins. Therefore not everyone is bound to confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Confession is condivided with satisfaction and 
contrition. Now all are bound to contrition and satisfaction. Therefore 
all are bound to confession also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, this appears from the Decretals (De Poenit. et Remiss. xii), 
where it is stated that "all of either sex are bound to confess their 
sins as soon as they shall come to the age of discretion."<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> We are bound to confession on two counts: first, by the 
Divine law, from the very fact that confession is a remedy, and in this 
way not all are bound to confession, but those only who fall into mortal 
sin after Baptism; secondly, by a precept of positive law, and in this 
way all are bound by the precept of the Church laid down in the general 
council (Lateran iv, Can. 21) under Innocent III, both in order that 
everyone may acknowledge himself to be a sinner, because "all have sinned 
and need the grace of God" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++3:23">Rm. 3:23</a>); and that the Eucharist may be 
approached with greater reverence; and lastly, that parish priests may 
know their flock, lest a wolf may hide therein.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although it is possible for a man, in this mortal life, to 
avoid shipwreck, i.e. mortal sin, after Baptism, yet he cannot avoid 
venial sins, which dispose him to shipwreck, and against which also 
Penance is ordained; wherefore there is still room for Penance, and 
consequently for confession, even in those who do not commit mortal sins.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> All must acknowledge Christ as their judge, to Whom they 
must confess in the person of His vicar; and although the latter may be 
the inferior if the penitent be a prelate, yet he is the superior, in so 
far as the penitent is a sinner, while the confessor is the minister of 
Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A man is bound to confess his venial sins, not in virtue of 
the sacrament, but by the institution of the Church, and that, when he 
has no other sins to confess. We may also, with others, answer that the 
Decretal quoted above does not bind others than those who have mortal 
sins to confess. This is evident from the fact that it orders all sins to 
be confessed, which cannot apply to venial sins, because no one can 
confess all his venial sins. Accordingly, a man who has no mortal sins to 
confess, is not bound to confess his venial sins, but it suffices for the 
fulfillment of the commandment of the Church that he present himself 
before the priest, and declare himself to be unconscious of any mortal 
sin: and this will count for his confession.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is lawful for a man to confess a sin which he has not committed?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is lawful for a man to confess a sin which 
he has not committed. For, as Gregory says (Regist. xii), "it is the mark 
of a good conscience to acknowledge a fault where there is none." 
Therefore it is the mark of a good conscience to accuse oneself of those 
sins which one has not committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by humility a man deems himself worse than another, who 
is known to be a sinner, and in this he is to be praised. But it is 
lawful for a man to confess himself to be what he thinks he is. Therefore 
it is lawful to confess having committed a more grievous sin than one has.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, sometimes one doubts about a sin, whether it be mortal 
or venial, in which case, seemingly, one ought to confess it as mortal. 
Therefore a person must sometimes confess a sin which he has not 
committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, satisfaction originates from confession. But a man can 
do satisfaction for a sin which he has not committed. Therefore he can 
also confess a sin which he has not done.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whosoever says he has done what he did not, tells an 
untruth. But no one ought to tell an untruth in confession, since every 
untruth is a sin. Therefore no one should  confess a sin which he has not 
committed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, in the public court of justice, no one should be accused of a 
crime which cannot be proved by means of proper witnesses. Now the 
witness, in the tribunal of Penance, is the conscience. Therefore a man 
ought not to accuse himself of a sin which is not on his conscience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The penitent should, by his confession, make his state 
known to his confessor. Now he who tells the priest something other than 
what he has on his conscience, whether it be good or evil, does not make 
his state known to the priest, but hides it; wherefore his confession is 
unavailing: and in order for it to be effective his words must agree with 
his thoughts, so that his words accuse him only of what is on his 
conscience.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> To acknowledge a fault where there is none, may be 
understood in two ways: first, as referring to the substance of the act, 
and then it is untrue; for it is a mark, not of a good, but of an 
erroneous conscience, to acknowledge having done what one has not done. 
Secondly, as referring to the circumstances of the act, and thus the 
saying of Gregory is true, because a just man fears lest, in any act 
which is good in itself, there should be any defect on his part. thus it 
is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+9:28">Job 9:28</a>): "I feared all my works." Wherefore it is also the 
mark of a good conscience that a man should accuse himself in words of 
this fear which he holds in his thoughts.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; From this may be gathered the Reply to the Second Objection, since a 
just man, who is truly humble, deems himself worse not as though he had 
committed an act generically worse, but because he fears lest in those 
things which he seems to do well, he may by pride sin more grievously.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> When a man doubts whether a certain sin be mortal, he is 
bound to confess it, so long as he remains in doubt, because he sins 
mortally by committing or omitting anything, while doubting of its being 
a mortal sin, and thus leaving the matter to chance; and, moreover, he 
courts danger, if he neglect to confess that which he doubts may be a 
mortal sin. He should not, however, affirm that it was a mortal sin, but 
speak doubtfully, leaving the verdict to the priest, whose business it is 
to discern between what is leprosy and what is not.<br>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> A man does not commit a falsehood by making satisfaction 
for a sin which he did not commit, as when anyone confesses a sin which 
he thinks he has not committed. And if he mentions a sin that he has not 
committed, believing that he has, he does not lie; wherefore he does not 
sin, provided his confession thereof tally with his conscience.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one is bound to confess at once?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one is bound to confess at once. For Hugh of 
St. Victor says (De Sacram. ii): "The contempt of confession is 
inexcusable, unless there be an urgent reason for delay." But everyone is 
bound to avoid contempt. Therefore everyone is bound to confess as soon 
as possible.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, everyone is bound to do more to avoid spiritual disease 
than to avoid bodily disease. Now if a man who is sick in body were to 
delay sending for the physician, it would be detrimental to his health. 
Therefore it seems that it must needs be detrimental to a man's health if 
he omits to confess immediately to a priest if there be one at hand.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, that which is due always, is due at once. But man owes 
confession to God always. Therefore he is bound to confess at once.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A fixed time both for confession and for receiving the 
Eucharist is determined by the Decretals (Cap. Omnis utriusque sexus: De 
Poenit. et Remiss.). Now a man does not sin by failing to receive the 
Eucharist before the fixed time. Therefore he does not sin if he does not 
confess before that time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, it is a mortal sin to omit doing what a commandment bids us to 
do. If therefore a man is bound to confess at once, and omits to do so, 
with a priest at hand, he would commit a mortal sin; and in like manner 
at any other time, and so on, so that he would fall into many mortal sins 
for the delay in confessing one, which seems unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Body Para. 1/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As the purpose of confessing is united to contrition, a 
man is bound to have this purpose when he is bound to have contrition, 
viz. when he calls his sins to mind, and chiefly when he is in danger of 
death, or when he is so circumstanced that unless his sin be forgiven, he 
must fall into another sin: for instance, if a priest be bound to say 
Mass, and a confessor is at hand, he is bound to confess or, if there be 
no confessor, he is bound at least to contrition and to have the purpose 
of confessing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Body Para. 2/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; But to actual confession a man is bound in two ways. First, 
accidentally, viz. when he is bound to do something which he cannot do 
without committing a mortal sin, unless he go to confession first: for 
then he is bound to confess; for instance, if he has to receive the 
Eucharist, to which no one can approach, after committing a mortal sin, 
without confessing first, if a priest be at hand, and there be no urgent 
necessity. Hence it is that the Church obliges all to confess once a 
year; because she commands all to receive Holy Communion once a year, 
viz. at Easter, wherefore all must go to confession before that time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Body Para. 3/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Secondly, a man is bound absolutely to go to confession; and here the 
same reason applies to delay of confession as to delay of Baptism, 
because both are necessary sacraments. Now a man is not bound to receive 
Baptism as soon as he makes up his mind to be  baptized; and so he would 
not sin mortally, if he were not baptized at once: nor is there any fixed 
time beyond which, if he defer Baptism, he would incur a mortal sin. 
Nevertheless the delay of Baptism may amount to a mortal sin, or it may 
not, and this depends on the cause of the delay, since, as the 
Philosopher says (Phys. viii, text. 15), the will does not defer doing 
what it wills to do, except for a reasonable cause. Wherefore if the 
cause of the delay of Baptism has a mortal sin connected with it, e.g. if 
a man put off being baptized through contempt, or some like motive, the 
delay will be a mortal sin, but otherwise not: and the same seems to 
apply to confession which is not more necessary than Baptism. Moreover, 
since man is bound to fulfill in this life those things that are 
necessary for salvation, therefore, if he be in danger of death, he is 
bound, even absolutely, then and there to make his confession or to 
receive Baptism. For this reason too, James proclaimed at the same time 
the commandment about making confession and that about receiving Extreme 
Unction (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+5:14,16">James 5:14,16</a>). Therefore the opinion seems probable of those 
who say that a man is not bound to confess at once, though it is 
dangerous to delay.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Body Para. 4/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others, however, say that a contrite man is bound to confess at once, as 
soon as he has a reasonable and proper opportunity. Nor does it matter 
that the Decretal fixes the time limit to an annual confession, because 
the Church does not favor delay, but forbids the neglect involved in a 
further delay. Wherefore by this Decretal the man who delays is excused, 
not from sin in the tribunal of conscience; but from punishment in the 
tribunal of the Church; so that such a person would not be deprived of 
proper burial if he were to die before that time. But this seems too 
severe, because affirmative precepts bind, not at once, but at a fixed 
time; and this, not because it is most convenient to fulfill them then 
(for in that case if a man were not to give alms of his superfluous 
goods, whenever he met with a man in need, he would commit a mortal sin, 
which is false), but because the time involves urgency. Consequently, if 
he does not confess at the very first opportunity, it does not follow 
that he commits a mortal sin, even though he does not await a better 
opportunity. unless it becomes urgent for him to confess through being in 
danger of death. Nor is it on account of the Church's indulgence that he 
is not bound to confess at once, but on account of the nature of an 
affirmative precept, so that before the commandment was made, there was 
still less obligation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] Body Para. 5/5-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Others again say that secular persons are not bound to confess before 
Lent, which is the time of penance for them; but that religious are bound 
to confess at once, because, for them, all time is a time for penance. 
But this is not to the point; for religious have no obligations besides 
those of other men, with the exception of such as they are bound to by 
vow.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Hugh is speaking of those who die without this sacrament.
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is not necessary for bodily health that the  physician 
be sent for at once, except when there is necessity for being healed: and 
the same applies to spiritual disease.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The retaining of another's property against the owner's 
will is contrary to a negative precept, which binds always and for 
always, and therefore one is always bound to make immediate restitution. 
It is not the same with the fulfillment of an affirmative precept, which 
binds always, but not for always, wherefore one is not bound to fulfill 
it at once.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether one can be dispensed from confession?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one can be dispensed from confessing his sins 
to a man. For precepts of positive law are subject to dispensation by the 
prelates of the Church. Now such is confession, as appears from what was 
said above (<A Href="XP006.html#XPQ6A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Therefore one may be dispensed from confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a man can grant a dispensation in that which was 
instituted by a man. But we read of confession being instituted, not by 
God, but by a man (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=James+5:16">James 5:16</a>): "Confess your sins, one to another." Now 
the Pope has the power of dispensation in things instituted by the 
apostles, as appears in the matter of bigamists. Therefore he can also 
dispense a man from confessing.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Penance, whereof confession is a part, is a necessary 
sacrament, even as Baptism is. Since therefore no one can be dispensed 
from Baptism, neither can one be dispensed from confession.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The ministers of the Church are appointed in the Church 
which is founded by God. Wherefore they need to be appointed by the 
Church before exercising their ministry, just as the work of creation is 
presupposed to the work of nature. And since the Church is founded on 
faith and the sacraments, the ministers of the Church have no power to 
publish new articles of faith, or to do away with those which are already 
published, or to institute new sacraments, or to abolish those that are 
instituted, for this belongs to the power of excellence, which belongs to 
Christ alone, Who is the foundation of the Church. Consequently, the Pope 
can neither dispense a man so that he may be saved without Baptism, nor 
that he be saved without confession, in so far as it is obligatory in 
virtue of the sacrament. He can, however, dispense from confession, in so 
far as it is obligatory in virtue of the commandment of the Church; so 
that a man may delay confession longer than the limit prescribed by the 
Church.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The precepts of the Divine law do not bind less than those 
of the natural law: wherefore, just as no dispensation is possible from 
the natural law, so neither can there be from positive Divine law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[6] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The precept about confession was not instituted  by a man 
first of all, though it was promulgated by James: it was instituted by 
God, and although we do not read it explicitly, yet it was somewhat 
foreshadowed in the fact that those who were being prepared by John's 
Baptism for the grace of Christ, confessed their sins to him, and that 
the Lord sent the lepers to the priests, and though they were not priests 
of the New Testament, yet the priesthood of the New Testament was 
foreshadowed in them.<br>
