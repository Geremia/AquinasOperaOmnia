    OF COMMUNICATION WITH EXCOMMUNICATED PERSONS (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider communication with those who are excommunicated. Under
    this head there are three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP023.html#XPQ23A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether it is lawful to
    communicate in matters purely corporal with one who is excommunicated?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP023.html#XPQ23A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether one who communicates with
    an excommunicated person is excommunicated?<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP023.html#XPQ23A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether it is always a mortal sin
    to communicate with an excommunicated person in matters not permitted by
    law?<br />

    Whether it is lawful, in matters purely corporal, to communicate with an
    excommunicated person?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is lawful, in matters
    purely corporal, to communicate with an excommunicated person. For
    excommunication is an act of the keys. But the power of the keys extends
    only to spiritual matters. Therefore excommunication does not prevent one
    from communicating with another in matters corporal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, "What is instituted for the sake of
    charity, does not militate against charity" (Cf.
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11OUTP1">Question [11]</a>,
    <a href="XP011.html#XPQ11A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>, Objection [1]). But we
    are bound by the precept of charity to succor our enemies, which is
    impossible without some sort of communication. Therefore it is lawful to
    communicate with an excommunicated person in corporal matters.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++5%3A11"
      >1 Cor. 5:11</a
    >): "With such an one not so much as to eat."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Excommunication is twofold: there is minor
    excommunication, which deprives a man merely of a share in the sacraments,
    but not of the communion of the faithful. Wherefore it is lawful to
    communicate with a person lying under an excommunication of this kind, but
    not to give him the sacraments. The other is major excommunication which
    deprives a man of the sacraments of the Church and of the communion of the
    faithful. Wherefore it is not lawful to communicate with one who lies under
    such an excommunication. But, since the Church resorts to excommunication to
    repair and not to destroy, exception is made from this general law, in
    certain matters wherein communication is lawful, viz. in those which concern
    salvation, for one is allowed to speak of such matters with an
    excommunicated person; and one may even speak of other matters so as to put
    him at his ease and to make the words of salvation more acceptable. Moreover
    exception is made in favor of certain people whose business it is to be in
    attendance on the excommunicated person, viz. his wife, child, slave, vassal
    or subordinate. This, however, is to be understood of children who have not
    attained their majority, else they are forbidden to communicate with their
    father: and as to the others, the exception applies to them if they have
    entered his service before his excommunication, but not if they did so
    afterwards.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some understand this exception to apply in the opposite way, viz. that the
    master can communicate with his subjects: while others hold the contrary. At
    any rate it is lawful for them to communicate with others in matters wherein
    they are under an obligation to them, for just as subjects are bound to
    serve their master, so is the master bound to look after his subjects. Again
    certain cases are excepted; as when the fact of the excommunication is
    unknown, or in the case of strangers or travelers in the country of those
    who are excommunicated, for they are allowed to buy from them, or to receive
    alms from them. Likewise if anyone were to see an excommunicated person in
    distress: for then he would be bound by the precept of charity to assist
    him. These are all contained in the following line: "Utility, law,
    lowliness, ignorance of fact, necessity," where "utility" refers to salutary
    words, "law" to marriage, "lowliness" to subjection. The others need no
    explanation.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Corporal matters are subordinate to
    spiritual matters. Wherefore the power which extends to spiritual things,
    can also extend to matters touching the body: even as the art which
    considers the end commands in matters ordained to the end.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In a case where one is bound by the
    precept of charity to hold communication, the prohibition ceases, as is
    clear from what has been said.<br />

    Whether a person incurs excommunication for communicating with one who is
    excommunicated?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a person does not incur
    excommunication for communicating with one who is excommunicated. For a
    heathen or a Jew is more separated from the Church than a person who is
    excommunicated. But one does not incur excommunication for communicating
    with a heathen or a Jew. Neither, therefore, does one for communicating with
    an excommunicated Christian.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if a man incurs excommunication for
    communicating with an excommunicated person, for the same reason a third
    would incur excommunication for communicating with him, and thus one might
    go on indefinitely, which would seem absurd. Therefore one does not incur
    excommunication for communicating with one who is excommunicated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> An excommunicated person is banished from
    communion. Therefore whoever communicates with him leaves the communion of
    the Church: and hence he seems to be excommunicated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> A person may incur excommunication in two ways.
    First, so that the excommunication includes both himself and whosoever
    communicates with him: and then, without any doubt, whoever communicates
    with him, incurs a major excommunication. Secondly, so that the
    excommunication is simply pronounced on him; and then a man may communicate
    with him either in his crime, by counsel, help or favor, in which case again
    he incurs the major excommunication, or he may communicate with him in other
    things by speaking to him, greeting him, or eating with him, in which case
    he incurs the minor excommunication.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The Church has no intention of
    correcting unbelievers as well as the faithful who are under her care: hence
    she does not sever those, whom she excommunicates, from the fellowship of
    unbelievers, as she does from the communion of the faithful over whom she
    exercises a certain power.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It is lawful to hold communion with one
    who has incurred a minor excommunication, so that excommunication does not
    pass on to a third person.<br />

    Whether it is always a mortal sin to communicate with an excommunicated
    person in other cases than those in which it is allowed?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is always a mortal sin to
    hold communion with an excommunicated person in other cases than those in
    which it is allowed. Because a certain decretal (Cap. Sacris: De his quae
    vi, metuve, etc.) declares that "not even through fear of death should
    anyone hold communion with an excommunicated person, since one ought to die
    rather than commit a mortal sin." But this would be no reason unless it were
    always a mortal sin to hold communion with an excommunicated person.
    Therefore, etc.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a mortal sin to act against a
    commandment of the Church. But the Church forbids anyone to hold communion
    with an excommunicated person. Therefore it is a mortal sin to hold
    communion with one who is excommunicated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, no man is debarred from receiving the
    Eucharist on account of a venial sin. But a man who holds communion with an
    excommunicated person, outside those cases in which it is allowed, is
    debarred from receiving the Eucharist, since he incurs a minor
    excommunication. Therefore it is a mortal sin to hold communion with an
    excommunicated person, save in those cases in which it is allowed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no one should incur a major
    excommunication save for a mortal sin. Now according to the law (Can.
    Praecipue, seqq., caus. xi) a man may incur a major excommunication for
    holding communion with an excommunicated person. Therefore it is a mortal
    sin to hold communion with one who is excommunicated.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> None can absolve a man from mortal sin unless
    he have jurisdiction over him. But any priest can absolve a man for holding
    communion with those who are excommunicated. Therefore it is not a mortal
    sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the measure of the penalty should be according to the measure of
    the sin, as stated in Dt. 25:3. Now the punishment appointed by common
    custom for holding communion with an excommunicated person is not that which
    is inflicted for mortal sin, but rather that which is due for venial sin.
    Therefore it is not a mortal sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Some hold that it is always a mortal sin to
    hold communion with an excommunicated person, by word or in any of the
    forbidden ways mentioned above (<a href="XP023.html#XPQ23A2THEP1"
      >Article [2]</a
    >), except in those cases allowed by law (Cap. Quoniam). But since it seems
    very hard that a man should be guilty of a mortal sin by uttering just a
    slight word to an excommunicated person, and that by excommunicating a
    person one would endanger the salvation of many, and lay a snare which might
    turn to one's own hurt, it seems to others more probable that he is not
    always guilty of a mortal sin, but only when he holds communion with him in
    a criminal deed, or in an act of Divine worship, or through contempt of the
    Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> This decretal is speaking of holding
    communion in Divine worship. It may also be replied that the same reason
    applies both to mortal and venial sin, since just as one cannot do well by
    committing a mortal sin, so neither can one by committing a venial sin: so
    that just as it is a man's duty to suffer death rather than commit a mortal
    sin, so is it his duty to do so sooner than commit a venial sin, inasmuch as
    it is his duty to avoid venial sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The commandment of the Church regards
    spiritual matters directly, and legitimate actions as a consequence: hence
    by holding communion in Divine worship one acts against the commandment, and
    commits a mortal sin; but by holding communion in other matters, one acts
    beside the commandment, and sins venially.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Sometimes a man is debarred from the
    Eucharist even without his own fault, as in the case of those who are
    suspended or under an interdict, because these penalties are sometimes
    inflicted on one person for the sin of another who is thus punished.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Although it is a venial sin to hold
    communion with one who is excommunicated, yet to do so obstinately is a
    mortal sin: and for this reason one may be excommunicated according to the
    law.<br />
