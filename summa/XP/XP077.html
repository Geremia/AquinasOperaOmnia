<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the time of the resurrection ought not to be 
delayed till the end of the world, so that all may rise together. For 
there is more conformity between head and members than between one member 
and another, as there is more between cause and effect than between one 
effect and another. Now Christ, Who is our Head, did not delay His 
resurrection until the end of the world, so as to rise again together 
with all men. Therefore there is no need for the resurrection of the 
early saints to be deferred until the end of the world, so that they may 
rise again together with the others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the resurrection of the Head is the cause of the 
resurrection of the members. But the resurrection of certain members that 
desire nobility from their being closely connected with the Head was not 
delayed till the end of the world, but followed immediately after 
Christ's resurrection, as is piously believed concerning the Blessed 
Virgin and John the Evangelist [*Ep. de Assump. B.V., cap. ii, among St. 
Jerome's works]. Therefore the resurrection of others will be so much 
nearer Christ's resurrection, according as they have been more conformed 
to Him by grace and merit.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the state of the New Testament is more perfect, and 
bears a closer resemblance to Christ, than the state of the Old 
Testament. Yet some of the fathers of the Old Testament rose again when 
Christ rose, according to Mt. 27:52: "Many of the bodies of the saints, 
that had slept, arose." Therefore it would seem that the resurrection of 
the Old Testament saints should not be delayed till the end of the world, 
so that all may rise together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, there will be no numbering of years after the end of the 
world. Yet after the resurrection of the dead, the years are still 
reckoned until the resurrection of others, as appears from Apoc. 20:4,5. 
For it is stated there that "I saw . . . the souls of them that were 
beheaded for the testimony of Jesus, and for the word of God," and 
further on: "And they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand years." 
And "the rest of the dead lived not till the thousand years were 
finished." Therefore the resurrection of all is not delayed until the end 
of the world, that all may rise together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+14:12">Job 14:12</a>): "Man when he is fallen 
asleep shall not rise again till the heavens be broken, he shall not 
wake, nor rise out of his sleep," and it is a question of the sleep of 
death. Therefore the resurrection of men will be delayed until the end of 
the world when the heavens shall be broken.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, it is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Heb++11:39">Heb. 11:39</a>): "All these being approved by the 
testimony of faith received not the promise," i.e. full beatitude of soul 
and body, since "God has provided something better for us, lest they 
should be consummated," i.e. perfected, "without us---in order that," as 
a gloss observes, "through all rejoicing each one might rejoice the 
more." But the resurrection will not precede the glorification of bodies, 
because "He will reform the body of our lowness made like to the body of 
His glory" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Phil++3:21">Phil. 3:21</a>), and the children of the resurrection will be "as 
the angels . . . in heaven" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++22:30">Mt. 22:30</a>). Therefore the resurrection will 
be delayed till the end of the world, when all shall rise together.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine states (De Trin. iii, 4) "Divine providence 
decreed that the grosser and lower bodies should be ruled in a certain 
order by the more subtle and powerful bodies": wherefore the entire 
matter of the lower bodies is subject to variation according to the 
movement of the heavenly bodies. Hence it would be contrary to the order 
established in things by Divine providence if the matter of lower bodies 
were brought to the state of incorruption, so long as there remains 
movement in the higher bodies. And since, according to the teaching of 
faith, the resurrection will bring men to immortal life conformably to 
Christ Who "rising again from the dead dieth now no more" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++6:9">Rm. 6:9</a>), the 
resurrection of human bodies will be delayed until the end of the world 
when the heavenly movement will cease. For this reason, too, certain 
philosophers, who held that the movement of the heavens will never cease, 
maintained that human souls will return to mortal bodies such as we have 
now---whether, as Empedocles, they stated that the soul would return to 
the same body at the end of the great year, or that it would return to 
another body; thus Pythagoras asserted that "any soul will enter any 
body," as stated in De Anima i, 3.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the head is more conformed to the members by 
conformity of proportion (which is requisite in order  that it have 
influence over the members) than one member is to another, yet the head 
has a certain causality over the members which the members have not; and 
in this the members differ from the head and agree with one another. 
Hence Christ's resurrection is an exemplar of ours, and through our faith 
therein there arises in us the hope of our own resurrection. But the 
resurrection of one of Christ's members is not the cause of the 
resurrection of other members, and consequently Christ's resurrection had 
to precede the resurrection of others who have all to rise again at the 
consummation of the world.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although among the members some rank higher than others and 
are more conformed to the Head, they do not attain to the character of 
headship so as to be the cause of others. Consequently greater conformity 
to Christ does not give them a right to rise again before others as 
though they were exemplar and the others exemplate, as we have said in 
reference to Christ's resurrection: and if it has been granted to others 
that their resurrection should not be delayed until the general 
resurrection, this has been by special privilege of grace, and not as due 
on account of conformity to Christ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Jerome, in a sermon on the Assumption [*Ep. x ad Paul. et 
Eustoch., now recognized as spurious], seems to be doubtful of this 
resurrection of the saints with Christ, namely as to whether, having been 
witnesses to the resurrection, they died again, so that theirs was a 
resuscitation (as in the case of Lazarus who died again) rather than a 
resurrection such as will be at the end of the world---or really rose 
again to immortal life, to live for ever in the body, and to ascend 
bodily into heaven with Christ, as a gloss says on Mt. 27:52. The latter 
seems more probable, because, as Jerome says, in order that they might 
bear true witness to Christ's true resurrection, it was fitting that they 
should truly rise again. Nor was their resurrection hastened for their 
sake, but for the sake of bearing witness to Christ's resurrection: and 
that by bearing witness thereto they might lay the foundation of the 
faith of the New Testament: wherefore it was more fitting that it should 
be borne by the fathers of the Old Testament, than by those who died 
after the foundation of the New. It must, however, be observed that, 
although the Gospel mentions their resurrection before Christ's, we must 
take this statement as made in anticipation, as is often the case with 
writers of history. For none rose again with a true resurrection before 
Christ, since He is the "first-fruits of them that sleep" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15:20">1 Cor. 15:20</a>), 
although some were resuscitated before Christ's resurrection, as in the 
case of Lazarus.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[1] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> On account of these words, as Augustine relates (De Civ. 
Dei xx, 7), certain heretics asserted that there will be a first 
resurrection of the dead that they may reign with Christ on earth for a 
thousand years; whence they were called "chiliasts" or "millenarians." 
Hence Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xx, 7) that these words are to be 
understood otherwise, namely of the spiritual resurrection, whereby men 
shall rise again from their sins to the  gift of grace: while the second 
resurrection is of bodies. The reign of Christ denotes the Church wherein 
not only martyrs but also the other elect reign, the part denoting the 
whole; or they reign with Christ in glory as regards all, special mention 
being made of the martyrs, because they especially reign after death who 
fought for the truth, even unto death. The number of a thousand years 
denotes not a fixed number, but the whole of the present time wherein the 
saints now reign with Christ, because the number 1,000 designates 
universality more than the number 100, since 100 is the square of 10, 
whereas 1,000 is a cube resulting from the multiplication of ten by its 
square, for 10 X 10 = 100, and 100 X 10 = 1,000. Again in Ps. 104:8, "The 
word which He commanded to a thousand," i.e. all, "generations."<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this time is not hidden. Because when we know 
exactly the beginning of a thing, we can know its end exactly, since "all 
things are measured by a certain period" (De Generat. ii). Now the 
beginning of the world is known exactly. Therefore its end can also be 
known exactly. But this will be the time of the resurrection and 
judgment. Therefore that time is not hidden.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++12:6">Apoc. 12:6</a>) that "the woman who represents 
the Church had a place prepared by God, that there she might feed [Vulg.: 
'they should feed her'] a thousand two hundred sixty days." Again (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Dan++12:11">Dan. 12:11</a>), a certain fixed number of days is mentioned, which apparently 
signify years, according to Ezech. 4:6: "A day for a year, yea a day for 
a year I have appointed to thee." Therefore the time of the end of the 
world and of the resurrection can be known exactly from Holy Writ.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the state of the New Testament was foreshadowed in the 
Old Testament. Now we know exactly the time wherein the state of the Old 
Testament endured. Therefore we can also know exactly the time wherein 
the state of the New Testament will endure. But the state of the New 
Testament will last to the end of the world, wherefore it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++28:20">Mt. 28:20</a>): "Behold I am with you . . . to the consummation of the world." 
Therefore the time of the end of the world and of the resurrection can be 
known exactly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> That which is unknown to the angels will be much more 
unknown to men: because those things to which men attain by natural 
reason are much more clearly and certainly known to the angels by their 
natural knowledge. Moreover revelations are not made to men save by means 
of the angels as Dionysius asserts (Coel. Hier. iv). Now the angels have 
no exact knowledge of that time, as appears from Mt. 24:36: "Of that day 
and hour no one knoweth, no not the angels of heaven." Therefore that 
time is hidden from men.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the apostles were more cognizant of God's secrets  than others 
who followed them, because they had "the first-fruits of the spirit" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++8:23">Rm. 8:23</a>)---" before others in point of time and more abundantly," as a gloss 
observes. And yet when they questioned our Lord about this very matter, 
He answered them (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+1:7">Acts 1:7</a>): "It is not for you to know the times or 
moments which the Father hath put in His own power." Much more, 
therefore, is it hidden from others.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> As Augustine says (Qq. lxxxiii, qu. 58) "as to the last 
age of the human race, which begins from our Lord's coming and lasts 
until the end of the world, it is uncertain of how many generations it 
will consist: even so old age, which is man's last age, has no fixed time 
according to the measure of the other ages, since sometimes alone it 
lasts as long a time as all the others." The reason of this is because 
the exact length of future time cannot be known except either by 
revelation or by natural reason: and the time until the resurrection 
cannot be reckoned by natural reason, because the resurrection and the 
end of the heavenly movement will be simultaneous as stated above (<A Href="XP077.html#XPQ77A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). 
And all things that are foreseen by natural reason to happen at a fixed 
time are reckoned by movement: and it is impossible from the movement of 
the heaven to reckon its end, for since it is circular, it is for this 
very reason able by its nature to endure for ever: and consequently the 
time between this and the resurrection cannot be reckoned by natural 
reason. Again it cannot be known by revelation, so that all may be on the 
watch and ready to meet Christ: and for this reason when the apostles 
asked Him about this, Christ answered (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Acts+1:7">Acts 1:7</a>): "It is not for you to 
know the times or moments which the Father hath put in His own power," 
whereby, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 53): "He scatters the 
fingers of all calculators and bids them be still." For what He refused 
to tell the apostles, He will not reveal to others: wherefore all those 
who have been misled to reckon the aforesaid time have so far proved to 
be untruthful; for some, as Augustine says (De Civ. Dei xviii, 53), 
stated that from our Lord's Ascension to His last coming 400 years would 
elapse, others 500, others 1,000. The falseness of these calculators is 
evident, as will likewise be the falseness of those who even now cease 
not to calculate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When we know a thing's beginning and also its end it 
follows that its measure is known to us: wherefore if we know the 
beginning of a thing the duration of which is measured by the movement of 
the heaven, we are able to know its end, since the movement of heaven is 
known to us. But the measure of the duration of the heavenly movement is 
God's ordinance alone, which is unknown to us. Wherefore however much we 
may know its beginning, we are unable to know its end.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The thousand two hundred sixty days mentioned in the 
Apocalypse (12:6) denote all the time during which the Church endures, 
and not any definite number of years. The reason whereof is because the 
preaching of Christ on which the Church is built lasted three years and a 
half, which time contains almost an equal number of days as the aforesaid 
number. Again the number of days  appointed by Daniel does not refer to a 
number of years to elapse before the end of the world or until the 
preaching of Antichrist, but to the time of Antichrist's preaching and 
the duration of his persecution.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[2] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the state of the New Testament in general is 
foreshadowed by the state of the Old Testament it does not follow that 
individuals correspond to individuals: especially since all the figures 
of the Old Testament were fulfilled in Christ. Hence Augustine (De Civ. 
Dei xviii, 52) answers certain persons who wished to liken the number of 
persecutions suffered by the Church to the number of the plagues of 
Egypt, in these words: "I do not think that the occurrences in Egypt were 
in their signification prophetic of these persecutions, although those 
who think so have shown nicety and ingenuity in adapting them severally 
the one to the other, not indeed by a prophetic spirit, but by the 
guess-work of the human mind, which sometimes reaches the truth and 
sometimes not." The same remarks would seem applicable to the statements 
of Abbot Joachim, who by means of such conjectures about the future 
foretold some things that were true, and in others was deceived.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the resurrection will not be at night-time. 
For the resurrection will not be "till the heavens be broken" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Job+14:12">Job 14:12</a>). Now when the heavenly movement ceases, which is signified by its 
breaking, there will be no time, neither night nor day. Therefore the 
resurrection will not be at night-time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the end of a thing ought to be most perfect. Now the end 
of time will be then: wherefore it is said (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++10:6">Apoc. 10:6</a>) that "time shall 
be no longer." Therefore time ought to be then in its most perfect 
disposition and consequently it should be the daytime.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the time should be such as to be adapted to what is done 
therein: wherefore (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Jn++13:30">Jn. 13:30</a>) the night is mentioned as being the time 
when Judas went out from the fellowship of the light. Now, all things 
that are hidden at the present time will then be made most manifest, 
because when the Lord shall come He "will bring to light the hidden 
things of darkness, and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts" (1 
Cor. 4:5). Therefore it ought to be during the day.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Christ's resurrection is the exemplar of ours. Now 
Christ's resurrection was at night, as Gregory says in a homily for 
Easter (xxi in Evang.). Therefore our resurrection will also be at 
night-time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, the coming of our Lord is compared to the coming of a thief 
into the house (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Lk++12:39,40">Lk. 12:39,40</a>). But the thief comes to the house at 
night-time. Therefore our Lord will also come in the  night. Now, when He 
comes the resurrection will take place, as stated above (<A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). 
Therefore the resurrection will be at night-time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The exact time and hour at which the resurrection will be 
cannot be known for certain, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 43). 
Nevertheless some assert with sufficient probability that it will be 
towards the twilight, the moon being in the east and the sun in the west; 
because the sun and moon are believed to have been created in these 
positions, and thus their revolutions will be altogether completed by 
their return to the same point. Wherefore it is said that Christ arose at 
such an hour.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> When the resurrection occurs, it will not be time but the 
end of time; because at the very instant that the heavens will cease to 
move the dead will rise again. Nevertheless the stars will be in the same 
position as they occupy now at any fixed hour: and accordingly it is said 
that the resurrection will be at this or that hour.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The most perfect disposition of time is said to be midday, 
on account of the light given by the sun. But then the city of God will 
need neither sun nor moon, because the glory of God will enlighten it 
(<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rev+++22:5">Apoc. 22:5</a>). Wherefore in this respect it matters not whether the 
resurrection be in the day or in the night.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> That time should be adapted to manifestation as regards the 
things that will happen then, and to secrecy as regards the fixing of the 
time. Hence either may happen fittingly, namely that the resurrection be 
in the day or in the night.<br>

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the resurrection will not happen suddenly but 
by degrees. For the resurrection of the dead is foretold (Ezech. 37:7,8) 
where it is written: "The bones came together . . . and I saw and behold 
the sinews and the flesh came up upon them, and the skin was stretched 
out over them, but there was no spirit in them." Therefore the 
restoration of the bodies will precede in time their reunion with the 
souls, and thus the resurrection will not be sudden.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a thing does not happen suddenly if it require several 
actions following one another. Now the resurrection requires several 
actions following one another, namely the gathering of the ashes, the 
refashioning of the body, the infusion of the soul. Therefore the 
resurrection will not be sudden.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, all sound is measured by time. Now the sound of the 
trumpet will be the cause of the resurrection, as stated above (<A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). Therefore the resurrection will take time and will not happen 
suddenly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, no local movement can be sudden as stated in De Sensu et 
Sensato vii. Now the resurrection requires local movement in the 
gathering of the ashes. Therefore it will not happen suddenly.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++15:51,52">1 Cor. 15:51,52</a>): "We shall all indeed 
rise again . . . in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye." Therefore the 
resurrection will be sudden.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, infinite power works suddenly. But the Damascene says (De Fide 
Orth. iv): "Thou shalt believe in the resurrection to be wrought by the 
power of God," and it is evident that this is infinite. Therefore the 
resurrection will be sudden.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> At the resurrection something will be done by the 
ministry of the angels, and something immediately by the power of God, as 
stated above (<A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76OUTP1">Question [76]</a>, <A Href="XP076.html#XPQ76A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>). Accordingly that which is done by the 
ministry of the angels, will not be instantaneous, if by instant we mean 
an indivisible point of time, but it will be instantaneous if by instant 
we mean an imperceptible time. But that which will be done immediately by 
God's power will happen suddenly, namely at the end of the time wherein 
the work of the angels will be done, because the higher power brings the 
lower to perfection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Ezechiel spoke, like Moses to a rough people, and 
therefore, just as Moses divided the works of the six days into days, in 
order that the uncultured people might be able to understand, although 
all things were made together according to Augustine (Gen. ad lit. iv), 
so Ezechiel expressed the various things that will happen in the 
resurrection, although they will all happen together in an instant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although these actions follow one another in nature, they 
are all together in time: because either they are together in the same 
instant, or one is in the instant that terminates the other.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> The same would seem to apply to that sound as to the forms of the 
sacraments, namely that the sound will produce its effect in its last 
instant.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[77] A[4] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> The gathering of the ashes which cannot be without local 
movement will be done by the ministry of the angels. Hence it will be in 
time though imperceptible on account of the facility of operation which 
is competent to the angels.<br>
