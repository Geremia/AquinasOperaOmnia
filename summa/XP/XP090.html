    OF THE FORM OF THE JUDGE IN COMING TO THE JUDGMENT (THREE ARTICLES)<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the form of the Judge in coming to the judgment. Under
    this head there are three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP090.html#XPQ90A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether Christ will judge under
    the form or His humanity?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP090.html#XPQ90A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether He will appear under the
    form of His glorified humanity?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP090.html#XPQ90A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether His Godhead can be seen
    without joy?

    Whether Christ will judge under the form of His humanity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that Christ will not judge under
    the form of His humanity. For judgment requires authority in the judge. Now
    Christ has authority over the quick and the dead as God, for thus is He the
    Lord and Creator of all. Therefore He will judge under the form of His
    Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, invincible power is requisite in a
    judge; wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++7%3A6"
      >Eccles. 7:6</a
    >): "Seek not to be made a judge, unless thou have strength enough to
    extirpate iniquities." Now invincible power belongs to Christ as God.
    Therefore He will judge under the form of the Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A22,23"
      >Jn. 5:22,23</a
    >): "The Father... hath given all judgment to the Son, that all men may
    honor the Son as they honor the Father." Now equal honor to that of the
    Father is not due to the Son in respect of His human nature. Therefore He
    will not judge under His human form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A9"
      >Dan. 7:9</a
    >): "I beheld till thrones were placed and the Ancient of days sat." Now the
    thrones signify judicial power, and God is called the Ancient by reason of
    His eternity, according to Dionysius (Div. Nom. x). Therefore it becomes the
    Son to judge as being eternal; and consequently not as man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Augustine says (Tract. xix in Joan.)
    that "the resurrection of the soul is the work of the Word the Son of God,
    and the resurrection of the body is the work of the Word made the Son of man
    in the flesh." Now that last judgment regards the soul rather than the body.
    Therefore it becomes Christ to judge as God rather than as man.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++5%3A27"
      >Jn. 5:27</a
    >): "He hath given Him power to do judgment, because He is the Son of
    man."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Job+36%3A17"
      >Job 36:17</a
    >): "Thy cause hath been judged as that of the wicked---by Pilate" according
    to a gloss---therefore, "cause and judgment thou shalt recover---that thou
    mayest judge justly," according to the gloss. Now Christ was judged by
    Pilate with regard to His human nature. Therefore He will judge under the
    human nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, to Him it belongs to judge who made the law. Now Christ gave us the
    law of the Gospel while appearing in the human nature. Therefore He will
    judge under that same nature.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Judgment requires a certain authority in the
    judge. Wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A4"
      >Rm. 14:4</a
    >): "Who art thou that judgest another man's servant?" Hence it is becoming
    that Christ should judge in respect of His having authority over men to whom
    chiefly the last judgment will be directed. Now He is our Lord, not only by
    reason of the Creation, since "the Lord He is God, He made us and not we
    ourselves" (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Ps++99%3A3"
      >Ps. 99:3</a
    >), but also by reason of the Redemption, which pertains to Him in respect
    of His human nature. Wherefore "to this end Christ died and rose again, that
    He might be Lord both of the dead and of the living" (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rm++14%3A9"
      >Rm. 14:9</a
    >). But the goods of the Creation would not suffice us to obtain the reward
    of eternal life, without the addition of the boon of the Redemption, on
    account of the obstacle accruing to created nature through the sin of our
    first parent. Hence, since the last judgment is directed to the admission of
    some to the kingdom, and the exclusion of others therefrom, it is becoming
    that Christ should preside at that judgment under the form of His human
    nature, since it is by favor of that same nature's Redemption that man is
    admitted to the kingdom. In this sense it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Acts+10%3A42"
      >Acts 10:42</a
    >) that "He... was appointed by God to be Judge of the living and of the
    dead." And forasmuch as by redeeming mankind He restored not only man but
    all creatures without exception---inasmuch as all creatures are bettered
    through man's restoration, according to Col. 1:20, "Making peace through the
    blood of His cross, both as to things on earth, and the things that are in
    heaven"---it follows that through His Passion Christ merited lordship and
    judicial power not over man alone, but over all creatures, according to Mt.
    28:18, "All power is given to Me, in heaven and in earth" [*Cf. TP, Question
    [59]].<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Christ, in respect of His Divine nature,
    has authority of lordship over all creatures by right of creation; but in
    respect of His human nature He has authority of lordship merited through His
    Passion. The latter is secondary so to speak and acquired, while the former
    is natural and eternal.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although Christ as man has not of
    Himself invincible power resulting from the natural power of the human
    species, nevertheless there is also in His human nature an invincible power
    derived from His Godhead, whereby all things are subjected under His feet
    (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Cor++15%3A25-28;+Heb++2:8,9"
      >1 Cor. 15:25-28; Heb. 2:8,9</a
    >). Hence He will judge in His human nature indeed, but by the power of His
    Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Christ would not have sufficed for the
    redemption of mankind, had He been a mere man. Wherefore from the very fact
    that He was able as man to redeem mankind, and thereby obtained judicial
    power, it is evident that He is God, and consequently is to be honored
    equally with the Father, not as man but as God.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> In that vision of Daniel the whole order
    of the judicial power is clearly expressed. This power is in God Himself as
    its first origin, and more especially in the Father Who is the fount of the
    entire Godhead; wherefore it is stated in the first place that the "Ancient
    of days sat." But the judicial power was transmitted from the Father to the
    Son, not only from eternity in respect of the Divine nature, but also in
    time in respect of the human nature wherein He merited it. Hence in the
    aforesaid vision it is further stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dan++7%3A13,14"
      >Dan. 7:13,14</a
    >): "Lo, one like the Son of man came with the clouds of heaven, and He came
    even to the Ancient of days... And He gave Him power and glory, and a
    kingdom."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Augustine is speaking by a kind of
    appropriation, so as to trace the effects which Christ wrought in the human
    nature to causes somewhat similar to them. And since we are made to the
    image and likeness of God in respect of our soul, and are of the same
    species as the man Christ in respect of our body, he ascribes to the Godhead
    the effects wrought by Christ in our souls, and those which He wrought or
    will work in our bodies he ascribes to His flesh; although His flesh, as
    being the instrument of His Godhead, has also its effect on our souls as
    Damascene asserts (De Fide Orth. iii, 15), according to the saying of Heb.
    9:14, that His "blood" hath cleansed "our conscience from dead works." And
    thus that "the Word was made flesh" is the cause of the resurrection of
    souls; wherefore also according to His human nature He is becomingly the
    Judge not only of bodily but also of spiritual goods [*Cf. TP, Question
    [56], Article [2], ad 1].<br />

    Whether at the judgment Christ will appear in His glorified humanity?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that at the judgment Christ will
    not appear in His glorified humanity. For a gloss [*St. Augustine, Tract.
    cxx in Joan.] on Jn. 19:37, "They shall look on him whom they pierced,"
    says: "Because He will come in the flesh wherein He was crucified." Now He
    was crucified in the form of weakness. Therefore He will appear in the form
    of weakness and not in the form of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Mt++24%3A30"
      >Mt. 24:30</a
    >) that "the sign of the Son of man shall appear in heaven," namely, "the
    sign of the cross," as Chrysostom says (Hom. lxxvii in Matth.), for "Christ
    when coming to the judgment will show not only the scars of His wounds but
    even His most shameful death." Therefore it seems that He will not appear in
    the form of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Christ will appear at the judgment under
    that form which can be gazed upon by all. Now Christ will not be visible to
    all, good and wicked, under the form of His glorified humanity: because the
    eye that is not glorified is seemingly unproportionate to see the clarity of
    a glorified body. Therefore He will not appear under a glorified form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, that which is promised as a reward to
    the righteous is not granted to the unrighteous. Now it is promised as a
    reward to the righteous that they shall see the glory of His humanity (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++10%3A9"
      >Jn. 10:9</a
    >): "He shall go in, and go out, and shall find pastures, i.e. refreshment
    in His Godhead and humanity," according to the commentary of Augustine [*De
    Spiritu et Anima, work of an unknown author. St. Thomas, De Anima, ascribes
    it to Alcherus, a Cistercian monk; see above Question [70], Article [2], ad
    1] and Is. 33:17: "His eyes shall see the King in his beauty." Therefore He
    will not appear to all in His glorified form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, Christ will judge in the form wherein He
    was judged: wherefore a gloss [*St. Augustine, Tract. xix, in Joan.] on Jn.
    5:21, "So the Son also giveth life to whom He will," says: "He will judge
    justly in the form wherein He was judged unjustly, that He may be visible to
    the wicked." Now He was judged in the form of weakness. Therefore He will
    appear in the same form at the judgment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++21%3A27"
      >Lk. 21:27</a
    >): "Then they shall see the Son of man coming in a cloud with great power
    and majesty." Now majesty and power pertain to glory. Therefore He will
    appear in the form of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, he who judges should be more conspicuous than those who are judged.
    Now the elect who will be judged by Christ will have a glorified body. Much
    more therefore will the Judge appear in a glorified form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, as to be judged pertains to weakness, so to judge pertains to
    authority and glory. Now at His first coming when Christ came to be judged,
    He appeared in the form of weakness. Therefore at the second coming, when He
    will come to judge, He will appear in the form of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Christ is called the mediator of God and men
    (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=1+Tim++2%3A5">1 Tim. 2:5</a
    >) inasmuch as He satisfies for men and intercedes for them to the Father,
    and confers on men things which belong to the Father, according to Jn.
    17:22, "The glory which Thou hast given Me, I have given to them."
    Accordingly then both these things belong to Him in that He communicates
    with both extremes: for in that He communicates with men, He takes their
    part with the Father, and in that He communicates with the Father, He
    bestows the Father's gifts on men. Since then at His first coming He came in
    order to make satisfaction for us to the Father, He came in the form of our
    weakness. But since at His second coming He will come in order to execute
    the Father's justice on men, He will have to show forth His glory which is
    in Him by reason of His communication with the Father: and therefore He will
    appear in the form of glory.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> He will appear in the same flesh, but
    not under the same form.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The sign of the cross will appear at the
    judgment, to denote not a present but a past weakness: so as to show how
    justly those were condemned who scorned so great mercy, especially those who
    persecuted Christ unjustly. The scars which will appear in His body will not
    be due to weakness, but will indicate the exceeding power whereby Christ
    overcame His enemies by His Passion and infirmity. He will also show forth
    His most shameful death, not by bringing it sensibly before the eye, as
    though He suffered it there; but by the things which will appear then,
    namely the signs of His past Passion, He will recall men to the thought of
    His past death.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> A glorified body has it in its power to
    show itself or not to show itself to an eye that is not glorified, as stated
    above (<a href="XP085.html#XPQ85OUTP1">Question [85]</a>,
    <a href="XP085.html#XPQ85A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 3). Hence Christ will
    be visible to all in His glorified form.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Even as our friend's glory gives us
    pleasure, so the glory and power of one we hate is most displeasing to us.
    Hence as the sight of the glory of Christ's humanity will be a reward to the
    righteous, so will it be a torment to Christ's enemies: wherefore it is
    written (<a href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Is++26%3A11"
      >Is. 26:11</a
    >): "Let the envious people see and be confounded and let fire" (i.e. envy)
    "devour Thy enemies."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> Form is taken there for human nature
    wherein He was judged and likewise will judge; but not for a quality of
    nature, namely of weakness, which will not be the same in Him when judging
    as when judged (Cf. ad 2).<br />

    Whether the Godhead can be seen by the wicked without joy?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the Godhead can be seen by the
    wicked without joy. For there can be no doubt that the wicked will know with
    the greatest certainty that Christ is God. Therefore they will see His
    Godhead, and yet they will not rejoice in seeing Christ. Therefore it will
    be possible to see it without joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the perverse will of the wicked is not
    more adverse to Christ's humanity than to His Godhead. Now the fact that
    they will see the glory of His humanity will conduce to their punishment, as
    stated above (<a href="XP090.html#XPQ90A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 4).
    Therefore if they were to see His Godhead, there would be much more reason
    for them to grieve rather than rejoice.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the course of the affections is not a
    necessary sequel to that which is in the intellect: wherefore Augustine says
    (In Ps. 118: conc. 8): "The intellect precedes, the affections follow slowly
    or not at all." Now vision regards the intellect, whereas joy regards the
    affections. Therefore it will be possible to see the Godhead without joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, whatever is received into "a thing is
    received according to the mode of the receiver and not of the received." But
    whatever is seen is, in a way, received into the seer. Therefore although
    the Godhead is in itself supremely enjoyable, nevertheless when seen by
    those who are plunged in grief, it will give no joy but rather
    displeasure.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, as sense is to the sensible object, so
    is the intellect to the intelligible object. Now in the senses, "to the
    unhealthy palate bread is painful, to the healthy palate sweet," as
    Augustine says (Confess. vii), and the same happens with the other senses.
    Therefore since the damned have the intellect indisposed, it would seem that
    the vision of the uncreated light will give them pain rather than joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Jn++17%3A3"
      >Jn. 17:3</a
    >): "This is eternal life: That they may know Thee, the... true God."
    Wherefore it is clear that the essence of bliss consists in seeing God. Now
    joy is essential to bliss. Therefore the Godhead cannot be seen without
    joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the essence of the Godhead is the essence of truth. Now it is
    delightful to every one to see the truth, wherefore "all naturally desire to
    know," as stated at the beginning of the Metaphysics. Therefore it is
    impossible to see the Godhead without joy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, if a certain vision is not always delightful, it happens sometimes
    to be painful. But intellective vision is never painful since "the pleasure
    we take in objects of understanding has no grief opposed to it," according
    to the Philosopher (Topic. ii). Since then the Godhead cannot be seen save
    by the intellect, it seems that the Godhead cannot be seen without joy.<br />

    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In every object of appetite or of pleasure two
    things may be considered, namely the thing which is desired or which gives
    pleasure, and the aspect of appetibility or pleasurableness in that thing.
    Now according to Boethius (De Hebdom.) that which is can have something
    besides what it is, but 'being' itself has no admixture of aught else beside
    itself. Hence that which is desirable or pleasant can have an admixture of
    something rendering it undesirable or unpleasant; but the very aspect of
    pleasurableness has not and cannot have anything mixed with it rendering it
    unpleasant or undesirable. Now it is possible for things that are
    pleasurable, by participation of goodness which is the aspect of
    appetibility or pleasurableness, not to give pleasure when they are
    apprehended, but it is impossible for that which is good by its essence not
    to give pleasure when it is apprehended. Therefore since God is essentially
    His own goodness, it is impossible for the Godhead to be seen without
    joy.<br />

    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The wicked will know most clearly that
    Christ is God, not through seeing His Godhead, but on account of the most
    manifest signs of His Godhead.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No one can hate the Godhead considered
    in itself, as neither can one hate goodness itself. But God is said to be
    hated by certain persons in respect of some of the effects of the Godhead,
    in so far as He does or commands something contrary to their will [*Cf. SS,
    Question [34], Article [1]]. Therefore the vision of the Godhead can be
    painful to no one.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The saying of Augustine applies when the
    thing apprehended previously by the intellect is good by participation and
    not essentially, such as all creatures are; wherefore there may be something
    in them by reason of which the affections are not moved. In like manner God
    is known by wayfarers through His effects, and their intellect does not
    attain to the very essence of His goodness. Hence it is not necessary that
    the affections follow the intellect, as they would if the intellect saw
    God's essence which is His goodness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> Grief denotes not a disposition but a
    passion. Now every passion is removed if a stronger contrary cause
    supervene, and does not remove that cause. Accordingly the grief of the
    damned would be done away if they saw God in His essence.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> The indisposition of an organ removes
    the natural proportion of the organ to the object that has a natural
    aptitude to please, wherefore the pleasure is hindered. But the
    indisposition which is in the damned does not remove the natural proportion
    whereby they are directed to the Divine goodness, since its image ever
    remains in them. Hence the comparison fails.<br />
