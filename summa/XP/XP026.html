</h3>
<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; We must now consider those who can grant indulgences: under which head 
there are four points of inquiry:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP026.html#XPQ26A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether every parish priest can grant indulgences? 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP026.html#XPQ26A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether a deacon or another, who is not a priest, can grant 
indulgences?<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP026.html#XPQ26A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether a bishop can grant them?
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A Href="XP026.html#XPQ26A4THEP1">(4)</a> Whether they can be granted by one who is in mortal sin?

<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that every parish priest can grant indulgences. For 
an indulgence derives its efficacy from the superabundance of the 
Church's merits. Now there is no congregation without some superabundance 
of merits. Therefore every priest, who has charge of a congregation, can 
grant indulgences, and, in like manner, so can every prelate.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, every prelate stands for a multitude, just as an 
individual stands for himself. But any individual can assign his own 
goods to another and thus offer satisfaction for a third person. 
Therefore a prelate can assign the property of the multitude subject to 
him, and so it seems that he can grant indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[1] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> To excommunicate is less than to grant indulgences. But 
a parish priest cannot do the former. Therefore he cannot do the latter.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[1] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Indulgences are effective, in as much as the works of 
satisfaction done by one person are applied to another, not only by 
virtue of charity, but also by the intention of the person who did them 
being directed in some way to the person to whom they are applied. Now a 
person's intention may be directed to another in three ways, 
specifically, generically and individually. Individually, as when one 
person offers satisfaction for another particular person; and thus anyone 
can apply his works to another. Specifically, as when a person prays for 
the congregation to which he belongs, for the members of his household, 
or for his benefactors, and directs his works of satisfaction to the same 
intention: in this way the superior of a congregation can apply those 
works to some other person, by applying the intention of those who belong 
to his congregation to some fixed individual. Generically, as when a 
person directs his works for the good of the Church in general; and thus 
he who presides over the whole Church can communicate those works, by 
applying his intention to this or that individual. And since a man is a 
member of a congregation, and a congregation is a part of the Church, 
hence the intention of private good includes the intention of the good of 
the congregation, and of the good of the whole Church. Therefore he who 
presides over the Church can communicate what belongs to an individual 
congregation or to an individual man: and he who presides over a 
congregation can communicate what belongs to an individual man, but not 
conversely. Yet neither the first nor the second communication is called 
an indulgence, but only the third; and this for two reasons. First, 
because, although those communications loose man from the debt of 
punishment in the sight  of God, yet he is not freed from the obligation 
of fulfilling the satisfaction enjoined, to which he is bound by a 
commandment of the Church; whereas the third communication frees man even 
from this obligation. Secondly, because in one person or even in one 
congregation there is not such an unfailing supply of merits as to be 
sufficient both for the one person or congregation and for all others; 
and consequently the individual is not freed from the entire debt of 
punishment unless satisfaction is offered for him individually, to the 
very amount that he owes. On the other hand, in the whole Church there is 
an unfailing supply of merits, chiefly on account of the merit of Christ. 
Consequently he alone who is at the head of the Church can grant 
indulgences. Since, however, the Church is the congregation of the 
faithful, and since a congregation of men is of two kinds, the domestic, 
composed of members of the same family, and the civil, composed of 
members of the same nationality, the Church is like to a civil 
congregation, for the people themselves are called the Church; while the 
various assemblies, or parishes of one diocese are likened to a 
congregation in the various families and services. Hence a bishop alone 
is properly called a prelate of the Church, wherefore he alone, like a 
bridegroom, receives the ring of the Church. Consequently full power in 
the dispensation of the sacraments, and jurisdiction in the public 
tribunal, belong to him alone as the public person, but to others by 
delegation from him. Those priests who have charge of the people are not 
prelates strictly speaking, but assistants, hence, in consecrating 
priests the bishop says: "The more fragile we are, the more we need these 
assistants": and for this reason they do not dispense all the sacraments. 
Hence parish priests, or abbots or other like prelates cannot grant 
indulgences.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a deacon, or one that is not a priest cannot 
grant an indulgence. Because remission of sins is an effect of the keys. 
Now none but a priest has the keys. Therefore a priest alone can grant 
indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, a fuller remission of punishment is granted by 
indulgences than by the tribunal of Penance. But a priest alone has power 
in the latter, and, therefore, he alone has power in the former.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> The distribution of the Church's treasury is entrusted 
to the same person as the government of the Church. Now this is entrusted 
sometimes to one who is not a priest. Therefore he can grant indulgences, 
since they derive their efficacy from the distribution of the Church's 
treasury.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The power of granting indulgences follows  jurisdiction, 
as stated above (<A Href="XP025.html#XPQ25OUTP1">Question [25]</a>, <A Href="XP025.html#XPQ25A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>). And since deacons and others, who are not 
priests, can have jurisdiction either delegated, as legates, or ordinary, 
as bishops-elect, it follows that even those who are not priests can 
grant indulgences, although they cannot absolve in the tribunal of 
Penance, since this follows the reception of orders. This suffices for 
the Replies to the Objections, because the granting of indulgences 
belongs to the key of jurisdiction and not to the key of orders.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that even a bishop cannot grant indulgences. 
Because the treasury of the Church is the common property of the whole 
Church. Now the common property of the whole Church cannot be distributed 
save by him who presides over the whole Church. Therefore the Pope alone 
can grant indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, none can remit punishments fixed by law, save the one 
who has the power to make the law. Now punishments in satisfaction for 
sins are fixed by law. Therefore the Pope alone can remit these 
punishments, since he is the maker of the law.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[3] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> stands the custom of the Church in accordance with 
which bishops grant indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[3] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The Pope has the plenitude of pontifical power, being 
like a king in his kingdom: whereas the bishops are appointed to a share 
in his solicitude, like judges over each city. Hence them alone the Pope, 
in his letters, addresses as "brethren," whereas he calls all others his 
"sons." Therefore the plenitude of the power of granting indulgences 
resides in the Pope, because he can grant them, as he lists, provided the 
cause be a lawful one: while, in bishops, this power resides subject to 
the Pope's ordination, so that they can grant them within fixed limits 
and not beyond.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether indulgences can be granted by one who is in mortal sin?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that indulgences cannot be granted by one who is in 
mortal sin. For a stream can no longer flow if cut off from its source. 
Now the source of grace which is the Holy Ghost is cut off from one who 
is in mortal sin. Therefore such a one can convey nothing to others by 
granting indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is a greater thing to grant an indulgence than to 
receive one. But one who is in mortal sin cannot receive an indulgence, 
as we shall show presently (<A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27OUTP1">Question [27]</a>, <A Href="XP027.html#XPQ27A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Neither, therefore, can he 
grant one.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Indulgences are granted in virtue of the  power 
conferred on the prelates of the Church. Now mortal sin takes away, not 
power but goodness. Therefore one who is in mortal sin can grant 
indulgences.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> The granting of indulgences belongs to jurisdiction. But 
a man does not, through sin, lose jurisdiction. Consequently indulgences 
are equally valid, whether they be granted by one who is in mortal sin, 
or by a most holy person; since he remits punishment, not by virtue of 
his own merits, but by virtue of the merits laid up in the Church's 
treasury.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The prelate who, while in a state of mortal sin, grants an 
indulgence, does not pour forth anything of his own, and so it is not 
necessary that he should receive an inflow from the source, in order that 
he may grant a valid indulgence.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[26] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Further, to grant an indulgence is more than to receive 
one, if we consider the power, but it is less, if we consider the 
personal profit.<br>
