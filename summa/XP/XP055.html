<H3 Align="Left">Whether a person contracts affinity through the marriage of a blood-relation?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a person does not contract affinity through 
the marriage of a blood-relation. For "the cause of a thing being so is 
yet more so." Now the wife is not connected with her husband's kindred 
except by reason of the husband. Since then she does not contract 
affinity with her husband, neither does she contract it with her 
husband's kindred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, if certain things be separate from one another and 
something be connected with one of them, it does not follow that it is 
connected with the other. Now a person's blood relations are separate 
from one another. Therefore it does not follow, if a certain woman be 
married to a certain man, that she is therefore connected with all his 
kindred.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, relations result from certain things being united 
together. Now the kindred of the husband do not become united together by 
the fact of his taking a wife. Therefore they do not acquire any 
relationship of affinity. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Husband and wife are made one flesh. Therefore if the 
husband is related in the flesh to all his kindred, for the same reason 
his wife will be related to them all.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, this is proved by the authorities quoted in the text (Sent. iv, 
D, 41).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A certain natural friendship is founded on natural 
fellowship. Now natural fellowship, according to the Philosopher (Ethic. 
viii, 12), arises in two ways; first, from carnal procreation; secondly, 
from connection with orderly carnal procreation, wherefore he says 
(Ethic. viii, 12) that the friendship of a husband towards his wife is 
natural. Consequently even as a person through being connected with 
another by carnal procreation is bound to him by a tie of natural 
friendship, so does one person become connected with another through 
carnal intercourse. But there is a difference in this, that one who is 
connected with another through carnal procreation, as a son with his 
father, shares in the same common stock and blood, so that a son is 
connected with his father's kindred by the same kind of tie as the father 
was, the tie, namely of consanguinity, albeit in a different degree on 
account of his being more distant from the stock: whereas one who is 
connected with another through carnal intercourse does not share in the 
same stock, but is as it were an extraneous addition thereto: whence 
arises another kind of tie known by the name of "affinity." This is 
expressed in the verse:<br>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Marriage makes a new kind of connection,
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; While birth makes a new degree,
because, to wit, the person begotten is in the same kind of relationship, 
but in a different degree, whereas through carnal intercourse he enters 
into a new kind of relationship.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although a cause is more potent than its effect, it does 
not always follow that the same name is applicable to the cause as to the 
effect, because sometimes that which is in the effect, is found in the 
cause not in the same but in a higher way; wherefore it is not applicable 
to both cause and effect under the same name or under the same aspect, as 
is the case with all equivocal effective causes. Thus, then, the union of 
husband and wife is stronger than the union of the wife with her 
husband's kindred, and yet it ought not to be named affinity, but 
matrimony which is a kind of unity; even as a man is identical with 
himself, but not with his kinsman.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Blood-relations are in a way separate, and in a way 
connected: and it happens in respect of their connection that a person 
who is connected with one of them is in some way connected with all of 
them. But on account of their separation and distance from one another it 
happens that a person who is connected with one of them in one way is 
connected with another in another way, either as to the kind of 
connection or as to the degree. 
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[1] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Further, a relation results sometimes from a movement in 
each extreme, for instance fatherhood and sonship, and a relation of this 
kind is really in both extremes. Sometimes it results from the movement 
of one only, and this happens in two ways. In one way when a relation 
results from the movement of one extreme without any movement previous or 
concomitant of the other extreme; as in the Creator and the creature, the 
sensible and the sense, knowledge and the knowable object: and then the 
relation is in one extreme really and in the other logically only. In 
another way when the relation results from the movement of one extreme 
without any concomitant movement, but not without a previous movement of 
the other; thus there results equality between two men by the increase of 
one, without the other either increasing or decreasing then, although 
previously he reached his actual quantity by some movement or change, so 
that this relation is founded really in both extremes. It is the same 
with consanguinity and affinity, because the relation of brotherhood 
which results in a grown child on the birth of a boy, is caused without 
any movement of the former's at the time, but by virtue of that previous 
movement of his wherein he was begotten; wherefore at the time it happens 
that there results in him the aforesaid relation through the movement of 
another. Likewise because this man descends through his own birth from 
the same stock as the husband, there results in him affinity with the 
latter's wife, without any new change in him.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether affinity remains after the death of husband or wife?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that affinity does not remain after the death of 
husband or wife, between the blood-relations of husband and wife or "vice 
versa." Because if the cause cease the effect ceases. Now the cause of 
affinity was the marriage, which ceases after the husband's death, since 
then "the woman . . . is loosed from the law of the husband" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Rm++7%3A2">Rm. 7:2</a>). 
Therefore the aforesaid affinity ceases also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, consanguinity is the cause of affinity. Now the 
consanguinity of the husband with his blood-relations ceases at his 
death. Therefore, the wife's affinity with them ceases also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Affinity is caused by consanguinity. Now consanguinity 
binds persons together for all time as long as they live. Therefore 
affinity does so also: and consequently affinity (between two persons) is 
not dissolved through the dissolution of the marriage by the death of a 
third person.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A relation ceases in two ways: in one way through the 
corruption of its subject, in another way by the removal of its cause; 
thus likeness ceases when one of the like subjects dies, or when the 
quality that caused the likeness is removed. Now there are certain 
relations which have for their cause an action, or a passion or movement 
(Metaph. v, 20): and some of these are caused by movement, through 
something being moved  actually; such is the relation between mover and 
moved: some of them are caused through something being adapted to 
movement, for instance the relations between the motive power and the 
movable, or between master and servant; and some of them result from 
something, having been moved previously, such as the relation between 
father and son, for the relation between them is caused not by (the con) 
being begotten now, but by his having been begotten. Now aptitude for 
movement and for being moved is transitory; whereas the fact of having 
been moved is everlasting, since what has been never ceases having been. 
Consequently fatherhood and sonship are never dissolved through the 
removal of the cause, but only through the corruption of the subject, 
that is of one of the subjects. The same applies to affinity, for this is 
caused by certain persons having been joined together not by their being 
actually joined. Wherefore it is not done away, as long as the persons 
between whom affinity has been contracted survive, although the person 
die through whom it was contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The marriage tie causes affinity not only by reason of 
actual union, but also by reason of the union having been effected in the 
past.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[2] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Consanguinity is not the chief cause of affinity, but union 
with a blood-relation, not only because that union is now, but because it 
has been. Hence the argument does not prove.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether unlawful intercourse causes affinity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that unlawful intercourse does not cause affinity. 
For affinity is an honorable thing. Now honorable things do not result 
from that which is dishonorable. Therefore affinity cannot be caused by a 
dishonorable intercourse.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, where there is consanguinity there cannot be affinity; 
since affinity is a relationship between persons that results from carnal 
intercourse and is altogether void of blood-relationship. Now if unlawful 
intercourse were a cause of affinity, it would sometimes happen that a 
man would contract affinity with his blood-relations and with himself: 
for instance when a man is guilty of incest with a blood-relation. 
Therefore affinity is not caused by unlawful intercourse.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, unlawful intercourse is according to nature or against 
nature. Now affinity is not caused by unnatural unlawful intercourse as 
decided by law (can. Extraordinaria, xxxv, qu. 2,3). Therefore it is not 
caused only by unlawful intercourse according to nature.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] OTC Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> He who is joined to a harlot is made one body (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=1+Cor++6%3A16">1 Cor. 6:16</a>). Now this is the reason why marriage caused affinity. Therefore 
unlawful intercourse does so for the same reason.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] OTC Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Further, carnal intercourse is the cause of affinity, as shown  by the 
definition of affinity, which definition is as follows: Affinity is the 
relationship of persons which results from carnal intercourse and is 
altogether void of blood-relationship. But there is carnal copulation 
even in unlawful intercourse. Therefore unlawful intercourse causes 
affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Ethic. viii, 12) the union 
of husband and wife is said to be natural chiefly on account of the 
procreation of offspring, and secondly on account of the community of 
works: the former of which belongs to marriage by reason of carnal 
copulation, and the latter, in so far as marriage is a partnership 
directed to a common life. Now the former is to be found in every carnal 
union where there is a mingling of seeds, since such a union may be 
productive of offspring, but the latter may be wanting. Consequently 
since marriage caused affinity, in so far as it was a carnal mingling, it 
follows that also an unlawful intercourse causes affinity in so far as it 
has something of natural copulation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In an unlawful intercourse there is something natural which 
is common to fornication and marriage, and in this respect it causes 
affinity. There is also something which is inordinate whereby it differs 
from marriage, and in this respect it does not cause affinity. Hence 
affinity remains honorable, although its cause is in a way dishonorable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> There is no reason why diverse relations should not be in 
the same subject by reason of different things. Consequently there can be 
affinity and consanguinity between two persons, not only on account of 
unlawful but also on account of lawful intercourse: for instance if a 
blood-relation of mine on my father's side marries a blood-relation of 
mine on my mother's side. Hence in the above definition the words "which 
is altogether void of blood-relationship" apply to affinity as such. Nor 
does it follow that a man by having intercourse with his blood-relation 
contracts affinity with himself, since affinity, like consanguinity, 
requires diversity of subjects, as likeness does.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[3] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In unnatural copulation there is no mingling of seeds that 
makes generation possible: wherefore a like intercourse does not cause 
affinity.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether affinity is caused by betrothal?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that affinity cannot be caused by betrothal. For 
affinity is a lasting tie: whereas a betrothal is sometimes broken off. 
Therefore it cannot cause affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further if the hymen be penetrated without the deed being 
consummated, affinity is not contracted. Yet this is much more akin to 
carnal intercourse than a betrothal. Therefore betrothal does not cause 
affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1 -->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, betrothal is nothing but a promise of future marriage. 
Now sometimes there is a promise of future marriage without affinity 
being contracted, for instance if it take place before the age of seven 
years; or if a man having a perpetual impediment of impotence promise a 
woman future marriage; or if a like promise be made between persons to 
whom marriage is rendered unlawful by a vow; or in any other way 
whatever. Therefore betrothal cannot cause affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Pope Alexander (cap. Ad audiendem, De spons. et 
matrim.) forbade a certain woman to marry a certain man, because she had 
been betrothed to his brother. Now this would not be the case unless 
affinity were contracted by betrothal. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Just as a betrothal has not the conditions of a perfect 
marriage, but is a preparation for marriage, so betrothal causes not 
affinity as marriage does, but something like affinity. This is called 
"the justice of public honesty," which is an impediment to marriage even 
as affinity and consanguinity are, and according to the same degrees, and 
is defined thus: "The justice of public honesty is a relationship arising 
out of betrothal, and derives its force from ecclesiastical institution 
by reason of its honesty." This indicates the reason of its name as well 
as its cause, namely that this relationship was instituted by the Church 
on account of its honesty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Betrothal, by reason not of itself but of the end to which 
it is directed, causes this kind of affinity known as "the justice of 
public honesty": wherefore just as marriage is a lasting tie, so is the 
aforesaid kind of affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> In carnal intercourse man and woman become one flesh by the 
mingling of seeds. Wherefore it is not every invasion or penetration of 
the hymen that causes affinity to be contracted, but only such as is 
followed by a mingling of seeds. But marriage causes affinity not only on 
account of carnal intercourse, but also by reason of the conjugal 
fellowship, in respect of which also marriage is according to nature. 
Consequently affinity results from the marriage contract itself expressed 
in words of the present and before its consummation, and in like manner 
there results from betrothal, which is a promise of conjugal fellowship, 
something akin to affinity, namely the justice of public honesty.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[4] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> All those impediments which void a betrothal prevent 
affinity being contracted through a promise of marriage. Hence whether he 
who actually promises marriage be lacking in age, or be under a solemn 
vow of continence or any like impediment, no affinity nor anything akin 
to it results because the betrothal is void. If however, a minor, 
laboring under insensibility or malefice, having a perpetual impediment, 
is betrothed before the age of puberty and after the age of seven years, 
with a woman who is of age, from such a contract there results the 
impediment called "justice of public honesty," because at the time the 
impediment was not actual, since at that age the boy who is insensible is 
equally  impotent in respect of the act in question.<br>

<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that affinity also is a cause of affinity. For Pope 
Julius I says (cap. Contradicimus 35, qu. iii): "No man may marry his 
wife's surviving blood-relation": and it is said in the next chapter 
(cap. Porro duorum) that "the wives of two cousins are forbidden to 
marry, one after the other, the same husband." But this is only on 
account of affinity being contracted through union with a person related 
by affinity. Therefore affinity is a cause of affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, carnal intercourse makes persons akin even as carnal 
procreation, since the degrees of affinity and consanguinity are reckoned 
equally. But consanguinity causes affinity. Therefore affinity does also.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, things that are the same with one and the same are the 
same with one another. But the wife contracts the same relations with all 
her husband's kindred. Therefore all her husband's kindred are made one 
with all who are related by affinity to the wife, and thus affinity is 
the cause of affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> On the contrary, If affinity is caused by affinity a man who has 
connection with two women can marry neither of them, because then the one 
would be related to the other by affinity. But this is false. Therefore 
affinity does not cause affinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 5:</i></b> Further, if affinity arose out of affinity a man by marrying 
another man's widow would contract affinity with all her first husband's 
kindred, since she is related to them by affinity. But this cannot be the 
case because he would become especially related by affinity to her 
deceased husband. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Obj. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 6:</i></b> Further, consanguinity is a stronger tie than affinity. But the 
blood-relations of the wife do not become blood-relations of the husband. 
Much less, therefore, does affinity to the wife cause affinity to her 
blood-relations, and thus the same conclusion follows.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> There are two ways in which one thing proceeds from 
another: in one way a thing proceeds from another in likeness of species, 
as a man is begotten of a man: in another way one thing proceeds from 
another, not in likeness of species; and this process is always towards a 
lower species, as instanced in all equivocal agents. The first kind of 
procession, however often it be repeated, the same species always 
remains: thus if one man be begotten of another by an act of the 
generative power, of this man also another man will be begotten, and so 
on. But the second kind of procession, just as in the first instance it 
produces another species, so it makes another species as often as it is 
repeated. Thus by movement from a point there proceeds a line and not a 
point, because a point  by being moved makes a line; and from a line 
moved lineally, there proceeds not a line but a surface, and from a 
surface a body, and in this way the procession can go no further. Now in 
the procession of kinship we find two kinds whereby this tie is caused: 
one is by carnal procreation, and this always produces the same species 
of relationship; the other is by the marriage union, and this produces a 
different kind of relationship from the beginning: thus it is clear that 
a married woman is related to her husband's blood-relations not by blood 
but by affinity. Wherefore if this kind of process be repeated, the 
result will be not affinity but another kind of relationship; and 
consequently a married party contracts with the affines of the other 
party a relation not of affinity but of some other kind which is called 
affinity of the second kind. And again if a person through marriage 
contracts relationship with an affine of the second kind, it will not be 
affinity of the second kind, but of a third kind, as indicated in the 
verse quoted above (<A Href="XP055.html#XPQ55A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Formerly these two kinds were included in the 
prohibition, under the head of the justice of public honesty rather than 
under the head of affinity, because they fall short of true affinity, in 
the same way as the relationship arising out of betrothal. Now however 
they have ceased to be included in the prohibition, which now refers only 
to the first kind of affinity in which true affinity consists.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A husband contracts affinity of the first kind with his 
wife's male blood-relation, and affinity of the second kind with the 
latter's wife: wherefore if the latter man dies the former cannot marry 
his widow on account of the second kind of affinity. Again if a man A 
marry a widow B, C, a relation of her former husband being connected with 
B by the first kind of affinity, contracts affinity of the second kind 
with her husband A; and D, the wife of this relation C being connected, 
by affinity of the second kind, with B, this man's wife contracts 
affinity of the third kind with her husband A. And since the third kind 
of affinity was included in the prohibition on account of a certain 
honesty more than by reason of affinity, the canon (cap. Porro duorum 35, 
qu. iii) says: "The justice of public honesty forbids the wives of two 
cousins to be married to the same man, the one after the other." But this 
prohibition is done away with.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Although carnal intercourse is a cause of people being 
connected with one another, it is not the same kind of connection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The wife contracts the same connection with her husband's 
relatives as to the degree but not as to the kind of connection.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 3 Para. 2/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp; Since however the arguments in the contrary sense would seem to show 
that no tie is caused by affinity, we must reply to them lest the 
time-honored prohibition of the Church seem unreasonable.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> As stated above, a woman does not contract affinity of the 
first kind with the man to whom she is united in  the flesh, wherefore 
she does not contract affinity of the second kind with a woman known by 
the same man; and consequently if a man marry one of these women, the 
other does not contract affinity of the third kind with him. And so the 
laws of bygone times did not forbid the same man to marry successively 
two women known by one man.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 5 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 5:</i></b> As a man is not connected with his wife by affinity of the 
first kind, so he does not contract affinity of the second kind with the 
second husband of the same wife. Wherefore the argument does not prove.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[5] R.O. 6 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 6:</i></b> One person is not connected with me through another, except 
they be connected together. Hence through a woman who is affine to me, no 
person becomes connected with me, except such as is connected with her. 
Now this cannot be except through carnal procreation from her, or through 
connection with her by marriage: and according to the olden legislation, 
I contracted some kind of connection through her in both ways: because 
her son even by another husband becomes affine to me in the same kind and 
in a different degree of affinity, as appears from the rule given above: 
and again her second husband becomes affine to me in the second kind of 
affinity. But her other blood-relations are not connected with him, but 
she is connected with them, either as with father or mother, inasmuch as 
she descends from them, or, as with her brothers, as proceeding from the 
same principle; wherefore the brother or father of my affine does not 
become affine to me in any kind of affinity.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that affinity is not an impediment to marriage. For 
nothing is an impediment to marriage except what is contrary thereto. But 
affinity is not contrary to marriage since it is caused by it. Therefore 
it is not an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, by marriage the wife becomes a possession of the 
husband. Now the husband's kindred inherit his possessions after his 
death. Therefore they can succeed to his wife, although she is affine to 
them, as shown above (<A Href="XP055.html#XPQ55A5THEP1">Article [5]</a>). Therefore affinity is not an impediment to 
marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> It is written (Lev. 18:8): "Thou shalt not uncover the 
nakedness of thy father's wife." Now she is only affine. Therefore 
affinity is an impediment to marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Affinity that precedes marriage hinders marriage being 
contracted and voids the contract, for the same reason as consanguinity. 
For just as there is a certain need for blood-relations to live together, 
so is there for those who are connected by affinity: and just as there is 
a tie of friendship between blood-relations, so is there between those 
who are affine to one another. If, however, affinity supervene to 
matrimony, it  cannot void the marriage, as stated above (<A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50OUTP1">Question [50]</a>, <A Href="XP050.html#XPQ50A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>).<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Affinity is not contrary to the marriage which causes it, 
but to a marriage being contracted with an affine, in so far as the 
latter would hinder the extension of friendship and the curbing of 
concupiscence, which are sought in marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[6] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The husband's possessions do not become one with him as the 
wife is made one flesh with him. Wherefore just as consanguinity is an 
impediment to marriage or union with the husband according to the flesh, 
so is one forbidden to marry the husband's wife.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether affinity in itself admits of degrees?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that affinity in itself admits of degrees. For any 
kind of propinquity can itself be the subject of degrees. Now affinity is 
a kind of propinquity. Therefore it has degrees in itself apart from the 
degrees of consanguinity by which it is caused.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it is stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 41) that the 
child of a second marriage could not take a consort from within the 
degrees of affinity of the first husband. But this would not be the case 
unless the son of an affine were also affine. Therefore affinity like 
consanguinity admits itself of degrees.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Affinity is caused by consanguinity. Therefore all the 
degrees of affinity are caused by the degrees of consanguinity: and so it 
has no degrees of itself.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> A thing does not of itself admit of being divided except 
in reference to something belonging to it by reason of its genus: thus 
animal is divided into rational and irrational and not into white and 
black. Now carnal procreation has a direct relation to consanguinity, 
because the tie of consanguinity is immediately contracted through it; 
whereas it has no relation to affinity except through consanguinity which 
is the latter's cause. Wherefore since the degrees of relationship are 
distinguished in reference to carnal procreation, the distinction of 
degrees is directly and immediately referable to consanguinity, and to 
affinity through consanguinity. Hence the general rule in seeking the 
degrees of affinity is that in whatever degree of consanguinity I am 
related to the husband, in that same degree of affinity I am related to 
the wife.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The degrees in propinquity of relationship can only be 
taken in reference to ascent and descent of propagation, to which 
affinity is compared only through consanguinity. Wherefore affinity has 
no direct degrees, but derives them according to the degrees of 
consanguinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[7] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Formerly it used to be said that the son of my  affine by a 
second marriage was affine to me, not directly but accidentally as it 
were: wherefore he was forbidden to marry on account of the justice of 
public honesty rather than affinity. And for this reason this prohibition 
is now revoked.<br>

</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the degrees of affinity do not extend in the 
same way as the degrees of consanguinity. For the tie of affinity is less 
strong than the tie of consanguinity, since affinity arises from 
consanguinity in diversity of species, as from an equivocal cause. Now 
the stronger the tie the longer it lasts. Therefore the tie of affinity 
does not last to the same number of degrees as consanguinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, human law should imitate Divine law. Now according to 
the Divine law certain degrees of consanguinity were forbidden, in which 
degrees affinity was not an impediment to marriage: as instanced in a 
brother's wife whom a man could marry although he could not marry her 
sister. Therefore now too the prohibition of affinity and consanguinity 
should not extend to the same degrees.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> A woman is connected with me by affinity from the very 
fact that she is married to a blood-relation of mine. Therefore in 
whatever degree her husband is related to me by blood she is related to 
me in that same degree by affinity: and so the degrees of affinity should 
be reckoned in the same number as the degrees of consanguinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since the degrees of affinity are reckoned according to 
the degrees of consanguinity, the degrees of affinity must needs be the 
same in number as those of consanguinity. Nevertheless, affinity being a 
lesser tie than consanguinity, both formerly and now, a dispensation is 
more easily granted in the more remote degrees of affinity than in the 
remote degrees of consanguinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fact that the tie of affinity is less than the tie of 
consanguinity causes a difference in the kind of relationship but not in 
the degrees. Hence this argument is not to the point.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[8] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> A man could not take his deceased brother's wife except, in 
the case when the latter died without issue, in order to raise up seed to 
his brother. This was requisite at a time when religious worship was 
propagated by means of the propagation of the flesh, which is not the 
case now. Hence it is clear that he did not marry her in his own person 
as it were, but as supplying the place of his brother.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether a marriage contracted by persons with the degrees of affinity or consanguinity should always be annulled?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that a marriage contracted by persons within the 
degrees of affinity or consanguinity ought not always to be annulled by 
divorce. For "what God hath joined together let no man put asunder" (<A Href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&q=Mt++19%3A6">Mt. 19:6</a>). Since then it is understood that what the Church does God does, 
and since the Church sometimes through ignorance joins such persons 
together, it would seem that if subsequently this came to knowledge they 
ought not to be separated.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, the tie of marriage is less onerous than the tie of 
ownership. Now after a long time a man may acquire by prescription the 
ownership of a thing of which he was not the owner. Therefore by length 
of time a marriage becomes good in law, although it was not so before.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, of like things we judge alike. Now if a marriage ought 
to be annulled on account of consanguinity, in the case when two brothers 
marry two sisters, if one be separated on account of consanguinity, the 
other ought to be separated for the same reason. and yet this is not 
seemly. Therefore a marriage ought not to be annulled on account of 
affinity or consanguinity.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Consanguinity and affinity forbid the contracting of a 
marriage and void the contract. Therefore if affinity or consanguinity be 
proved, the parties should be separated even though they have actually 
contracted marriage.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Since all copulation apart from lawful marriage is a 
mortal sin, which the Church uses all her endeavors to prevent, it 
belongs to her to separate those between whom there cannot be valid 
marriage, especially those related by blood or by affinity, who cannot 
without incest be united in the flesh.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Although the Church is upheld by God's gift and authority, 
yet in so far as she is an assembly of men there results in her acts 
something of human frailty which is not Divine. Therefore a union 
effected in the presence of the Church who is ignorant of an impediment 
is not indissoluble by Divine authority, but is brought about contrary to 
Divine authority through man's error, which being an error of fact 
excuses from sin, as long as it remains. Hence when the impediment comes 
to the knowledge of the Church, she ought to sever the aforesaid union.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> That which cannot be done without sin is not ratified by 
any prescription, for as Innocent III says (Conc. Later. iv, can. 50: 
cap. Non debent, De consang. et affinit.), "length of time does not 
diminish sin but increases it": nor can it in any way legitimize a 
marriage which could not take place between unlawful persons.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[9] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> In contentious suits between two persons the verdict does 
not prejudice a third party, wherefore although the  one brother's 
marriage with the one sister is annulled on account of consanguinity, the 
Church does not therefore annul the other marriage against which no 
action is taken. Yet in the tribunal of the conscience the other brother 
ought not on this account always to be bound to put away his wife, 
because such accusations frequently proceed from ill-will, and are proved 
by false witnesses. Hence he is not bound to form his conscience on what 
has been done about the other marriage: but seemingly one ought to draw a 
distinction, because either he has certain knowledge of the impediment of 
his marriage, or he has an opinion about it, or he has neither. In the 
first case, he can neither seek nor pay the debt, in the second, he must 
pay, but not ask, in the third he can both pay and ask.<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether it is necessary to proceed by way of accusation for the annulment of a marriage contracted by persons related to each other by affinity or consanguinity?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that one ought not to proceed by way of accusation 
in order to sever a marriage contracted between persons related by 
affinity or consanguinity. Because accusation is preceded by inscription* 
whereby a man binds himself to suffer the punishment of retaliation, if 
he fail to prove his accusation. [*The accuser was bound by Roman Law to 
endorse (se inscribere) the writ of accusation; Cf. SS, <A Href="XP033.html#XPQ33OUTP1">Question [33]</a>, <A Href="XP033.html#XPQ33A7THEP1">Article [7]</a>]. But this is not required when a matrimonial separation is at issue. Therefore accusation has no place then.

 OBJ 2: Further, in a matrimonial lawsuit only the relatives are heard, as stated in the text (Sent. iv, D, 41). But in accusations even 
strangers are heard. Therefore in a suit for matrimonial separation the 
process is not by way of accusation.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, if a marriage ought to be denounced this should be done 
especially where it is least difficult to sever the tie. Now this is when 
only the betrothal has been contracted, and then it is not the marriage 
that is denounced. Therefore accusation should never take place at any 
other time.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] Obj. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 4:</i></b> Further, a man is not prevented from accusing by the fact that he 
does not accuse at once. But this happens in marriage, for if he was 
silent at first when the marriage was being contracted, he cannot 
denounce the marriage afterwards without laying himself open to 
suspicion. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Whatever is unlawful can be denounced. But the marriage 
of relatives by affinity and consanguinity is unlawful. Therefore it can 
be denounced.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] Body Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> Accusation is instituted lest the guilty be tolerated as 
though they were innocent. Now just as it happens through ignorance of 
fact that a guilty man is reputed innocent, so it happens through 
ignorance of a circumstance that a certain fact  is deemed lawful whereas 
it is unlawful. Wherefore just as a man is sometimes accused, so is a 
fact sometimes an object of accusation. It is in this way that a marriage 
is denounced, when through ignorance of an impediment it is deemed 
lawful, whereas it is unlawful.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] R.O. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The punishment of retaliation takes place when a person is 
accused of a crime, because then action is taken that he may be punished. 
But when it is a deed that is accused, action is taken not for the 
punishment of the doer, but in order to prevent what is unlawful. Hence 
in a matrimonial suit the accuser does not bind himself to a punishment. 
Moreover, the accusation may be made either in words or in writing, 
provided the person who denounces the marriage denounced, and the 
impediment for which it is denounced, be expressed.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] R.O. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Strangers cannot know of the consanguinity except from the 
relatives, since these know with greater probability. Hence when these 
are silent, a stranger is liable to be suspected of acting from ill-will 
unless he wish the relatives to prove his assertion. Wherefore a stranger 
is debarred from accusing when there are relatives who are silent, and by 
whom he cannot prove his accusation. On the other hand the relatives, 
however nearly related they be, are not debarred from accusing, when the 
marriage is denounced on account of a perpetual impediment, which 
prevents the contracting of the marriage and voids the contract. When, 
however, the accusation is based on a denial of the contract having taken 
place, the parents should be debarred from witnessing as being liable to 
suspicion, except those of the party that is inferior in rank and wealth, 
for they, one is inclined to think, would be willing for the marriage to 
stand.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] R.O. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> If the marriage is not yet contracted and there is only a 
betrothal, there can be no accusation, for what is not, cannot be 
accused. But the impediment can be denounced lest the marriage be 
contracted.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[10] R.O. 4 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Reply to Objection 4:</i></b> He who is silent at first is sometimes heard afterwards if 
he wish to denounce the marriage, and sometimes he is repulsed. This is 
made clear by the Decretal (cap. Cum in tua, De his qui matrim. accus. 
possunt.) which runs as follows: "If an accuser present himself after the 
marriage has been contracted, since he did not declare himself when 
according to custom, the banns were published in church, we may rightly 
ask whether he should be allowed to voice his accusation. In this matter 
we deem that a distinction should be made, so that if he who lodges 
information against persons already married was absent from the diocese 
at the time of the aforesaid publication, or if for some other reason 
this could not come to his knowledge, for instance if through exceeding 
stress of weakness and fever he was not in possession of his faculties, 
or was of so tender years as to be too young to understand such matters, 
or if he were hindered by some other lawful cause, his accusation should 
be heard. otherwise without doubt he should be repulsed as open to 
suspicion, unless he  swear that the information lodged by him came to 
his knowledge subsequently and that he is not moved by ill-will to make 
his accusation."<br>

<H3 Align="Left">Whether in a suit of this kind one should proceed by hearing witnesses in the same way as in other suits?<br>
</h3>
<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[11] Obj. 1 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that in such a suit one ought not to proceed by 
hearing witnesses, in the same way as in other suits where any witnesses 
may be called provided they be unexceptionable. But here strangers are 
not admitted, although they be unexceptionable. Therefore, etc.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[11] Obj. 2 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, witnesses who are suspected of private hatred or love 
are debarred from giving evidence. Now relatives are especially open to 
suspicion of love for one party, and hatred for the other. Therefore 
their evidence should not be taken.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[11] Obj. 3 Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, marriage is a more favorable suit than those others in 
which purely corporeal questions are at stake. Now in these the same 
person cannot be both accuser and witness. Neither therefore can this be 
in a matrimonial suit; and so it would appear that it is not right to 
proceed by hearing witnesses in a suit of this kind.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[11] OTC Para. 1/1-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>On the contrary,</i></b> Witnesses are called in a suit in order to give the 
judge evidence concerning matters of doubt. Now evidence should be 
afforded the judge in this suit as in other suits, since he must not 
pronounce a hasty judgment on what is not proven. Therefore here as in 
other lawsuits witnesses should be called.<br>
<!--Aquin.: SMT XP Q[55] A[11] Body Para. 1/2-->
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>I answer that,</i></b> In this kind of lawsuit as in others, truth must be 
unveiled by witnesses: yet, as the lawyers say, there are many things 
peculiar to this suit; namely that "the same person can be accuser and 
witness; that evidence is not taken 'on oath of calumny,' since it is a 
quasi-spiritual lawsuit; that relatives are allowed as witnesses; that 
the juridical order is not perfectly observed, since if the denunciation 
has been made, and the suit is uncontested, the defendant may be 
excommunicated if contumacious; that hearsay evidence is admitted; and 
that witnesses may be called after the publication of the names of the 
witnesses." All this is in order to prevent the sin that may occur in 
such a union (cap. Quoties aliqui; cap. Super eo, De test. et attest.; 
cap. Literas, De juram. calumn.).<br>
