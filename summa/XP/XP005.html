  <h3 align="center">OF THE EFFECT OF CONTRITION (THREE ARTICLES)<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    We must now consider the effect of contrition: under which head there are
    three points of inquiry:<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP005.html#XPQ5A1THEP1">(1)</a> Whether the remission of sin is the
    effect of contrition?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP005.html#XPQ5A2THEP1">(2)</a> Whether contrition can take away
    the debt of punishment entirely?
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="XP005.html#XPQ5A3THEP1">(3)</a> Whether slight contrition suffices
    to blot out great sins?

    Whether the forgiveness of sin is the effect of contrition?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that the forgiveness of sin is not
    the effect of contrition. For God alone forgives sins. But we are somewhat
    the cause of contrition, since it is an act of our own. Therefore contrition
    is not the cause of forgiveness.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, contrition is an act of virtue. Now
    virtue follows the forgiveness of sin: because virtue and sin are not
    together in the soul. Therefore contrition is not the cause of the
    forgiveness of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, nothing but sin is an obstacle to
    receiving the Eucharist. But the contrite should not go to Communion before
    going to confession. Therefore they have not yet received the forgiveness of
    their sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> a gloss on Ps. 50:19, "A sacrifice to God is
    an afflicted spirit," says: "A hearty contrition is the sacrifice by which
    sins are loosed."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, virtue and vice are engendered and corrupted by the same causes, as
    stated in Ethic. ii, 1,2. Now sin is committed through the heart's
    inordinate love. Therefore it is destroyed by sorrow caused by the heart's
    ordinate love; and consequently contrition blots out sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Contrition can be considered in two ways,
    either as part of a sacrament, or as an act of virtue, and in either case it
    is the cause of the forgiveness of sin, but not in the same way. Because, as
    part of a sacrament, it operates primarily as an instrument for the
    forgiveness of sin, as is evident with regard to the other sacraments (cf.
    Sent. iv, D, 1, <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1">Question [1]</a>,
    <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1A4THEP1">Article [4]</a>:
    <a href="../TP.html">TP</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP062.html#TPQ62OUTP1">Question [62]</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP062.html#TPQ62A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>); while, as an act
    of virtue, it is the quasi-material cause of sin's forgiveness. For a
    disposition is, as it were, a necessary condition for justification, and a
    disposition is reduced to a material cause, if it be taken to denote that
    which disposes matter to receive something. It is otherwise in the case of
    an agent's disposition to act, because this is reduced to the genus of
    efficient cause.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> God alone is the principal efficient
    cause of the forgiveness of sin: but the dispositive cause can be from us
    also, and likewise the sacramental cause, since the sacramental forms are
    words uttered by us, having an instrumental power of conferring grace
    whereby sins are forgiven.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The forgiveness of sin precedes virtue
    and the infusion of grace, in one way, and, in another, follows: and in so
    far as it follows, the act elicited by the virtue can be a cause of the
    forgiveness of sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> The dispensation of the Eucharist
    belongs to the ministers of the Church: wherefore a man should not go to
    Communion until his sin has been forgiven through the ministers of the
    Church, although his sin may be forgiven him before God.<br />

    Whether contrition can take away the debt of punishment entirely?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that contrition cannot take away
    the debt of punishment entirely. For satisfaction and confession are
    ordained for man's deliverance from the debt of punishment. Now no man is so
    perfectly contrite as not to be bound to confession and satisfaction.
    Therefore contrition is never so great as to blot out the entire debt of
    punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, in Penance the punishment should in some
    way compensate for the sin. Now some sins are accomplished by members of the
    body. Therefore, since it is for the due compensation for sin that "by what
    things a man sinneth, by the same also he is tormented" (Wis. 11:17), it
    seems that the punishment for suchlike sins can never be remitted by
    contrition.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, the sorrow of contrition is finite. Now
    an infinite punishment is due for some, viz. mortal, sins. Therefore
    contrition can never be so great as to remit the whole punishment.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> The affections of the heart are more
    acceptable to God than external acts. Now man is absolved from both
    punishment and guilt by means of external actions; and therefore he is also
    by means of the heart's affections, such as contrition is.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, we have an example of this in the thief, to whom it was said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Lk++23%3A43"
      >Lk. 23:43</a
    >): "This day shalt thou be with Me in paradise," on account of his one act
    of repentance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    As to whether the whole debt of punishment is always taken away by
    contrition, this question has already been considered above (Sent. iv, D,
    14, Question [2], Articles [1],2; TP, Question [86], Article [4]), where the
    same question was raised with regard to Penance.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> The intensity of contrition may be regarded in
    two ways. First, on the part of charity, which causes the displeasure, and
    in this way it may happen that the act of charity is so intense that the
    contrition resulting therefrom merits not only the removal of guilt, but
    also the remission of all punishment. Secondly, on the part of the sensible
    sorrow, which the will excites in contrition: and since this sorrow is also
    a kind of punishment, it may be so intense as to suffice for the remission
    of both guilt and punishment.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> A man cannot be sure that his contrition
    suffices for the remission of both punishment and guilt: wherefore he is
    bound to confess and to make satisfaction, especially since his contrition
    would not be true contrition, unless he had the purpose of confessing united
    thereto: which purpose must also be carried into effect, on account of the
    precept given concerning confession.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Just as inward joy redounds into the
    outward parts of the body, so does interior sorrow show itself in the
    exterior members: wherefore it is written (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Prov++17%3A22"
      >Prov. 17:22</a
    >): "A sorrowful spirit drieth up the bones."<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> Although the sorrow of contrition is
    finite in its intensity, even as the punishment due for mortal sin is
    finite; yet it derives infinite power from charity, whereby it is quickened,
    and so it avails for the remission of both guilt and punishment.<br />

    Whether slight contrition suffices to blot out great sins?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that slight contrition does not
    suffice to blot out great sins. For contrition is the remedy for sin. Now a
    bodily remedy, that heals a lesser bodily infirmity, does not suffice to
    heal a greater. Therefore the least contrition does not suffice to blot out
    very great sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, it was stated above (<a
      href="XP003.html#XPQ3OUTP1"
      >Question [3]</a
    >, <a href="XP003.html#XPQ3A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>) that for greater sins
    one ought to have greater contrition. Now contrition does not blot out sin,
    unless it fulfills the requisite conditions. Therefore the least contrition
    does not blot out all sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Every sanctifying grace blots out every
    mortal sin, because it is incompatible therewith. Now every contrition is
    quickened by sanctifying grace. Therefore, however slight it be, it blots
    out all sins.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> As we have often said (<a
      href="XP001.html#XPQ1OUTP1"
      >Question [1]</a
    >, <a href="XP001.html#XPQ1A2THEP1">Article [2]</a>, ad 1;
    <a href="XP003.html#XPQ3OUTP1">Question [3]</a>,
    <a href="XP003.html#XPQ3A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>;
    <a href="XP004.html#XPQ4OUTP1">Question [4]</a>,
    <a href="XP004.html#XPQ4A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), contrition includes a
    twofold sorrow. One is in the reason, and is displeasure at the sin
    committed. This can be so slight as not to suffice for real contrition, e.g.
    if a sin were less displeasing to a man, than separation from his last end
    ought to be; just as love can be so slack as not to suffice for real
    charity. The other sorrow is in the senses, and the slightness of this is no
    hindrance to real contrition, because it does not, of itself, belong
    essentially to contrition, but is connected with it accidentally: nor again
    is it under our control. Accordingly we must say that sorrow, however slight
    it be, provided it suffice for true contrition, blots out all sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> Spiritual remedies derive infinite
    efficacy from the infinite power which operates in them: wherefore the
    remedy which suffices for healing a slight sin, suffices also to heal a
    great sin. This is seen in Baptism which looses great and small: and the
    same applies to contrition provided it fulfill the necessary conditions.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> It follows of necessity that a man
    grieves more for a greater sin than for a lesser, according as it is more
    repugnant to the love which causes his sorrow. But if one has the same
    degree of sorrow for a greater sin, as another has for a lesser, this would
    suffice for the remission of the sin.<br />
