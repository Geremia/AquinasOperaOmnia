          Respondeo dicendum quod hic oportet aliter dicere secundum
          expositionem Augustini, et aliorum sanctorum. Augustinus enim in
          omnibus his operibus non ponit durationis ordinem, sed solum originis
          et naturae. Dicit enim primo creatam naturam spiritualem informem, et
          naturam corporalem absque omni forma (quam dicit primo significari
          nomine terrae et aquae), non quia haec informitas formationem
          praecesserit tempore, sed origine tantum. Neque una formatio, secundum
          eum, praecessit aliam duratione; sed solum naturae ordine. Secundum
          quem ordinem necesse fuit ut primo poneretur formatio supremae
          naturae, scilicet spiritualis, per hoc quod legitur prima die lux
          facta. Sicut autem spiritualis natura praeeminet corporali, ita
          superiora corpora praeeminent inferioribus. Unde secundo loco tangitur
          formatio superiorum corporum, cum dicitur, fiat firmamentum; per quod
          intelligitur impressio formae caelestis in materiam informem, non
          prius existentem tempore, sed origine tantum. Tertio vero loco ponitur
          impressio formarum elementarium in materiam informem, non tempore, sed
          origine praecedentem. Unde per hoc quod dicitur, congregentur aquae,
          et appareat arida, intelligitur quod materiae corporali impressa est
          forma substantialis aquae, per quam competit sibi talis motus; et
          forma substantialis terrae, per quam competit sibi sic videri.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> It is necessary to reply differently to
          this question according to the different interpretations given by
          Augustine and other holy writers. In all these works, according to
          Augustine (Gen. ad lit. i, 15; iv, 22,34; De Gen. Contr. Manich. i, 5,
          7), there is no order of duration, but only of origin and nature. He
          says that the formless spiritual and formless corporeal natures were
          created first of all, and that the latter are at first indicated by
          the words "earth" and "water." Not that this formlessness preceded
          formation, in time, but only in origin; nor yet that one formation
          preceded another in duration, but merely in the order of nature.
          Agreeably, then, to this order, the formation of the highest or
          spiritual nature is recorded in the first place, where it is said that
          light was made on the first day. For as the spiritual nature is higher
          than the corporeal, so the higher bodies are nobler than the lower.
          Hence the formation of the higher bodies is indicated in the second
          place, by the words, "Let there be made a firmament," by which is to
          be understood the impression of celestial forms on formless matter,
          that preceded with priority not of time, but of origin only. But in
          the third place the impression of elemental forms on formless matter
          is recorded, also with a priority of origin only. Therefore the words,
          "Let the waters be gathered together, and the dry land appear," mean
          that corporeal matter was impressed with the substantial form of
          water, so as to have such movement, and with the substantial form of
          earth, so as to have such an appearance.<br />

          Sed secundum alios sanctos, in his operibus etiam ordo durationis
          attenditur, ponunt enim quod, informitas materiae tempore praecessit
          formationem, et una formatio aliam. Sed informitas materiae, secundum
          eos, non intelligitur carentia omnis formae quia iam erat caelum et
          aqua et terra (quae tria nominantur tanquam manifeste sensu
          perceptibilia), sed intelligitur informitas materiae carentia debitae
          distinctionis, et consummatae cuiusdam pulchritudinis. Et secundum
          haec tria nomina, posuit Scriptura tres informitates. Ad caelum enim,
          quod est superius, pertinet informitas tenebrarum, quia ex eo est
          origo luminis. Informitas vero aquae, quae est media, significatur
          nomine abyssi, quia hoc nomen significat quandam immensitatem
          inordinatam aquarum, ut Augustinus dicit, contra Faustum. Informitas
          vero terrae tangitur in hoc quod dicitur, quod terra erat invisibilis
          vel inanis, per hoc quod erat aquis cooperta. Sic igitur formatio
          supremi corporis facta est prima die. Et quia tempus sequitur motum
          caeli, tempus autem est numerus motus supremi corporis; per huiusmodi
          formationem facta est distinctio temporis, noctis scilicet et diei.
          Secundo vero die formatum est medium corpus, scilicet aqua, per
          firmamentum accipiens quandam distinctionem et ordinem (ita quod sub
          nomine aquae etiam alia comprehenduntur, ut supra dictum est). Tertio
          vero die formatum est ultimum corpus, scilicet terra, per hoc quod
          discooperta est aquis; et facta est distinctio in infimo, quae dicitur
          terrae et maris. Unde satis congrue, sicut informitatem terrae
          expresserat dicens quod terra erat invisibilis vel inanis, ita eius
          formationem exprimit per hoc quod dicit, et appareat arida.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          According, however, to other holy writers [*Question [66], Article
          [1]] an order of duration in the works is to be understood, by which
          is meant that the formlessness of matter precedes its formation, and
          one form another, in order of time. Nevertheless, they do not hold
          that the formlessness of matter implies the total absence of form,
          since heaven, earth, and water already existed, since these three are
          named as already clearly perceptible to the senses; rather they
          understand by formlessness the want of due distinction and of perfect
          beauty, and in respect of these three Scripture mentions three kinds
          of formlessness. Heaven, the highest of them, was without form so long
          as "darkness" filled it, because it was the source of light. The
          formlessness of water, which holds the middle place, is called the
          "deep," because, as Augustine says (Contr. Faust. xxii, 11), this word
          signifies the mass of waters without order. Thirdly, the formless
          state of the earth is touched upon when the earth is said to be "void"
          or "invisible," because it was covered by the waters. Thus, then, the
          formation of the highest body took place on the first day. And since
          time results from the movement of the heaven, and is the numerical
          measure of the movement of the highest body, from this formation,
          resulted the distinction of time, namely, that of night and day. On
          the second day the intermediate body, water, was formed, receiving
          from the firmament a sort of distinction and order (so that water be
          understood as including certain other things, as explained above (<a
            href="FP068.html#FPQ68OUTP1"
            >Question [68]</a
          >, <a href="FP068.html#FPQ68A3THEP1">Article [3]</a>)). On the third
          day the earth, the lowest body, received its form by the withdrawal of
          the waters, and there resulted the distinction in the lowest body,
          namely, of land and sea. Hence Scripture, having clearly expresses the
          manner in which it received its form by the equally suitable words,
          "Let the dry land appear."<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b>
          According to Augustine [*Gen. ad lit. ii, 7,8; iii, 20], Scripture
          does not say of the work of the third day, that it was made, as it
          says of those that precede, in order to show that higher and spiritual
          forms, such as the angels and the heavenly bodies, are perfect and
          stable in being, whereas inferior forms are imperfect and mutable.
          Hence the impression of such forms is signified by the gathering of
          the waters, and the appearing of the land. For "water," to use
          Augustine's words, "glides and flows away, the earth abides" (Gen. ad
          lit. ii, 11). Others, again, hold that the work of the third day was
          perfected on that day only as regards movement from place to place,
          and that for this reason Scripture had no reason to speak of it as
          made.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b>
          This argument is easily solved, according to Augustine's opinion (De
          Gen. Contr. Manich. i), because we need not suppose that the earth was
          first covered by the waters, and that these were afterwards gathered
          together, but that they were produced in this very gathering together.
          But according to the other writers there are three solutions, which
          Augustine gives (Gen. ad lit. i, 12). The first supposes that the
          waters are heaped up to a greater height at the place where they were
          gathered together, for it has been proved in regard to the Red Sea,
          that the sea is higher than the land, as Basil remarks (Hom. iv in
          Hexaem.). The second explains the water that covered the earth as
          being rarefied or nebulous, which was afterwards condensed when the
          waters were gathered together. The third suggests the existence of
          hollows in the earth, to receive the confluence of waters. Of the
          above the first seems the most probable.<br />

          All the waters have the sea as their goal, into which they flow by
          channels hidden or apparent, and this may be the reason why they are
          said to be gathered together into one place. Or, "one place" is to be
          understood not simply, but as contrasted with the place of the dry
          land, so that the sense would be, "Let the waters be gathered together
          in one place," that is, apart from the dry land. That the waters
          occupied more places than one seems to be implied by the words that
          follow, "The gathering together of the waters He called Seas."<br />

          The Divine command gives bodies their natural movement and by these
          natural movements they are said to "fulfill His word." Or we may say
          that it was according to the nature of water completely to cover the
          earth, just as the air completely surrounds both water and earth; but
          as a necessary means towards an end, namely, that plants and animals
          might be on the earth, it was necessary for the waters to be withdrawn
          from a portion of the earth. Some philosophers attribute this
          uncovering of the earth's surface to the action of the sun lifting up
          the vapors and thus drying the land. Scripture, however, attributes it
          to the Divine power, not only in the Book of Genesis, but also Job
          38:10 where in the person of the Lord it is said, "I set My bounds
          around the sea," and Jer. 5:22, where it is written: "Will you not
          then fear Me, saith the Lord, who have set the sand a bound for the
          sea?"<br />

          According to Augustine (De Gen. Contr. Manich. i), primary matter is
          meant by the word earth, where first mentioned, but in the present
          passage it is to be taken for the element itself. Again it may be said
          with Basil (Hom. iv in Hexaem.), that the earth is mentioned in the
          first passage in respect of its nature, but here in respect of its
          principal property, namely, dryness. Wherefore it is written: "He
          called the dry land, Earth." It may also be said with Rabbi Moses,
          that the expression, "He called," denotes throughout an equivocal use
          of the name imposed. Thus we find it said at first that "He called the
          light Day": for the reason that later on a period of twenty-four hours
          is also called day, where it is said that "there was evening and
          morning, one day." In like manner it is said that "the firmament,"
          that is, the air, "He called heaven": for that which was first created
          was also called "heaven." And here, again, it is said that "the dry
          land," that is, the part from which the waters had withdrawn, "He
          called, Earth," as distinct from the sea; although the name earth is
          equally applied to that which is covered with waters or not. So by the
          expression "He called" we are to understand throughout that the nature
          or property He bestowed corresponded to the name He gave.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod, sicut supra dictum est, in tertia die
          informitas terrae removetur. Duplex autem informitas circa terram
          describebatur, una, quod erat invisibilis vel inanis, quia erat aquis
          cooperta; alia, quod erat incomposita sive vacua, idest non habens
          debitum decorem, qui acquiritur terrae ex plantis eam quodammodo
          vestientibus. Et ideo utraque informitas in hac tertia die removetur,
          prima quidem, per hoc quod aquae congregatae sunt in unum locum, et
          apparuit arida; secunda vero, per hoc quod protulit terra herbam
          virentem. Sed tamen circa productionem plantarum, aliter opinatur
          Augustinus ab aliis. Alii enim expositores dicunt quod plantae
          productae sunt actu in suis speciebus in hac tertia die, secundum quod
          superficies litterae sonat. Augustinus autem, V Sup. Gen. ad Litt.,
          dicit quod causaliter tunc dictum est produxisse terram herbam et
          lignum, idest producendi accepisse virtutem. Et hoc quidem confirmat
          auctoritate Scripturae. Dicitur enim Gen. II, istae sunt generationes
          caeli et terrae, quando creata sunt, in die quo Deus fecit caelum et
          terram, et omne virgultum agri, antequam oriretur in terra, omnemque
          herbam regionis, priusquam germinaret. Ante ergo quam orirentur super
          terram, factae sunt causaliter in terra. Confirmat autem hoc etiam
          ratione. Quia in illis primis diebus condidit Deus creaturam
          originaliter vel causaliter, a quo opere postmodum requievit, qui
          tamen postmodum, secundum administrationem rerum conditarum per opus
          propagationis, usque modo operatur. Producere autem plantas ex terra,
          ad opus propagationis pertinet. Non ergo in tertia die productae sunt
          plantae in actu, sed causaliter tantum. Quamvis, secundum alios, dici
          possit quod prima institutio specierum ad opera sex dierum pertinet,
          sed quod ex speciebus primo institutis generatio similium in specie
          procedat, hoc iam pertinet ad rerum administrationem. Et hoc est quod
          Scriptura dicit, antequam oriretur super terram, vel antequam
          germinaret; idest, antequam ex similibus similia producerentur, sicut
          nunc naturaliter fieri videmus secundum viam seminationis. Unde
          signanter Scriptura dicit, germinet terra herbam virentem et facientem
          semen, quia scilicet sunt productae perfectae species plantarum, ex
          quibus semina aliarum orirentur. Nec refert ubicumque habeant vim
          seminativam, utrum scilicet in radice, vel in stipite, vel in fructu.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> On the third day, as said (<a
            href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1"
            >Article [1]</a
          >), the formless state of the earth comes to an end. But this state is
          described as twofold. On the one hand, the earth was "invisible" or
          "void," being covered by the waters; on the other hand, it was
          "shapeless" or "empty," that is, without that comeliness which it owes
          to the plants that clothe it, as it were, with a garment. Thus,
          therefore, in either respect this formless state ends on the third
          day: first, when "the waters were gathered together into one place and
          the dry land appeared"; secondly, when "the earth brought forth the
          green herb." But concerning the production of plants, Augustine's
          opinion differs from that of others. For other commentators, in
          accordance with the surface meaning of the text, consider that the
          plants were produced in act in their various species on this third
          day; whereas Augustine (Gen. ad lit. v, 5; viii, 3) says that the
          earth is said to have then produced plants and trees in their causes,
          that is, it received then the power to produce them. He supports this
          view by the authority of Scripture, for it is said (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A4,5"
            >Gn. 2:4,5</a
          >): "These are the generations of the heaven and the earth, when they
          were created, in the day that... God made the heaven and the earth,
          and every plant of the field before it sprung up in the earth, and
          every herb of the ground before it grew." Therefore, the production of
          plants in their causes, within the earth, took place before they
          sprang up from the earth's surface. And this is confirmed by reason,
          as follows. In these first days God created all things in their origin
          or causes, and from this work He subsequently rested. Yet afterwards,
          by governing His creatures, in the work of propagation, "He worketh
          until now."Now the production of plants from out the earth is a work
          of propagation, and therefore they were not produced in act on the
          third day, but in their causes only. However, in accordance with other
          writers, it may be said that the first constitution of species belongs
          to the work of the six days, but the reproduction among them of like
          from like, to the government of the universe. And Scripture indicates
          this in the words, "before it sprung up in the earth," and "before it
          grew," that is, before like was produced from like; just as now
          happens in the natural course by the production of seed. Wherefore
          Scripture says pointedly (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++1%3A11"
            >Gn. 1:11</a
          >): "Let the earth bring forth the green herb, and such as may seed,"
          as indicating the production of perfection of perfect species, from
          which the seed of others should arise. Nor does the question where the
          seminal power may reside, whether in root, stem, or fruit, affect the
          argument.<br />
