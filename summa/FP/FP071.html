              Et videtur quod inconvenienter hoc opus describatur. Illud enim

              virtus aquae non sufficit ad productionem omnium piscium et avium,

              <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that this work is not
              fittingly described. For the waters produce that which the power
              of water suffices to produce. But the power of water does not
              suffice for the production of every kind of fishes and birds since
              we find that many of them are generated from seed. Therefore the
              words, "Let the waters bring forth the creeping creature having
              life, and the fowl that may fly over the earth," do not fittingly
              describe this work.<br />

                  quia corpora eorum naturaliter moventur ad terram; unde et in

                  produced from water only, but earth seems to predominate over
                  water in their composition, as is shown by the fact that their
                  bodies tend naturally to the earth and rest upon it. It is
                  not, then, fittingly that fishes and birds are produced from

                              are more perfect than birds and fishes which
                              appears from the fact that they have more distinct
                              limbs, and generation of a higher order. For they
                              bring forth living beings, whereas birds and

                                      factam; ita in hac quinta die facit
                                      mentionem de aquis et de firmamento caeli,

                                      corresponds to the order of the work of
                                      distinction. Hence, as among the three
                                      days assigned to the work of distinction,
                                      the middle, or second, day is devoted to
                                      the work of distinction of water, which is
                                      the intermediate body, so in the three
                                      days of the work of adornment, the middle
                                      day, which is the fifth, is assigned to
                                      the adornment of the intermediate body, by
                                      the production of birds and fishes. As,
                                      then, Moses makes mention of the lights
                                      and the light on the fourth day, to show
                                      that the fourth day corresponds to the
                                      first day on which he had said that the
                                      light was made, so on this fifth day he
                                      mentions the waters and the firmament of
                                      heaven to show that the fifth day
                                      corresponds to the second. It must,
                                      however, be observed that Augustine
                                      differs from other writers in his opinion
                                      about the production of fishes and birds,
                                      as he differs about the production of
                                      plants. For while others say that fishes
                                      and birds were produced on the fifth day
                                      actually, he holds that the nature of the
                                      waters produced them on that day
                                      potentially.<br />

                                          posuit omnia animalia posse generari
                                          ex aliquali elementorum commixtione
                                          absque semine, etiam per viam naturae.
                                          Sed hoc videtur inconveniens. Quia
                                          natura determinatis mediis procedit ad
                                          suos effectus, unde illa quae
                                          naturaliter generantur ex semine, non
                                          possunt naturaliter sine semine
                                          generari. Et ideo dicendum est aliter,
                                          quod in naturali generatione
                                          animalium, principium activum est
                                          virtus formativa quae est in semine,
                                          in iis quae ex semine generantur; loco
                                          cuius virtutis, in iis quae ex
                                          putrefactione generantur, est virtus
                                          caelestis corporis. Materiale autem
                                          principium in utrorumque animalium
                                          generatione, est aliquod elementum vel
                                          elementatum. In prima autem rerum
                                          institutione, fuit principium activum
                                          verbum Dei, quod ex materia elementari
                                          produxit animalia vel in actu,
                                          secundum alios sanctos; vel virtute,
                                          secundum Augustinum. Non quod aqua aut

                                          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> It
                                          was laid down by Avicenna that animals
                                          of all kinds can be generated by
                                          various minglings of the elements, and
                                          naturally, without any kind of seed.
                                          This, however, seems repugnant to the
                                          fact that nature produces its effects
                                          by determinate means, and
                                          consequently, those things that are
                                          naturally generated from seed cannot
                                          be generated naturally in any other
                                          way. It ought, then, rather to be said
                                          that in the natural generation of all
                                          animals that are generated from seed,
                                          the active principle lies in the
                                          formative power of the seed, but that
                                          in the case of animals generated from
                                          putrefaction, the formative power of
                                          is the influence of the heavenly
                                          bodies. The material principle,
                                          however, in the generation of either
                                          kind of animals, is either some
                                          element, or something compounded of
                                          the elements. But at the first
                                          beginning of the world the active
                                          principle was the Word of God, which
                                          produced animals from material
                                          elements, either in act, as some holy
                                          writers say, or virtually, as
                                          Augustine teaches. Not as though the
                                          power possessed by water or earth of
                                          producing all animals resides in the
                                          earth and the water themselves, as
                                          Avicenna held, but in the power
                                          originally given to the elements of
                                          producing them from elemental matter
                                          by the power of seed or the influence
                                          of the stars.<br />

                                              The bodies of birds and fishes may
                                              be considered from two points of
                                              view. If considered in themselves,
                                              it will be evident that the
                                              earthly element must predominate,
                                              since the element that is least
                                              active, namely, the earth, must be
                                              the most abundant in quantity in
                                              order that the mingling may be
                                              duly tempered in the body of the
                                              animal. But if considered as by
                                              nature constituted to move with
                                              certain specific motions, thus
                                              they have some special affinity
                                              with the bodies in which they
                                              move; and hence the words in which
                                              their generation is described.<br />
