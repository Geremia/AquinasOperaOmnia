          Respondeo dicendum quod in recapitulatione divinorum operum, Scriptura
          sic dicit, igitur perfecti sunt caeli et terra, et omnis ornatus
          eorum. In quibus verbis triplex opus intelligi potest, scilicet opus
          creationis, per quod caelum et terra producta leguntur, sed informia.
          Et opus distinctionis, per quod caelum et terra sunt perfecta, sive
          per formas substantiales attributas materiae omnino informi, ut
          Augustinus vult; sive quantum ad convenientem decorem et ordinem, ut
          alii sancti dicunt. Et his duobus operibus additur ornatus. Et differt
          ornatus a perfectione. Nam perfectio caeli et terrae ad ea pertinere
          videtur quae caelo et terrae sunt intrinseca, ornatus vero ad ea quae
          sunt a caelo et terra distincta. Sicut homo perficitur per proprias
          partes et formas, ornatur autem per vestimenta, vel aliquid huiusmodi.
          Distinctio autem aliquorum maxime manifestatur per motum localem, quo
          ab invicem separantur. Et ideo ad opus ornatus pertinet productio
          illarum rerum quae habent motum in caelo et in terra. Sicut autem
          supra dictum est, de tribus fit mentio in creatione, scilicet de caelo
          et aqua et terra. Et haec tria etiam formantur per opus distinctionis
          tribus diebus, primo die, caelum; secundo die distinguuntur aquae;
          tertio die fit distinctio in terra, maris et aridae. Et similiter in
          opere ornatus, primo die, qui est quartus, producuntur luminaria, quae
          moventur in caelo, ad ornatum ipsius. Secundo die, qui est quintus,
          aves et pisces, ad ornatum medii elementi, quia habent motum in aere
          et aqua, quae pro uno accipiuntur. Tertio die, qui est sextus,
          producuntur animalia quae habent motum in terra, ad ornatum ipsius.
          Sed sciendum est quod in productione luminarium non discordat
          Augustinus ab aliis sanctis. Dicit enim luminaria esse facta in actu,
          non in virtute tantum, non enim habet firmamentum virtutem productivam
          luminarium, sicut habet terra virtutem productivam plantarum. Unde
          Scriptura non dicit, producat firmamentum luminaria; sicut dicit,
          germinet terra herbam virentem.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> In recapitulating the Divine works,
          Scripture says (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Gn++2%3A1"
            >Gn. 2:1</a
          >): "So the heavens and the earth were finished and all the furniture
          of them," thereby indicating that the work was threefold. In the first
          work, that of "creation," the heaven and the earth were produced, but
          as yet without form. In the second, or work of "distinction," the
          heaven and the earth were perfected, either by adding substantial form
          to formless matter, as Augustine holds (Gen. ad lit. ii, 11), or by
          giving them the order and beauty due to them, as other holy writers
          suppose. To these two works is added the work of adornment, which is
          distinct from perfect. For the perfection of the heaven and the earth
          regards, seemingly, those things that belong to them intrinsically,
          but the adornment, those that are extrinsic, just as the perfection of
          a man lies in his proper parts and forms, and his adornment, in
          clothing or such like. Now just as distinction of certain things is
          made most evident by their local movement, as separating one from
          another; so the work of adornment is set forth by the production of
          things having movement in the heavens, and upon the earth. But it has
          been stated above (<a href="FP069.html#FPQ69OUTP1">Question [69]</a>,
          <a href="FP069.html#FPQ69A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), that three things
          are recorded as created, namely, the heaven, the water, and the earth;
          and these three received their form from the three days' work of
          distinction, so that heaven was formed on the first day; on the second
          day the waters were separated; and on the third day, the earth was
          divided into sea and dry land. So also is it in the work of adornment;
          on the first day of this work, which is the fourth of creation, are
          produced the lights, to adorn the heaven by their movements; on the
          second day, which is the fifth, birds and fishes are called into
          being, to make beautiful the intermediate element, for they move in
          air and water, which are here taken as one; while on the third day,
          which is the sixth, animals are brought forth, to move upon the earth
          and adorn it. It must also here be noted that Augustine's opinion
          (Gen. ad lit. v, 5) on the production of lights is not at variance
          with that of other holy writers, since he says that they were made
          actually, and not merely virtually, for the firmament has not the
          power of producing lights, as the earth has of producing plants.
          Wherefore Scripture does not say: "Let the firmament produce lights,"
          though it says: "Let the earth bring forth the green herb."<br />

          collationem determinatae virtutis. Ideo tamen non fit mentio a
          principio de eis, sed solum quarta die, ut Chrysostomus dicit, ut per
          hoc removeat populum ab idololatria, ostendens luminaria non esse

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> In Augustine's opinion there is no
          difficulty here; for he does not hold a succession of time in these
          works, and so there was no need for the matter of the lights to exist
          under another form. Nor is there any difficulty in the opinion of
          those who hold the heavenly bodies to be of the nature of the four
          elements, for it may be said that they were formed out of matter
          already existing, as animals and plants were formed. For those,
          however, who hold the heavenly bodies to be of another nature from the
          elements, and naturally incorruptible, the answer must be that the
          lights were substantially created at the beginning, but that their
          substance, at first formless, is formed on this day, by receiving not
          its substantial form, but a determination of power. As to the fact
          that the lights are not mentioned as existing from the beginning, but
          only as made on the fourth day, Chrysostom (Hom. vi in Gen.) explains
          this by the need of guarding the people from the danger of idolatry:
          since the lights are proved not to be gods, by the fact that they were
          not from the beginning.<br />

          facta intelligitur lux corporalis, oportet dicere quod lux primo die
          fuit producta secundum communem lucis naturam, quarto autem die
          attributa est luminaribus determinata virtus ad determinatos effectus;
          secundum quod videmus alios effectus habere radium solis, et alios
          radium lunae, et sic de aliis. Et propter hanc determinationem
          virtutis, dicit Dionysius, IV cap. de Div. Nom., quod lumen solis,

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> No difficulty exists if we follow
          Augustine in holding the light made on the first day to be spiritual,
          and that made on this day to be corporeal. If, however, the light made
          on the first day is understood to be itself corporeal, then it must be
          held to have been produced on that day merely as light in general; and
          that on the fourth day the lights received a definite power to produce
          determinate effects. Thus we observe that the rays of the sun have one
          effect, those of the moon another, and so forth. Hence, speaking of
          such a determination of power, Dionysius (Div. Nom. iv) says that the
          sun's light which previously was without form, was formed on the
          fourth day.<br />

          Chrysostomus dicit quod non ideo dicitur quod posuit ea in firmamento,

          hominem in Paradiso, ut ibi esset. Sed secundum opinionem Aristotelis,

          According to Ptolemy the heavenly luminaries are not fixed in the
          spheres, but have their own movement distinct from the movement of the
          spheres. Wherefore Chrysostom says (Hom. vi in Gen.) that He is said
          to have set them in the firmament, not because He fixed them there
          immovably, but because He bade them to be there, even as He placed man
          in Paradise, to be there. In the opinion of Aristotle, however, the
          stars are fixed in their orbits, and in reality have no other movement
          but that of the spheres; and yet our senses perceive the movement of
          the luminaries and not that of the spheres (De Coel. ii, text. 43).
          But Moses describes what is obvious to sense, out of condescension to
          popular ignorance, as we have already said (<a

          however, falls to the ground if we regard the firmament made on the
          second day as having a natural distinction from that in which the
          stars are placed, even though the distinction is not apparent to the
          senses, the testimony of which Moses follows, as stated above (De
          Coel. ii, text. 43). For although to the senses there appears but one
          firmament; if we admit a higher and a lower firmament, the lower will
          be that which was made on the second day, and on the fourth the stars
          were fixed in the higher firmament.<br />

          In the words of Basil (Hom. v in Hexaem.), plants were recorded as
          produced before the sun and moon, to prevent idolatry, since those who
          believe the heavenly bodies to be gods, hold that plants originate
          primarily from these bodies. Although as Chrysostom remarks (Hom. vi

          As Chrysostom says, the two lights are called great, not so much with
          regard to their dimensions as to their influence and power. For though
          the stars be of greater bulk than the moon, yet the influence of the
          moon is more perceptible to the senses in this lower world. Moreover,
          as far as the senses are concerned, its apparent size is greater.<br />

          creature can be considered as made either for the sake of its proper

          glory of God. Of these reasons only that which points out the
          usefulness of these things to man, is touched upon by Moses, in order
          to withdraw his people from idolatry. Hence it is written (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Dt++4%3A19"
            >Dt. 4:19</a

          the moon and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou
          adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service
          of all nations." Now, he explains this service at the beginning of
          Genesis as threefold. First, the lights are of service to man, in
          regard to sight, which directs him in his works, and is most useful
          for perceiving objects. In reference to this he says: "Let them shine
          in the firmament and give life to the earth." Secondly, as regards the
          changes of the seasons, which prevent weariness, preserve health, and
          provide for the necessities of food; all of which things could not be
          secured if it were always summer or winter. In reference to this he
          says: "Let them be for seasons, and for days, and years." Thirdly, as
          regards the convenience of business and work, in so far as the lights
          are set in the heavens to indicate fair or foul weather, as favorable
          to various occupations. And in this respect he says: "Let them be for

          When the moon is at its perfection it rises in the evening and sets in

          intrinsic to the heavenly bodies: and consequently they are living
          beings.<br />

          Respondeo dicendum quod circa istam quaestionem apud philosophos fuit
          diversa opinio. Anaxagoras enim, ut Augustinus refert Lib. XVIII de
          Civ. Dei, factus est reus apud Athenienses, quia dixit solem esse
          lapidem ardentem, negans utique ipsum esse Deum, vel aliquid animatum.
          Platonici vero posuerunt corpora caelestia animata. Similiter etiam
          apud doctores fidei, fuit circa hoc diversa opinio. Origenes enim
          posuit corpora caelestia animata. Hieronymus etiam idem sentire
          videtur, exponens illud Eccle. I, lustrans universa, per circuitum
          pergit spiritus. Basilius vero et Damascenus asserunt corpora
          caelestia non esse animata. Augustinus vero sub dubio dereliquit, in
          neutram partem declinans, ut patet in II supra Gen. ad Litt.; et in
          Enchirid., ubi etiam dicit quod, si sunt animata caelestia corpora,
          pertinent ad societatem Angelorum eorum animae.

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Philosophers have differed on this
          question. Anaxagoras, for instance, as Augustine mentions (De Civ. Dei
          xviii, 41), "was condemned by the Athenians for teaching that the sun
          was a fiery mass of stone, and neither a god nor even a living being."
          On the other hand, the Platonists held that the heavenly bodies have
          life. Nor was there less diversity of opinion among the Doctors of the
          Church. It was the belief of Origen (Peri Archon i) and Jerome that
          these bodies were alive, and the latter seems to explain in that sense
          the words (<a
            href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Eccles++1%3A6"
            >Eccles. 1:6</a
          >), "The spirit goeth forward, surveying all places round about." But
          Basil (Hom. iii, vi in Hexaem.) and Damascene (De Fide Orth. ii)
          maintain that the heavenly bodies are inanimate. Augustine leaves the
          matter in doubt, without committing himself to either theory, though
          he goes so far as to say that if the heavenly bodies are really living
          beings, their souls must be akin to the angelic nature (Gen. ad lit.
          ii, 18; Enchiridion lviii).<br />

          In hac autem opinionum diversitate, ut veritas aliquatenus innotescat,
          considerandum est quod unio animae et corporis non est propter corpus,
          sed propter animam, non enim forma est propter materiam, sed e
          converso. Natura autem et virtus animae deprehenditur ex eius
          operatione, quae etiam quodammodo est finis eius. Invenitur autem
          corpus necessarium ad aliquam operationem animae, quae mediante
          corpore exercetur; sicut patet in operibus animae sensitivae et
          nutritivae. Unde necesse est tales animas unitas esse corporibus
          propter suas operationes. Est autem aliqua operatio animae, quae non
          exercetur corpore mediante, sed tamen ex corpore aliquod adminiculum
          tali operationi exhibetur; sicut per corpus exhibentur animae humanae
          phantasmata, quibus indiget ad intelligendum. Unde etiam talem animam
          necesse est corpori uniri propter suam operationem, licet contingat
          ipsam separari. Manifestum est autem quod anima caelestis corporis non
          potest habere operationes nutritivae animae, quae sunt nutrire, augere
          et generare, huiusmodi enim operationes non competunt corpori
          incorruptibili per naturam. Similiter etiam nec operationes animae
          sensitivae corpori caelesti conveniunt, quia omnes sensus fundantur
          super tactum, qui est apprehensivus qualitatum elementarium. Omnia
          etiam organa potentiarum sensitivarum requirunt determinatam
          proportionem secundum commixtionem aliquam elementorum, a quorum
          natura corpora caelestia ponuntur remota. Relinquitur ergo quod de
          operationibus animae nulla potest competere animae caelesti nisi duae,
          intelligere et movere, nam appetere consequitur sensum et intellectum,
          et cum utroque ordinatur. Intellectualis autem operatio, cum non
          exerceatur per corpus, non indiget corpore nisi inquantum ei per
          sensus ministrantur phantasmata. Operationes autem sensitivae animae
          corporibus caelestibus non conveniunt, ut dictum est. Sic igitur
          propter operationem intellectualem, anima caelesti corpori non
          uniretur. Relinquitur ergo quod propter solam motionem. Ad hoc autem
          quod moveat, non oportet quod uniatur ei ut forma; sed per contactum
          virtutis, sicut motor unitur mobili. Unde Aristoteles, libro VIII
          Physic., postquam ostendit quod primum movens seipsum componitur ex
          duabus partibus, quarum una est movens et alia mota; assignans quomodo
          hae duae partes uniantur, dicit quod per contactum vel duorum ad
          invicem, si utrumque sit corpus, vel unius ad alterum et non e
          converso, si unum sit corpus et aliud non corpus. Platonici etiam
          animas corporibus uniri non ponebant nisi per contactum virtutis,
          sicut motor mobili. Et sic per hoc quod Plato ponit corpora caelestia
          animata, nihil aliud datur intelligi, quam quod substantiae
          spirituales uniuntur corporibus caelestibus ut motores mobilibus. Quod
          autem corpora caelestia moveantur ab aliqua substantia apprehendente,
          et non solum a natura, sicut gravia et levia, patet ex hoc, quod
          natura non movet nisi ad unum, quo habito quiescit, quod in motu
          corporum caelestium non apparet. Unde relinquitur quod moventur ab
          aliqua substantia apprehendente Augustinus etiam dicit, III de Trin.,
          corpora omnia administrari a Deo per spiritum vitae.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          In examining the truth of this question, where such diversity of
          opinion exists, we shall do well to bear in mind that the union of
          soul and body exists for the sake of the soul and not of the body; for
          the form does not exist for the matter, but the matter for the form.
          Now the nature and power of the soul are apprehended through its
          operation, which is to a certain extent its end. Yet for some of these
          operations, as sensation and nutrition, our body is a necessary
          instrument. Hence it is clear that the sensitive and nutritive souls
          must be united to a body in order to exercise their functions. There
          are, however, operations of the soul, which are not exercised through
          the medium of the body, though the body ministers, as it were, to
          their production. The intellect, for example, makes use of the
          phantasms derived from the bodily senses, and thus far is dependent on
          the body, although capable of existing apart from it. It is not,
          however, possible that the functions of nutrition, growth, and
          generation, through which the nutritive soul operates, can be
          exercised by the heavenly bodies, for such operations are incompatible
          with a body naturally incorruptible. Equally impossible is it that the
          functions of the sensitive soul can appertain to the heavenly body,
          since all the senses depend on the sense of touch, which perceives
          elemental qualities, and all the organs of the senses require a
          certain proportion in the admixture of elements, whereas the nature of
          the heavenly bodies is not elemental. It follows, then, that of the
          operations of the soul the only ones left to be attributed to the
          heavenly bodies are those of understanding and moving; for appetite
          follows both sensitive and intellectual perception, and is in
          proportion thereto. But the operations of the intellect, which does
          not act through the body, do not need a body as their instrument,
          except to supply phantasms through the senses. Moreover, the
          operations of the sensitive soul, as we have seen, cannot be
          attributed to the heavenly bodies. Accordingly, the union of a soul to
          a heavenly body cannot be for the purpose of the operations of the
          intellect. It remains, then, only to consider whether the movement of
          the heavenly bodies demands a soul as the motive power, not that the
          soul, in order to move the heavenly body, need be united to the latter
          as its form; but by contact of power, as a mover is united to that
          which he moves. Wherefore Aristotle (Phys. viii, text. 42,43), after
          showing that the first mover is made up of two parts, the moving and
          the moved, goes on to show the nature of the union between these two
          parts. This, he says, is effected by contact which is mutual if both
          are bodies; on the part of one only, if one is a body and the other
          not. The Platonists explain the union of soul and body in the same
          way, as a contact of a moving power with the object moved, and since
          Plato holds the heavenly bodies to be living beings, this means
          nothing else but that substances of spiritual nature are united to
          them, and act as their moving power. A proof that the heavenly bodies
          are moved by the direct influence and contact of some spiritual
          substance, and not, like bodies of specific gravity, by nature, lies
          in the fact that whereas nature moves to one fixed end which having
          attained, it rests; this does not appear in the movement of heavenly
          bodies. Hence it follows that they are moved by some intellectual
          substances. Augustine appears to be of the same opinion when he
          expresses his belief that all corporeal things are ruled by God
          through the spirit of life (De Trin. iii, 4).<br />
