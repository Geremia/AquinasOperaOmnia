          speciem. Unde quaecumque accidentia consequuntur naturam speciei, in

          operatione naturae, qui in statu innocentiae non fuisset. In
          accidentibus autem individualibus non est necesse quod filii
          parentibus similentur. Iustitia autem originalis, in qua primus homo
          conditus fuit, fuit accidens naturae speciei, non quasi ex principiis
          speciei causatum, sed sicut quoddam donum divinitus datum toti
          naturae. Et hoc apparet, quia opposita sunt unius generis, peccatum
          autem originale, quod opponitur illi iustitiae, dicitur esse peccatum
          naturae; unde traducitur a parente in posteros. Et propter hoc etiam

          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Man naturally begets a specific likeness
          to himself. Hence whatever accidental qualities result from the nature
          of the species, must be alike in parent and child, unless nature fails
          in its operation, which would not have occurred in the state of
          innocence. But individual accidents do not necessarily exist alike in
          parent and child. Now original righteousness, in which the first man
          was created, was an accident pertaining to the nature of the species,
          not as caused by the principles of the species, but as a gift
          conferred by God on the entire human nature. This is clear from the
          fact that opposites are of the same genus; and original sin, which is
          opposed to original righteousness, is called the sin of nature,
          wherefore it is transmitted from the parent to the offspring; and for
          this reason also, the children would have been assimilated to their
          parents as regards original righteousness.<br />

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Some say that children would have
          been born, not with the righteousness of grace, which is the principle
          of merit, but with original righteousness. But since the root of
          original righteousness, which conferred righteousness on the first man
          when he was made, consists in the supernatural subjection of the
          reason to God, which subjection results from sanctifying grace, as
          above explained (<a href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a>,
          <a href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>), we must conclude
          that if children were born in original righteousness, they would also
          have been born in grace; thus we have said above that the first man
          was created in grace (<a href="FP095.html#FPQ95OUTP1">Question [95]</a
          >, <a href="FP095.html#FPQ95A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). This grace,
          however, would not have been natural, for it would not have been
          transfused by virtue of the semen; but would have been conferred on
          man immediately on his receiving a rational soul. In the same way the
          rational soul, which is not transmitted by the parent, is infused by
          God as soon as the human body is apt to receive it.<br />

          righteousness. For it is clear that at their birth they would not have
          had greater perfection than their parents at the time of begetting.
          Now the parents, as long as they begot children, would not have been
          confirmed in righteousness. For the rational creature is confirmed in
          righteousness through the beatitude given by the clear vision of God;
          and when once it has seen God, it cannot but cleave to Him Who is the
          essence of goodness, wherefrom no one can turn away, since nothing is
          desired or loved but under the aspect of good. I say this according to
          the general law; for it may be otherwise in the case of special
          privilege, such as we believe was granted to the Virgin Mother of God.
          And as soon as Adam had attained to that happy state of seeing God in
          His Essence, he would have become spiritual in soul and body; and his
          animal life would have ceased, wherein alone there is generation.

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> If Adam had not sinned, he would
          not have begotten "children of hell" in the sense that they would
          contract from him sin which is the cause of hell: yet by sinning of
          their own free-will they could have become "children of hell." If,
          however, they did not become "children of hell" by falling into sin,
          this would not have been owing to their being confirmed in
          righteousness, but to Divine Providence preserving them free from
          sin.<br />

          Ad secundum dicendum quod Anselmus hoc non dicit asserendo, sed
          opinando. Quod patet ex ipso modo loquendi, cum dicit, videtur quod,

          <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Anselm does not say this by way of
          assertion, but only as an opinion, which is clear from his mode of

          Ad tertium dicendum quod ratio ista non est efficax, quamvis per eam
          Anselmus motus fuisse videatur, ut ex eius verbis apparet. Non enim
          sic per peccatum primi parentis eius posteri necessitatem peccandi
          incurrunt, ut ad iustitiam redire non possint, quod est tantum in
          damnatis. Unde nec ita necessitatem non peccandi transmisisset ad
          posteros, quod omnino peccare non possent, quod est tantum in beatis.

          This argument is not conclusive, though Anselm seems to have been
          influenced by it, as appears from his words above quoted. For the
          necessity of sin incurred by the descendants would not have been such
          that they could not return to righteousness, which is the case only
          with the damned. Wherefore neither would the parents have transmitted
          to their descendants the necessity of not sinning, which is only in
          the blessed.<br />

          There is no comparison between man and the angels; for man's free-will
          is changeable, both before and after choice; whereas the angel's is
          not changeable, as we have said above in treating of the angels (<a
