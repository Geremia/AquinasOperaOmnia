          belief in matters which are above nature, we rely on authority alone;
          and so, when authority is wanting, we must be guided by the ordinary
          course of nature. Now it is natural for man to acquire knowledge

          operation; and this would not be so if the soul were endowed at birth
          with knowledge not acquired through the sensitive powers. We must
          conclude then, that, in the state of innocence, children would not
          have been born with perfect knowledge; but in course of time they

          powers hampered, man has not the perfect use of reason, as we see in
          those who are asleep or delirious. Now the sensitive powers are
          situate in corporeal organs; and therefore, so long as the latter are
