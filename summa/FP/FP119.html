          <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> According to the Philosopher (Metaph.
          ii), "The relation of a thing to truth is the same as its relation to
          being." Therefore that belongs to the true nature of any thing which
          enters into the constitution of that nature. But nature can be
          considered in two ways: firstly, in general according to the species;
          secondly, as in the individual. And whereas the form and the common
          matter belong to a thing's true nature considered in general;
          individual signate matter, and the form individualized by that matter
          belong to the true nature considered in this particular individual.
          Thus a soul and body belong to the true human nature in general, but
          to the true human nature of Peter and Martin belong this soul and this

          Now there are certain things whose form cannot exist but in one

          the human form cannot exist but in a certain individual matter, which,
          they said, was given that form at the very beginning in the first man.
          So that whatever may have been added to that which was derived by

          Sed haec positio est multipliciter irrationabilis. Primo quidem, quia
          eiusdem rationis est quod aliqua forma possit fieri in alia materia,
          et quod possit propriam materiam deserere, et ideo omnia generabilia
          sunt corruptibilia, et e converso. Manifestum est autem quod forma
          humana potest deficere ab hac materia quae ei subiicitur, alioquin
          corpus humanum corruptibile non esset. Unde relinquitur quod et alii
          materiae advenire possit, aliquo alio in veritatem humanae naturae
          transeunte. Secundo, quia in omnibus quorum materia invenitur tota sub
          uno individuo, non est nisi unum individuum in una specie, sicut patet
          in sole et luna, et huiusmodi. Sic igitur non esset nisi unum
          individuum humanae speciei. Tertio, quia non est possibile quod
          multiplicatio materiae attendatur nisi vel secundum quantitatem
          tantum, sicut accidit in rarefactis, quorum materia suscipit maiores
          dimensiones; vel etiam secundum substantiam materiae. Sola autem eadem
          substantia materiae manente, non potest dici quod sit multiplicata,
          quia idem ad seipsum non constituit multitudinem, cum necesse sit
          omnem multitudinem ex aliqua divisione causari. Unde oportet quod
          aliqua alia substantia materiae adveniat, vel per creationem, vel per
          conversionem alterius in ipsam. Unde relinquitur quod non potest
          aliqua materia multiplicari, nisi vel per rarefactionem, sicut cum ex
          aqua fit aer; vel per conversionem alterius rei, sicut multiplicatur
          ignis per additionem lignorum; vel per creationem materiae. Sed
          manifestum est multiplicationem materiae in humanis corporibus non
          accidere per rarefactionem, quia sic corpora hominum perfectae aetatis
          essent imperfectiora quam corpora puerorum. Nec iterum per creationem
          novae materiae, quia secundum Gregorium, omnia sunt simul creata
          secundum substantiam materiae, licet non secundum speciem formae. Unde
          relinquitur quod multiplicatio corporis humani non fit nisi per hoc,
          quod alimentum convertitur in veritatem humani corporis. Quarto, quia
          cum homo non differat ab animalibus et plantis secundum animam
          vegetabilem, sequeretur quod etiam corpora animalium et plantarum non
          multiplicarentur per conversionem alimenti in corpus nutritum, sed per
          quandam multiplicationem. Quae non potest esse naturalis, cum materia
          secundum naturam non extendatur nisi usque ad certam quantitatem; nec
          iterum inveniatur aliquid naturaliter crescere, nisi per
          rarefactionem, vel conversionem alterius in ipsum. Et sic totum opus
          generativae et nutritivae, quae dicuntur vires naturales, esset
          miraculosum. Quod est omnino inconveniens.
        </td>
        <td style="text-align: justify">
          But this is unreasonable in many ways. Firstly, because it comes to
          the same that a form can be produced in another matter, or that it can
          cease to be in its proper matter; wherefore all things that can be
          generated are corruptible, and conversely. Now it is manifest that the
          human form can cease to exist in this (particular) matter which is its
          subject: else the human body would not be corruptible. Consequently it
          can begin to exist in another matter, so that something else be
          changed into true human nature. Secondly, because in all beings whose
          entire matter is contained in one individual there is only one
          individual in the species: as is clearly the case with the sun, moon
          and such like. Thus there would only be one individual of the human
          species. Thirdly, because multiplication of matter cannot be
          understood otherwise than either in respect of quantity only, as in
          things which are rarefied, so that their matter increases in
          dimensions; or in respect of the substance itself of the matter. But
          as long as the substance alone of matter remains, it cannot be said to
          be multiplied; for multitude cannot consist in the addition of a thing
          to itself, since of necessity it can only result from division.
          Therefore some other substance must be added to matter, either by
          creation, or by something else being changed into it. Consequently no
          matter can be multiplied save either by rarefaction as when air is
          made from water; or by the change of some other things, as fire is
          multiplied by the addition of wood; or lastly by creation. Now it is
          manifest that the multiplication of matter in the human body does not
          occur by rarefaction: for thus the body of a man of perfect age would
          be more imperfect than the body of a child. Nor does it occur by
          creation of flesh matter: for, according to Gregory (Moral. xxxii):
          "All things were created together as to the substance of matter, but
          not as to the specific form." Consequently the multiplication of the
          human body can only be the result of the food being changed into the
          true human nature. Fourthly, because, since man does not differ from
          animals and plants in regard to the vegetative soul, it would follow
          that the bodies of animals and plants do not increase through a change
          of nourishment into the body so nourished, but through some kind of
          multiplication. Which multiplication cannot be natural: since the
          matter cannot naturally extend beyond a certain fixed quantity; nor
          again does anything increase naturally, save either by rarefaction or
          the change of something else into it. Consequently the whole process
          of generation and nourishment, which are called "natural forces,"
          would be miraculous. Which is altogether inadmissible.<br />

          sibi simile secundum individuum; quae quidem virtus in corporibus
          viventibus est virtus nutritiva. Nihil ergo per virtutem nutritivam
          adderetur corporibus viventibus, si alimentum in veritatem naturae
          ipsorum non converteretur. Secundo quia virtus activa quae est in
          semine, est quaedam impressio derivata ab anima generantis, sicut
          supra dictum est. Unde non potest esse maioris virtutis in agendo,
          quam ipsa anima a qua derivatur. Si ergo ex virtute seminis vere
          assumit aliqua materia formam naturae humanae, multo magis anima in
          nutrimentum coniunctum poterit veram formam naturae humanae imprimere
          per potentiam nutritivam. Tertio, quia nutrimento indigetur non solum
          ad augmentum, alioquin terminato augmento necessarium non esset, sed
          etiam ad restaurandum illud quod deperditur per actionem caloris
          naturalis. Non autem esset restauratio, nisi id quod ex alimento
          generatur, succederet in locum deperditi. Unde sicut id quod primo
          inerat, est de veritate humanae naturae, ita et id quod ex alimento
          generatur.

        <td style="text-align: justify">
          Wherefore others have said that the human form can indeed begin to
          exist in some other matter, if we consider the human nature in
          general: but not if we consider it as in this individual. For in the
          individual the form remains confined to a certain determinate matter,
          on which it is first imprinted at the generation of that individual,
          so that it never leaves that matter until the ultimate dissolution of
          the individual. And this matter, say they, principally belongs to the
          true human nature. But since this matter does not suffice for the
          requisite quantity, some other matter must be added, through the
          change of food into the substance of the individual partaking thereof,
          in such a quantity as suffices for the increase required. And this
          matter, they state, belongs secondarily to the true human nature:
          because it is not required for the primary existence of the
          individual, but for the quantity due to him. And if anything further
          is produced from the food, this does not belong to true human nature,
          properly speaking. However, this also is inadmissible. First, because
          this opinion judges of living bodies as of inanimate bodies; in which,
          although there be a power of generating their like in species, there
          is not the power of generating their like in the individual; which
          power in living bodies is the nutritive power. Nothing, therefore,
          would be added to living bodies by their nutritive power, if their
          food were not changed into their true nature. Secondly, because the
          active seminal power is a certain impression derived from the soul of
          the begetter, as stated above (<a href="FP118.html#FPQ118OUTP1"
            >Question [118]</a
          >, <a href="FP118.html#FPQ118A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>). Hence it
          cannot have a greater power in acting, than the soul from which it is
          derived. If, therefore, by the seminal power a certain matter truly
          assumes the form of human nature, much more can the soul, by the
          nutritive power, imprint the true form of human nature on the food
          which is assimilated. Thirdly, because food is needed not only for
          growth, else at the term of growth, food would be needful no longer;
          but also to renew that which is lost by the action of natural heat.
          But there would be no renewal, unless what is formed from the food,
          took the place of what is lost. Wherefore just as that which was there
          previously belonged to true human nature, so also does that which is
          formed from the food.<br />

          By flesh belonging to the species, some have understood that which
          first receives the human species, which is derived from the begetter:
          this, they say, lasts as long as the individual does. By flesh
          belonging to the matter these understand what is generated from food:
          and this, they say, does not always remain, but as it comes so it
          goes. But this is contrary to the mind of Aristotle. For he says
          there, that "just as in things which have their species in matter"—for
          instance, wood or stone—"so in flesh, there is something belonging to
          the species, and something belonging to matter." Now it is clear that
          this distinction has no place in inanimate things, which are not
          generated seminally, or nourished. Again, since what is generated from
          food is united to, by mixing with, the body so nourished, just as
          water is mixed with wine, as the Philosopher says there by way of
          example: that which is added, and that to which it is added, cannot be
          different natures, since they are already made one by being mixed
          together. Therefore there is no reason for saying that one is
          destroyed by natural heat, while the other remains.<br />

          It must therefore be said that this distinction of the Philosopher is
          not of different kinds of flesh, but of the same flesh considered from
          different points of view. For if we consider the flesh according to
          the species, that is, according to that which is formed therein, thus
          it remains always: because the nature of flesh always remains together
          with its natural disposition. But if we consider flesh according to
          matter, then it does not remain, but is gradually destroyed and
          renewed: thus in the fire of a furnace, the form of fire remains, but
          the matter is gradually consumed, and other matter is substituted in

          Every virtue of a passible body is weakened by continuous action,
          because such agents are also patient. Therefore the transforming
          virtue is strong at first so as to be able to transform not only
          enough for the renewal of what is lost, but also for growth. Later on
          it can only transform enough for the renewal of what is lost, and then
          growth ceases. At last it cannot even do this; and then begins
          decline. In fine, when this virtue fails altogether, the animal dies.
          Thus the virtue of wine that transforms the water added to it, is
          weakened by further additions of water, so as to become at length
          watery, as the Philosopher says by way of example (De Gener. i, 5).<br />

          the form communicated to it. Now it belongs to the natural order that
          a thing should be reduced from potentiality to act gradually: hence in
          things generated we observe that at first each is imperfect and is
          afterwards perfected. But it is clear that the common is to the proper
          and determinate, as imperfect is to perfect: therefore we see that in
          the generation of an animal, the animal is generated first, then the
          man or the horse. So therefore food first of all receives a certain
          common virtue in regard to all the parts of the body, which virtue is
          subsequently determinate to this or that part.<br />

          Now it is not possible that the semen be a kind of solution from what
          is already transformed into the substance of the members. For this
          solution, if it does not retain the nature of the member it is taken
          from, it would no longer be of the nature of the begetter, and would
          be due to a process of corruption; and consequently it would not have
          the power of transforming something else into the likeness of that
          nature. But if it retained the nature of the member it is taken from,
          then, since it is limited to a certain part of the body, it would not
          have the power of moving towards (the production of) the whole nature,
          but only the nature of that part. Unless one were to say that the
          solution is taken from all the parts of the body, and that it retains
          the nature of each part. Thus the semen would be a small animal in
          act; and generation of animal from animal would be a mere division, as
          mud is generated from mud, and as animals which continue to live after
          being cut in two: which is inadmissible.<br />

          It remains to be said, therefore, that the semen is not something
          separated from what was before the actual whole; rather is it the
          whole, though potentially, having the power, derived from the soul of
          the begetter, to produce the whole body, as stated above (<a
            href="FP119.html#FPQ119A1THEP1"

          in potentiality to the whole, is that which is generated from the
          food, before it is transformed into the substance of the members.
          Therefore the semen is taken from this. In this sense the nutritive
          power is said to serve the generative power: because what is
          transformed by the nutritive power is employed as semen by the
          generative power. A sign of this, according to the Philosopher, is
          that animals of great size, which require much food, have little semen
          in proportion to the size of their bodies, and generated seldom; in
          like manner fat men, and for the same reason.<br />

          The likeness of the begetter to the begotten is on account not of the
          matter, but of the form of the agent that generates its like.
          Wherefore in order for a man to be like his grandfather, there is no
          need that the corporeal seminal matter should have been in the
          grandfather; but that there be in the semen a virtue derived from the
          soul of the grandfather through the father.

          These words of Augustine are not to be understood as though the
          immediate seminal virtue, or the corporeal substance from which this
          individual was formed were actually in Adam: but so that both were in
          Adam as in principle. For even the corporeal matter, which is supplied
          by the mother, and which he calls the corporeal substance, is
          originally derived from Adam: and likewise the active seminal power of
          the father, which is the immediate seminal virtue (in the production)
          of this man.<br />

          But Christ is said to have been in Adam according to the "corporeal

          Mother, was derived from Adam; whereas the active virtue was not
          derived from Adam, because His Body was not formed by the seminal
