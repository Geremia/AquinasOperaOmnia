    APPENDIX 2<br />
    <br />
    TWO ARTICLES ON PURGATORY<br />
    <br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <br />
  <h3 align="left">Whether there is a Purgatory after this life?<br /></h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that there is not a Purgatory after
    this life. For it is said (<a
      href="http://drbo.org/cgi-bin/s?b=drl&amp;q=Rev+++14%3A13"
      >Apoc. 14:13</a
    >): "Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord. From henceforth now, saith
    the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors." Therefore after this life
    no cleansing labor awaits those who die in the Lord, nor those who do not
    die in the Lord, since they cannot be cleansed. Therefore there is no
    Purgatory after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> Further, as charity is to an eternal reward, so
    is mortal sin to eternal punishment. Now those who die in mortal sin are
    forthwith consigned to eternal punishment. Therefore those who die in
    charity go at once to their reward; and consequently no Purgatory awaits
    them after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, God Who is supremely merciful is more
    inclined to reward good than to punish evil. Now just as those who are in
    the state of charity, do certain evil things which are not deserving of
    eternal punishment, so those who are in mortal sin, at times perform
    actions, generically good, which are not deserving of an eternal reward.
    Therefore since these good actions are not rewarded after this life in those
    who will be damned, neither should those evil actions be punished after this
    life. Hence the same conclusion follows.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> It is said (2 Macc. 12:46): "It is a holy and
    wholesome thought to pray for the dead, that they may be loosed from sins."
    Now there is no need to pray for the dead who are in heaven, for they are in
    no need; nor again for those who are in hell, because they cannot be loosed
    from sins. Therefore after this life, there are some not yet loosed from
    sins, who can be loosed therefrom; and the like have charity, without which
    sins cannot be loosed, for "charity covereth all sins" [*Prov. 10:12]. Hence
    they will not be consigned to everlasting death, since "he that liveth and
    believeth in Me, shall not die for ever" [*Jn. 11:26]: nor will they obtain
    glory without being cleansed, because nothing unclean shall obtain it, as
    stated in the last chapter of the Apocalypse (verse 14). Therefore some kind
    of cleansing remains after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, Gregory of Nyssa [*De iis qui in fide dormiunt] says: "If one who
    loves and believes in Christ," has failed to wash away his sins in this
    life, "he is set free after death by the fire of Purgatory." Therefore there
    remains some kind of cleansing after this life.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> From the conclusions we have drawn above (<a
      href="../TP.html"
      >TP</a
    >, <a href="../TP/TP086.html#TPQ86OUTP1">Question [86]</a>,
    <a href="../TP/TP086.html#TPQ86ATHEP1">Articles [4]</a>,5;
    <a href="../XP.html">XP</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP012.html#XPQ12OUTP1">Question [12]</a>,
    <a href="../XP/XP012.html#XPQ12A1THEP1">Article [1]</a>) it is sufficiently
    clear that there is a Purgatory after this life. For if the debt of
    punishment is not paid in full after the stain of sin has been washed away
    by contrition, nor again are venial sins always removed when mortal sins are
    remitted, and if justice demands that sin be set in order by due punishment,
    it follows that one who after contrition for his fault and after being
    absolved, dies before making due satisfaction, is punished after this life.
    Wherefore those who deny Purgatory speak against the justice of God: for
    which reason such a statement is erroneous and contrary to faith. Hence
    Gregory of Nyssa, after the words quoted above, adds: "This we preach,
    holding to the teaching of truth, and this is our belief; this the universal
    Church holds, by praying for the dead that they may be loosed from sins."
    This cannot be understood except as referring to Purgatory: and whosoever
    resists the authority of the Church, incurs the note of heresy.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The authority quoted is speaking of the
    labor of working for merit, and not of the labor of suffering to be
    cleansed.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> Evil has not a perfect cause, but
    results from each single defect: whereas good arises from one perfect cause,
    as Dionysius asserts [*Div. Nom. iv, 4]. Hence each defect is an obstacle to
    the perfection of good; while not every good hinders some consummation of
    evil, since there is never evil without some good. Consequently venial sin
    prevents one who has charity from obtaining the perfect good, namely eternal
    life, until he be cleansed; whereas mortal sin cannot be hindered by some
    conjoined good from bringing a man forthwith to the extreme of evils.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> He that falls into mortal sin, deadens
    all the good he has done before, and what he does, while in mortal sin, is
    dead: since by offending God he deserves to lose all the good he has from
    God. Wherefore no reward after this life awaits him who dies in mortal sin,
    whereas sometimes punishment awaits him who dies in charity, which does not
    always wash away the sin which it finds, but only that which is contrary to
    it.<br />

    Whether it is the same place where souls are cleansed, and the damned
    punished?<br />
  </h3>
  <br />
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 1:</i></b> It would seem that it is not the same place where
    souls are cleansed and the damned punished. For the punishment of the damned
    is eternal, according to Mt. 25:46, "These shall go into everlasting
    punishment [Vulg.: 'fire']." But the fire of Purgatory is temporary, as the
    Master says (Sent. iv, D, 21). Therefore the former and the latter are not
    punished together in the same place: and consequently these places must
    needs be distinct.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 2:</i></b> The punishment of hell is called by various
    names, as in Ps. 10:7, "Fire and brimstone, and storms of winds," etc.,
    whereas the punishment of Purgatory is called by one name only, namely fire.
    Therefore they are not punished with the same fire and in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Objection 3:</i></b> Further, Hugh of St. Victor says (De Sacram. ii,
    16): "It is probable that they are punished in the very places where they
    sinned." And Gregory relates (Dial. iv, 40) that Germanus, Bishop of Capua,
    found Paschasius being cleansed in the baths. Therefore they are not
    cleansed in the same place as hell, but in this world.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>On the contrary,</i></b> Gregory says [*The quotation is from St.
    Augustine (De Civ. Dei i, 8)]: "Even as in the same fire gold glistens and
    straw smokes, so in the same fire the sinner burns and the elect is
    cleansed." Therefore the fire of Purgatory is the same as the fire of hell:
    and hence they are in the same place.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Further, the holy fathers; before the coming of Christ, were in a more
    worthy place than that wherein souls are now cleansed after death, since
    there was no pain of sense there. Yet that place was joined to hell, or the
    same as hell: otherwise Christ when descending into Limbo would not be said
    to have descended into hell. Therefore Purgatory is either close to, or the
    same place as, hell.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>I answer that,</i></b> Nothing is clearly stated in Scripture about
    the situation of Purgatory, nor is it possible to offer convincing arguments
    on this question. It is probable, however, and more in keeping with the
    statements of holy men and the revelations made to many, that there is a
    twofold place of Purgatory. one, according to the common law; and thus the
    place of Purgatory is situated below and in proximity to hell, so that it is
    the same fire which torments the damned in hell and cleanses the just in
    Purgatory; although the damned being lower in merit, are to be consigned to
    a lower place. Another place of Purgatory is according to dispensation: and
    thus sometimes, as we read, some are punished in various places, either that
    the living may learn, or that the dead may be succored, seeing that their
    punishment being made known to the living may be mitigated through the
    prayers of the Church.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    Some say, however, that according to the common law the place of Purgatory
    is where man sins. This does not seem probable, since a man may be punished
    at the same time for sins committed in various places. And others say that
    according to the common law they are punished above us, because they are
    between us and God, as regards their state. But this is of no account, for
    they are not punished for being above us, but for that which is lowest in
    them, namely sin.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 1:</i></b> The fire of Purgatory is eternal in its
    substance, but temporary in its cleansing effect.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 2:</i></b> The punishment of hell is for the
    purpose of affliction, wherefore it is called by the names of things that
    are wont to afflict us here. But the chief purpose of the punishment of
    Purgatory is to cleanse us from the remains of sin; and consequently the
    pain of fire only is ascribed to Purgatory, because fire cleanses and
    consumes.<br />
  </p>
  <p>
    <b><i>Reply to Objection 3:</i></b> This argument considers the point of
    special dispensation and not that of the common law.<br />
