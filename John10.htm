            1365 To understand this parable we must consider who the sheep are,
            namely, that they are the faithful of Christ and those in the grace
            of God: "We are the people of his pasture, and the sheep of his
            hand" (Ps 95:7); "You, the people, are the sheep of my pasture" [Ez
            34:31]. And so the sheepfold is the multitude of the faithful: "I
            will surely gather all of you, O Jacob, I will gather the remnant of
            Israel; I will set them together like sheep in a fold" (Mic 2:12).
            The door of the sheepfold is explained in different ways by
            Chrysostom and by Augustine.

            Nam secundum Chrysostomum, ostium vocat Christus Scripturas sacras,
            secundum illud Col. IV, 3:
            <i>orantes simul pro nobis, ut Deus aperiat ostium sermonis</i>.
            Dicitur autem sacra Scriptura ostium, ut Chrysostomus dicit, primo
            quia per ipsam accessum habemus ad Dei cognitionem; Rom. c. I, 2:
            <i
              >quod autem promiserat per prophetas suos in Scripturis sanctis de
              filio suo, qui factus est ei ex semine David secundum carnem</i

            <i>scrutamini Scripturas: quia vos putatis vitam habere in ipsis</i
            >. Tertio quia ostium lupos supervenire non permittit: sic sacra

            <i

            Matth. XV, 9:
            <i>sine causa colunt me, docentes doctrinas et mandata hominum</i>;
            ibid. v. 6: <i>irritum fecistis mandatum Dei</i>. Haec est ergo

            1366 According to Chrysostom, Christ calls Sacred Scripture the
            door, according to "Pray for us also that God may open to us a door
            for the word" (Col 4:3). Sacred Scripture is called a door, as
            Chrysostom says, first of all, because through it we have access to
            the knowledge of God: "which he promised beforehand through his
            prophets in the holy scriptures" (Rom 1:2). Secondly, for just as
            the door guards the sheep, so Sacred Scripture preserves the life of
            the faithful: "You search the scriptures, because you think that in
            them you have eternal life" (5:39). Thirdly, because the door keeps
            the wolf from entering; so Sacred Scripture keeps heretics from
            harming the faithful: "Every scripture inspired by God is also
            profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction" (2 Tim 3:16).
            So, the one who does not enter by the door is the one who does not
            enter by Sacred Scripture to teach the people. Our Lord says of
            such: "In vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the
            precepts of men" (Matt 15:9); "You have made void the word of God"
            (Matt 15:6). This, then, is the mark of the thief: he does not enter
            by the door, but in some other way.

            He adds that the thief <b>climbs</b>, and this is appropriate to
            this parable because thieves climb the walls, instead of entering by
            the door, and drop into the sheepfold. It also corresponds to the
            truth, because the reason why some teach what conflicts with Sacred
            Scripture is due to pride: "If any one teaches otherwise and does
            not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the
            teaching which accords with godliness, he is puffed up with conceit,
            he knows nothing" (1 Tim 6:3). Referring to this he says that such a
            person <b>climbs</b>, that is, through pride. The one who
            <b>climbs in by another way, that man is a thief</b>, because he
            snatches what is not his, <b>and a robber</b>, because he kills what
            he snatches: "If thieves came to you, if plunderers by night - how
            you have been destroyed" (Obad v 5).

            According to this explanation, the relation with what preceded is
            made in this way: Since our Lord had said, "If you were blind, you
            would have no guilt," the Jews might have answered: "We do not
            believe you, but this is not due to our blindness. It is because of
            your own error that we have turned away from you." And so our Lord
            rejects this, and wishes to show that he is not in error because he
            enters by the door, by Sacred Scripture, that is, he teaches what is
            contained in Sacred Scripture.

            Sed contra hoc est, quod dominus, infra eodem, exponens, dicit:

            intelligi Christus. Ad quod Chrysostomus dicit, quod in hac parabola
            dominus dicit se esse et ostium et pastorem; unde secundum quod ipse
            diversimode se vocat, diversimode dicitur ostium, quia, secundum
            quod dicit se pastorem, oportet quod aliud sit ostium quam ipse,
            quia non est idem pastor et ostium. Nihil autem aliud a Christo
            convenientius potest dici ostium quam sacra Scriptura, propter
            rationes praedictas. Convenienter ergo sacra Scriptura ostium

            1367 Against this interpretation is the fact that when our Lord
            explains this further on, he says,
            <b>I am the door</b>. So it seems that we should understand the door
            to be Christ. In answer to this, Chrysostom says that in this
            parable our Lord refers to himself both as the door and the
            shepherd; but this is from different points of view, because a door
            and a shepherd are different.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" id="_ftnref2">[2]</a>
            Now aside from Christ nothing is more fittingly called a door than
            Sacred Scripture, for the reasons given above. Therefore, Sacred
            Scripture is fittingly called a door.

            Note that both the sheep and their shepherd enter into the
            sheepfold: the sheep in order to be secure there, and the shepherd
            in order to guard the sheep. And so, if you wish to enter as a sheep
            to be kept safe there, or as a shepherd to keep the people safe, you
            must enter the sheepfold through Christ. You must not enter by any
            other way, as did the philosophers who treated the principle
            virtues, and the Pharisees who established the ceremonial
            traditions. These are neither sheep nor shepherds because, as our

            ostium intraverunt veri pastores, de quibus Hebr. V, 4:
            <i>nemo sibi assumit honorem, sed qui vocatur a Deo tamquam Aaron</i
            >. Mali vero pastores non intrant per ostium, sed per ambitionem, et
            potentiam saecularem, et simoniam; et isti sunt fures et latrones;
            Oseae VIII, 4: <i>ipsi regnaverunt, et non cognovi</i>; idest, non
            approbavi. Et dicit <i>sed ascendit aliunde</i>, quia ostium istud,
            scilicet Christus, cum sit parvum per humilitatem, Matth. XI, 29:
            <i>discite a me, quia mitis sum</i>, non possunt intrare nisi qui
            Christi humilitatem imitantur. Qui ergo non intrant per ostium,
            aliunde ascendunt, idest superbi sunt, et non imitantur illum qui,
            cum Deus esset, factus est homo; et humilitatem suam non
            recognoscunt.

            It should be noted that just as one who does not enter by the door
            as a sheep cannot be kept safe, so one who enters as a shepherd
            cannot guard the sheep unless he enters by the door, namely, by
            Christ. This is the door through which the true shepherds have
            entered: "And one does not take the honor upon himself, but he is
            called by God, just as Aaron was" (Heb 5:4). Evil shepherds do not
            enter by the door, but by ambition and secular power and simony; and
            these are thieves and robbers: "They set up princes, but without my
            knowledge," that is, without my approval (Hos 8:5). Further, he says
            such a person
            <b>climbs in by another way</b>, because the door, namely, Christ,
            since it is small through humility - "Learn from me; for I am gentle
            and lowly in heart" (Matt 11:29) - can be entered only by those who
            imitate the humility of Christ. Therefore, those who do not enter by
            the door but climb in by another way are the proud. They do not
            imitate him who, although he was God, became man; and they do not
            recognize his lowering of himself.

            veritatem, quae est Christus, intrare; infra XVII, 17:
            <i>sanctifica eos in veritate</i>; infra:
            <i>per me si quis introierit, salvabitur</i>. Sed si quis etiam

            <i>dabo eis pastorem unum, qui pascat eas, servum meum David</i>,

            But if the door is Christ, as Augustine explains it, then in
            entering by the door, he enters by himself.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" id="_ftnref4">[4]</a>
            And this is special to Christ: for no one can enter the door, i.e.,
            to beatitude, except by the truth, because beatitude is nothing else
            than joy in the truth. But Christ, as God, is the truth; therefore,
            as man, he enters by himself, that is, by the truth, which he is as
            God. We, however, are not the truth, but children of the light, by
            participating in the true and uncreated light. Consequently, we have
            to enter by the truth which is Christ: "Sanctify them in the truth"
            (17:17); "If any one enters by me, he will be saved" (10:9). If one
            wishes to enter even as a shepherd, he must enter by the door, that
            is, Christ, according to his truth, will and consent. Thus we read
            in Ezekiel (24:23): "And I will set up over them one shepherd, my
            servant David, and he shall feed them." This is like saying: They
            must be given by me, and not by others or themselves.

            shepherd is let in by him. As to this he says,
            <b>to him the gatekeeper opens</b>. This gatekeeper, according to
            Chrysostom, is the one who opens the way to a knowledge of Sacred
            Scripture.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" id="_ftnref5">[5]</a>
            The first one to do this was Moses, who first received and
            established Sacred Scripture. And Moses opened to Christ, because as
            was said above: "If you believed Moses, you would believe me, for he
            wrote of me" (5:46).

            ipsemet introducit homines ad seipsum; dicit: ipse se aperit, qui
            seipsum exponit, et non nisi per eius gratiam intramus; Eph. II, 8:
            <i>gratia salvati estis</i>. Nec refert si Christus, qui est ostium,

            in corporalibus esse non possunt. Magis autem differre videtur
            pastor et ostium quam ostium et ostiarius. Cum ergo Christus dicatur
            pastor et ostium, ut dictum est, multo magis potest dici ostium et
            ostiarius. Sed si aliam personam ostiarii quaeris quam Moysem et
            Christum, vide ostiarium spiritum sanctum, ut Augustinus dicit. Ad
            officium enim ostiarii pertinet ut ostium aperiat, et de spiritu
            sancto dicitur infra XVI, 13: <i>docebit vos omnem veritatem</i>.

            Or, according to Augustine, the gatekeeper is Christ himself,
            because he brings us himself.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" id="_ftnref6">[6]</a>
            He says, "He opens himself who reveals himself, and we enter only by
            his grace." "For by grace you have been saved" (Eph 2:8). It does
            not matter if Christ, who is the door, is also the gatekeeper; for
            certain things are compatible in spiritual matters that cannot occur
            in physical reality. Now there seems to be a greater difference
            between a shepherd and a door than between a door and a gatekeeper.
            Therefore, since Christ can be called both a shepherd and a door, as
            was said, much more so can he be called a door and a gatekeeper. But
            if you prefer that someone other than Moses or Christ be the
            gatekeeper, then consider the Holy Spirit the gatekeeper, as
            Augustine says.

            For it is the office of a gatekeeper to open the door, and it says
            below of the Holy Spirit that "He will guide you into all the truth"
            (16:13). And Christ is the door insofar as he is the Truth.

            1373 But what of the fact that many who are Christ's sheep did not
            hear his voice, as Paul; or that some who were not his sheep did
            here it, as Judas? One might reply that Judas was Christ's sheep for
            that time as to his present righteousness. And Paul, when he did not
            hear the voice of Christ, was not a sheep but a wolf; but when the
            voice of Christ came it changed the wolf into a sheep. This reply
            could be accepted if it were not contrary to a statement in Ezekiel
            (34:4): "The crippled you have not bound up, the strayed you have
            not brought back." It seems from this that even when they were
            crippled and strayed they were sheep. Therefore, one must say that
            here our Lord is speaking of his sheep not only according to their
            present righteousness but even according to their eternal
            predestination. For there is a certain voice of Christ that only the
            predestined can hear, i.e., "He who endures to the end" (Matt

            countenance of your flock" [Prv 27:23]. This applies to Christ
            according to his present knowledge, but even more so considering
            eternal predestination, by which he knew them by name from eternity:
            "He determined the number of the stars, he gives to all of them
            their names" (Ps 147:4); "The Lord knows those who are his" (2 Tim

            1379 The cause of their failure to understand was that Christ was
            speaking in figures. The Evangelist says,
            <b>This figure</b> [ <i>proverbium</i> ]
            <b>Jesus used with them.</b> A figure [ <i>proverbium</i> ],
            properly speaking, is the use of one word in place of another, when
            it is intended that one word be understood from its likeness to the
            other. This is also called a parable [ <i>parabola</i> ]. Our Lord
            spoke in figures, first of all, because of the wicked, in order to
            conceal from them the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven: "To you it
            has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of God; but for
            others they are in parables" (Lk 8:10). Secondly, because of the
            good, so that his figures might stir them up to make further
            inquiry. So, after our Lord spoke his figures or parables to the
            crowds, his disciples questioned him in private, as mentioned in
            Matthew (13:10) and Mark (4:10). This is the reason why Augustine
            says: "Our Lord feeds" the believing crowds "with clear words, and
            stirs up" his disciples "with things that are obscure."

            1380 The Evangelist discloses their failure to understand when he
            says,
            <b>but they did not understand what he was saying to them</b>. The
            ignorance which resulted from Christ's figures was both useful and
            harmful. For the good and the just [who tried to understand them] it
            was useful for giving praise to God; for although they did not
            understand, they believed and praised the Lord and his wisdom which
            was so far above them: "It is the glory of God to conceal the word"
            [Prv 25:2]. But for the wicked, it was a source of harm, because,
            failing to understand, they blasphemed: "But these men revile
            whatever they do not understand" (Jude 10). As Augustine observes,
            when both the good and the wicked hear the words of the Gospel, and
            neither of them understands, the good person says that what was said
            was true and good, but that he does not understand it. Such a person
            is knocking and deserves to have the door opened, provided he
            perseveres. But the wicked person says that what was said had no
            meaning or was evil.

            dooris a thief and a robber." The second is: "He who enters by the

            the second clause (v 11). Concerning the first he does two things:
            first, he explains the first clause; secondly, he proves it (v 7).
            The first clause mentions a door, a thief and a robber; so first he

            acquire skill to understand a proverb and a figure" (Prv 1:6). Jesus
            said, <b>Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the door</b>. Now the
            purpose of a door is to conduct one into the inner rooms of a house;
            and this is fitting to Christ, for one must enter into the secrets
            of God through him: "This is the gate of the Lord," that is, Christ,
            "the righteous shall enter through it" (Ps 118:20). He says,
            <b>I am the door of the sheep</b>, because through Christ not only
            the shepherds are brought into the present Church or enter into
            everlasting happiness, but the sheep also. Thus he says below: "My
            sheep hear my voiceand they follow me; and I give them eternal life"

            Sed hoc esse falsum apparet ex tribus. Primo quidem ex his quae in
            parabola dicta sunt. Quod enim hic dicitur
            <i>omnes quotquot venerunt</i>, ponitur ut expositivum
            praecedentium; ibi autem dicitur, quod intraverunt, et cetera. Illi
            ergo <i>omnes quotquot veniunt</i>, scilicet non per me, idest non
            intrantes per ostium, <i>fures sunt et latrones</i>. Constat autem
            quod patriarchae et prophetae omnes per ostium, idest Christum,
            intraverunt, quos Christus venturus praecones mittebat. Licet enim
            ex tempore carnem acceperit, et factus fuerit homo, ab aeterno tamen
            erat verbum Dei; Hebr. XIII, 8:
            <i>Iesus Christus heri et hodie, ipse et in saecula</i>. Prophetae
            autem missi sunt per verbum Dei et sapientiam; Sap. VII, 27:
            <i>per nationes in animas sanctas se transfert</i>
            (scilicet Dei sapientia)
            <i>prophetas et amicos Dei constituit</i>. Et ideo signanter in
            prophetis legimus, verbum domini factum esse ad hunc vel ad illum
            prophetam, qui per participationem verbi Dei prophetaverunt.

            The falsity of this view is clear from three things. First, from
            what this parable says. For the statement,
            <b>all who came before me</b>, is intended as a description of the
            previous statement, which mentioned those who do not enter by the
            door. Therefore, <b>all who came before me</b>, but not through me,
            that is, not entering by the door, <b>are thieves and robbers</b>.
            It is clear that all the patriarchs and prophets, whom the
            Christ-to-come had sent forerunners, entered by the door, i.e.,
            Christ. For although he took flesh and became man in time, he was
            the Word of God from all eternity: "Jesus Christ is the same
            yesterday and today and for ever" (Heb 13:8). Indeed, the prophets
            were sent by the Word and Wisdom of God: "In every generation she,"
            the Wisdom of God, "passes into holy souls and makes them friends of
            God, and prophets" (Wis 7:27). Accordingly, we expressly read in the
            prophets that the word of God came to this or that prophet, who
            prophesied by participating in the Word of God.

            our Lord says,

            themselves forward on their own authority and were not sent by God:
            "I did not send the prophets, yet they ran" (Jer 23:21). Indeed,
            such prophets have not come from the Word of God: "Woe to the
            foolish prophets who follow their own spirit, and have seen nothing"
            (Ez 13:3). But the fathers of the Old Testament were not of this
            type, as has been said.

            sheep did heed were not thieves and robbers. Now the people of
            Israel did listen to the prophets, and those who did not heed them
            were rebuked in Sacred Scripture: "Which of the prophets did not
            your fathers persecute?" (Acts 7:52); "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem,
            killing the prophets and stoning those who are sent to you!" (Matt

            1390 The way the sheep are safeguarded is set forth when he says
            that
            <b>he will go in and out and find pasture</b>. This statement can be
            explained in four ways. First of all, according to Chrysostom, it
            simply affirms the security and freedom of those who cling to
            Christ.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" id="_ftnref11">[11]</a>
            For one who enters some other way than by the door does not have
            free entry and exit; but one who does enter by the door has free
            exit, because he can leave freely. Therefore, when he says,
            <b>he will go in and out</b>, the meaning is that the Apostles
            adhering to Christ enter with security by living with the faithful,
            who are within the Church, and with unbelievers who are outside,
            when they became masters of the whole world and no one wished to
            cast them out: "Let the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh
            appoint a man over the congregation, who shall go out before them
            and come in before themthat the congregation of the Lord may not be
            as sheep which have no shepherd" (Num 27:16).
            <b>And find pasture</b>, find delight in converting others, and find
            joy even when persecuted by unbelievers for the name of Christ:
            "Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they
            were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name," as we read in
            Acts (5:41).

            Two things are incumbent upon anyone who acts well, namely to be
            well-ordered to the things that are within him, and to those that
            are without. Within a person is the spirit, and without is the body:
            "Though our outer nature is wasting away, our inner nature is being
            renewed every day" (2 Cor 4:16). Therefore, a person who clings to
            Christ
            <b>will go in</b>
            through contemplation, to protect his conscience - "When I enter my
            house," i.e., my conscience, "I shall find rest with her," i.e.,
            with wisdom (Wis 8:16) -
            <b>and out</b>, namely, by good actions, to tame the body - "Man
            goes forth to his work and to his labor until the evening" (Ps
            104:23) - <b>and find pasture</b>, in a clean and sincere conscience
            - "I will appear before your sight: I will be satisfied when your
            glory appears" [Ps 16:15]. Again, by his actions he will
            <b>find pasture</b>, i.e., fruit - "He shall come home with shouts

            1398 He says, in regard to the first,
            <b>I am the good shepherd</b>. That Christ is a shepherd is clear
            enough, for as a flock is led and fed by the shepherd, so the
            faithful are nourished by Christ with spiritual food, and even with
            his own body and blood: "For you were straying like sheep, but now
            have returned to the Shepherd and Guardian of your souls" (1 Pet
            2:25); "He will feed his flock like a shepherd" (Is 40:11). To
            distinguish himself from an evil shepherd and thief, he adds,
            <b>good</b>. Good, I say, because he fulfills the office of a
            shepherd, just as a soldier is called good who fulfills the office
            of a soldier. But since Christ had said above that the shepherd
            enters by the door, and here he says that he is the shepherd, and
            before he said he was the door (v 9), then he must enter through
            himself. And he does enter through himself, because he manifests
            himself and through himself knows the Father. We, however, enter
            through him, because it is by him that we are led to happiness.

            Note that only he is the door, because no one else is the true
            light, but only shares in the light: "He," John the Baptizer, "was
            not the light, but came to bear witness to the light" (1:8). But we
            read of Christ that "He was the true light, which enlightens every
            man" [1:9]. Therefore, no one else refers to himself as a door;
            Christ reserved this for himself. But being a shepherd he did share
            with others, and conferred it on his members: for Peter was a
            shepherd, and the other apostles were shepherds, as well as all good
            bishops: "I will give you shepherds after my own heart" (Jer 3:15).
            Now, although the Church's rulers, who are her children, are all
            shepherds, as Augustine says, yet he expressly says,
            <b>I am the good shepherd</b>, in order to emphasize the virtue of
            charity.

            Qui igitur utitur grege ut semetipsum tantum pascat, non est pastor
            bonus. Ex quo sequitur quod pastor malus, etiam corporalis, nullum
            detrimentum vult sustinere pro grege, cum non intendat eorum
            commodum, sed proprium. Bonus vero pastor, etiam corporalis,
            sustinet multa pro grege, cuius bonum intendit; unde Iacob dixit
            Gen. XXXI, 40:
            <i>nocte ac die gelu urebar et aestu</i>. Sed in corporalibus
            pastoribus non exigitur a bono pastore ut exponat se morti propter
            salutem gregis. Sed quia spiritualis gregis salus praeponderat

            1399 The office of a good shepherd is charity; thus he says,
            <b>the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep</b>. It should
            be noted that there is a difference between a good shepherd and an
            evil one: the good shepherd is intent upon the welfare of the flock,
            but the evil one is intent upon his own. This difference is touched
            upon by Ezekiel (34:2): "Ho, shepherds of Israel who have been
            feeding yourselves! Should not shepherds feed the sheep?" Therefore,
            one who uses the flock only to feed himself is not a good shepherd.
            From this it follows that an evil shepherd, even over animals, is
            not willing to sustain any loss for the flock, since he does not
            intend the welfare of the flock, but his own. But a good shepherd,
            even over animals, endures many things for the flock whose welfare
            he has at heart. Thus Jacob said in Genesis (31:40): "By day the
            heat consumed me, and the cold by night." However, when dealing with
            mere animals it is not necessary that a good shepherd expose himself
            to death for the safety of the flock. But because the spiritual
            safety of the human flock outweighs the bodily life of the shepherd,
            when danger threatens the safety of the flock the spiritual shepherd
            ought to suffer the loss of his bodily life for the safety of the
            flock. This is what our Lord says,
            <b>the good shepherd lays down his life</b>, i.e., his bodily life,
            <b>for the sheep</b>, the sheep who are his by authority and
            charity. Both are required, for they must belong to him and he must
            love them; the first without the second is not enough. Furthermore,
            Christ has given us an example of this teaching: "He laid down his
            life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren" (1
            Jn 3:16).

            Prima quidem distinctio accipitur quantum ad intentionem; secunda
            quantum ad affectum tertia quantum ad sollicitudinem. Differunt ergo
            primo in intentione, et hoc ex nomine utriusque: nam primus dicitur
            pastor, ex quo datur intelligi quod intendit pascere gregem; Ez.
            XXXIV, 2:
            <i>nonne greges pascuntur a pastoribus?</i>
            Iste autem, scilicet malus, dicitur mercenarius, quasi mercedem
            quaerens. Ut sic differant in hoc: quod bonus pastor quaerit
            utilitatem gregis; mercenarius autem principalius commodum proprium.
            Haec etiam differentia est inter regem et tyrannum, ut philosophus
            dicit, quia rex in suo regimine intendit utilitatem subditorum;
            tyrannus vero utilitatem propriam; unde est sicut mercenarius: Zach.
            c. XI, 12:
            <i>si bonum est in oculis vestris, afferte mihi mercedem</i>.

            1402 First, they differ in their intentions, and this is implied by
            their very names. For the first is called a good shepherd, and this
            implies that he intends to feed the flock: "Should not shepherds
            feed the sheep?" (Ez 34:2). But the other one, the evil shepherd, is
            called a hireling, as though he were intent on his wages. Thus they
            differ in this: the good shepherd looks to the benefit of the flock,
            while the hireling seeks mainly his own advantage. This is also the
            difference between a king and a tyrant, as the Philosopher says,
            because when a king rules he intends to benefit his subjects, while
            a tyrant seeks his own interest.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn17" name="_ftnref17" id="_ftnref17">[17]</a>
            So a tyrant is like a hireling: "If it seems right to you, give me
            my wages" (Zech 11:12).

            Respondeo. Dicendum quod merces potest accipi dupliciter: scilicet
            communiter et proprie. Communiter quidem, omne quod meritis

            ipsa vita aeterna merces dicitur. Et hanc mercedem potest et debet
            quaerere quilibet bonus pastor. Proprie autem dicitur merces aliquid
            segregatum ab hereditate; et ad hanc non debet habere respectum ille
            qui est verus filius, ad quem spectat hereditas; sed ad eam
            respectum habent servi et mercenarii. Unde, cum vita aeterna sit

            I answer that wages can be taken in a general sense and in a proper
            sense. In a general sense, a wage is anything conferred by reason of
            merits. And because everlasting life, which is God - "This is true
            God and eternal life" (1 Jn 5:20) - is conferred by reason of
            merits, everlasting life is said to be a wage. And this is a wage
            that every good shepherd can and should seek. In the strict sense,
            however, a wage is different from an inheritance, and a wage is not
            sought after by a true child, who is entitled to the inheritance. A
            wage is sought after by servants and hirelings. Thus, since
            everlasting life is our inheritance, any one who works with an eye
            towards it is working as a child; but any one who aims at something
            different (for example, one who longs for worldly gain, or takes
            delight in the honor of being a prelate) is a hireling.

            by love and solicitude: "I hold you in my heart" (Phil 1:7). On the
            other hand, it is said of the hireling,
            <b>whose own the sheep are not</b>, i.e., the hireling has no care
            for them: "My shepherds have not searched for my sheep, but the
            shepherds have fed themselves" (Ez 34:8).

            Tertio differunt quantum ad affectum: nam bonus pastor qui diligit
            gregem, animam suam dat pro eo, idest, exponit se periculo vitae
            corporalis. Malus autem, quia nullum affectum habet ad gregem, fugit
            cum videt lupum. Unde dicit
            <i>videt lupum venientem, et dimittit oves</i>. Lupus iste
            tripliciter accipitur. Primo quidem Diabolus tentans; Eccli. XIII,
            21:
            <i
              >sed si communicabat aliquando lupus cum agno, sic peccator
              iusto</i

              ovium</i

              vos, non parcentes gregi</i
            >. Tertio tyrannus saeviens: Ez. XXII, 27:
            <i>principes eius in medio eius quasi lupi</i>. Debet ergo bonus
            pastor contra hunc lupum triplicem, subditum gregem tueri: dum
            scilicet videns lupum, idest tentationem diabolicam, deceptionem
            haereticam et saevitiam tyrannicam, opponit se: contra quod dicitur
            Ez. XIII, 5:
            <i

              Israel</i

          <td>
            1405 Thirdly, they differ in their affections. For the good
            shepherd, who loves his flock,
            <b>lays down his life</b>
            for it, i.e., he exposes himself to dangers that affect his bodily
            life. But the evil shepherd, because he has no love for the flock,
            flees when he sees the wolf. Thus he says,
            <b>he sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees</b>. Here,
            the wolf is understood in three ways. First, for the devil as
            tempting: "What fellowship has a wolf with a lamb? No more has a
            sinner with a godly man" (Si 13:17). Secondly, it stands for the
            heretic who destroys: "beware of false prophets, who come to you in
            sheep's clothing, but inwardly are ravenous wolves" (Matt 7:15); "I
            know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you,
            not sparing the flock" (Acts 20:29). Thirdly, it stands for the
            raging tyrant: "Her princes in the midst of her are like wolves" (Ez
            22:27). Therefore, the good shepherd must guard the flock against
            these three wolves, so that when he sees the wolf, i.e., the devil
            tempting, the deceiving heretic and the raging tyrant, he can oppose
            him. Against those who do not, we read, "You have not gone up into
            the breaches, or built up a wall for the house of Israel" (Ez 13:5).

            1406 But in Matthew (10:23) we find the contrary: "When they
            persecute you in one town, flee to the next." Therefore, it seems to
            be lawful for a shepherd to flee. I reply that there are two answers
            to this. One is that given by Augustine in his
            <i>Commentary on John</i>.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn18" name="_ftnref18" id="_ftnref18">[18]</a>
            There are two kinds of flight: that of the soul and that of the
            body. When we read here, he
            <b>leaves the sheep and flees</b>, we can understand it to mean the
            flight of the soul: for when an evil shepherd fears personal danger
            from a wolf, he does not dare to resist his injustices but flees,
            not by running away, but by withdrawing his encouragement, refusing
            to care for his flock.

            tyrannum, ideo adhibenda est alia responsio, quam Augustinus ponit
            in epistola ad Honoratum. Nam, ut ipse dicit, videtur quod liceat
            etiam corporaliter fugere lupos, non solum ex auctoritate domini
            supra posita, sed etiam exemplo sanctorum aliquorum, puta Athanasii
            et aliorum persecutores fugientium. Non enim quia fugit, sed quia
            dimittit oves vituperatur: unde si posset fugere non dimittendo
            oves, non esset vituperabile. Contingit enim aliquando, quod
            quaeritur persona praelati; aliquando totus grex. Manifestum est
            autem quod si quaeratur sola persona praelati, possunt alii loco sui
            ad gregis custodiam deputari, qui vice sui consolentur et gubernent
            gregem. Unde si sic fugiat, non dicitur dimittere oves; et hoc modo,
            in casu, fugere licet. Si autem quaeratur totus grex, aut oportet
            quod pastores omnes simul sint cum ovibus, aut oportet quod aliqui
            ex eis remaneant, et aliqui recedant. Si autem totaliter deserant
            gregem, tunc eis competit quod hic dicitur

            But since sometimes a shepherd does flee physically because of
            certain wolves, such as powerful heretics and tyrants, another
            answer must be given, as found in Augustine's
            <i>Letter to Honoratus</i>.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn19" name="_ftnref19" id="_ftnref19">[19]</a>
            As he says, it seems lawful to flee, even physically, from the
            wolves, not only because of the authority of our Lord, as cited
            above, but because of the example of certain saints, as Athanasius
            and others, who fled from their persecutors. For what is censured is
            not the flight itself, but the neglect of the flock; so, if the
            shepherd could flee without abandoning his flock, it would not be
            blameworthy. Sometimes it is the prelate himself who is the one
            sought, and at other times, it is the entire flock. It is obvious
            that if the prelate alone is sought, others can be assigned to guard
            the flock in his territory, and console and govern the flock in his
            place. So if he flees under these circumstances, he is not said to
            leave the sheep. In this way, it is lawful to flee in certain cases.
            But if the whole flock is sought, then either all the shepherds
            should be with the people, or some should remain while the others
            leave. But if all desert the flock, then these words apply,
            <b>he sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees</b>.

            for all the wild beasts" (Ez 34:8). The other danger is that the
            sheep be scattered; so he says, <b>and scatters them</b>, insofar as
            some are led astray and others persevere: "My sheep were scattered

            <i>non quaero datum, sed quaero fructum</i>
            et cetera. Et pertinet ad eum de ovibus; idest, eas diligit, et de
            eis sollicitatur, Phil. I, 7:
            <i>eo quod habeam vos in vinculis meis</i>
            et cetera.

            1408 Now he shows how the above-mentioned marks are related, for the
            third follows from the first two. Since the evil shepherd seeks his
            own advantage and has no love or solicitude for the flock, it
            follows that he is not willing to endure any inconvenience for them.
            Thus he says of the hireling,
            <b>he flees</b>, for this reason, <b>because he is a hireling</b>,
            that is, he seeks his own advantage, which is the first mark;
            <b>and cares nothing for the sheep</b>, i.e., he does not love them,
            and is not solicitous for them, which is the second mark. So we read
            in Job (39:16) about the evil shepherd: "She deals cruelly with her
            young, as if they were not hers." The opposite is true of the good
            shepherd, for he seeks the welfare of his flock, and not his own:
            "Not that I seek the gift; but I seek the fruit which increases to
            your credit" (Phil 4:17). Furthermore, he is concerned for his
            sheep, that is, he loves them and is solicitous for them: "I hold
            you in my heart" (Phil 1:7).

            approval and love: "To him who loves us and has freed us from our
            sins" (Rev 1:5). The second sign is that the sheep hear his voice

            <b>and my own know me. My own</b>, I say, by predestination, by
            vocation and by grace. This is like saying: They love me and obey
            me. Thus, we must understand that they have a loving knowledge about
            which we read: "They shall all know me, from the least of them to

            potest communicari creaturae alicui; I Cor. XIII, 12:
            <i>cognoscam sicut et cognitus sum</i>, idest, sicut cognitus sum

            cognitus est ab eo, est proprium solius filii, quia solus filius
            cognoscit patrem comprehendendo, sicut pater comprehendendo
            cognoscit filium; Matth. XI, 27:
            <i

            in qua erat ut filius pro salute humani generis moreretur: in quo
            etiam dicit se mediatorem Dei et hominis. Nam sicut ad oves se habet
            ut cognitus et cognoscens, ita et ad patrem: quia sicut pater eum
            novit, ita ipse patrem cognoscit.
          </td>
          <td>
            1414 The reason for this sign, that is, of his laying down his life
            for his sheep, is the knowledge he has of the Father. Concerning
            this he says,
            <b
              >as the Father knows me and I know the Father, and I lay down my
              life for the sheep</b
            >. This statement can be explained in two ways. In one way, so that
            "as" indicates just a similarity in knowledge; and taken this way,
            such knowledge can be given to a creature: "I shall know even as I
            am known" [1 Cor 13:12], i.e., <i>as</i> I am known without
            obscurity, so I will know without obscurity. In another way, the
            "as" implies an equality of knowledge. And then to know the Father
            as he is known by him is proper to the Son alone, because only the
            Son knows the Father comprehensively, just as the Father knows the
            Son comprehensively: "No one knows the Son except the Father, and no
            one knows the Father except the Son" (Matt 11:27), that is, with a
            comprehensive knowledge. Our Lord says this because in knowing the
            Father, he knows the will of the Father that the Son should die for
            the salvation of the human race. He is also saying here that he is
            the mediator between God and man. For as he is related to the sheep
            as known by them and as knowing them, so also he is related to the
            Father, because as the Father knows him, so he knows the Father.

            Consequenter cum dicit
            <i>et animam meam pono pro ovibus meis</i>, ponit ipsum signum; I
            Io. III, 16:
            <i
              >in hoc cognovimus caritatem Dei, quoniam ille pro nobis animam
              suam posuit</i
            >

            substantia verbi, animae et corporis, quaeritur quis loquatur cum
            dicit <i>animam meam pono</i>. Si dicas, quod verbum hic loquitur,
            non est verum: nam verbum numquam animam posuit, cum numquam fuerit
            ab anima separatum. Si autem dicas quod anima loquitur; hoc etiam
            impossibile videtur, quia nihil separatur a seipso. Si vero dicas,
            quod quantum ad corpus Christus hoc dicit, nec hoc videtur, quia
            corpus non habet potestatem iterum sumendi eam. Dicendum ergo ad
            hoc, quod in morte Christi, anima fuit separata a carne; alias non
            fuisset vere mortuus; sed divinitas numquam separata fuit in Christo
            ab ipsa anima et carne, sed unita fuit animae descendenti ad Inferos
            et corpori existenti in sepulcro: et ideo corpus virtute divinitatis
            animam posuit, et iterum resumpsit eam.

          <td>
            1415 Then when he says,
            <b>and I lay down my life for the sheep</b>, he gives the sign: "By
            this we know love, that he laid down his life for us" (1 Jn 3:16).
            But since there are three substances in Christ, namely the substance
            of the Word, of the soul, and of the body, one might ask who is
            speaking when he says, <b>I lay down my life</b> ["my life" can also
            be literally translated as "my soul"]. If you say that the Word is
            speaking here, it is not true, because the Word never laid down his
            soul, since He was never separated from his soul. If you say that
            the soul is speaking, this too seems impossible, because nothing is
            separated from itself. And if you say that Christ says this
            referring to his body, it does not seem to be so, because his body
            does not have the power to take up its soul. Therefore, one must say
            that when Christ died, his soul was separated from his flesh,
            otherwise Christ would not have been truly dead. But in Christ, his
            divinity was never separated from his soul or his flesh; but was
            united to his soul, as it descended to the lower world, and to his
            body, as it lay in the tomb. And therefore, his body, by the power
            of his divinity, laid down his soul [or life] by the power of his
            divinity, and took it up again.

            people, the flock of thy pasture" (Ps 79:13) - could have said that
            he laid down his life for them alone. But our Lord adds that it is
            not only for them, but for others too: "He prophesied that Jesus
            should die for the nation, and not for the nation only, but to
            gather into one the children of God who are scattered abroad"

            the precepts of the Law, as we read in Galatians (c 3). These other
            sheep, I say, that is, the Gentiles, I have from my Father through
            an eternal predestination: "Ask of me, and I will make the nations
            your heritage" (Ps 2:8); "I will give you as a light to the nations,
            that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth" (Is 49:6).

            But one might object to this that good works cannot merit the divine
            love. For since our works are meritorious to the extent that they
            are given life by charity - "If I give away all I havebut have not
            love, I gain nothing" (1 Cor 13:3) - and since God is the first to
            love - "In this is love, not that we love God but that he first
            loved us" [1 Jn 4:10] - it is clear that his love precedes all our
            merit. This can be answered by saying that no one can merit God's
            love; nevertheless, we can merit by our good works the effect of
            God's love, that is, an increase of grace and the reception of the
            good of glory, both of which God bestows on us because of his love.
            Thus we can say that for this reason God loves this or that person,
            that is, bestows on him the effect of his love, because he obeys his
            commandments. And so we can say about Christ as man, that for this
            reason the Father loves him, that is, has exalted him and given him
            the brightness of glory, because he laid down his life in death.

            death can be voluntary, yet among human beings death is always
            natural. Now nature is not subject to the will of any mere human,
            since nature, as well as the will, are from God. Therefore, the
            death of any mere human person must be natural. But in Christ, his
            own nature and every other nature are subject to his will, just like
            artifacts are subject to the will of the artisan. Thus, according to
            the pleasure of his will, he could lay down his life when he willed,
            and he could take it up again; no mere human being can do this,
            although he could voluntarily use some instrument to kill himself.
            This explains why the centurion, seeing that Christ did not die by a
            natural necessity, but by his own [will] - since "Jesus cried again
            with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit" (Matt 27:50) -
            recognized a divine power in him, and said: "Truly, this was the Son
            of God" (Matt 27:54). Again, the Apostle says in 1 Corinthians
            (1:18): "For the word of the cross is folly to those who are
            perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God,"
            that is, his great power was revealed in the very death of Christ.

            Blasphemantes autem, duo Christo imponunt. Primo, quod Daemonium
            habet; quasi dicant: non ex spiritu sancto, sed ex spiritu maligno
            loquitur. Simile dicitur Act. XVII, 18, de Paulo:
            <i>novorum Daemoniorum annuntiator est</i>. Contingit autem aliquem
            habere Daemonium privatum et familiarem; et talis licet semper
            insaniat spiritualiter, non tamen semper insanit corporaliter;
            aliquem vero arreptum a Daemone esse: et iste semper insanit etiam
            corporaliter. Unde Mc. III, 21, dicebant:
            <i>quoniam in furorem versus est</i>. Secundo, ut ostendat quod
            Christus sic habeat Daemonium, dicunt <i>et insanit</i>. Act. XXVI,
            v. 24: <i>multae litterae ad insaniam te adducunt</i>. Nec mirum si
            blasphemant, quia animales sunt, et, ut dicitur I Cor. II, 14,
            <i>animalis homo non percipit ea quae sunt spiritus Dei</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            These blasphemers accuse Christ of two things. First, that he has a
            demon. As if to say: He is not speaking due to the Holy Spirit, but
            from a wicked spirit. Something similar is found in Acts about Paul:
            "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities [demons]" (17:18).
            Now the fact is that a person who has his own and familiar demon is
            always spiritually mad, but not always mad in a bodily way. But some
            can be possessed by a demon, and these are always mad even in a
            bodily way. Thus it was said of Christ "He has become mad" (Mk
            3:21). Secondly, to show that Christ has a demon in this way, they
            say,
            <b>and he is mad</b>. "Your great learning is turning you mad" (Acts
            26:24). Yet their blasphemy is not surprising, because they are
            sensual and, as we read in 1 Corinthians [2:14]: "The sensual person
            does not perceive those things that pertain to the Spirit of God."

            <i>domine, ad quem ibimus? Verba vitae aeternae habes</i>. Unde
            Paulus dicit Act. c. XXVI, 25:
            <i
              >non insanio, optime Feste, sed verba veritatis et sobrietatis
              loquor</i

            <i>numquid Daemonium potest oculos caecorum aperire?</i>
            Quasi dicat: non erat enim hoc miraculum maximum? Et ideo recte
            credebant, quod non nisi Dei virtute fieri posset; supra IX, 33:

            1430 This opinion is refuted by the statements of the other side,
            and this is in two ways. First, by the profundity of Christ's words.
            Thus he says, <b>Others</b>, that is, those who rightly understood,
            <b>said, These are not the sayings of one who has a demon</b>. This
            was like saying: It is clear from what he is saying that he is not
            mad, because his words are orderly and profound: "Lord, to whom
            shall we go? You have the words of eternal life" (6:69). And Paul
            says, "I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking the
            sober truth" (Acts 26:25). Secondly, this opinion is refuted by the
            greatness of the miracle worked by Christ. Thus they say,
            <b>Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?</b>
            This means: Was not this one of the greatest of miracles? They were
            correct in believing that it could be performed only by the power of
            God: "If this man were not from God, he could do nothing" (9:33).

            naturae, potest Angelus et bonus et malus, quando sibi permittitur.
            Sicut secundum semina, quae sunt in rebus naturalibus ad
            generationem aliquorum animalium ordinata, possunt illorum animalium
            generationem operari; sicut fecerunt magi Pharaonis, Ex. VII, 11. Et
            similiter alterare naturam alicuius possunt: unde possent sanare
            infirmos, quibus beneficio naturae subveniri posset.

            1431 It should be noted that there are certain "miracles" which can
            be performed by the power of demons and angels, and there are others
            which in no way can be accomplished by their power. Those things
            which are above the order of nature no creature whatever can perform
            by its own power, since the creature itself is subject to the laws
            of nature. God alone, who is above nature, can act above the order
            of nature. Therefore, whatever any creature performs must remain
            within the order of nature, an angel, either good or wicked, is able
            to do, when it is permitted. Thus, by using the seeds which in
            natural things are ordered to the generation of certain animals,
            they are able to effect the generation of these animals, as
            Pharaoh's magicians did (Ex 7:11). Again, they can produce changes
            affecting the nature of a thing; thus, they can heal the sick who
            could be helped by the power of nature.

            performed by God alone, or by good angels and saintly men through
            God's power, which they obtain through prayer. Such would be the
            conferring of sight on the blind and the raising of the dead; for
            the power of nature cannot extend to the restoring of sight or to
            the raising of the dead. Consequently, a demon cannot open the eyes
            of a blind man or raise the dead, because this is done by God alone,

            1432 Here we see the dispute which the Jewish leaders initiated with
            Christ. First, the Evangelist gives the question asked by the Jews;
            secondly, Christ's answer (v 25); and thirdly, the effect of this
            answer (v 31). Concerning the first he does two things: first, he
            describes the circumstances of the questioning; secondly, he gives
            the question itself (v 24). The circumstances of the questioning are
            described with respect to three things: the time, the place, and the
            persons who ask the question.

            1433 He mentions the specific time first, saying,
            <b>it was</b>
            (<i>encaenia</i>)
            <b>the feast of the Dedication at Jerusalem</b>. To understand this
            we have to know, as Augustine says, that an "encaenia" was the feast
            of the dedication of a church.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn26" name="_ftnref26" id="_ftnref26">[26]</a>
            The Greek word,
            <i>caenos</i>, is the same as the Latin word for "new." Thus an
            <i>encaenia</i> is the same as a renewal; and even in everyday
            speech, when something is dedicated to some use, it is said to be
            "encaeniated," which is the same thing as being renewed. Thus the
            <i>encaenia</i>, the feast of the Dedication, was the feast and
            commemoration of the dedication of the temple, for when we newly
            dedicate some church to the divine worship, we celebrate its being
            set aside for a sacred purpose; and in memory of this we celebrate
            it every year on the same day. Thus every year the Jews celebrated
            the <i>encaenia</i>, the remembrance of the dedication of the
            temple.

            celebrated in remembrance of God's blessings: "I will recount the
            steadfast love of the Lord" (Is 63:7). Again in Psalm 117 [v 1],
            after David called to mind God's many blessings, saying, "Give
            praise to the Lord, for he is good," he adds, "Solemnize this day,

            We recall God's benefits to us as being of three kinds. Sometimes,
            as they are found in our head, the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus we
            celebrate the feast of his birth, and of his resurrection, and so
            on. Sometimes we recall them as found in our fellow members, that
            is, in the saints, who are members of the Church. This is fitting,
            for as the Apostle says: "If one member is honored, all rejoice
            together" (1 Cor 12:26). Thus we celebrate the feasts of Saints
            Peter and Paul, and the other saints. But at times we recall God's
            benefits as found in the entire Church: for example, the benefits of
            the sacraments and other things granted to the Church in general.
            Now a material church building is like a sign of the gathering of
            the faithful of the Church, and in this building all the sacraments
            of grace are dispensed. So it is in memory of these benefits that we
            celebrate the feast of the dedication of a church. Indeed, such a
            feast is greater than the feast of any saint, just as the benefits
            conferred upon the whole Church, which benefits we celebrate, exceed
            the benefits conferred on some saint and recalled during his feast.

            1435 Recall that the temple at Jerusalem had been consecrated three
            times: first by Solomon (1 Kgs c 8); secondly, during the time of
            Ezra by Zerubbabel and Jesus, the high priest (Ezra c 6); thirdly,
            by the Maccabees, for it says in 1 Maccabees (c 4) that they went up
            to Jerusalem to cleanse the holy places. Now this feast was not
            celebrated in memory of the dedication by Solomon, because that took
            place in the fall, i.e., in the seventh month; nor was it in memory
            of the dedication made at the time of Ezra, for this took place
            during the spring, i.e., the ninth day of March. But it was in
            memory of the dedication made by the Maccabees, which took place
            during the winter. And so to show this he mentions the specific

            auditorum cordibus, scilicet Iudaeorum malitiae, frigus indicaret;
            Ier. VI, 7:
            <i

              malitiam suam</i

            There is also a mystical reason for mentioning the time. As Gregory
            says (<i>Morals</i>
            2), the Evangelist took care to mention the season as winter in
            order to indicate the chill of evil in the hearts of those
            listening, that is, the Jews: "As a well keeps its water cold, so
            she keeps cold her wickedness" [Jer 6:7]; and we read of this
            winter: "The winter is past, the rain is over and gone" (Song 2:11).

            surrounding porticos as well; it was on these porticos that the
            people stood and prayed, for only the priests prayed in the temple.
            It was called the portico of Solomon because it was the place where
            Solomon stood and prayed when the temple was being dedicated: "Then
            Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all

            appetentem regnum, quod erat contra Caesarem, et odiosum Romanis.
            Unde et Pilatus quando Iudaei accusabant Christum, quod filium Dei
            se faceret, parum curavit. Dum vero dixerunt:
            <i>omnis qui se regem facit, contradicit Caesari</i>, magis coepit

            Secondly, they state their question,
            <b>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly</b>. Note their
            perversity; for since they resent Christ's calling himself the Son
            of God (5:18), they do not ask him if he is the Son of God, but
            <b>If you are the Christ, tell us plainly</b>. They hoped by this to
            obtain grounds for accusing him before Pilate for inciting sedition
            and making himself king - which was in opposition to Caesar and
            offensive to the Romans. Thus it was that when the Jews accused
            Christ of making himself the Son of God, Pilate was not very
            impressed; but when they said: "Every one who makes himself a king
            sets himself against Caesar" (19:12), he was swayed against Christ.
            This is why they say, <b>If you are the Christ</b>, or a king, or
            anointed, <b>tell us plainly.</b>

            the truth when they said, "How long will you keep us in suspense?"
            He shows this in two ways. First, because they did not believe his
            words; and about this he says,
            <b>I told you, and you do not believe</b>. As if to say: You say to
            me, "If you are the Christ," the king, "tell us." But
            <b>I told you</b>, that is, I told you the truth,
            <b>and you do not believe</b>. "If I tell you, you will not believe"
            (Lk 22:67).

            to believe, but foreknown to eternal destruction. For the very fact
            that we believe is due to God: "For it has been granted to you that
            for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also
            suffer for his sake" (Phil 1:29); "For by grace you have been saved
            thorough faith; and this is not your own doing, it is the gift of
            God" (Eph 2:8). And this is given only to those for whom it was
            prepared from eternity; thus, only those believe in him who have
            been ordained to this by God through an eternal predestination: "As
            many as were ordained to eternal life believed" (Acts 13:48); "We
            believe that we shall be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus"

            1444 But should anyone be told that he is not predestined? It seems
            that he should not be told: for since no one can be saved unless he
            is predestined, if one is told that he is not predestined, he would
            be driven to despair. And so our Lord was driving the Jews to
            despair when he said to them,
            <b>you do not believe, because you do not belong to my sheep</b>. My
            answer to this is that in this group there was something common to
            all, that is, they were not preordained by God to believe at that
            time; and there was also something special, that is, some of them
            were preordained to believe later. Thus, some of them did believe
            later, for we read in Acts (c 2) that three thousand of them
            believed in one day. But some were not preordained to do this.
            Therefore, it did not militate against hope to say to a group, some
            of whom were preordained to believe later, that they did not belong
            to his sheep, because no one of them could apply this definitely to
            himself. But it would militate against hope if Christ had said this
            to some definite person.

            But if a person cannot believe unless God gives this to him, it
            seems that unbelief should not be imputed to anyone. I answer that
            it is imputed to them because they are the cause why it is not given
            to them. Thus, I cannot see the light unless I am enlightened by the
            sun. Yet if I were to close my eyes, I would not see the light; but
            this is not due to the sun but to me, because by closing my eyes I
            am the cause of my not being enlightened. Now sin, for example,
            original sin, and in some persons actual sin, is the cause why we
            are not enlightened by God through faith. This cause is in everyone.
            Thus, all who are left by God are left by reason of the just
            judgment of God, and those who are chosen are lifted up by God's
            mercy.

            Our Lord shows in three ways that this reward will never end.
            Something can end in three ways. First of all, by its very nature,
            for example, if it is corruptible. But this reward is incorruptible
            of its very nature. Thus He says,
            <b>I give them eternal life</b>, which is incorruptible and
            ever-living enjoyment of God: "This is eternal life, that they know
            thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom thou hast sent"
            (17:3). As Augustine says, this is the pasture which he spoke before
            (v 9).
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn29" name="_ftnref29" id="_ftnref29">[29]</a>
            Indeed, eternal life is called a good pasture because it is entirely
            verdant and nothing withers away. Secondly, a thing can end because
            the one receiving it ends, or does not guard it well. But this will
            not happen to that reward; so he says,
            <b>and they shall never perish</b>, that is, the sheep will never
            perish. This conflicts with Origen, for he said that the saints in
            glory are able to sin.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn30" name="_ftnref30" id="_ftnref30">[30]</a>
            Yet our Lord says,
            <b>they shall never perish</b>, because they will be preserved
            forever: "He who conquers I will make him a pillar in the temple of
            my God; never shall he go out of it" (Rev 3:12). Thirdly, a thing
            can end by being snatched by force: for perhaps Adam would not have
            been cast out if the Deceiver had not been there. But this will not
            happen in eternal life, and so he says,
            <b>and no one shall snatch them</b>, that is, the sheep,
            <b>out of my hand</b>, that is, from my protection and loyalty: "The
            souls of the righteous are in the hand of God" (Wis 3:1). As
            Augustine says: "There the wolf does not snatch, nor the thief
            steal, nor the robber kill."

            1450 He now proves what he had said above about the dignity of his
            sheep, namely, that no one can snatch them from his hand. His reason
            is this: No one can snatch what is in the hand of my Father; but the
            Father's hand and mine are the same; therefore, no one can snatch
            what is in my hand. Concerning this he does three things: first, he
            gives the minor premise by showing that the Father had communicated
            divinity to him, saying,
            <b>what my Father has given to me</b>, through an eternal
            generation, <b>is greater than all</b>. "For as the Father has life
            in himself, so he has granted the Son also to have life in himself"
            (5:26). It is
            <b>greater</b>
            than any power: "He has given him authority to execute judgment,
            because he is the Son of man" (5:27); it is
            <b>greater</b>
            than any reverence and honor: "God had bestowed on him the name
            which is above every name, that at the name of Jesus every knee
            should bow" (Phil 2:9). Therefore,
            <b>what my Father has given to me</b>, that is, that I am his Word,
            his only begotten, and the splendor of his light,
            <b>is greater than all</b>.

            ignorantiam surripere, <i>de manu</i>, idest de potestate,

            dicatur de potestate patris, quam a me, ut Augustinus dicit. Ideo

            fortissimus est, cui non potest fieri violentia, et sapientissimus,

            Secondly, he mentions the greatness of the Father's power, which
            concerns the major premise, when he says,
            <b>and no one is able to snatch</b>, take by violence or secretly
            pilfer, <b>out of my Father's hand</b>, from the power of my Father,
            or from me, who am the might of the Father - although as Augustine
            says, it is better to say "from the power of the Father" than "from
            me."

            <b>no one is able to snatch out of my Father's hand</b>, because he
            is the almighty One who is not subject to violence, and he is
            all-wise from whom nothing is hidden: "He is wise in heart, and
            mighty in strength" (Job 9:4).

            <b>no one shall snatch them out of my hand</b>, because

            dicitur sicut ens; unde sicut aliquid non dicitur ens simpliciter
            nisi secundum substantiam, ita nec unum nisi secundum substantiam
            vel naturam. Simpliciter autem dicitur aliquid quo nullo addito
            dicitur. Quia erga hoc simpliciter dicitur
            <i>ego et pater unum sumus</i>, nullo alio addito, manifestum est
            quod sunt unum secundum substantiam et naturam. Numquam autem
            invenitur quod Deus et creatura sint unum sine aliquo addito, sicut
            illud I Cor. VI, 17: <i>qui adhaeret Deo, unus spiritus est</i>.
            Ergo patet quod filius Dei non est unum cum patre, ut creatura.

          <td>
            Yet the Arians, deceived by their wickedness, try to deny this, and
            say that a creature can in some sense be one with God, and in this
            sense the Son can be one with the Father. The falsity of this can be
            shown in three ways. First, from our very manner of speaking. For it
            is clear that "one" is asserted as "being"; thus, just as something
            is not said to be a being absolutely except according to its
            substance, so it is not said to be one except according to its
            substance or nature. Now something is asserted absolutely when it is
            asserted with no added qualification. Therefore, because
            <b>I and the Father are one</b>, is asserted absolutely, without any
            qualifications added, it is plain that they are one according to
            substance and nature. But we never find that God and a creature are
            one without some added qualification, as in 1 Corinthians (6:17):
            "He who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with him."
            Therefore, it is clear that the Son of God is not one with the
            Father as a creature can be.

          <td>
            Secondly, we can see this from his previous statement,
            <b>what my Father has given me is greater than all</b>. He draws the
            conclusion from this: <b>I and the Father are one</b>. This is like
            saying: We are one to the extent that the Father has given me that
            which is greater than all.

            Thirdly, it is clear from his intention. For our Lord proves that no

            snatch from the hand of his Father. But this would not follow if his
            power were less than the power of the Father. Therefore, the Father

            working miracles - "He has done all things well" (Mk 7:37) -

            consideranda occurrunt. Primum quidem videtur pertinere ad motivum
            lapidationis, quod est blasphemia. Praecipitur enim Lev. XXIV, 14,
            quod blasphemi lapidentur. <i>Educ</i> inquit
            <i

            1456 With respect to the first, the Evangelist says,
            <b
              >The Jews answered him, We stone you for no good work but for
              blasphemy</b
            >. There are five things to be considered here. First, what seems to
            be the motive for their stoning him, namely, his blasphemy. For
            Leviticus commands that blasphemers be stoned: "Bring out of the
            camp him who has blasphemed; and let all who heard him lay their
            hands upon his head, and let the congregation stone him" [24:14].
            Mentioning this motive, they say,
            <b>We stone you for no good work but for blasphemy</b>.

            Secundum, quod specificant ipsam blasphemiam. Nam blasphemia est non
            solum attribuere Deo quod sibi non convenit, sed etiam attribuere
            alteri quod solius Dei est: sicut blasphemia est non solum dicere
            Deum esse corpus, sed etiam dicere aliquam creaturam creare posse.
            Mc. II, 7, dicebant:
            <i
              >hic blasphemat. Quis potest dimittere peccata nisi solus Deus?</i
            >
            Dicebant ergo Iudaei dominum blasphemum esse, non primo modo, sed
            usurpando sibi quae divinitatis propria erant; unde dicebant
            <i>quia tu homo cum sis, facis teipsum Deum</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            Secondly, they specify his blasphemy. It is blasphemy not only to
            attribute to God what is not appropriate to him, but also to
            attribute to another what belongs to God alone. So, it is blasphemy
            not only to say that God is a body, but also to say that a creature
            can create: "It is blasphemy! Who can forgive sins but God alone?"
            (Mk 2:7). Thus the Jews were saying that our Lord was a blasphemer
            not in the first way, but for usurping for himself what is proper to
            God:
            <b>because you, being a man, make yourself God.</b>

            they were incensed because they understood that
            <b>I and the Father are one</b>
            could only be said if the Father and Son are equal. This is what
            they say,

            God, which is not true, you, <b>being a man</b>.

            The fourth point to consider is that the distance between God and
            man is so great that it was unbelievable to them that someone with a
            human nature could be God. So they significantly say,
            <b>because you, being a man, make yourself God</b>. Yet this
            unbelief could have been dispelled by what is read in the Psalm,
            "What is man that you are mindful of him? Or the son of man that you
            visit him?" [Ps 8:5]; and in Habakkuk (1:5): "For I am doing a work
            in your days that you would not believe if told," this is, the work
            of the incarnation, which surpasses every mind.

            accuse him of blasphemy, usurping for himself the honor of God. Now
            these conflict with each other, for he could not accomplish miracles
            from God if he blasphemed God, because "A sound tree cannot bear
            evil fruit, nor can a bad tree bear good fruit" (Mt 7:18). And this
            applied especially to Christ.

            1458 The Evangelist says,
            <b>Jesus answered them: Is it not written in your law</b>
            (in Psalm 82:6):
            <b>I said, you are gods?</b>
            Here we should note that "law" is understood in three ways in
            Scripture. Some times it is taken in a general sense for the entire
            Old Testament, containing the five books of Moses, the prophets and
            the hagiographies. This is the way
            <b>in your law</b>
            is understood here, meaning in the Old Testament. For this quotation
            is from the psalms which are referred to as the law because the
            entire Old Testament is considered to have the authority of law.
            Sometimes "law" is understood as distinct from the prophets, psalms,
            and the hagiographies; this is the way Luke uses it in "Everything
            written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and the psalms
            must be fulfilled" (Lk 24:44). Again, at other times it is
            distinguished from the prophets. In this sense the psalms and the
            other books of the Old Testament, other than the Pentateuch, are
            included within the prophets, on the ground that the Old Testament
            was produced by a prophetic spirit. This is the way it is understood
            in Matthew: "On these two commandments depend all the law and the
            prophets" (Mt 23:40).

            1459 The word "God" is also used in three senses. Sometimes it
            signifies the divine nature itself, and then it is used only in the
            singular: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord" (Deut 6:4).
            At other times it is taken in a denominative sense: in this way
            idols are called gods: "All the gods of the peoples are idols" (Ps
            96:5). And sometimes someone is called a god because of a certain
            participation in divinity, or in some sublime power divinely
            infused. In this way, even judges are called gods in Scripture: "If
            the thief is not known, the owner of the house shall be brought to
            the gods," that is, to the judges [Ex 22:8]; "You shall not speak
            ill of the gods," that is, of the rulers [Ex 22:28]. This is the way
            the word "god" is taken here, when he says,
            <b>I said, you are gods</b>, i.e., you share in some divine power
            superior to the human.

            called them gods because they participated in something divine
            insofar as they participated in God's word, which was spoken to
            them. For due to God's word a person obtains some participation in
            the divine power and purity: "You are already made clean by the word
            which I have spoken to you" (15:3); and in Exodus (c 34) we read

            From what has been said above, one might argue in this way: It is
            clear that a person by participating in the word of God becomes god
            by participation. But a thing does not become this or that by
            participation unless it participates in what is this or that by its
            essence: for example, a thing does not become fire by participation
            unless it participates in what is fire by its essence. Therefore,
            one does not become god by participation unless he participates in
            what is God by essence. Therefore, the Word of God, that is the Son,
            by participation in whom we become gods, is God by essence. But our
            Lord, rather than argue so profoundly against the Jews, preferred to
            argue in a more human way. He says,
            <b>and scripture cannot be broken</b>, in order to show the
            irrefutable truth of Scripture: "O Lord, your word endures forever"
            [Ps 118:89].

            VIII, 15: <i>accepistis spiritum adoptionis filiorum</i>, Christum
            autem sanctificavit ut esset filius Dei per naturam, unitus in
            persona verbo Dei: quod haec verba ostendunt dupliciter. Primo per
            hoc quod dicit <i>quem pater sanctificavit</i>. Si enim ut pater
            sanctificat, manifestum est quod sanctificat ut filium; Rom. I, 4:
            <i
              >qui praedestinatus est filius Dei in virtute secundum spiritum
              sanctificationis</i
            >. Secundo per hoc quod dixit <i>et misit in mundum</i>. Mitti enim
            in aliquem locum, non convenit alicui rei, nisi ante fuerit quam ibi
            esset: ergo ille quem pater misit in mundum, scilicet visibiliter,
            est filius Dei, qui praeexistit visibili visioni: quia, ut dicitur
            supra I, 10, <i>in mundo erat, et mundus per ipsum factus est</i>.
            Supra III, 17:
            <i>non enim misit Deus filium suum in mundum ut iudicet mundum</i>.
            Hunc ergo quem Deus misit in mundum,
            <i>vos dicitis quia blasphemas, quia dixi, filius Dei sum?</i>
            Quasi dicat: multo magis possum hoc dicere, qui sum unitus verbo in
            persona, quam illi
            <i>ad quos sermo Dei factus est</i>.
          </td>
          <td>
            1461 Then when he says,
            <b
              >do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the
              world, You are blaspheming</b
            >, he draws his conclusion. If, with Hilary, we refer this to Christ
            insofar as he has a human nature, the meaning is this: Some people
            are called gods only because they participate in God's word. How
            then can you say, <b>you are blaspheming</b>, that is, how can you
            consider it blasphemy, if that man who is united in person to the
            Word of God is called God?
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn36" name="_ftnref36" id="_ftnref36">[36]</a>
            This is why he says,
            <b>whom the Father sanctified</b>. For although God sanctifies all
            who are sanctified - "Sanctify them in truth" (17:17) - he
            sanctified Christ in a special way. He sanctifies others to be
            adopted children - "You have received the spirit of adoption" (Rom
            8:15) - but he sanctified Christ to be the Son of God by nature,
            united in person to the Word of God. These words,
            <b>whom the Father sanctified</b>, show this in two ways. For if God
            sanctifies as Father, it is clear that he sanctifies Christ as his
            Son: "He was predestined to be the Son of God by the Spirit of
            sanctification" [Rom 1:4]. We can also see this by his saying,
            <b>and sent into the world</b>. For it is not fitting for a thing to
            be sent some place unless it existed before it was sent there.
            Therefore, he whom the Father sent into the world in a visible way,
            is the Son of God, who existed before he was visible: for as we saw
            above, "He was in the world, and the world was made through him"
            (1:10); and "God sent the Son into the world" (3:17).
            <b
              >Do you say of him whom the Father sent into the world, you are
              blaspheming, because I said, I am the Son of God?</b
            >
            This was like saying: I, who am united in person to the Word, have
            much more reason to say this than those
            <b>to whom the word of God came</b>.

            <b>that the Father is in me and I am in the Father</b>: "I am in the

            Hilarius autem hoc bene exponit dicens, quod differentia est inter

            Sed, ut dicit Augustinus, licet Deus sit in homine, et homo in Deo,
            ut dicitur I Io. IV, 16:
            <i>qui manet in caritate, in Deo manet, et Deus in eo</i>, non est

          </td>
          <td>
            Hilary explains this well by saying that there is this difference
            between God and man: man being a composite, is not his own nature;
            but God, being entirely simple, is his own existence and his own
            nature. Therefore, in whomever the nature of God is, there is God.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn38" name="_ftnref38" id="_ftnref38">[38]</a>
            And so, since the Father is God and the Son is God, where the nature
            of the Father is, there is the Father, and where the nature of the
            Son is, there is the Son. Therefore, since the nature of the Father
            is in the Son, and conversely, the Father is in the Son, and
            conversely. But as Augustine remarks, although God is in man and man
            is in God - "He who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in
            him" (1 Jn 4:16) - this does not mean that they are one in essence.
            Rather, man is in God, that is, under the divine care and
            protection, and God is in man, by the likeness of his grace.
            <a href="John10.htm#_ftn39" name="_ftnref39" id="_ftnref39">[39]</a>
            However, the only Son is in the Father and the Father is in him as
            equals.

            To show that he could not be restrained unless he willed: "Passing

            from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (10:18). Secondly, to
            give us the example of turning away from persecution when this can
            be done without endangering the faith: "Do not make your stand
            against one who can injure you" [Sir 8:14].

            is twofold. First, this place was near Jerusalem, and since his
            passion was near, he did not wish to be too far away. Secondly, he
            wanted to recall the witness which John had given there, when he

            (1:29), as well as the Father's testimony to his Son, Christ, at the
            time of his baptism.

            Effectus autem declinationis fuit conversio turbarum ad fidem: quae
            quidem conversio describitur quantum ad tria. Primo quantum ad
            operationis imitationem; unde dicit
            <i>et multi venerunt ad eum</i>, scilicet per imitationem operum;
            Matth. XI, 28:
            <i
              >venite ad me omnes qui laboratis et onerati estis, et ego
              reficiam vos</i
            >. Secundo quantum ad oris confessionem; unde
            <i>et dicebant quia Ioannes quidem nullum fecit signum</i>. Ubi
            primo confitentur eminentiam Christi ad Ioannem; unde dicebant
            <i>quia Ioannes fecit nullum signum</i>. Cuius quidem ratio fuit,
            quia Ioannes missus fuit ut testis Christi, unde oportebat quod
            fieret fide dignus, et testimonium eius ostenderetur verum: quod
            quidem fit convenienter per sanctitatem vitae: Christus autem venit
            ut Deus: et ideo oportebat quod ostenderet in se signa potestatis
            divinae. Et ideo Ioannes vitae sanctitate pollebat; Christus autem
            cum hoc exercebat etiam opera potestatem divinam manifestantia. Hic
            etiam mos servabatur apud antiquas potestates, quod in praesentia
            potestatis maioris minor potestas non utebatur suae potestatis
            insigniis; unde in praesentia dictatoris consules insignia
            deponebant. Non ergo decens fuit ut Ioannes, qui minoris potestatis
            erat, utpote praecursor et testis, in Christi praesentia, divinae
            potestatis insigniis uteretur; sed solum Christus. Secundo
            confitentur veritatem testimonii Ioannis de Christo; unde dicebant
            <i>omnia enim quae dixit Ioannes de hoc</i>, scilicet de Christo,
            <i>erant vera</i>; quasi dicerent: et si nullum signum fecerit
            Ioannes, tamen de Christo omnia veraciter dixit. Tertio manifestat
            cordis fidem; unde dicit <i>et multi crediderunt in eum</i>. Ut
            Augustinus dicit, Christum apprehenderunt permanentem, quem Iudaei
            volebant apprehendere descendentem, quia per lucernam ad diem
            venerant: Ioannes enim lucerna erat, et diei testimonium perhibebat.

            1470 The effect of this turning away was that many were converted to
            the faith. Three points are made about this conversion. First, many
            imitated his works; so he says,
            <b>and many came to him</b>, namely, by imitating his works: "Come
            to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest"
            (Matt 11:28). Secondly, many professed him in word,
            <b>and they said, John did no sign</b>. By this they profess
            Christ's superiority to John. The reason for this was that John was
            sent as a witness to Christ; thus he should show that he was worthy
            to be believed and his testimony would be shown to be true. Now this
            is fittingly done by holiness of life. On the other hand, Christ
            came as God; consequently, it was fitting that he show the signs of
            divine power. And so John stood out by the sanctity of his life;
            Christ, however, in addition to this, performed works which
            manifested his divine power. This was in accord with the practice of
            the rulers of antiquity that when in the presence of a higher power
            a lesser power did not display the insignia of its power. Thus, in
            the presence of the Dictator, the Consuls took down their insignia.
            So it was not fitting that John, who possessed less power, because
            he was a precursor and witness, should employ the insignia of divine
            power; only Christ should have done this. They profess the truth of
            John's witness to Christ, saying,
            <b>but everything that John said about this man</b>, Christ,
            <b>was true</b>. They were saying: Although John did no sign, he
            nevertheless said all things truthfully about Christ. Thirdly, he
            reveals the faith in their hearts, saying,
            <b>and many believed in him there</b>. As Augustine remarks, they
            grasped Christ remaining, whom the Jews wanted to seize waning,
            because through the lamp they had come to the day. For John was that
            lamp and gave testimony to the day.
