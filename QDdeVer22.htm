                            habet ad verum, sic appetitus ad bonum. Non autem

                            same way since it is interchanged with either one.
                            Furthermore, tendency is related to good as
                            cognition is to the true. But not every being knows
                            the true. Neither, then, does every being tend to
                            good.

                                Sed in animali cognitio appetitum praecedit;
                                cognitio autem nullo modo se extendit ad non
                                animata, ut dicamus ea cognoscere naturaliter.
                                Ergo nec appetitus ad eadem se extendet, ut
                                dicamus ea naturaliter appetere bonum.

                                is removed. But in an animal cognition precedes
                                appetitive tendency. Cognition, however, in no
                                sense extends to inanimate things so that we
                                could say that they know naturally. Neither,
                                then, does appetitive tendency extend to them so
                                that we could say that they naturally tend to
                                good.

                                    Praeterea, secundum Boetium in libro de
                                    hebdomadibus, unumquodque dicitur appetere
                                    aliquid in quantum est sibi simile. Si
                                    igitur res aliqua appetit bonum, oportet
                                    quod sit similis bono. Cum autem similia
                                    sint quorum est qualitas vel forma una,
                                    oportet formam boni esse in appetente bonum.
                                    Sed non potest esse quod sit ibi secundum
                                    esse naturae, quia iam ulterius bonum non
                                    appeteret; quod enim habet quis, iam non
                                    appetit. Ergo oportet quod in appetente
                                    bonum forma boni praeexistat per modum
                                    intentionis. Sed in quocumque est aliquid
                                    per hunc modum, illud est cognoscens. Ergo
                                    appetitus boni non potest esse nisi in
                                    cognoscentibus; et sic idem quod prius.

                                    3. According to Boethius’ a thing is said to
                                    tend to something else inasmuch as it is
                                    like it. If, then, something tends to good,
                                    it must be like good. But since things are
                                    alike which have the same quality or form,
                                    the form of good must be in whatever tends
                                    to good. Now it cannot be there according to
                                    the thing’s real existence, because it would
                                    then no longer tend; for what someone has he
                                    does not seek. The form of good must
                                    therefore pre-exist intentionally in the
                                    being which tends to good. But anything
                                    which has something else in it in this
                                    manner is cognitive. Only in cognitive
                                    beings, therefore, can there be a tendency
                                    to good; and so the conclusion is the same
                                    as before.

                                        oportet hoc intelligi de bono quod omnia
                                        possunt habere; quia nihil appetit
                                        naturaliter vel rationaliter illud quod
                                        impossibile est ipsum habere. Sed bonum
                                        extendens se ad omnia entia, non est
                                        nisi esse. Ergo idem est dicere omnia
                                        bonum appetere, et omnia esse appetere.
                                        Sed non omnia appetunt esse; immo, ut
                                        videtur, nulla; quia omnia esse habent,
                                        et nihil appetit nisi quod non habet, ut
                                        patet per Augustinum in Lib. de
                                        Trinitate, et per philosophum in I Phys.
                                        Ergo non omnia bonum appetunt.

                                        4. If all things tend to good, this must
                                        be understood of a good which all can
                                        have, because nothing tends either
                                        naturally or rationally to what is
                                        impossible for it to have. But the only
                                        good extending to all beings is
                                        existence. It is therefore the same to
                                        say that all things tend to good as that
                                        they tend to existence. Now not all
                                        things tend to existence; in fact it
                                        seems that none do, because all have
                                        existence and nothing tends except to

                                        all things, therefore, tend to good.

                                            do they tend to the good.

                                                people therefore tend to evil,
                                                and so not all tend to good.

                          1. Things are oriented to God as knowable and
                          appetible. But not all things oriented to God as
                          knowable know Him, for not all cognitive beings know
                          God. Therefore, neither do all things oriented to Him
                          as appetible tend to Him.

                              ibidem vult Commentator. Sed Deus non est esse
                              omnium. Ergo Deus non est illud bonum quod ab
                              omnibus est desideratum.

                              2. The good which is desired by all things is, in
                              the opinion of the Philosopher, existence, as the
                              Commentator maintains. But God is not the
                              existence of all. Then God is not the good which
                              is desired by all.

                                  qui te oderunt, ascendit semper; et Iob, XXI,
                                  14, dicitur: dixerunt Deo: recede a nobis.
                                  Ergo non omnia appetunt Deum.

                                  3. No one seeks what he flees from. But some
                                  people flee from God, as is had in the Psalms
                                  (73:23): “The pride of them that hate thee
                                  ascends continually.” And Job (21:14) says:
                                  “[They] have said to God: Depart from us.”
                                  Hence not all things seek God.

                                      have God. Then not all things seek Him.

                                          Trinit. Ergo non omnia naturaliter
                                          appetunt Deum.

                                          5. There is a natural appetite only
                                          for what can be had. But only a
                                          rational creature can have God, since
                                          it alone is made to the image of God
                                          and “is the image of God by the very
                                          fact of having a capacity for Him,” as
                                          Augustine says. Not all things, then,
                                          naturally seek God.

                                                  1. There is the statement of
                                                  Augustine: “Whatever can love
                                                  loves God.” But all things can
                                                  love because all seek good.
                                                  Then all seek God.

                                                      it exists. But all things

                                                      written in Proverbs
                                                      (16:4): “The Lord has made
                                                      all things for himself.”
                                                      All things, therefore,
                                                      naturally tend to God.

                          1. The powers of the soul are ordained only to vital
                          operations. Now those operations are called vital by
                          which animate things are distinguished from inanimate.
                          But it is not as regards tending that animate things
                          are distinguished from inanimate, because even the
                          inanimate tend to good. Appetite is therefore not a
                          special power of the soul.

                              quaedam directio in finem. Sed appetitus naturalis
                              sufficit ad hoc quod aliquid per ipsum dirigatur
                              in finem. Ergo non oportet superaddi appetitum
                              animalem, qui sit specialis potentia animae.

                              2. Appetite is nothing, it seems, but a sort of
                              direction to an end. But natural appetite suffices
                              for a thing to be directed to an end. So there is
                              no necessity of adding an animal appetite which
                              would be a special power of the soul.

                                  appetitus naturalis et animalis, scilicet
                                  bonum. Ergo eadem est potentia vel operatio.
                                  Sed appetitus naturalis non est potentia
                                  animae. Ergo nec animalis.

                                  3. Operations and powers are differentiated as
                                  to their terms. But there is the same term,
                                  good, for both natural and animal appetite. It
                                  is therefore the same power or operation. But
                                  natural appetite is not a power of the soul.
                                  Then neither is animal appetite.

                                      per cognitionem bonum habetur. Ergo

                                      4. Appetite is for what is not had,
                                      according to Augustine. But in the case of
                                      animals the good is already had by
                                      knowledge. Therefore there does not follow
                                      upon knowledge among animals any appetite
                                      which would call for a special power.

                                          5. A special power is destined for a
                                          special act, not for an act common to
                                          all the powers of the soul. But to
                                          tend to good is common to all the
                                          powers of the soul. This is apparent
                                          from the fact that every power tends
                                          to its object and takes pleasure in
                                          it. Therefore appetite is not a
                                          special power of the soul.

                                              appetitiva potentia non erit

                                              Ergo non erit aliqua potentia quae
                                              specialiter debeat dici appetitus.

                                              6. If the appetitive power tends
                                              to good, it tends either to good
                                              in general or to what is good for
                                              itself. Now if it should tend to
                                              good in general, since every other
                                              power tends to some particular
                                              good, the appetitive power will
                                              not be a special power but a
                                              universal one. But if it tends to
                                              what is good for itself, since
                                              every other power also tends to
                                              what is good for itself, every
                                              other power can for the same
                                              reason be called an appetite.
                                              There will therefore not be any
                                              power of the soul which can be
                                              called appetite in a special way.

                          1. An accidental difference in objects does not
                          distinguish powers. But the objects of the, will and
                          of the sense appetite are differentiated only by
                          accidental differences in good, which is essentially
                          the object of appetite. They do not, indeed, seem to
                          differ except inasmuch as the will has as its object
                          the good apprehended by the intellect, and sense
                          appetite, that apprehended by sense. But these
                          differences are accidental to good as such. Therefore
                          the will is not a power distinct from sense appetite.

                              intellectiva differunt per particulare et
                              universale; quia sensus apprehendit particularia,
                              intellectus autem universalia. Sed per hoc non
                              potest distingui appetitus sensitivae partis et
                              intellectivae, quia omnis appetitus est boni in
                              rebus existentis, quod non est universale, sed
                              singulare. Ergo non debet dici quod appetitus
                              rationalis, qui est voluntas, sit alia potentia ab
                              appetitu sensitivo, per modum quo intellectus est
                              alia potentia a sensu.

                              2. Sensitive and intellectual apprehensive powers
                              differ as particular and universal, for sense
                              apprehends particulars and intellect universals.
                              But the appetite of the sensitive and intellective
                              parts cannot be distinguished in this way, because
                              any appetite is for the good as it exists in
                              reality. This, however, is not universal but
                              singular. The rational appetite—the will—must
                              therefore not be said to be a power other than
                              sense appetite as intellect is other than sense.

                                  just as the appetitive follows apprehension.
                                  But the motive power is not one thing in
                                  rational beings and another in irrational.
                                  Then neither is the appetitive. And so the
                                  conclusion is the same as before.

                                      distinguit quinque genera potentiarum
                                      animae et operationum: quorum unum
                                      includit generationem, nutritionem et

                                      videtur quod non distinguatur potentia
                                      appetitiva superior ab inferiori, sicut

                                      4. The Philosopher distinguishes five
                                      kinds of powers and operations of the
                                      soul. One includes generation, nutrition,
                                      and growth; the second is sense; the
                                      third, appetite; the fourth, locomotion;
                                      and the fifth, intellect. Intellect is
                                      here distinguished from sense, but not
                                      intellective appetite from sense appetite.
                                      It therefore seems that a higher
                                      appetitive power is not distinguished from
                                      a lower as a higher apprehensive power is
                                      distinguished from a lower.

                                                          which is found in it.
                                                          Now it belongs to the

                                                          move and incline and

                                                          by any other. Hence

                          aliquo non expeti. Ergo voluntas de necessitate
                          aliquid expetit.

                          1. According to Augustine’ all seek happiness “with a
                          single will.” But what is sought by all in common is
                          sought of necessity; for if it were not of necessity,
                          it might chance not to be sought by someone. The will
                          therefore wills something necessarily.

                              necessitate movet suum mobile. Sed secundum
                              philosophum in III de anima, bonum est motivum
                              voluntatis, secundum quod apprehenditur. Ergo, cum
                              aliquid sit perfectum bonum, sicut Deus et
                              beatitudo, ut etiam dicitur in I Ethic., aliquid
                              erit quod voluntatem de necessitate movebit; et
                              ita a voluntate aliquid necessario appetitur.

                              2. Every cause of motion having perfect efficacy
                              moves its object of necessity. But according to
                              the Philosopher good as apprehended is the cause
                              of the motion of the will. Therefore, since
                              something is a perfect good, viz., God and
                              beatitude, as is said in the <i>Ethics,</i> there
                              will be something which will move the will with
                              necessity. And so something is desired by the will
                              necessarily.

                                  Praeterea, immaterialitas est causa quare
                                  aliqua potentia cogi non possit; potentiae
                                  enim organis affixae coguntur, sicut patet
                                  praecipue de motiva. Sed intellectus est
                                  immaterialior potentia quam voluntas; quod
                                  patet ex hoc quod habet immaterialius
                                  obiectum, scilicet universale: cum bonum in
                                  rebus particularibus existens sit obiectum
                                  voluntatis. Cum igitur intellectus cogatur ut
                                  aliquid de necessitate teneat, ut dicitur in V
                                  Metaphys., videtur quod etiam voluntas de
                                  necessitate aliquid appetat.

                                  3. Immateriality is the reason why a given
                                  power cannot be forced; for powers connected
                                  with organs are forced, as appears especially
                                  in regard to the motive power. But the
                                  intellect is a more immaterial power than the
                                  will. This is clear from the fact that it has
                                  a more immaterial object, the universal,
                                  whereas the object of the will is the good
                                  existing in particular things. Since, then,
                                  the intellect is forced to hold something of
                                  necessity, as is said in the
                                  <i>Metaphysics,</i> it seems that the will
                                  also tends to something of necessity.

                                      dicimus: necesse est ut ita sit vel ita
                                      fiat; nescio cur eam timeamus ne nobis
                                      libertatem auferat voluntatis. Ergo
                                      voluntas de necessitate aliquid vult.

                                      4. Necessity is removed from the will only
                                      by reason of freedom, to which necessity
                                      seems to be opposed. But not every sort of
                                      necessity prevents freedom. Hence
                                      Augustine says: “If necessity is defined
                                      to be that according to which we say: ‘It
                                      is necessary for something to be or to
                                      become thus and so, I do not know why we
                                      should fear that it will take away the
                                      freedom of the <i>will.”</i> The will
                                      therefore of necessity wills something.

                                          good. He therefore necessarily wills
                                          good; and so some will wills something
                                          necessarily.

                                              volendum.

                                              6. According to Gregory “a sin
                                              which is not wiped out by
                                              repentance, by its own weight soon
                                              draws a person to another.” But a
                                              sin is not committed unless it is
                                              done voluntarily, as Augustine
                                              teaches..Since drawing is a
                                              violent motion, as is made clear
                                              in the <i>Physics</i>, one can
                                              accordingly be violently forced to
                                              will something of necessity.

                                                  7. Following Augustine, the
                                                  Master says: “In the second
                                                  state (the state of guilt) man
                                                  cannot avoid sinning even
                                                  mortally before reparation and
                                                  at least venially after
                                                  reparation.” But both mortal
                                                  and venial sin are voluntary.
                                                  There is therefore a state of
                                                  man in which he is unable not
                                                  to will something which
                                                  constitutes a sin. And so the
                                                  will of necessity wills
                                                  something.

                          immutabilius. Sed vivere est nobilius quam esse,
                          intelligere quam vivere, et velle quam intelligere.
                          Ergo velle est immutabilius quam esse. Sed esse animae
                          volentis est immutabile, quia est incorruptibile. Ergo
                          et velle eius est immutabile; et ita, quidquid vult,
                          immutabiliter et necessario vult.

                          1 The nobler a thing is, the more unchangeable it is.
                          But to live is nobler than to be; to understand,
                          nobler than to live; and to will, nobler than to
                          understand. Therefore to will is more unchangeable
                          than to be. But the being of a soul that wills is
                          unchangeable because it is incorruptible. Therefore
                          its willing is also unchangeable; and so whatever it
                          wills, it wills unchangeably and necessarily.

                              tanto immutabilius est. Sed magis conformatur

                              anima, secundum illud Ps. XXXVIII, 7: in imagine
                              pertransit homo. Ergo et secundum conformitatem
                              secundam, quae est similitudinis, consistens in
                              debita voluntatis ordinatione, habebit
                              immutabilitatem, ut voluntas immutabiliter velit
                              bonum, nec possit velle malum.

                              2. The more conformed a thing is to God, the more
                              unchangeable it is. But the soul is more conformed
                              to God by secondary conformity, which is that of
                              likeness, than by primary conformity, which is
                              that of an image. But in its primary conformity
                              the soul has unchangeableness because it cannot
                              lose its image, according to the words of the
                              Psalm (38:7): “Man passes as an image.” Then
                              according to secondary conformity, which is that
                              of a likeness consisting in the due ordering of
                              the will, it will also have unchangeableness so
                              that the will will unchangeably will good and
                              cannot will evil.

                                  Praeterea, sicut se habet actus ad ens actu,
                                  ita potentia ad ens potentiale. Sed Deus, cum
                                  sit actu bonus, non potest aliquid actu malum
                                  facere. Ergo etiam eius potentia, quae bona
                                  est, non potest producere aliquid quod sit
                                  malum in potentia: et ita voluntas quam divina
                                  potentia produxit, non potest in malum.

                                  3. Potency stands to potential being as act to
                                  actual being. But God, being actually good,
                                  cannot actually do anything evil. Therefore
                                  His power, which is good, also cannot produce
                                  anything which is evil potentially; and thus
                                  the will, which the divine power has produced,
                                  cannot tend to evil.

                                      are related to means just as in
                                      demonstrative sciences principles are to
                                      conclusions. But from principles that are
                                      naturally known necessity is imposed upon
                                      the intellect so that it knows conclusions
                                      necessarily. Then from the fact that the

                                      directed to the ultimate end.

                                          something necessarily attains it
                                          unless something interferes. But the
                                          will “naturally wills good,” as is
                                          said in the Gloss. It therefore
                                          unchangeably wills good, since there
                                          is nothing to stop it, seeing that it
                                          is “the most powerful” thing under
                                          God, as Bernard teaches.

                                              darkness to light. But sight,
                                              which is naturally determined to
                                              know light and what is lighted,
                                              sees them naturally so as to be
                                              unable to see what is dark. Then
                                              the will, whose object is the
                                              good, so unchangeably wills good
                                              that it can in no way will evil.
                                              And so the will has some necessity

                          1. What anyone necessarily wills he wills naturally.
                          But we do not merit by what is natural. Therefore we
                          do not merit by such an act of the will.

                              Praeterea, meritum et demeritum sunt circa idem.
                              Sed nullus demeretur in eo quod vitare non potest,
                              secundum Augustinum. Ergo nullus meretur in eo
                              quod de necessitate vult.

                              2. Merit and demerit apply to the same thing. But
                              according to Augustine’ no one gets any demerit in
                              anything that he cannot avoid.

                                  virtutis. Sed omnis actus virtutis est ex
                                  electione, non autem ex naturali inclinatione.
                                  Ergo nullus meretur in eo quod de necessitate
                                  vult.

                                  3. No one merits except by an act of virtue.
                                  But every act of virtue is from a choice, not
                                  from a natural inclination. Then no one merits
                                  in anything that he does from necessity.

                                          1. Every creature naturally and
                                          necessarily seeks God. But in loving
                                          God we merit. it is therefore possible
                                          to merit in what one necessarily does.

                                              appetendo vitam aeternam merentur.
                                              Ergo aliquis meretur volendo id
                                              quod naturaliter vult.

                                              eternal life. Therefore a person
                                              merits by willing what he wills
                                              necessarily.

                          force it. But, as is said in Proverbs (2 1:1), “The
                          heart of the king is in the hand of the Lord:
                          whithersoever he will he shall turn it.” God can
                          therefore force the will.

                              tradidit Deus illos et cetera. Dicit Glossa
                              Augustini: manifestum est Deum operari in cordibus
                              hominum ad inclinandas voluntates eorum in
                              quodcumque voluerit, sive in bonum pro
                              misericordia sua, sive ad malam pro meritis eorum.
                              Ergo Deus potest cogere voluntatem.

                              2. Quoting Augustine on Romans (1:24): “Wherefore,
                              God gave them up to the desires of their heart...”
                              the Gloss says. “It is evident that God works in
                              the hearts of men to incline their wills to
                              whatever He wishes, whether to good, according to
                              His mercy, or to evil, according to their
                              deserts.” God can accordingly force the will.

                                  habet infinitam virtutem in agendo, potest
                                  totaliter cogere voluntatem.

                                  infinite being will act infinitely. But a
                                  finite creature attracts the will in a finite
                                  way, because, as Cicero says, the honorable is
                                  what attracts us by its own vigor and entices
                                  us by its own excellence. Therefore God, who
                                  has infinite efficacy in acting, can therefore
                                  force the will.

                                      whether he wants to or not. But the will
                                      is unable not to will what God by His will
                                      of good pleasure wants it to will;
                                      otherwise the will of God would be
                                      inefficacious in regard to our will. God
                                      can therefore force the will.

                                          can therefore force it to what He

                          1. The will is a creature. But the will changes its
                          own act as it wishes. It therefore seems that some
                          creature can change the will and force it.

                              Praeterea, difficilius est immutare totum quam
                              partem. Sed secundum quosdam philosophos, corpora
                              caelestia immutant totam multitudinem ad aliquid
                              volendum. Ergo multo fortius videtur quod possunt
                              cogere voluntatem alicuius unius.

                              2. It is harder to change a whole thing than a
                              part of it. But according to some philosophers’
                              the heavenly bodies change a whole crowd to will
                              something. With all the more reason, then, does it
                              seem that they can force the will of a single man.

                                  cogitur ab illo. Sed secundum philosophum in
                                  VII Ethic., incontinentes vincuntur a
                                  passionibus. Ergo passiones immutant et cogunt
                                  voluntatem incontinentis.

                                  3. Whoever is bound by something is forced by
                                  it. But according to the Philosopher
                                  incontinent people are bound by their
                                  passions. Passions therefore change and force
                                  the will of an incontinent person.

                                      Praeterea, secundum Augustinum in III de

                                      corporibus movent inferiora naturali

                                      sicut intellectus est superior et
                                      perfectior nostro intellectu, ita et

                                      4. According to Augustine both among
                                      spirits and among bodies the higher move
                                      the lower with a certain natural order.
                                      But not only the intellect but also the
                                      will of the blessed angels is higher and
                                      more perfect than ours. Therefore, just as
                                      they can influence our intellect by theirs
                                      by enlightening it, according to the
                                      teaching of Dionysius, so also it seems
                                      that by their will they can influence our
                                      will by changing it in some way.

                                          et perficiunt inferiores. Sed sicut
                                          illuminatio pertinet ad intellectum,
                                          ita purgatio videtur pertinere ad
                                          affectum. Ergo, sicut Angeli possunt
                                          imprimere in intellectum, ita etiam in
                                          voluntatem.

                                          5. According to Dionysius, the higher
                                          angels enlighten, cleanse, and perfect
                                          the lower. But just as enlightenment
                                          applies to the intellect, so cleansing
                                          seems to apply to the affections.
                                          Angels can accordingly influence the
                                          will as they can the intellect.

                          1. Powers are distinguished on the basis of their
                          objects. Now the object of the intellect is the true,
                          that of the will, the good. Since the good and the
                          true are identical as to their real subject and differ
                          in formal character, it therefore seems that the
                          intellect and the will are really identical and differ
                          only in formal character.

                              voluntas est in ratione. Ergo vel est idem quod
                              ratio, vel pars rationis. Sed ratio est eadem
                              potentia cum intellectu. Igitur et voluntas.

                              2. According to the Philosopher, the will is in
                              reason. It is therefore either the same as reason
                              or a part of reason. But reason is the same power
                              as the intellect. Then so is the will.

                                  Sed voluntas distinguitur ab irascibili et
                                  concupiscibili. Ergo continetur sub rationali.

                                  3. The faculties of the soul are commonly
                                  divided into the rational, the concupiscible,
                                  and the irascible. But the will is
                                  distinguished from the irascible and the
                                  concupiscible. It is therefore contained
                                  within the rational.

                                      Sed voluntatis et intellectus practici est

                                      practicus, quia secundum philosophum in

                                      fit practicus. Ergo voluntas et

                                      4. Wherever there is found an object which
                                      is the same in reality and in formal
                                      character, there is a single power. But
                                      the object of the will and of the
                                      practical intellect is the same in reality
                                      and in formal character, for the object of
                                      both is the good. Therefore the practical
                                      intellect is not a power different from
                                      the will. But the speculative intellect is
                                      not a power different from the practical
                                      because, according to the Philosopher, by
                                      extension the speculative intellect
                                      becomes practical. Therefore the will and
                                      the intellect (taken simply) are a single
                                      power.

                                          communem esse. Ergo eadem ratione

                                          cognoscit et vult; et ita intellectus

                                          5. To know the difference of two
                                          things from one another it is
                                          necessary for the same person to know
                                          both of the things differentiated.
                                          Similarly it must be the same person
                                          who knows and wills. But for the
                                          knowing of the difference between any
                                          two things, as “between white and
                                          sweet,” it must be the same power
                                          which knows both. From this the
                                          Philosopher proves the existence of
                                          the central sense. By the same
                                          reasoning, then, it must be a single
                                          power which knows and wills; and so
                                          the intellect and the will are a
                                          single power, so it seems.

                                                  different from the

                                                  Philosopher. But the will is
                                                  listed under the appetitive.
                                                  The will is therefore a power
                                                  different from the intellect.

                          Nobilitas enim animae consistit in hoc quod est ad
                          imaginem Dei. Sed anima est ad imaginem Dei secundum
                          rationem vel intelligentiam: unde Augustinus dicit in
                          III super Genesim ad litteram: intelligamus in eo
                          factum hominem ad imaginem Dei, quo irrationabilibus
                          animantibus antecellit: id autem est ipsa ratio, vel
                          mens, vel intelligentia, vel si quo alio vocabulo
                          commodius appellatur. Ergo excellentissima potentia
                          animae est intellectus.

                          1. The nobility of the soul consists in its being made
                          to the image of God. But the soul is made to the image
                          of God in virtue of reason or intelligence. Hence
                          Augustine says: “Let us understand that man is made to
                          the image of God in that particular in which he excels
                          irrational animals; but that is reason, mind, or
                          intelligence, or whatever it may more appropriately be
                          called.” Therefore the most excellent power of the
                          soul is the intellect.

                              Ipse dicebat, quod sicut imago est in intellectu,
                              ita est etiam in voluntate, cum imago, secundum
                              Augustinum in Lib. de Trinit., attendatur secundum
                              memoriam, intelligentiam et voluntatem.- Sed
                              contra: ex quo nobilitas animae penes imaginem
                              attenditur, oportet quod illud sit excellentius
                              animae, ubi magis proprie invenitur ratio
                              imaginis. Sed etiam si imago sit in voluntate et
                              intellectu, magis proprie est in intellectu quam
                              in voluntate: unde Magister, in II Sent. dist. 16,
                              dicit, imaginem esse in cognitione veritatis,
                              similitudinem in dilectione boni. Ergo adhuc
                              oportet quod intellectus sit nobilior voluntate.

                              2. The answer was given that the image is in the
                              will as well as in the intellect, since according
                              to Augustine, the image is seen in memory,
                              intelligence, and will.—On the contrary, when the
                              nobility of the soul is considered from the
                              standpoint of the image, that in which the notion
                              of image is most properly verified must be the
                              most excellent part of the soul. Now even if the
                              image is in both the will and the intellect, it is
                              more properly in the intellect than in the will.
                              Hence the Master of the <i>Sentences</i> says that
                              the image is in the knowledge of truth and merely
                              a likeness in the love of good. Therefore the
                              intellect must still be nobler than the will.

                                  intellectus est nobilior quam voluntas.
                                  Probatio mediae. Cum actus specificentur ex
                                  terminis, oportet illum actum esse nobiliorem

                                  intellectus est secundum motum ad animam,

                                  anima ad res. Ergo, cum anima sit nobilior

                                  quam velle.

                                  3. Since we judge of the powers from their
                                  acts, that power must be the nobler whose act
                                  is the nobler. But to understand is nobler
                                  than to will. Therefore the intellect is
                                  nobler than the will. Proof of the minor:
                                  Since acts are specified by their terms, that
                                  act must be nobler whose term is nobler. But
                                  the act of the intellect involves a motion to
                                  the soul; that of the will, from the soul to
                                  things. Since the soul is nobler than external
                                  things, to understand is therefore nobler than
                                  to will.

                                      the more distant anything is from the
                                      lowest member, the higher it is. But the
                                      lowest among the powers of the soul is
                                      sense, and the will stands closer to sense
                                      than does the intellect. For the will
                                      shares with the sense powers the condition
                                      of its object, because the will is
                                      concerned with particulars just as is
                                      sense. We wish for a particular health and
                                      not health as something universal. But the
                                      intellect is concerned with universals.
                                      The intellect is therefore a higher power
                                      than the will.

                          Movens enim est naturaliter prius moto. Sed voluntas
                          est posterior intellectu; nihil enim amatur vel

                          1. The mover is naturally prior to the thing moved.
                          But the will is posterior to the intellect, for
                          nothing is loved or desired unless it is known,
                          according to Augustine. The will therefore does not
                          move the intellect.

                              quia voluntas vult ipsum intelligere. Sed voluntas
                              non vult aliquid nisi intellectum. Ergo prius
                              intellectus intellexit ipsum intelligere quam
                              voluntas illud vellet. Sed antequam intellectus
                              hoc intelligeret, oportet ponere quod voluntas
                              illud vellet, quia ponitur intellectus a voluntate
                              moveri. Ergo est abire in infinitum; vel dicendum,
                              quod voluntas non movet intellectum.

                              2. If the will moves the intellect to its act,
                              then it follows that the intellect understands
                              because the will wants it to understand. But the
                              will does not want anything unless it is
                              understood. The intellect therefore first
                              understands its understanding before the will
                              wills it. But before the intellect could
                              understand this, the will would have to be held to
                              will it, because the intellect is held to be moved
                              by the will. We should then have to go on to
                              infinity. But this is impossible. Therefore the
                              will does not move the intellect.

                                  But the will is a passive power, for appetite
                                  is a mover which is moved, as is said in
                                  <i>The Soul</i>. Hence it is moved by its
                                  object. But its object is the understood or
                                  apprehended good, as is said in the same book.
                                  Therefore the intellect or some other
                                  apprehensive power moves the will, and not the
                                  other way about.

                                      because of the ability to command which it
                                      has over the other. But to command belongs
                                      to reason, as is said in the
                                      <i>Ethics</i>. It therefore belongs to
                                      reason to command the other powers and not
                                      to the will.

                                          and agent is nobler than the thing
                                          moved or made. But the intellect is
                                          nobler than the will, at least in
                                          regard to sensible things, as has been
                                          explained. At least in regard to
                                          these, then, it is not moved by the
                                          will.

                                                      able to be forced by

                          Quia super illud Luc. XI, 34: lucerna corporis tui est
                          oculus tuus, Glossa, id est intentio. Sed oculus in
                          anima est ratio vel intellectus. Ergo intentio
                          pertinet ad rationem vel intellectum, et non ad
                          voluntatem.

                          1. In regard to the words of Luke (11: 34): “The light
                          of your body is your eye,” the Gloss explains: “That
                          is, ‘thy intention.” But the eye in the soul is reason
                          or the intellect. Intention therefore pertains to
                          reason or the intellect, not to the will.

                              rationem, et pro tanto oculo comparatur.- Sed
                              contra: actus superioris et prioris potentiae non
                              dependet ab actu posterioris. Sed voluntas est
                              prior intellectu in agendo, quia voluntas movet
                              intellectum, ut dictum est, art. praeced. Ergo
                              actus voluntatis non dependet a ratione. Si ergo
                              intentio esset actus voluntatis, nullo modo ad
                              rationem pertineret.

                              2. The answer was given that it pertains to the
                              will as subordinated to reason and in this respect
                              is compared to an eye.—On the contrary, the act of
                              a higher and prior power does not depend upon that
                              of a posterior power. The will, however, is prior
                              to the intellect in acting, because it moves the
                              intellect; as has been said. Then the act of the
                              will does not depend upon reason. If intention
                              were an act of the will, it would therefore in no
                              way pertain to reason.

                                  Sed dicendum, quod secundum hoc actus
                                  voluntatis dependet a ratione in quantum ad
                                  volendum praeexigitur cognitio voliti; et sic
                                  intentio, quamvis sit actus voluntatis, est
                                  aliquo modo rationis.- Sed contra: nullus
                                  actus voluntatis est qui cognitionem non
                                  praeexigat. Ergo secundum hoc nullus actus
                                  deberet attribui simpliciter voluntati, nec
                                  velle nec amare, sed voluntati et rationi
                                  simul; quod est falsum. Ergo et primum;
                                  scilicet quod intentio sit actus voluntatis.

                                  3. The answer was given that the act of the
                                  will does depend upon reason in this respect,
                                  that knowledge of the thing willed is a
                                  prerequisite for willing; and so, although
                                  intention is an act of the will, it
                                  nevertheless does in some sense belong to
                                  reason.—On the contrary, there is no act of
                                  the will for which knowledge is not a
                                  prerequisite. Consequently, according to the
                                  proposed solution no act should be attributed
                                  to the will simply, not even willing and
                                  loving, but to will and reason together. This,
                                  however, is false. Then so is the preceding
                                  contention that intention is an act of the
                                  will.

                                      4. The very name <i>intention</i> implies
                                      a relation to an end. But it belongs to
                                      reason to refer anything to an end.
                                      Intention therefore belongs to reason and
                                      not to will.

                                          solum est relatio in finem, sed actus
                                          voluntatis qui refertur in finem; et
                                          utrumque per nomen intentionis
                                          significatur.- Sed contra: actus ille
                                          relationi in finem prosternitur ut
                                          materiale formali. Sed magis
                                          denominatur aliquid a formali quam a
                                          materiali. Ergo intentio magis
                                          denominatur ab eo quod est rationis,
                                          quam ab eo quod est voluntatis; et sic
                                          magis debet poni actus rationis quam
                                          voluntatis.

                                          5. It was maintained in answer that
                                          there is in intention not only a
                                          relation to an end but also an act of
                                          the will which is referred to the end,
                                          and that both are meant by the name
                                          intention.—On the contrary, that act
                                          is made the substratum of the relation
                                          to an end as a material principle is
                                          made that of the formal. But a thing
                                          takes its name from its formal rather
                                          than its material principle. Intention
                                          accordingly takes its name rather from

                                              of nature. But the intention in
                                              the things of nature is more
                                              properly attributed to the prime

                                              themselves, since these are said
                                              to intend something only in so far
                                              as they are directed by the prime
                                              mover. Then among the powers of

                          1. It is impossible for the same act to be at the same
                          time good and bad. But it sometimes happens that there
                          is a bad act of will with a good intention, as when
                          someone wishes to steal in order to give an alms.
                          Intending and willing are therefore not the same act.

                              specie. Sed id quod est ad finem, et finis, se
                              habent quodammodo ut medium et extrema. Ergo
                              intentio finis et voluntas eius quod est ad finem,
                              differunt specie; et ita non sunt unus actus.

                              2. According to the Philosopher, a motion which
                              terminates in the mean and one which terminates in
                              the extreme are specifically different. But the
                              means to an end and the end are related about as
                              the mean and the extreme. The intention of the end
                              and the willing of the means are therefore
                              specifically different, and so they are not a
                              single act.

                                  fines in practicis sunt sicut principia in
                                  demonstrativis scientiis. Sed non est idem

                                  intelliguntur principia, et quo considerantur
                                  conclusiones. Quod patet ex hoc quod ex
                                  diversis habitibus eliciuntur: est enim
                                  intellectus habitus principiorum, sed scientia
                                  conclusionum. Ergo in operativis non est idem

                                  3. According to the Philosopher, in practical
                                  matters ends are comparable to principles in
                                  demonstrative sciences. But the act of the
                                  speculative intellect by which it understands
                                  principles is not the same as that by which it
                                  sees conclusions. This is shown by the fact
                                  that they are elicited from different habits;
                                  for understanding is the habit of principles,
                                  and science, that of conclusions. Then in
                                  matters of operation it is not the same act of
                                  the will by which we intend the end and will
                                  the means.

                                      finem, sunt diversa obiecta. Ergo non idem

                                      4. Acts are distinguished by their
                                      objects. But the end and the means are
                                      distinct. The intention of the end and the
                                      willing of the means are therefore not the
                                      same act.

                                              1. There cannot be two acts of the
                                              same power at the same time. But
                                              while the will is willing the
                                              means, it is at the same time
                                              intending the end. The intention
                                              of the end and the willing of the
                                              means are therefore not distinct
                                              acts.

                          1. Ignorance is not found in the will but in reason.
                          But the perversity of a choice is a sort of ignorance.
                          Hence also “every evil person is said to be ignorant”
                          with the ignorance of choice, as is explained in the
                          <i>Ethics.</i> Choice, then, pertains to reason.

                              2. Not only do inquiry and argumentation belong to
                              reason but also conclusion. But a choice is, as it
                              were, the conclusion of a deliberation, as is made
                              clear in the <i>Ethics.</i> Since deliberation
                              belongs to reason, choice will therefore also
                              belong to reason.

                                  virtutibus moralibus, est principale, quod
                                  formaliter complet rationem virtutis. Ergo
                                  electio pertinet ad prudentiam. Sed prudentia
                                  est in ratione. Ergo et electio.

                                  3. According to the Philosopher, the chief
                                  characteristic of moral virtue consists in
                                  choice. But, as he himself says, in the moral
                                  virtues the part of prudence is the most
                                  important factor, adding the last formal
                                  determinant to the essential nature of virtue.
                                  Choice therefore pertains to prudence. But
                                  prudence is in reason, and so choice also is.

                                      4. Choice implies a certain
                                      discrimination. But to discriminate is a
                                      function of reason. Therefore to choose
                                      also is.

                                              preference to the other, as
                                              Damascene explains. But to want is
                                              an act of the will, not of reason.
                                              Then so is to choose.

                                                  choice is the desire of what
                                                  has been previously
                                                  deliberated. But desire is a
                                                  function of the will, not of
                                                  reason. Then so is choice.
