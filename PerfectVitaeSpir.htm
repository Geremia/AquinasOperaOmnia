                Primum igitur considerare oportet, quod perfectum multipliciter
                dicitur. Est enim aliquid simpliciter perfectum; aliquid vero
                dicitur perfectum secundum quid. Simpliciter quidem perfectum
                est quod attingit ad finem eius quod ei competit secundum
                propriam rationem; secundum quid autem perfectum dici potest
                quod attingit ad finem alicuius eorum quae concomitantur
                propriam rationem: sicut animal simpliciter dicitur esse
                perfectum, quando ad hunc finem perducitur ut nihil ei desit ex
                his quae integritatem animalis vitae constituunt: puta cum nihil
                ei deficit ex numero et dispositione membrorum, et debita
                corporis quantitate, et virtutibus quibus operationes animalis
                vitae perficiuntur; secundum quid autem perfectum animal potest
                dici si sit perfectum in aliquo concomitanti, puta si sit
                perfectum in albedine, aut in odore, aut in aliquo huiusmodi.

                AT the outset of our work we must bear in mind that the word
                “perfect” is used in several senses. A thing may be absolutely
                perfect (<i>simpliciter</i>), or it may be perfect relatively
                (<i>secundum quid</i>) <i>.</i> That which is perfect absolutely
                attains the end to which, according to its own nature, it is
                adapted. That which is relatively perfect is that which attains
                to the perfection of one of those qualities which are
                concomitant to its own nature. Thus, an animal is said to be
                perfect absolutely when it attains to its end in so far as to
                lack nothing necessary to the integrity of animal life, when,
                for instance, it possesses the requisite number and the proper
                disposition of its limbs, and the faculties necessary for
                performing the operations of animal life. An animal is, on the
                other hand, perfect relatively, if it be perfect in any
                attribute concomitant to its nature, its colour, for instance,
                its odour, etc.

                    Sic igitur et in spirituali vita simpliciter quidem homo
                    perfectus dicitur ratione eius in quo principaliter
                    spiritualis vita consistit; sed secundum quid perfectus dici
                    potest ratione cuiuscumque quod spirituali vitae adiungitur.
                    Consistit autem principaliter spiritualis vita in caritate:
                    quam qui non habet, nihil esse spiritualiter reputatur: unde
                    apostolus I Cor. XIII, 2, dicit: si habuero prophetiam, et
                    noverim mysteria omnia et omnem scientiam, et si habuero
                    omnem fidem, ita ut montes transferam, caritatem autem non
                    habuero, nihil sum. Beatus etiam Ioannes apostolus totam
                    spiritualem vitam in dilectione consistere asserit, dicens I
                    Ioan. III, 14: nos scimus quoniam translati sumus de morte
                    in vitam, quoniam diligimus fratres. Qui non diligit, manet
                    in morte. Simpliciter igitur in spirituali vita perfectus
                    est qui est in caritate perfectus; secundum quid autem
                    perfectus dici potest, secundum quodcumque quod spirituali
                    vitae adiungitur: quod evidenter ex verbis sacrae Scripturae
                    ostendi potest.

                    In the spiritual life a man may be called perfect
                    absolutely, <i>i.e.</i> perfect in that wherein the
                    spiritual life principally consists. He may, also, be
                    perfect relatively, <i>i.e.</i> perfect in some quality
                    which is a condition of the spiritual life. Now, the
                    spiritual life consists, principally, in charity. For he
                    that is without charity is spiritually nought. Hence St.
                    Paul says (1 Cor. xiii. 2), “If I should have all prophecy,
                    and should know all mysteries and all knowledge; and if I
                    should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and
                    have not charity I am nothing.” And the blessed apostle John
                    declares, that the whole spiritual life consists in love,
                    saying, “We know that we have passed from death to life,
                    because we love the brethren. He that does not love abides
                    in death” (1 John iii. 14). Therefore, he that is perfect in
                    charity is said to be perfect in the spiritual life
                    absolutely. But he that is perfect relatively is perfect in
                    something incidental to the spiritual life This is evident
                    from the words of Holy Scripture.

                        Apostolus enim ad Col. III, 14, perfectionem
                        principaliter caritati attribuit: enumeratis enim multis
                        virtutibus, scilicet misericordia, benignitate
                        humilitate, etc., subdit: super omnia haec caritatem
                        habete, quae est vinculum perfectionis. Sed et secundum
                        intellectus cognitionem aliqui dicuntur esse perfecti.
                        Dicit enim idem apostolus, I ad Cor. XIV 20: malitia
                        parvuli estote; sensibus autem perfecti: et alibi in
                        eadem epistola (cap. I, 10): sitis perfecti in eodem
                        sensu et in eadem scientia: cum tamen, sicut dictum est,
                        quantumcumque quis habeat perfectam scientiam, sine
                        caritate nihil esse iudicetur. Sic etiam et perfectus
                        aliquis dici potest et secundum patientiam, quae opus
                        perfectum habet, ut Iacobus dicit, et secundum
                        quascumque alias virtutes. Nec hoc debet mirum videri:
                        quia etiam in malis aliquis dicitur esse perfectus,
                        sicut dicitur aliquis perfectus fur aut latro: et hoc
                        etiam modo loquendi interdum Scriptura utitur: dicitur
                        enim Isai. XXXII, 6: cor stulti faciet iniquitatem, ut
                        perficiat simulationem.

                      <td>
                        St. Paul considers charity as the chief element in
                        perfection. He enumerates several virtues, such as
                        mercy, benignity, and humility, and then concludes by
                        saying, “But above all these things, have charity which
                        is the bond of perfection” (Col iii). Some men are also
                        said to be perfect in point of understanding, “In malice
                        be children and in sense be perfect,” writes St. Paul to
                        the Corinthians (1 Epist. xiv. 20). Elsewhere in the
                        same epistle, he bids them “be perfect in the same mind
                        and in the same judgment” (1 Cor. i. 10); although, as
                        has been said, a man who has perfect knowledge, without
                        charity, must be judged to be nothing. Thus also, a man
                        may be said to be perfect in patience which “performs a
                        perfect work,” as St. James says, perfect also in other
                        virtues. There is nothing surprising in this manner of
                        speaking, for persons may be perfect in their vices.
                        Thus we may talk of a man being “a perfect thief” or “a
                        perfect robber.” Indeed, this mode of expression is used
                        in Holy Scripture, for Isaias says, “ his heart (i.e.
                        the heart of the fool) will work iniquity to perfect
                        hypocrisy” (xxxii. 6).

                Perfectione igitur circa caritatem principaliter considerata,
                plane accipi potest in quo perfectio spiritualis vitae

                secundario vero diligendus ex caritate est proximus, qui nobis
                quodam sociali iure coniungitur in beatitudinis participatione:

                THE perfection of the spiritual life may be understood as
                signifying principally perfection, as it regards charity. Now
                there are two precepts of charity, one pertaining to the love of
                God; the other referring to the love of our neighbour. These two
                precepts bear a certain order to each other, proportioned to the
                order of charity. That which is chiefly to be loved, by charity,
                is the Supreme Good, which makes us happy, that is to say, God.
                In the next place, we are, by charity, to love our neighbour,
                who is, by certain social bonds, united to us, either by the
                anticipation of beatitude, or in the enjoyment of it. Hence, we
                are bound in charity to love our neighbour, in order that,
                together with him, we may arrive at beatitude.

                    Hunc autem ordinem praeceptorum caritatis dominus in
                    Evangelio Matth. XXII, 37, ostendit dicens: diliges dominum
                    Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, et in tota anima tua, et in
                    tota mente tua. Hoc est maximum et primum mandatum. Secundum

                    spiritualis vitae perfectio in proximi dilectione: unde
                    dominus cum dixisset Matth. V, 44: diligite inimicos
                    vestros, et plura subiunxisset quae ad dilectionem proximi
                    pertinent, concludit in fine: estote ergo perfecti, sicut et

                    Our Lord establishes this order of charity in the Gospel of
                    St. Matthew (xxii. 37), where He says, “Love the Lord your
                    God with your whole heart and your whole soul and your whole
                    mind. This is the first and greatest commandment; and the
                    second is like to this: love your neighbour as yourself.”
                    Thus, the perfection of the spiritual life consists,
                    primarily and principally, in the love of God. Hence the
                    Lord, speaking to Abraham, says, “I am the Almighty God;
                    walk before me and be perfect” (Gen. xvii. 1). We walk
                    before God, not with bodily footsteps, but with the
                    affections of the mind. The perfection of the spiritual life
                    consists, secondarily, in the love of our neighbour.
                    Therefore when our Lord had said, “Love your enemies “
                    (Matt. v. 44), and had added several other precepts
                    regarding charity to our neighbour, He concluded by saying,
                    “Be therefore perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.”

                IN each of the two divisions of charity there are many degrees.
                As regards the love of God, the first and supreme degree of
                perfection of Divine love belongs to God alone. This is the case
                on account both of the One who is loved, and of the one who
                loves. It is the case on account of the loved one, because every
                object is loved in proportion to the qualities which make it
                lovable. It is the case on account of the lover, because an
                object is loved in proportion to the whole capacity of the one
                who loves. Now, as every object is lovable in proportion to its
                goodness, the goodness of God, which is infinite, must be
                infinitely lovable. But no creature can love infinitely, because
                no finite power is able to elicit an infinite act. Therefore,
                God alone, whose power of loving equals His Goodness, can love
                Himself perfectly in the first degree of perfection.

                affectionem, fortitudo ad executionem. Haec enim omnia in Dei
                dilectione sunt expendenda. Considerandum est autem, quod hoc

                THE only mode of loving God perfectly which is possible to
                rational creatures, is the mode which belongs to him that loves.
                In this manner a rational creature loves God with all the
                completeness of his nature. This is made clear in the precept of
                Divine love. We read in Deuteronomy (vi. 5), “Love the Lord your
                God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul and with all
                your strength.” St. Luke (x. 27) adds, “and with all your mind”;
                as if the “heart” regulated the intention, the “mind” the
                thought, the “soul” the affections, and the “strength” the
                activities. For all these must be devoted to the love of God. We
                must remember that this precept may be fulfilled in a two-fold
                manner. When anything is perfect, nothing is wanting to it.
                Hence, when the love of God is complete and perfect, He is loved
                with the whole heart, and soul, and strength; so that there is
                nothing within us which is not actually turned to God.

                    Sed hic perfectae dilectionis modus non est viatorum, sed
                    comprehensorum. Unde apostolus ad Philip. III, 12, dicit:
                    non quod iam acceperim, aut iam perfectus sim; sequor autem
                    si quo modo comprehendam; quasi tunc perfectionem expectans,
                    cum ad comprehensionem pervenerit, beatitudinis palmam
                    accipiens. Comprehensionem autem accipit non secundum quod
                    importat inclusionem aut terminationem comprehensi, sic enim
                    Deus incomprehensibilis est omni creaturae; sed secundum
                    quod comprehensio importat consecutionem eius quod aliquis
                    insequendo quaesivit. In illa enim caelesti beatitudine
                    semper actualiter intellectus et voluntas creaturae
                    rationalis in Deum fertur, cum in divina fruitione illa
                    beatitudo consistat. Beatitudo autem non est in habitu, sed
                    in actu. Et quia Deo creatura rationalis inhaerebit tanquam
                    ultimo fini, qui est veritas summa; in finem autem ultimum
                    omnia per intentionem referuntur, et secundum regulam ultimi
                    finis omnia exequenda disponuntur; consequens est quod in
                    illa beatitudinis perfectione creatura rationalis diliget
                    Deum ex toto corde, dum tota eius intentio feretur in Deum
                    ex omnibus quae cogitat, amat, aut agit; ex tota mente, dum
                    semper actualiter mens eius feretur in Deum, ipsum semper
                    videns, et omnia in ipso et secundum eius veritatem de
                    omnibus iudicans; ex tota anima, dum tota affectio eius ad
                    Deum diligendum feretur continue, et propter ipsum omnia
                    diligentur; ex tota fortitudine vel ex omnibus viribus, dum
                    omnium exteriorum actuum ratio erit Dei dilectio. Hic est
                    ergo secundus perfectae dilectionis divinae modus, qui est
                    beatorum.

                    This perfect mode of love is not possible to those who are
                    on the way to Heaven, but only to those who have reached
                    their goal. Hence, St. Paul writing to the Philippians says
                    (chap. iii. 12), “Not as though I had already attained, or
                    were already perfect; but I follow after, if I may by any
                    means apprehend.” He writes as if he were hoping for
                    perfection when he should have reached his goal, and when he
                    should have received the palm of the blessed. But St. Paul
                    does not use the word “attaining” in the sense of entire
                    possession or perfect comprehension, for God in this sense
                    is incomprehensible to every creature. By “attaining” he
                    means reaching the end which he has been following and
                    seeking. In Heaven, the understanding and the will of every
                    rational creature is turned to God; since it is in the
                    fruition of the Godhead that the beatitude of Heaven
                    consists. For beatitude exists not in habit, but in act.
                    And, since the rational creature will in Heaven cleave to
                    God, the Supreme Truth, as to its last End, all its
                    activities will, by intention, likewise be directed to that
                    Last End, and will all be disposed towards the attainment of
                    that End. Consequently, in that perfection of happiness, the
                    rational creature will love God with its whole heart; since
                    its whole intention in all its thoughts, deeds, and
                    affections, will be wholly directed to Him. It will love God
                    with its whole mind, for its mind will be ever actually
                    fixed on Him, beholding Him, and seeing all things in Him,
                    and judging of all things according to His truth. It will
                    love God with its whole soul, for all its affection will be
                    uninterruptedly fixed on Him, and for His sake it will love
                    all things. It will love God with all its strength, since
                    His love will be the motive governing all its exterior acts.
                    This, then, is the second mode of perfect love, and this
                    love is the portion only of the blessed.

                    First, we are taught to refer everything to God as to our

                    eat or drink, or whatsoever else you do, do all to the glory
                    of God.” We fulfil this precept when we order our life to
                    the service of God; and when, in consequence, all our
                    actions are, virtually, directed to Him, save those that are

                            expresses this love in the following words: “For
                            whether we be transported in mind it is to God, or
                            whether we be sober, it is for you; for the charity
                            of Christ presses us” (2 Cor. v. 13).

                WHEN St. Paul had said to the Philippians, “Not as though I had
                already attained, or were already perfect,” he continued, “but I
                follow after, if I may by any means apprehend.” Shortly
                afterwards he added, “Let us therefore, as many as are perfect,
                be thus minded.” From these words it is plain that, although the
                perfection of the blessed is not possible to us in this life, we
                ought, nevertheless, to endeavour, as far as we can, to emulate
                it. Now, it is in this effort that consists the perfection in
                this life, to which we are invited by the counsels.

                    Manifestum namque est quod humanum cor tanto intensius in

                    igitur tanto perfectius animus hominis ad Deum diligendum
                    fertur, quanto magis ab affectu temporalium removetur. Unde
                    Augustinus dicit in libro LXXXIII quaestionum quod venenum
                    caritatis est cupiditas temporalium rerum, augmentum vero
                    eius est cupiditatis diminutio; perfectio vero nulla
                    cupiditas. Omnia igitur consilia, quibus ad perfectionem
                    invitamur, ad hoc pertinent ut animus hominis ab affectu
                    temporalium avertatur, ut sic liberius mens tendat in Deum,
                    contemplando, amando, et eius voluntatem implendo.

                    It is abundantly clear, that the human heart is more
                    intensely attracted to one object, in proportion as it is
                    withdrawn from a multiplicity of desires. Therefore, the
                    more a man is delivered from solicitude concerning temporal
                    matters, the more perfectly he will be enabled to love God.
                    Hence St. Augustine says (<i
                      >De Diversis Quaestionibus Octaginta Tribus</i
                    >, Lib. lxxxiii. Quest.1) that, the hope of gaining, or
                    keeping, material wealth, is the poison of charity; that, as
                    charity increases, cupidity diminishes; and that, when
                    charity becomes perfect, cupidity ceases to exist. Hence,
                    all the counsels which call man to perfection tend to
                    withdraw his affections from temporal objects; so that, his
                    sour is enabled the more freely to turn to God by
                    contemplating Him, loving Him, and fulfilling His will.

                Inter temporalia vero bona primo relinquenda occurrunt bona
                extrinseca, quae divitiae nuncupantur; et hoc dominus consulit
                Matth. XIX, 21, dicens: si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende
                omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus; et habebis thesaurum in
                caelo: et veni, sequere me: cuius consilii utilitas consequenter
                ostenditur. Primo quidem per evidentiam facti. Nam cum
                adolescens, qui de via perfectionis quaesierat hoc audisset,
                abiit tristis. Causaque tristitiae, ut Ieronymus dicit super
                Matth., redditur: erat enim habens multas possessiones, idest
                spinas, et tribulos, quae sementem dominicam suffocaverunt. Et
                Chrysostomus idem exponens dicit quod: non similiter detinentur
                qui pauca habent, et qui multis abundant: quoniam adiectio
                divitiarum maiorem accendit flammam, et violentior fit cupido.
                Augustinus etiam dicit in Epist. ad Paulinum et Therasiam, quod
                terrena diliguntur artius adepta, quam concupita constringant;
                nam unde iuvenis ille tristis discessit, nisi quia magnas
                habebat divitias? Aliud est enim nolle incorporare quae desunt,
                aliud iam incorporata divellere. Illa enim velut extranea
                repudiantur, ista velut membra praeciduntur.

              <td>
                THE first among the material possessions to be renounced are
                those extrinsic goods that we call riches. Our Lord counselled
                us to relinquish them when He said, “If you would be perfect,
                go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you shall
                have treasure in Heaven; and come, follow me” (Matt. xix. 21).
                The utility of this counsel is evident. First, we have the
                evidence of a fact. For, when the young man who was inquiring
                about perfection heard the words of Christ, he went away sad.
                And “Behold,” says St. Jerome in his commentary on St. Matthew,
                “the cause of this sadness. He had many possessions, which, like
                thorns and briars, choked the seed of the Lord’s words.” St.
                Chrysostom, writing on the same passage, says that, “they who
                possess but little, and they that abound in riches, do not
                encounter the same obstacles; for the renunciation of wealth
                enkindles a more mighty fire and causes avarice to grow
                greater.” St. Augustine likewise says, in his epistle to
                Paulinus and Therasia, that “when earthly things are
                inordinately loved, those that we already possess fetter us more
                closely than those that we desire; for why did this young man go
                away sad, save because he had great possessions? For, it is one
                thing not to be anxious to acquire the things that we lack, but
                quite another to be ready to divest ourselves of those that we
                possess. For the things that are not ours we can repudiate as
                extrinsic to ourselves, but our own possessions are dear to us
                as the limbs of our body.”

                    Secundo vero utilitas praedicti consilii manifestatur per
                    domini verba quae subdidit: quia dives difficile intrabit in
                    regnum caelorum. Ut enim Ieronymus dicit, quia divitiae
                    habitae difficile contemnuntur. Non dixit: impossibile est
                    divitem intrare in regnum caelorum, sed difficile: ubi
                    difficile ponitur, non impossibilitas praetenditur, sed
                    raritas demonstratur. Et, sicut Chrysostomus dicit super
                    Matth., procedit ulterius dominus ad ostendendum quod est
                    impossibile, dicens: facilius est camelum per foramen acus
                    transire, quam divitem intrare in regnum caelorum. Ex quibus
                    verbis, ut Augustinus dicit in Lib. de quaest. Evang.,
                    discipuli adverterunt, omnes qui divitias cupiunt, in
                    divitum haberi numero: alioquin cum pauci sint divites in
                    comparatione multitudinis pauperum, non quaesivissent
                    discipuli: quis ergo poterit salvus esse?

                  <td>
                    The utility of this counsel is again shown us by those words
                    of our Lord, “A rich man shall hardly enter into the Kingdom
                    of Heaven.” St. Jerome tells us the reason of this
                    difficulty. “It is,” he says, “because it is hard to despise
                    the riches that we possess. Our Lord does not say that it is
                    impossible, but that it is <i>hard,</i> for a rich man to
                    enter the Kingdom of Heaven. For difficulty does not mean
                    impossibility, but signifies infrequency of performance.”
                    And, as St. Chrysostom, says on the Gospel of St. Matthew,
                    If the Lord goes further, proving that it is impossible,
                    “For,” He says, “it is easier for a camel to pass through
                    the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom
                    of Heaven.” “From these words,” says St. Augustine (<i
                      >lib. de Quest. Evang.),</i
                    >
                    “the disciples understood that all they that covet riches
                    are included in the number of the rich; otherwise,
                    considering how small is the number of the wealthy in
                    comparison to the vast multitude of the poor, they would not
                    have asked, “Who then shall be saved?”

                        illud apostoli II ad Cor. VIII, 10: consilium in hoc do:
                        hoc enim utile est.

                        From these two utterances of Our Lord it is clearly
                        evident, that he that possesses riches, will, with
                        difficulty, enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. For, as He
                        says elsewhere (Matt. xiii. 22), “The cares of this
                        world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the Word,
                        and it becomes fruitless.” In truth, it is impossible
                        for those to enter Heaven who love money inordinately.
                        Far easier is it for a camel to pass through the eye of
                        a needle. The latter feat would indeed be impossible
                        without violating the laws of nature. Bit if a covetous
                        man were admitted into Heaven it would be contrary to
                        Divine Justice, which is more unfailing than any natural
                        law. Hence, we see the reasonableness of Our Lord’s
                        counsel; for a counsel is given concerning that which is
                        most useful, according to the words of St. Paul (2 Cor.
                        viii. 10), “Herein I give my advice, for this is
                        profitable for you.”

                            If we wish to attain eternal life, it is more
                            advantageous for us to renounce our possessions than
                            to retain them. They that possess wealth will hardly
                            enter into the Kingdom of Heaven; the reason being
                            got it is difficult to prevent our affections from
                            being attached to riches, and that such an
                            Attachment makes admission into Heaven impossible,
                            Therefore, Our Lord, with good reason, has
                            counselled the renunciation of riches as our most
                            profitable course.

                                Sed potest aliquis contra praemissa obicere quia
                                Matthaeus et Zachaeus divitias habuerunt, et
                                tamen in regnum caelorum intraverunt. Sed hoc
                                Hieronymus solvens dicit: considerandum est quod
                                eo tempore quo intraverunt, divites esse
                                desierant. Sed cum Abraham nunquam dives esse
                                desierit, quin potius in divitiis fuerit
                                mortuus, et eas in morte reliquerit filiis, ut
                                in Genesi legitur; videtur secundum praedicta
                                non fuisse perfectus; cum tamen ad eum dominus
                                dixerit, Gen. XVII, 1: esto perfectus. Quae
                                quidem quaestio solvi non posset, si perfectio
                                Christianae vitae in ipsa dimissione divitiarum

                                It may be objected, however, that St. Matthew,
                                St. Bartholomew, and Zaccheus were rich;
                                nevertheless, they entered into Heaven. St.
                                Jerome replies, that, “we must remember that
                                they had ceased to be wealthy at the time of
                                their admission to Heaven.”Abraham, however,
                                never lost his wealth, but, as we read in
                                Genesis, died a rich man, bequeathing his
                                property to his sons. How then could he be
                                perfect? Nevertheless God said to him, “Be
                                perfect” (Gen. xvii. 1). This question cannot be
                                answered if we hold that it is the mere
                                renunciation of wealth which constitutes
                                perfection. For, if such were the case, no one
                                who was rich could be perfect. Our Lord does not
                                say that perfection lies in giving up what we
                                possess, but He mentions this renunciation of
                                our possessions as a <i>means</i> to perfection.
                                We see this by His own words, “If you would be
                                perfect, go, sell all that you hast and give to
                                the poor, and follow me.”The following of Christ
                                constitutes perfection; the sacrifice of riches
                                is a means to perfection.

                                    unde Hieronymus dicit super Matth.: quia non

                                    Origenes etiam in eodem loco dicit, quod hoc
                                    quod dicitur: si vis perfectus esse etc.,
                                    non sic intelligitur ut in ipso tempore quo

                                    St. Jerome, commenting on the Gospel of St.
                                    Matthew, says, “As if to show that merely
                                    giving up our possessions does not suffice
                                    to make us perfect, Peter mentions that
                                    wherein perfection consists, when he says,
                                    ‘We have followed you.’” Origen, again, says
                                    on the same passage, “We are not to gather
                                    from the words, ‘if you would be perfect’
                                    that when a man has given his goods to the
                                    poor, he becomes perfect at once. What we
                                    are to understand is, that from that time,
                                    his contemplation of God begins to attract
                                    him to all virtues.” A rich man may be
                                    perfect if his affections be not entangled
                                    in his possessions, but devoted entirely to
                                    God. In this way Abraham was perfect.
                                    Although he possessed wealth, he was
                                    detached from it. The words of the Lord
                                    spoken to him, “Walk before me and be
                                    perfect,” make it clear, that the perfection
                                    of the Patriarch was to consist in walking
                                    before God, and in loving Him with a love so
                                    perfect that it reached to contempt of
                                    himself, and of all that belonged to him. So
                                    perfect, indeed, was his love of God, that
                                    he showed it by his readiness to slay his
                                    son. Wherefore the Lord said to him,
                                    “Because you have done this thing, and have
                                    not spared your only begotten son for my
                                    sake, I will bless you” (Gen. xxii. 16).

                                        perfect, we will refer him for an answer
                                        to what has been already said. Our Lord,
                                        we repeat, did not mean, by this
                                        counsel, that rich men cannot be
                                        perfect, or cannot enter into the
                                        Kingdom of Heaven; but He meant that
                                        they cannot do so easily. The virtue of
                                        Abraham was very great; for, although
                                        possessed of great wealth, his heart was
                                        detached from riches. The virtue,
                                        likewise, of Samson was eminent, for,
                                        armed only with the jawbone of an ass,
                                        he slew many of his enemies;
                                        nevertheless the instruction which he
                                        gave to the soldier to take up arms in
                                        combat with his foes, was not
                                        unprofitable. Neither, then, is it
                                        useless to counsel those that seek
                                        perfection to part with their earthly
                                        goods, although Abraham was perfect with
                                        all his wealth.

                                            We must not draw conclusions from
                                            wonderful deeds; for the weak among
                                            us are more capable of wondering at
                                            and praising such deeds, than of
                                            imitating them. Hence we read in
                                            Sirach xxxi. 8, “Blessed is the rich
                                            man who is found without blemish;
                                            who has not gone after gold, nor put
                                            his trust in money nor in
                                            treasures.” This passage proves that
                                            the rich man who does not sin by
                                            covetousness, nor by pride, must,
                                            indeed, be a man of tried virtue,
                                            with a heart adhering closely, by
                                            perfect charity, to God. St. Paul
                                            bids Timothy to “charge the rich of
                                            this world not to be high-minded,
                                            nor to trust in the uncertainty of
                                            riches”(1 Tim. vi. 17). The greater
                                            the blessedness and the virtue of
                                            the wealthy who obey this behest,
                                            the smaller is their number. Thus
                                            Sirach (xxxi) speaking of a virtuous
                                            and yet a wealthy man, says: “Who is
                                            he, and we will praise him? for he
                                            has done wonderful things in his
                                            life.” For truly, he who, while
                                            abounding in riches has not set his
                                            heart upon his treasures, has indeed
                                            done wonderful things, and without
                                            the shadow of a doubt has proved
                                            himself perfect. The same chapter of
                                            Sirach continues, “Who has been
                                            tried thereby,” that is to say, who
                                            has been tested as to whether he can
                                            live a sinless life in the midst of
                                            wealth, “and made perfect.” This is
                                            as much as to say: “such a man is
                                            indeed rare, and his virtue will
                                            merit for him eternal glory.” This
                                            test of Sirach bears out the saying
                                            of Our Lord, that a rich man shall
                                            hardly enter into the Kingdom of
                                            Heaven.

                Ut autem secundam perfectionis viam convenientius ostendamus,
                accipiendum est verbum Augustini, qui dicit in 12 de Trin.:
                tanto magis inhaeretur Deo, quanto minus diligitur proprium.
                Secundum igitur ordinem propriorum bonorum quae homo propter
                Deum contemnit, est attendendus ordo eorum quibus ad perfectam
                Dei inhaesionem pervenitur.

                IN order the more clearly to understand this second means of
                perfection, we should reflect on the words of St. Augustine
                which occur in xii. <i>de Trinit.</i>: “The less a man loves his
                private possessions, the more closely will he cleave to God.”
                Hence, according to the order of the things which a man
                sacrifices for the love of God, will be the order of those
                things which will enable him to adhere perfectly to God.

                    et filios et fratres et sorores (...) non potest meus esse

                    The things to be first given up, are those least closely
                    united to ourselves. Therefore, the renunciation of material
                    possessions, which are extrinsic to our nature, must be our
                    first step on the road to perfection. The next objects to be
                    sacrificed will be those which are united to our nature, by
                    a certain communion and necessary affinity. Hence, Our Lord
                    says, “If any man comes to me, and does not hate his father,
                    and mother, and wife, and children, and brothers, and
                    sisters, yes, and his own life also, he cannot be my
                    disciple” (Luke xiv. 26).

                        But, as St. Gregory says, “It is permissible to inquire
                        how we can be commanded to hate our parents and
                        kinsfolk, when we are bidden to love even our enemies?
                        If, however, we carefully consider this precept, we
                        shall be able to obey it by means of discretion. For,
                        when we refuse to listen to one who, savouring earthly
                        things, suggests to us to do what is wrong, we at the
                        same time love him and hate him. Thus we must bear this
                        discreet hatred towards our kinsfolk, loving in them
                        what they are in themselves, and hating them when they
                        hinder our progress towards God. For, whosoever desires
                        eternal life must, for the love of God, be independent
                        of father and mother, of wife, children, and relations,
                        yea, detached from self, in order that he may the better
                        know God, for whose sake he loses sight of every other.
                        For it is but too clear, that earthly affections warp
                        the mind, and blunt its keenness.”

                            Now amongst all relationships the conjugal tie does,
                            more than any other, engross men’s hearts. So that
                            our first parent said (Gen. ii. 24): “A man shall
                            leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his
                            wife.” Hence, they who are aiming at perfection,
                            must, above all things, avoid the bond of marriage,
                            which, in a pre-eminent degree, entangles men in
                            earthly concerns. This is the reason which St. Paul
                            gives for his counsel concerning continence. “He
                            that is without a wife, is solicitous for the things
                            that belong to the Lord, how he may please God. But
                            he that is with a wife, is solicitous for the things
                            of the world, how he may please his wife” (1 Cor.
                            vii. 32).

                                Ut ergo homo liberius Deo vacet, eique

                                via est perpetua observatio castitatis. Habet

                                impulsu. Inter omnes autem interiores passiones
                                maxime rationem absorbet concupiscentia carnis,
                                et venereorum usus: unde Augustinus dicit in I
                                Lib. Soliloquiorum: nihil esse sentio quod magis
                                ex arce deiciat animum virilem, quam blandimenta
                                feminae, corporumque ille contactus, sine quo
                                uxor haberi non potest. Et ideo continentiae via

                                consequendam: quam quidem viam apostolus
                                consulit I ad Cor. VII, 25: de virginibus
                                praeceptum domini non habeo; consilium autem do
                                tanquam misericordiam consecutus (...) ut sim
                                fidelis.

                                Therefore, the second means whereby a man may be
                                more free to devote himself to God, and to
                                cleave more perfectly to Him, is by the
                                observance of perpetual chastity. But continence
                                possesses the further advantage of affording a
                                peculiar facility to the acquirement of
                                perfection. For, the soul is hindered in its
                                free access to God, not only by the love of
                                exterior things, but much more by force of
                                interior passions. And, amongst these passions,
                                the lust of the flesh does, beyond all others,
                                overpower reason. Hence in
                                <i>Soliloquiorum</i> (<i>lib.</i> 1) St.
                                Augustine says, “I know nothing which doth more
                                cast a manly soul down from the tower of its
                                strength, than do the caresses of a woman, and
                                the physical contact essential to marriage.”
                                Thus, continence is most necessary to
                                perfection. It is the way pointed out by St.
                                Paul (1 Cor. vii. 25), “Concerning virgins I
                                have no commandment of the Lord, but I give
                                counsel, as having obtained mercy of the Lord to
                                be faithful.”

                                    The advantage of virginity is also shown in
                                    St. Matthew (xix. 12). When the disciples
                                    said to Our Lord, “If the case of a man with
                                    his wife be so, it is not expedient to
                                    marry,” He answered, “All men take not this
                                    word but those to whom it is given.” By
                                    these words we see the difficulty involved
                                    in continence, and the inadequacy of human
                                    virtue to lead such a life without the grace
                                    of God. We read in the Book of Wisdom (viii.
                                    21), “I knew that I could not otherwise be
                                    continent except God gave it; and this also
                                    was a point of wisdom to know whose gift it
                                    was.” This saying is also borne out by the
                                    words of St. Paul (1 Cor. vii. 7), “I wish
                                    all men were as myself” (i.e. a virgin),
                                    “but everyone has his proper gift from God;
                                    one after this manner, and another after
                                    that.” In these words he distinctly asserts
                                    that continence is a gift of God.

                                        But, lest anyone should, on the other
                                        hand, fail to use his own endeavour to
                                        obtain this gift, our Lord exhorts all
                                        men to it. He first gives an
                                        illustration, saying, “There are eunuchs
                                        who have made themselves eunuchs”;
                                        “not,” as St. Chrysostom explains, “by
                                        mutilation, but by resisting evil
                                        thoughts.” Then Christ goes on to invite
                                        all men to follow this example, for the
                                        sake of its reward. “There are some,” He
                                        continues, “who have made themselves
                                        eunuchs for the Kingdom of Heaven.” The
                                        Book of Wisdom also says (iv. 2), “The
                                        chaste generation triumphs, crowned for
                                        ever, winning the reward of undefiled
                                        conflicts.” Finally, Our Lord exhorts
                                        men to continence, by the words, “He
                                        that can take, let him take it.” “This,”
                                        says St. Jerome, “is the voice of the
                                        Lord encouraging his soldiers to win the
                                        prize of chastity. It is as if He said:
                                        he that can fight, let him fight and
                                        conquer.”

                                            corporis, sed animi virtus est.
                                            Virtutes autem animi aliquando in
                                            opere manifestantur, aliquando in
                                            habitu latent. Quocirca sicut non

                                            Petro, qui passus est, et in Ioanne,

                                            meritum est continentiae in Ioanne,
                                            qui nullas expertus est nuptias, et
                                            in Abraham, qui filios generavit. Et

                                            Christo militaverunt. Dicat ergo
                                            fidelis continens: ego quidem non
                                            sum melior quam Abraham; sed melior
                                            est castitas caelibum quam castitas
                                            nuptiarum; quarum Abraham unam
                                            habuit in usu, ambas in habitu:
                                            caste quippe coniugaliter vixit.
                                            Esse autem castus sine coniugio
                                            potuit, sed tunc non oportuit. Ego
                                            vero facilius non utor nuptiis,
                                            quibus est usus Abraham, quam sic
                                            uterer nuptiis quemadmodum est usus
                                            Abraham; et ideo melior sum illis

                                            possunt quod ego; non illis qui

                                            example of Abraham, and of other
                                            just men of old, who were perfect
                                            without refraining from matrimony,
                                            we will answer them in the words
                                            written by St. Augustine in his
                                            book, <i>de bono conjugali.</i> “The
                                            continence that is a virtue is that
                                            of the mind, not of the body. And
                                            virtue is sometimes revealed in
                                            deeds, and sometimes lies disguised
                                            as a habit. The patience of John who
                                            did not suffer martyrdom was equal
                                            in merit to that of Peter who was
                                            slain; and Abraham who fathered
                                            sons, was equal in continence to the
                                            virgin John. The marriage of the one
                                            and the celibacy of the other
                                            fought, each in their season, for
                                            Christ. Therefore, any one of the
                                            faithful who observes continence may
                                            say, “I am certainly no better than
                                            Abraham; but the chastity of
                                            celibacy is superior to the chastity
                                            of married life. Abraham practised
                                            the one actually, the other
                                            habitually. For he lived chastely as
                                            a husband, and could have lived
                                            continently had he been unmarried.
                                            The latter state, however, did not
                                            befit the time at which he lived. It
                                            is easier for me not to marry at
                                            all, (although Abraham married) than
                                            to live such a married life as he
                                            lived. Therefore, am I better than
                                            they, who could not, by continence
                                            of heart, do what I do; but I am not
                                            better than they, who, on account of
                                            the different time at which they
                                            lived, did not what I do. Had it
                                            been fitting, they, in their time,
                                            would have accomplished far better
                                            than I, that which I now do; but I,
                                            even were it now required, could not
                                            do what they achieved.”

                                                agrees with what has already

                                                Abraham had arrived at such
                                                perfection that his heart never
                                                wavered in love to God on
                                                account either of temporal
                                                possessions or of wedded life.

                SINCE chastity is so difficult a virtue that, in Our Lord’s
                words, not all men “take it,” but those only “to whom it is
                given,” it is necessary for those who desire to live a life of
                continence, so to conduct themselves as to avoid all that might
                prove an obstacle in the prosecution of their design. Now there
                are three principal hindrances to continence. The first arises
                from the body. The second from the mind. The third from external
                circumstances, whether they be of persons or of things.

                    Ex parte quidem proprii corporis: quia, sicut apostolus
                    dicit ad Gal. V, 17, caro concupiscit adversus spiritum.
                    Cuius carnis opera ibidem esse dicuntur fornicatio,
                    immunditia, impudicitia et cetera huiusmodi. Haec autem
                    concupiscentia carnis est lex de qua dicit Rom. VII, 23:
                    video aliam legem in membris meis repugnantem legi mentis
                    meae. Quanto autem caro magis fovetur per ciborum
                    affluentiam et deliciarum mollitiem, tanto huiusmodi
                    concupiscentia magis crescit: unde Hieronymus dicit: venter
                    mero aestuans cito despumat in libidinem: et Prov. XX 1:
                    luxuriosa res est vinum; et Iob XL, 16, dicitur de Behemoth
                    per quem Diabolus significatur: sub umbra dormit in secreto
                    calami in locis humentibus: quod exponens Gregorius 33
                    Moral. dicit: loca humentia sunt opera voluptuosa. Pes
                    quippe in arida terra non labitur, fixus vero in lubrica vix
                    tenetur. In locis ergo humentibus iter vitae praesentis
                    faciunt qui in hac ad iustitiam recti stare non possunt.
                    Oportet igitur continentiae viam assumentibus, carnem
                    propriam, abstractis deliciis, vigiliis et ieiuniis et
                    huiusmodi exercitiis castigare.

                    The body is an obstacle to continence. As St. Paul says,
                    “The flesh lusts against the Spirit” (Gal. v. 17), and “the
                    works of the flesh are fornication, uncleanness, unchastity
                    and the like.” Concupiscence is that law of the flesh, of
                    which, in his epistle to the Romans, St. Paul says, “I see
                    another law in my members fighting against the law of my
                    mind” (Rom. vii. 23). Now the more the flesh is pampered, by
                    superabundance of food, and by effeminacy of life, the more
                    will its concupiscence increase. For, as St. Jerome says, “A
                    man heated with wine will quickly give the rein to lust.”
                    The book of Proverbs warns us against wine as “a luxurious
                    thing” (Prov. xx.1). Job, again, tells us that Behemoth (by
                    whom Satan is signified) “sleeps under the shadow, in the
                    covert of the reed and in moist places” (chap. xl. 16). St.
                    Gregory (33 <i>Moral.</i>) thus interprets this passage.
                    “Moist places,” he says, “betoken voluptuous works. We do
                    not slip on dry ground; but, we have no sure foothold on
                    slippery soil. Hence, those men pursue the journey of this
                    present life in moist places, who cannot hold themselves
                    upright in justice.” He, then, who desires to undertake a
                    life of continence, must chastise his flesh, by abstention
                    from pleasure, and by fasts, vigils, and such like
                    exercises.

                        carnis, inquit, curam ne feceritis in desideriis. Recte

                        St. Paul sets before us his own conduct as an example in
                        this respect, “Every one who strives for mastery,
                        refrains himself from all things... I chastise my body
                        and bring it into subjection, lest, perhaps, when I have
                        preached to others, I myself should become a castaway”
                        (1 Cor. ix. 25), What the Apostle practised in deed, he
                        taught in word. In his Epistle to the Romans (xiii. 14),
                        after his warning against “chambering and impurities,”
                        he concludes, “make no provision for the flesh in its
                        concupiscences.” He rightly lays stress upon the
                        concupiscences of the flesh, i.e. its desire for
                        pleasure; for it is incumbent on us to make provision
                        for what is necessary for our body, and St. Paul himself
                        says (Eph. v. 29), “No man ever hates his own flesh, but
                        he nourishes and cherishes it.”

                            I, 16: auferte malum cogitationum vestrarum ab
                            oculis meis. Malae enim cogitationes plerumque ad
                            male faciendum inducunt; unde dicitur Mich. II, 1:
                            vae qui cogitatis inutile: et statim subditur: et
                            operamini malum in cubilibus vestris. Inter ceteras
                            tamen cogitationes malas magis ad peccandum
                            inclinant cogitationes de delectationibus carnis.
                            Cuius ratio etiam secundum philosophorum doctrinam
                            duplex assignari potest. Una quidem quia, cum talis
                            delectatio sit homini connaturalis, et a iuventute
                            connutrita, facile in ipsam appetitus fertur, cum
                            eam cogitatio proponit. Unde philosophus dicit 2
                            Ethic. quod delectationem diiudicare non possumus de
                            facili quin accipiamus eam. Secunda ratio est, quia,
                            ut idem dicit in 3 Ethic., delectabilia in
                            particulari sunt magis voluntaria quam in
                            universali. Manifestum est autem quod per moram
                            cogitationis ad particularia quaeque descendimus:
                            unde per cogitationem diuturnam maxime libido
                            provocatur: et propter hoc apostolus I ad Cor., VI,
                            18, dicit: fugite fornicationem: quia, ut Glossa
                            ibidem dicit, cum aliis vitiis potest expectari
                            conflictus; sed hanc fugite, ne approximetis, quia
                            non aliter melius potest vinci.

                            An obstacle to continence arises also from the mind,
                            if we dwell on unchaste thoughts. The Lord says by
                            His prophet, “Take away the evil of your devices
                            from my eyes” (Isa. i. 16). For, evil thoughts often
                            lead to evil deeds. Hence the Prophet Micah says
                            (ii. 1), “Woe to you who devise that which is
                            unprofitable,” and he immediately continues, “and
                            work evil in your beds.” Amongst all evil thoughts,
                            those which most powerfully incline unto sin, are
                            thoughts concerning carnal gratification.
                            Philosophers assign two reasons for this fact.
                            First, they say, that as concupiscence is innate in
                            man, and grows with him from youth upwards, he is
                            easily carried away by it, when his imagination sets
                            it before him. Hence Aristotle says (2 Ethics), that
                            “we cannot easily judge of pleasure, unless we enjoy
                            it.” The second reason is given by the same
                            philosopher (3 <i>Ethics</i>), “Pleasure is more
                            voluntary in particular cases than in general.” It
                            is clear that by dallying with a thought we descend
                            to particulars; hence, by daily thoughts we are
                            incited to lust. On this account St. Paul (1 Cor. vi
                            18) warns us to “Flee from fornication”; for, as the
                            Gloss says, “It is permissible to await a conflict
                            with other vices; but this one must be shunned; for
                            in no other means can it be overcome.”

                                such obstacles. The first and chief remedy is to
                                keep the mind busied in prayer and in the
                                contemplation of Divine things. This lesson is
                                taught us in St. Paul’s epistle to the Ephesians
                                (v. 18), wherein he says, “Be not drunk with
                                wine wherein is luxury; but be filled with the
                                Holy Spirit, speaking to yourselves in psalms
                                and hymns and spiritual canticles” (which
                                pertain to contemplation), “singing and making
                                melody in your hearts to the Lord” (whereby
                                prayer is implied). Hence in Isaiah (xlviii. 9),
                                the Lord says, “For by my praise I will bridle
                                you, lest you should perish.”For the divine
                                praise is, as it were, a bridle on the soul,
                                checking it from sin.

                                    flesh.”’ And St. Paul in his exhortation to
                                    Timothy (1 Tim. iv. 12) says, Be an example
                                    of the faithful in word, in conversation, in
                                    charity, in faith, in chastity,” immediately

                                        concupiscence, is to occupy the mind
                                        with good thoughts. St. Chrysostom, in
                                        his commentary on the Gospel of St.
                                        Matthew, says that, “physical mutilation
                                        is not such a curb to temptation, and
                                        such a source of peace to the mind, as
                                        is a habit of bridling the thoughts.”
                                        St. Paul also says to the Philippians
                                        (iv. 8), “For the rest, brethren,
                                        whatsoever things are true, whatsoever
                                        modest, whatsoever just, whatsoever

                                            The fourth help to chastity is to
                                            shun idleness, and to engage in
                                            bodily toil. We read in the book of
                                            Sirach (xxxiii. 29), “Idleness has
                                            taught much evil.” Idleness is
                                            pre-eminently an incentive to sins
                                            of the flesh. Hence Ezechiel says
                                            (xvi. 49), “Behold, this was the
                                            iniquity of Sodom your sister,
                                            pride, fulness of bread, abundance,
                                            and idleness.” St. Jerome likewise
                                            writes, in his letter to the monk
                                            Rusticus, “Do some work, that so the
                                            devil may always find you employed.”

                                                disquietude. St. Jerome relates,
                                                in the epistle quoted above,
                                                that, in a congregation of
                                                cenobites there dwelt a young
                                                man who could not, by means of
                                                fasting or any laborious work,
                                                free himself from temptations of
                                                the flesh. The superior of the
                                                monastery, seeing that the youth
                                                was on the point of yielding,
                                                adopted the following means for
                                                his relief. He commanded one of

                                                Superior. Witnesses were called,

                                                part, This treatment was
                                                continued for a year. At the end
                                                of that time, the superior
                                                questioned the youth about his
                                                old train of thought. “Father,”
                                                was the reply, “I am scarcely
                                                permitted to live. How, in such

                                                    A great obstacle to
                                                    continence arises from
                                                    extrinsic circumstances,
                                                    such as constant intercourse
                                                    with women. We read in
                                                    Sirach (ix. 9), “Many have
                                                    perished by the beauty of a
                                                    woman, and hereby lust is

                                                    her conversation burns as
                                                    fire.” And, in the same
                                                    chapter, the following
                                                    safeguard is proposed
                                                    against these dangers: “Do
                                                    not look upon a woman who
                                                    has a mind for many, lest
                                                    you fall into her snares. Do
                                                    not frequent the company of
                                                    a dancer, and do not listen
                                                    to her lest you perish by
                                                    the force of her charms.”
                                                    Again (chapter xlii. 12),
                                                    “Do not gaze on everybody’s
                                                    beauty; and do not tarry
                                                    among women. For from
                                                    garments comes a moth, and
                                                    from a woman the iniquity of
                                                    a man.” St. Jerome, in his
                                                    book against Vigilantius,
                                                    writes that a monk, knowing
                                                    his own frailty, and how
                                                    fragile is the vessel which
                                                    he carries, will fear to

                                                    he will chiefly avoid gazing
                                                    at women, and especially at
                                                    young ones, lest he be
                                                    caught by the eyes of a
                                                    harlot, and lest beauty of

                Non solum autem necessarium est ad perfectionem caritatis
                consequendam, quod homo exteriora abiciat, sed etiam quodammodo
                se ipsum derelinquat. Dicit enim Dionysius, 4 cap. de divinis
                nominibus, quod divinus amor est extasim faciens, id est hominem
                extra se ipsum ponens, non sinens hominem sui ipsius esse, sed
                eius quod amatur: cuius rei exemplum in se ipso demonstravit
                apostolus dicens ad Gal. II, 20: vivo ego, iam non ego, vivit
                vero in me Christus, quasi suam vitam non suam aestimans, sed
                Christi: quia quod proprium sibi erat contemnens, totus Christo
                inhaerebat. Hoc etiam in quibusdam esse completum ostendit, cum
                dicit ad Col. III, 3: mortui estis, et vita vestra abscondita
                est cum Christo in Deo. Exhortatur etiam alios ut ad hoc
                perveniant, cum dicit II ad Cor. V, 15. Pro omnibus mortuus est
                Christus: ut et qui vivunt, iam non sibi vivant, sed ei qui pro
                ipsis mortuus est. Et ideo, ut habetur Luc. XIV, 26, postquam
                dixerat: si quis venit ad me et non odit patrem suum et matrem
                et uxorem et filios et fratres et sorores: tanquam aliquid maius
                addens subdit: adhuc autem et animam suam; non potest meus esse
                discipulus. Hoc etiam idem dominus docet Matth. XVI 24 dicens:
                si quis vult post me venire, abneget semet ipsum, et tollat
                crucem suam, et sequatur me.

                IT is not only necessary for the perfection of charity that a
                man should sacrifice his exterior possessions: he must also, in
                a certain sense, relinquish himself. Dionysius, in Chapter IV.
                <i>De Divinis Nominibus</i>, says that, “divine love causes a
                man to be out of himself, meaning thereby, that this love
                suffers him no longer to belong to himself but to Him whom he
                loves.”St. Paul, writing to the Galatians (ii. 20), illustrates
                this state by his own example, saying, “I live, now not I, but
                Christ lives in me,” as if he did not count his life as his own,
                but as belonging to Christ, and as if he spurned all that he
                possessed, in order to cleave to Him. He further shows that this
                state reaches perfection in certain souls; for he says to the
                Colossians (iii. 3), “For you are dead, and your life is hidden
                with Christ in God.”Again, he exhorts others to the same
                sublimity of love, in his second Epistle to the Corinthians (v.
                15), “And Christ died for all, that they also who live, may not
                now live to themselves, but unto Him who died for them, and rose
                again.” Therefore, when our Lord had said (Luke xiv. 26), “If
                any man comes to me, and does not hate his father, and mother,
                and wife, and children, and brethren, and sisters,” He added
                something greater than all these, saying, “yes, and his own life
                also, he cannot be my disciple.” He teaches the same thing in
                the Gospel of St. Matthew (xvi. 24) when He says, “If any man
                would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross
                and follow Me.”

                    Huius autem salubris abnegationis et caritativi odii
                    observatio partim quidem necessaria est ad salutem et
                    omnibus qui salvantur communis; partim autem ad perfectionis
                    pertinet complementum. Ut enim ex supraposita Dionysii
                    auctoritate apparet, de ratione divini amoris est ut amans
                    non sui ipsius remaneat, sed amati. Secundum ergo divini
                    amoris gradum necesse est et odium et abnegationem
                    praedictam distingui. Est autem necessarium ad salutem ut
                    homo sic Deum diligat ut in eo finem suae intentionis ponat,
                    nihilque admittat quod contrarium divinae dilectioni
                    existat; et ideo consequenter et odium et abnegatio sui
                    ipsius est de necessitate salutis, cum, ut Gregorius dicit
                    in omelia, vitamus quod per vetustatem fuimus, et ad hoc
                    nitimur quod per novitatem vocamur; et sic nosmet ipsos
                    relinquimus et abnegamus. Et sicut in alia omelia dicit:
                    tunc bene animam nostram odimus, cum eius carnalibus
                    desideriis non acquiescimus, cum eius appetitum frangimus et
                    eius voluptatibus reluctamur.

                    This practice of salutary self-abnegation, and charitable
                    self-hatred, is, in part, necessary for all men in order to
                    salvation, and is, partly, a point of perfection. As we have
                    already seen from the words of Dionysius quoted above, it is
                    in the nature of divine love that he who loves should
                    belong, not to himself, but, to the one beloved. It is
                    necessary, therefore, that self-abnegation and self-hatred
                    be proportionate to the degree of divine love existing in an
                    individual soul. It is essential to salvation that a man
                    should love God to such a degree, as to make Him his end,
                    and to do nothing which be believes to be opposed to the
                    Divine love. Consequently, self-hatred and self-denial are
                    necessary for salvation. Hence St. Gregory says, in his
                    Homily, “We relinquish and deny ourselves when we avoid what
                    we were wont (through the old man dwelling in us) to be, and
                    when we strive after that to which (by the new man) we are
                    called.” In another Homily he, likewise, says, “We hate our
                    own life when we do not condescend to carnal desires, but
                    resist the appetites and pleasures of the flesh.”

                        Ad perfectionem vero pertinet ut homo propter
                        intentionem divini amoris etiam ea abiiciat quibus
                        licite uti posset, ut per hoc liberius Deo vacet.
                        Secundum hunc ergo modum etiam consequens est ut et
                        odium et abnegatio sui ipsius ad perfectionem pertineat.
                        Unde ex ipso modo loquendi apparet haec a domino
                        proposita esse quasi ad perfectionem pertineant. Sicut
                        enim dicit Matth. XIX, 21: si vis perfectus esse, vade
                        et vende omnia quae habes, non necessitatem imponens,
                        sed voluntati relinquens: ita dicit: si quis vult post
                        me venire, abneget semet ipsum. Quod Chrysostomus
                        exponens dicit: non coactivum facit sermonem: non enim
                        dicit: si vos volueritis et non volueritis, oportet hoc
                        vos pati. Similiter cum dixisset: si quis venit ad me,
                        et non odit patrem suum etc. postmodum subdit: quis enim
                        ex vobis volens aedificare turrem, (non) computat
                        sumptus qui necessarii sunt, si habeat ad perficiendum?
                        Quod exponens Gregorius in Homil. dicit: quia sublimia
                        praecepta data sunt, protinus comparatio aedificandae
                        sublimitatis adiungitur; et post pauca dicit: istos
                        sumptus dives ille habere non potuit qui, cum praecepta
                        relinquendi omnia audisset, tristis abscessit. Ex quibus
                        patet hoc ad perfectionis consilium secundum aliquem
                        modum pertinere.

                        But, in order to attain perfection, we must further, for
                        the love of God, sacrifice what we might lawfully use,
                        in order, thus to be more free to devote ourselves to
                        Him. It follows, therefore, that self-hatred, and
                        self-denial, pertain to perfection. We see that our Lord
                        speaks of them as if they belonged to it. For, just as
                        in the Gospel of St. Matthew (xix. 21) He says, “If you
                        would be perfect, go, sell all that you have and give to
                        the poor,” but does not lay any necessity on us to do
                        so, leaving it to our own will, so He likewise says
                        (Matt. xvi. 24), “if any man would come after Me, let
                        him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow Me.”
                        St. Chrysostom thus explains these words, “Christ does
                        not make his saying compulsory; He does not say,
                        ‘whether you like it or not, you must bear these
                        things.’” In the same manner, when He says: “If any man
                        will come after Me and hate not his father” etc. (Luke
                        xiv. 28), He immediately asks, “Which of you having a
                        mind to build a tower, does not first sit down, and
                        reckon the charges that are necessary, whether) he have
                        enough to finish it?” St. Gregory in his Homily thus
                        expounds these words, “The precepts which Christ gives
                        are sublime, and, therefore, the comparison between them
                        and the building of a high tower shortly follows them.”
                        And he says again, “That young man could not have had
                        enough to finish his tower who, when he heard the
                        counsel to leave all things, went away sad.” We may
                        hence understand, that these words of our Lord refer, in
                        a certain manner, to a counsel of perfection.

                            The martyrs carried out this counsel of perfection
                            most perfectly. Of them St. Augustine says (in his
                            sermon <i>De martyribus</i>, that “none sacrifice so
                            much as those who sacrifice themselves.” The martyrs
                            of Christ, denying themselves, did, in a certain
                            manner, hate their lives, for the love of Christ.
                            St. Chrysostom, again, says, writing on the Gospel
                            of St. Matthew, “He who denies another, be it his
                            brother, or his servant, or whomsoever it may be,
                            will not assist him if he sees him suffering from
                            the scourge or any other torture. And we, in like
                            manner, ought to have so little regard for our body,
                            that, if men should scourge, or in any other way
                            maltreat, us, we ought not to spare ourselves.”

                                Our Lord would not have us to think that we are
                                to deny ourselves, only so far as to endure
                                insults and hard words. He shows us that we are
                                to deny ourselves unto death, even unto the
                                shameful death of the cross. For He says: “Let
                                him take up his cross and follow Me.” We,
                                therefore, say that the martyrs did a most
                                perfect work; for they renounced, for the love
                                of God, life itself, which others hold so dear,
                                that, for its sake, they are content to part
                                with all temporal goods, and are willing to
                                purchase it by any sacrifice whatsoever. For a
                                man will prefer to lose friends and wealth, and
                                to suffer sickness, or even slavery, rather than
                                to be deprived of life. Conquerors will grant to
                                their defeated foes the privilege of life, in
                                order that they may keep them subject to them in
                                slavery. Satan said to the Lord (Job ii. 4),
                                “Skin for skin, and all that a man has he will
                                give for life,” <i>i.e.</i> to preserve his
                                body.

                                    Now, the more dearly a thing is loved
                                    according to nature, the more perfect it is
                                    to despise it, for the sake of Christ.
                                    Nothing is dearer to any man than the
                                    freedom of his will, whereby he is lord of
                                    others, can use what he pleases, can enjoy
                                    what he wills, and is master of his own
                                    actions. Just, therefore, as a person who
                                    relinquishes his wealth, and leaves those to
                                    whom be is bound by natural ties, denies
                                    these things and persons; so, he who
                                    renounces his own will, which makes him
                                    master, does truly deny himself. Nothing is
                                    so repugnant to human nature as slavery;
                                    and, therefore, there is no greater
                                    sacrifice (except that of life), which one
                                    man can make for another, than to give
                                    himself up to bondage for the sake of, that
                                    other. Hence, the younger Tobias said to the
                                    angel (Tobias ix. 2), “if I should give
                                    myself to be your servant, I should not make
                                    a worthy return for your care.”

                                        thing. A vow imposes a certain
                                        obligation on him that makes it; so
                                        that, for the future, he is not at

                                        formerly permissible to him; for he is
                                        bound to accomplish his vow. Thus, we
                                        read in Ps. 1xv. 13, “I will pay you my
                                        vows which my lips have uttered,” and
                                        again (Eccles. v. 3), “If you have vowed
                                        anything to God, defer not to pay it;
                                        for an unfaithful and foolish promise
                                        displeases him.”

                                            Others there are, however, who make
                                            a complete sacrifice of their own
                                            will, for the love of God,
                                            submitting themselves to another by
                                            the vow of obedience, of which
                                            virtue Christ has given us a sublime
                                            example. For, as we read in the
                                            Epistle to the Romans (v. 19), “As
                                            by the disobedience of one man, many
                                            were made sinners; so also by the
                                            obedience of one, many shall be made
                                            just.” Now this obedience consists
                                            in the abnegation of our own will.
                                            Hence, our Lord said, “Father, if it
                                            be possible, let this chalice pass
                                            from Me: nevertheless not as I will
                                            but as you will” (Matt. xxvi. 39).
                                            Again He said (John vi. 38), “I came
                                            down from Heaven, not to do my own
                                            will, but the will of Him who sent
                                            Me.”By these words He shows us,
                                            that, as He renounced His own will,
                                            submitting it to the Divine will, so
                                            we ought wholly to subject our will
                                            to God, and to those whom He has set
                                            over us as His ministers. To quote
                                            the words of St. Paul, “obey your
                                            prelates and be subject to them “
                                            (Heb. xiii. 17).

                Secundum autem triplicem viam perfectionis assignatam, in
                religionibus triplex commune votum invenitur: scilicet votum
                paupertatis, continentiae, et obedientiae usque ad mortem. Per
                votum paupertatis primam perfectionis viam religiosi assumunt,
                omni proprietati abrenuntiantes; per votum autem continentiae
                aggrediuntur viam secundam, matrimonio perpetue abrenuntiantes;
                per votum autem obedientiae manifeste viam tertiam assumunt,
                voluntatem propriam abnegando. Hoc etiam triplex votum congrue
                religioni adaptatur. Nam, sicut Augustinus dicit 10 de Civit.
                Dei, religio non quemlibet, sed Dei cultum significare videtur.
                Unde et Tullius dicit in rhetorica, quod religio est: quae
                cuidam superiori naturae, quam divinam vocant, cultum
                caeremoniamque affert.

                WE find the three ways to perfection in religious life, embodied
                in the three vows of perpetual poverty, chastity, and obedience.
                Religious follow the first road to perfection by the vow of
                poverty, whereby they renounce all property. By the vow of
                chastity, whereby they renounce marriage, they enter on the
                second road to perfection. They set forth on the third road to
                perfection, by the vow of obedience, whereby they sacrifice
                their own will. Now these three vows well beseem the religious
                life. For, as St. Augustine says (lib. x.
                <i>de Civitate Dei),</i> “The word <i>religion</i> means, not
                any sort of worship, but the worship of God.” And Tully says, in
                his <i>Rhetorica,</i> that “religion is a virtue, paying worship
                and reverence to a certain higher nature which men term the
                Divine nature.”

                    Cultus autem soli Deo debitus in sacrificii oblatione

                    illud Hebr. ult., 16: beneficentiae et communionis nolite

                    etiam Deo sacrificium de proprio corpore, dum scilicet qui
                    Christi sunt, carnem suam crucifigunt cum vitiis et
                    concupiscentiis, ut apostolus dicit ad Gal. V 24; unde et
                    ipse dicit ad Rom. XII, 1: exhibeatis corpora vestra hostiam
                    viventem, sanctam, Deo placentem. Est etiam sacrificium
                    tertium Deo acceptissimum, quando aliquis spiritum suum
                    offert Deo, secundum illud Psal. l, 19: sacrificium Deo
                    spiritus contribulatus.

                    Now the worship which is due to God alone, consists in the
                    offering of sacrifice. Such sacrifices may consist in
                    external things, when they are given for the love of God.
                    Thus, St. Paul says, (Hebrews xiii. 3), “Do not forget to do
                    good and to impart; for by such sacrifices God’s favour is
                    obtained.” We also offer to God the sacrifice of our own
                    bodies, when, as St. Paul says (Gal. v. 24), “we crucify the
                    flesh with its vices and concupiscences,” or, when we obey,
                    his exhortation to the Romans (xii. 1), “Present your bodies
                    a living, sacrifice, holy, pleasing, unto God.” There is,
                    again, a third and most agreeable sacrifice to God, spoken
                    of in the 50th Psalm (v. 19), “a sacrifice to God is an
                    afflicted spirit.”

                        Sed sciendum, quod, sicut Gregorius super Ezechielem
                        dicit, hoc inter sacrificium ac holocaustum distat, quod
                        omne holocaustum sacrificium est, et non omne
                        sacrificium holocaustum. In sacrificio enim pars
                        pecudis, in holocausto vero totum pecus offerri
                        consueverat. Cum ergo aliquis suum aliquid Deo vovet, et
                        aliquid non vovet, sacrificium est. Cum vero omne quod
                        habet, omne quod vivit, omne quod sapit, omnipotenti Deo
                        voverit, holocaustum est. Quod quidem impletur per tria
                        vota praedicta. Unde manifestum est, eos qui huiusmodi
                        vota Deo emittunt, quasi propter holocausti excellentiam
                        antonomastice religiosos vocari.

                        The difference, says St. Gregory, in his Commentary on
                        <i>Ezechiel,</i> between a sacrifice and a holocaust is,
                        that, whereas every holocaust is a sacrifice, every
                        sacrifice is not a holocaust, In a sacrifice a part of
                        the victim was immolated; but in a holocaust the entire
                        offering was consumed.” When, therefore, a man vows one
                        thing to God, and does not vow another, he offers a
                        sacrifice. When, however, he dedicates to the Almighty
                        all that he has, all that he takes pleasure in, and his
                        entire life, he is offering a holocaust.” This he does,
                        most perfectly, by the three religious vows. Hence, it
                        is clear that the name of <i>religious</i> is strictly
                        applied, according to the very meaning of the word, to
                        those who pay their vows as a holocaust to God.

                            mandatum pro peccatis satisfacere oportet, ut in
                            Levitico expresse iubetur. Unde Psal. IV, cum
                            dixisset: quae dicitis in cordibus vestris, et in
                            cubilibus vestris compungimini, statim de
                            satisfactione subdens dixit: sacrificate sacrificium
                            iustitiae; idest, opera facite iusta post
                            poenitentiae lamentum, ut Glosa exponit. Sicut ergo
                            holocaustum est perfectum sacrificium, ita per vota
                            praemissa perfecte homo Deo satisfacit, cui et de
                            exterioribus rebus, et de proprio corpore, et de
                            proprio spiritu holocaustum offert. Ex quo patet
                            quod religionis status non solum perfectionem

                            According to the Levitical law the offering of
                            sacrifice was ordained for the atonement of sin.
                            Again, in Psalm Iv., immediately after the verse,
                            “the things you say in your hearts, be sorry for
                            them upon your beds,” we read, “offer up the
                            sacrifice of justice,” that is to say (as the Gloss
                            explains), “perform works of justice after your
                            lamentations of penitence.” Since, then, a holocaust
                            is a perfect sacrifice, a man who makes the
                            religious vows, (thereby offering, of his own will,
                            a holocaust to God), makes perfect satisfaction for
                            his sins. Hence we see, that the religious life, is
                            not only the perfection of charity, but likewise the
                            perfection of penitence, since, however heinous may
                            be the sins committed by a man, he cannot be
                            enjoined, as a penance for them, to go into
                            religion; for the religious state transcends all
                            satisfaction. We see (in Gratian, 33, Quest. II.
                            cap. <i>Admonere</i>, that Astulplus, who had killed
                            his wife, was advised to go into a monastery as the
                            easiest and best course to pursue; for, if he
                            remained in the world, a very severe penance would
                            be imposed upon him.

                                diximus pertinere, praecipuum est obedientiae
                                votum: quod quidem multipliciter apparet. Primo
                                quidem, quia per obedientiae votum homo Deo
                                propriam voluntatem offert; per votum autem
                                continentiae offert ei sacrificium de proprio

                                exterioribus rebus. Sicut ergo inter hominis
                                bona corpus praefertur exterioribus rebus, et
                                anima corpori; ita votum continentiae voto
                                paupertatis praefertur, votum autem obedientiae
                                utrique. Secundo quia per propriam voluntatem
                                homo et exterioribus rebus utitur et proprio
                                corpore. Sic igitur qui propriam voluntatem dat,
                                totum dedisse videtur. Universalius igitur est
                                obedientiae votum quam continentiae et
                                paupertatis; et quodammodo includit utrumque.
                                Hinc est quod Samuel obedientiam omnibus
                                sacrificiis praefert, dicens I Reg. XV, 22:
                                melior est obedientia quam victimae.

                                The vow which, of all the three religious vows,
                                belongs most peculiarly to the religious life,
                                is that of obedience. This is clear for several
                                reasons. First, because, by obedience man
                                sacrifices to God his own will; by chastity, on
                                the other hand, he offers his body, and by
                                poverty his external possessions. Now, since the
                                body is worth more than material goods the vow
                                of chastity is superior in merit to that of
                                poverty, but the vow of obedience is of more
                                value than either of the other two. Secondly,
                                because it is by his own will that a man makes
                                use either of his body or his goods: therefore,
                                he who sacrifices his own will, sacrifices
                                everything else that he has. Again, the vow of
                                obedience is more universal than is that of
                                either poverty or chastity, and hence it
                                includes them both. This is the reason why
                                Samuel preferred obedience to all other
                                offerings and sacrifices, saying, “Obedience is
                                better than sacrifices” (1 Kings xv. 22).

                SATAN, in his jealousy of human perfection, has raised up
                several foolish and misleading men, who, by their teaching, have
                shown themselves hostile to the different modes of perfection of
                which we have been speaking. Vigilantius attacked the first
                counsel of perfection. St. Jerome thus combats his objections to
                it: “Some men hold that they act more virtuously who keep the
                use of their fortune, and divide the fruit of their possessions
                piecemeal among the poor, than they do who sell their goods,
                and, at once, give all they possess to the poor. The fallacy of
                this assertion is proved not by my words but by those of the
                Lord Himself, “If you would be perfect, go, sell all that you
                have and give to the poor, and come follow me.” Christ is here
                speaking to one who desires to be perfect, and who, with the
                Apostles, leaves father, ship, and net. The man who is praised
                for retaining the use of his possessions, is in the second or
                third degree of perfection; and we know that the first degree is
                preferable to either the second or the third.” Hence, in order
                to exclude error on this point, we find in the book,
                <i>De ecclesiasticis dogmatibus</i> the following words: “It is
                good to distribute one’s goods prudently among the poor; but it
                is better if it be done with the intention of following the
                Lord, to give them all away at once, and, in our dealings with
                Christ, to be free from all earthly solicitude.”

                    Jovinian argued against the second counsel of perfection,
                    and declared that marriage was equal in merit to virginity.
                    St. Jerome refuted his opinions, in the book which he wrote
                    against him. St. Augustine, likewise, thus speaks of his
                    error, in his book <i>Retractationum:</i> “The heresy of
                    Jovinian asserted that the merit of consecrated virgins was
                    equalled by conjugal chastity. Hence, it is said that in
                    Rome, certain nuns who had not hitherto been suspected of
                    immorality, contracted marriage. Our holy mother the Church
                    has always stoutly resisted this error. In the book
                    <i>De ecclesiasticis dogmatibus</i> we find the following
                    declaration: “It is not Christian but Jovinian to set
                    virginity on a level with matrimony, or to deny an increase
                    of merit to those who, for the sake of mortifying the flesh,
                    refrain from wine or flesh meat.”

                        But the devil is not content with these old devices.
                        Even in our own days he has stirred up some men to
                        declaim against the vow of obedience and all other vows,
                        and to preach that good works are more meritorious when
                        performed without obedience or vow, than when executed
                        under such obligations. Others, again, say that a vow
                        made to enter religion may, without danger to salvation,
                        be broken, and they strive to confirm their opinion by
                        frivolous and empty arguments. For they contend that an
                        act is meritorious in proportion as it is voluntary, and
                        that, if such an act be less voluntary in proportion as
                        it is more necessary, good works done at a man’s
                        pleasure, without the constraint of obedience or vow of
                        any kind, are worth more than such as are performed
                        under the obligation of a vow, either of obedience or of
                        some other nature. They quote in support of their
                        teaching the words of Prosper (<i
                          >Book II. De vita contemplativa</i
                        >), “We ought to fast and abstain, not as though forced
                        by necessity, lest by acting reluctantly we should be

                        bring forward the words of St. Paul (2 Cor. ix. 7),
                        “Every one as he has determined in his heart, not with
                        sadness or of necessity; for God loves a cheerful
                        giver.”

                            singulorum, ut castitas, virginitas et huiusmodi. Ad
                            haec ergo vovenda nos invitat: non praecipit ut
                            voveamus, sed ut vota reddamus. Vovere enim
                            voluntati consulitur; sed post voti emissionem
                            redditio exigitur necessario.

                            We must now show the fallacy of these arguments, and
                            confute this foolish reasoning. First, in order to
                            manifest the error of these arguments we will quote
                            the Gloss on the verse of Ps. lxxv. 12, “Vow and pay
                            to the Lord your God.” “We must observe,” says the
                            Gloss, “that some vows made to God are common to all
                            men, and are necessary to salvation: such are our
                            Baptismal promises and the like, which we should be
                            bound to keep, even if we had not made them. The
                            verse, ‘Vow and pay,’ alludes to such vows as these,
                            and is addressed to all men. There are also other
                            vows made by individuals, such as chastity,
                            virginity, and the like. The Psalmist invites us,
                            but does not command us, to make such vows as these,
                            and to pay them when we have made them. For the
                            emission of a vow is a decision of the will; but the
                            payment of such a vow is a decided necessity.”

                                consilium non datur nisi de meliori bono, ut
                                supra dictum est. Melius est ergo servare

                                est in aliis.

                                Hence a vow is, in one sense, a matter partly of
                                counsel, and, in another sense, a matter of
                                precept. But, from whichever point of view we
                                consider it, we shall see plainly that good
                                works performed under vow, are more meritorious
                                than those executed without a vow. For, it is
                                clear, that, in all that is necessary for
                                salvation, all men are bound by the precept of
                                God; neither would it be Tight to think that God
                                would give a command without a purpose. For, as
                                St. Paul says (1 Tim. i. 5), “Now the end of the
                                Commandment is charity.” In vain, then, would
                                God have given a commandment concerning the
                                performance of anything, if the execution of
                                such a thing had not tended more towards the
                                increase of charity than its omission would have
                                done. Now we are not only bidden by precept to
                                believe, and forbidden to steal, but, further,
                                we are commanded to make a vow to believe and to
                                abstain from theft. Therefore, believing on
                                account of our vow, and abstention from theft on
                                the same account, tend more to augment charity
                                than would be the case if we had no vow. Again,
                                the more anything increases charity, the more it
                                is praiseworthy and meritorious. Hence it is
                                more praiseworthy and meritorious to perform any
                                work under vow, than without such an obligation.
                                Once more, the counsel is given to us not only
                                to preserve virginity or chastity, but (as the
                                Gloss points out) to make a vow to do so. But
                                since, as we have said, a counsel is only given
                                concerning that which is the greater good, it
                                must be better to observe chastity under a vow
                                than without one. The same argument holds good
                                concerning the other counsels.

                                    Now, amongst other good works virginity
                                    meets with special commendation. our Lord
                                    speaking of it says, “He who can take it,
                                    let him take it” (Matt. xix. 12). It is,
                                    however, the vow of virginity which renders
                                    that state so praiseworthy. St. Augustine
                                    says, in his book,
                                    <i>De virginitate,</i> “Virginity is
                                    honourable, not because it is virginity, but
                                    because it is consecrated to God, and
                                    because it vows to Him, and preserves for
                                    Him, the continence of piety.” And, again,
                                    he says, “We do not praise virgins because
                                    they are virgins, but because they are
                                    consecrated to God by the holy continence of
                                    virginity.” Hence we see, that the fact of
                                    their being performed under a vow, renders
                                    good works the more meritorious.

                                        Again, every finite good acquires
                                        additional value by bearing a promise of
                                        some other good. There is no doubt that
                                        the promise of good is in itself a good.
                                        Hence, when one man makes a promise to
                                        another, he is considered to confer some
                                        advantage upon him; and he to whom the
                                        promise is made returns thanks. Now a
                                        vow, is a promise made to God, as we see
                                        from Ecclesiastes (v. 3), “If you have
                                        vowed anything to God, defer not to pay
                                        it; for an unfaithful and foolish
                                        promise displeases him.” It is better,
                                        therefore, to make a vow and to perform
                                        it, than simply to execute a good work
                                        without being bound thereto by vow.

                                            Again, the more one person gives to
                                            another, the more he deserves from
                                            that other. Now, he that does a good
                                            work without a vow, offers to God
                                            only that single act which he
                                            performs for love of him: he, on the
                                            contrary, who not only accomplishes
                                            a good work, but also makes a vow to
                                            perform it, gives to God not only
                                            that which he does, but also the
                                            power whereby he does it. For he
                                            puts it out of his power not to do
                                            such a good work; although, before
                                            making his vow, he might
                                            legitimately have omitted it. Hence
                                            he merits far more from God who acts
                                            under vow, than be who is not under
                                            any obligation.

                                                as the will is confirmed in
                                                good, just as the heinousness of
                                                sin is aggravated in proportion

                                                will. Now it is evident, that he
                                                who makes a vow, confirms his
                                                will to accomplish that which he
                                                promises; and that when he
                                                accomplishes the good work which
                                                he has vowed to do, its
                                                consummation proceeds from the
                                                strength which his will has
                                                acquired. Just as the gravity of
                                                a crime proceeds from the fact
                                                that he who commits it acts from
                                                a determined purpose, or, as is
                                                usually said, sins out of
                                                malice; so the merit of any good
                                                work is enhanced by the fact
                                                that it is done under a vow.

                                                    origin in a superior virtue.
                                                    For example we might do an

                                                    inferior virtue from motives
                                                    of superior virtue; just as

                                                    performed out of charity.
                                                    Now, we know, that,, the
                                                    particular good works that
                                                    we accomplish proceed from
                                                    inferior virtues; fasting,
                                                    for instance, is an act of
                                                    abstemiousness; continence
                                                    proceeds from chastity, and
                                                    so of the rest. But, on the
                                                    other hand, a vow is,
                                                    strictly speaking, an act of
                                                    <i>latria</i>, which,
                                                    undoubtedly, is a higher
                                                    virtue than abstemiousness,
                                                    chastity, or any other
                                                    virtue. For it is more
                                                    meritorious to worship God,
                                                    than to order ourselves
                                                    rightly, towards, either our
                                                    neighbour or ourselves.
                                                    Hence chastity,
                                                    abstemiousness, or any other
                                                    virtue, inferior to
                                                    <i>latria</i>, derives
                                                    additional value if it be
                                                    performed under a vow.

                                                        (1 Cor. xii. 31), “Be

                                                        the most meritorious
                                                        state, she would absolve
                                                        them all from their
                                                        vows, in order, as far
                                                        as possible, to enhance
                                                        the merit of their good
                                                        works. Hence, the
                                                        opinion that vows
                                                        detract from the value
                                                        of good works, is
                                                        repugnant to the spirit
                                                        of the Church, and must

                                                        heretical.

                tuo. Proximus autem noster non est universale bonum supra nos
                existens, sed particulare infra nos constitutum: et ideo non
                determinatur nobis modus ut aliquis proximum diligat toto corde,
                sed sicut se ipsum. Ex hoc autem modo tria circa dilectionem

                WE may fittingly conclude these considerations about the
                perfection of charity, as it regards God, with some reflections
                touching perfect charity as it concerns our neighbour. There are
                several degrees of perfect love of our neighbour, just as there
                are several degrees of perfect love of God. There is a certain
                perfection of this virtue which is a matter of precept, and
                which is necessary to salvation. There is, further, a
                supererogatory perfection, which is a matter of counsel. The
                perfection of brotherly love necessary to salvation, is of the
                nature prescribed by the precept, “Thou shall love your
                neighbour as your self.”As God is the universal Good, existing
                above us, it is necessary, as we have before said, for the
                perfection of divine love that the whole heart should be, in a
                certain sense, turned to God. This degree of divine love is
                expressed by the precept, “Love the Lord your God with your
                whole heart.” But our neighbour is not the universal good
                existing above ourselves; he is a particular good beneath us.
                Therefore, we are not bidden to love him with our whole heart,
                but as ourselves. Three consequences follow from this
                proposition.

                    Primo quidem ut sit vera dilectio: cum enim de ratione
                    dilectionis sive amoris hoc esse videatur ut aliquis bonum
                    velit ei quem amat; manifestum est quod motus amoris sive
                    dilectionis in duo tendit: scilicet in eum cui aliquis vult
                    bonum, et in bonum quod optat eidem. Et quamvis utrumque
                    amari dicatur, tamen illud vere amatur cui aliquis bonum
                    optat. Bonum vero quod quis optat alicui, quasi per accidens
                    dicitur amari, prout ex consequenti sub actu amoris cadit.
                    Inconveniens enim est dicere, quod illud proprie ac vere
                    ametur cuius destructionem aliquis optat. Multa autem sunt
                    bona quae dum in nostrum usum vertimus, consumuntur; sicut
                    vinum, dum bibitur, et equus dum exponitur pugnae: unde
                    manifestum est quod dum res aliquas in nostrum usum vertere
                    cupimus, vere quidem et proprie nos ipsos amamus; res autem
                    illas per accidens, et quasi abusive amari a nobis dicuntur.

                    First, our love must be sincere. It is in the nature of love
                    to wish well to the object beloved. Hence, love tends
                    towards two things: to the one to whom we are wishing well,
                    and to the good which we desire for him. And, although both
                    these things are said to be loved, that object is truly
                    loved to which we wish some good. For the good which we wish
                    to another person is only loved <i>per accidens,</i> because
                    it falls within the limits of the act of love. Now it is
                    incorrect to say that we really and sincerely love an object
                    which we desire to destroy; and as many of the things which
                    we use are destroyed, we only love such things
                    <i>per accidens.</i> For instance, we consume wine in
                    drinking, we expose a horse to death in battle; in such
                    cases, we are truly loving ourselves and are only loving
                    these other things <i>per accidens</i>, on account of the
                    use which they are to us.

                        It is clear, likewise, that every man does, by nature,
                        love himself truly, in so far as to wish benefits to
                        himself, happiness, for instance, virtue, knowledge, and
                        the necessaries of life. But those things of which he
                        avails himself he does not truly love in themselves;
                        rather, he loves the service they render him, and he
                        prefers himself to them. Now this proposition is as true
                        with regard to persons, as it is with regard to things.
                        We love some men only because they are of use to us; and
                        when this is the case, it is evident that we do not
                        truly love them as we love ourselves. He that loves
                        another because he is of service- to him, or affords him
                        gratification, proves that he loves himself. As he seeks
                        only convenience and profit from his friend and not his
                        friend himself, he can only be said to love his friend
                        in the sense in which we are said to love wine or
                        horses, i.e. not as ourselves by wishing well to them,
                        but rather as valuing them as an advantage to ourselves.

                            It is not difficult to prove, that sincerity is
                            necessary to perfect charity. We see this, first,
                            from the precept which bids us to love our neighhour
                            as ourselves. “The end of the commandment is charity
                            from a pure heart, and a good conscience, and an
                            unfeigned faith,” says St. Paul (1 Tim. i. 5). Again
                            he says, “Charity does not seek her own” (1 Cor.
                            xiii. 5), but wishes well to those whom she loves.
                            He gives his own example, as a lesson of charity,
                            “not seeking that which is profitable to myself, but
                            to many, that they may be saved” (1 Cor. x. 33).

                                exteriora largitur, secundum illud Iob II, 4,
                                pellem pro pelle, et cuncta quae habet homo,
                                dabit pro anima sua. Et hic quidem naturalis
                                ordo dilectionis sui ipsius in paucis vel nullis
                                deficit quantum ad naturalia bona, de quibus
                                exemplum posuimus. Sed inveniuntur nonnulli qui
                                quantum ad superaddita hunc ordinem dilectionis
                                pervertunt; sicut cum propter salutem vel
                                delectationem corporis, bonum virtutis aut
                                scientiae multi abiiciunt: rursusque propter
                                exteriora bona conquirenda, corpus suum
                                periculis et laboribus immoderatis exponunt:
                                quorum non est recta dilectio; immo, ut amplius
                                dicam, nec vere isti se ipsos diligere
                                comprobantur. Hoc enim maxime videtur esse
                                unumquodque quod est in ipso praecipuum: unde et
                                civitatem aliquid facere dicimus, quod faciunt
                                principes civitatis. Manifestum est autem quod
                                praecipuum in homine est anima; et inter animae
                                partes ratio sive intellectus. Qui ergo bonum
                                rationalis animae contemnit, inhaerens bonis
                                corporis vel animae sensitivae, manifestum est
                                quod non vere se ipsum diligit; unde et in
                                Psalmo dicitur: qui diligit iniquitatem, odit
                                animam suam.

                                Secondly, the way in which we are commanded to
                                love our neighbour, viz. “as ourselves,” proves
                                that our charity ought to be rightly ordered and
                                sincere. For true and rightly ordered love
                                prefers the greater to the lesser good. Now it
                                is clear, that, of all human good, the welfare
                                of the soul is the greatest: next in degree
                                comes physical well-being; and external goods
                                occupy the last place. It is natural to man to
                                observe this order in his preference. For who
                                would not rather lose bodily eyesight than the
                                use of reason? Who would not part with all his
                                property in order to save his life? “Skin for
                                skin,” said Satan to the Lord, “and all that a
                                man has he will give for his life” (Job ii. 4).
                                Very few, if any, fail to observe this order in
                                their preference concerning the natural goods of
                                which we have given examples. There are,
                                nevertheless, many who pervert this order of
                                charity, in the case of the other goods which
                                exist in addition to the purely natural ones of
                                which we have spoken. They will, for instance,
                                prefer physical health or comfort, to the
                                acquisition of virtue or learning; and they will
                                expose their bodies to danger and hardship, in
                                order to gain material wealth. Now this, as we
                                shall show more at large, is not true love.
                                Neither do they who act thus, love themselves
                                sincerely. It is quite clear that the chief part
                                of a thing is really the thing itself. When we
                                say that a city acted thus or thus, we mean that
                                the chief citizens acted in such or such a
                                manner. Now we know, that the principal thing in
                                man is the soul, and that the chief among the
                                powers or faculties of the soul, is the reason
                                or understanding. He, therefore, who despises
                                the good of the rational soul, for the sake of
                                physical welfare, or of the advantage of the
                                sensitive soul, plainly show that he does not
                                truly love himself. “He who loves iniquity,
                                hates his own soul” (Pa. x. 6).

                                    ought to observe in the love of ourselves.
                                    Hence we must desire his welfare in the same
                                    manner as we ought to desire our own,
                                    <i>i.e.</i> first his spiritual good,

                                    in extrinsic possessions. But, if we wish

                                        We see, thirdly, from the precept
                                        concerning charity, that our love of our
                                        neighbour must be holy. That is called
                                        holy which is directed to God. An altar,
                                        and the other things used in the sacred
                                        ministry, are holy, because they are
                                        dedicated to His service. Now, when one
                                        man loves another as himself, there must
                                        be intercommunion between them; and, in
                                        so far as the two persons are united
                                        together, they are considered as forming
                                        one; and the one behaves to the other as
                                        to himself. There are, however, several
                                        ways in which two persons may be joined
                                        together. They may be joined by ties of
                                        blood, <i>i.e.</i> by being born of the
                                        same parents. They may be joined by
                                        certain social ties—they may be
                                        fellow-citizens, under the same ruler
                                        and the same laws. Or, they may be
                                        joined by certain professional or
                                        commercial bonds—they may be
                                        fellow-workmen, or fellow-soldiers. Now
                                        the neighbourly love which may exist
                                        between men, united by these various
                                        bonds, may be just and seemly, but it
                                        cannot, on that account, be called holy.
                                        For love can only be called holy in so
                                        far as it is directed to God.

                                            iustitiae legislatorem.
                                            Considerandum est autem, quod bonum
                                            commune secundum rectam rationem est
                                            bono proprio praeferendum: unde

                                            instinctu ordinatur ad bonum totius.
                                            Cuius signum est, quod aliquis
                                            percussioni manum exponit, ut cor
                                            vel caput conservet, ex quibus
                                            totius hominis vita dependet. In

                                            omnes homines conveniunt in

                                            ut pars quaedam consideratur: bonum
                                            autem commune totius est ipse Deus,
                                            in quo omnium beatitudo consistit.
                                            Sic igitur secundum rectam rationem

                                            ipsum in Deum ordinat, sicut pars

                                            quidem per caritatem perficitur, qua
                                            homo se ipsum propter Deum amat. Cum

                                            se ipsum, et per hoc dilectio ipsa
                                            sancta efficitur; unde dicitur I

                                            Fellow-citizens agree in being
                                            subject to the same ruler whose laws
                                            they obey; and all men, inasmuch as
                                            they naturally aspire to happiness,
                                            are united in their inclinations
                                            towards God, the Beginning of all
                                            things, the Source of happiness, and
                                            the Principle of justice. But, we
                                            must remember, that, in the right
                                            order, the general is preferable to
                                            the particular good. A part is, by a
                                            natural instinct governed by the
                                            good of the whole. The hand, for
                                            example, is exposed to danger in
                                            order to shield the head or heart,
                                            the source of life. Now, in the
                                            communion, whereof we have been
                                            speaking, and in which all men are
                                            united by their natural tendency
                                            towards happiness, each individual
                                            must be considered as a part, and
                                            God, in whom the happiness of all
                                            consists, must be regarded as the
                                            universal Good of the whole. Hence,
                                            according to right reason and
                                            natural instinct, each man orders
                                            himself towards God, as a part is
                                            ordered to the whole; and this order
                                            is made perfect by charity, whereby
                                            man loves himself for God’s sake.
                                            Now, when he also loves his
                                            neighbour for God’s sake, he loves
                                            him as himself; and his love thus
                                            becomes holy. This is plainly
                                            expressed by St. John, in the
                                            following words: “This commandment
                                            we have from God that he who loves
                                            God, should also love his brother”
                                            (1 John iv. 21).

                                                The precept to love our
                                                neighbour as ourselves teaches
                                                us, fourthly, that our love of
                                                our neighbour must be practical
                                                and fruitful. Men love

                                                good to befall them, and by
                                                desiring protection from-evil;
                                                but also, by endeavouring, by

                                                Hence, when a man truly loves
                                                another as himself, he will show

                                                wishes, but by practical
                                                benefits. He will obey the
                                                teaching of St. John (1 Jn. iii.

                WE devoted the last chapter to the consideration of the
                perfection of brotherly love, as exhibited in the degree
                necessary to salvation. We will now treat of the same virtue, as
                manifested in a degree exceeding common perfection, and thus
                forming a matter of counsel. This perfection of fraternal
                charity may be regarded from a triple point of view. First we
                may consider its comprehensiveness; for love is perfect in
                proportion to the number of persons whom it includes.

                    diligunt vel propter beneficia sibi impensa, vel propter
                    naturalis cognationis vinculum, aut civilis; et iste
                    dilectionis gradus terminis civilis amicitiae coartatur,
                    unde dominus dicit Matth. V, 46: si diligitis eos qui vos
                    diligunt, quam mercedem habebitis? Nonne et publicani hoc
                    faciunt? Et si salutaveritis fratres vestros tantum, quid
                    amplius facietis? Nonne et ethnici hoc faciunt? Sunt autem
                    alii qui dilectionis affectum etiam ad extraneos extendunt,
                    dum tamen in eis non inveniatur aliquid quod eis adversetur:
                    et hic quidem dilectionis gradus quodammodo sub naturae
                    limitibus coarctatur; quia enim omnes homines conveniunt in
                    natura speciei, omnis homo est naturaliter omni homini
                    amicus. Et hoc manifeste ostenditur in hoc quod homo alium
                    errantem in via dirigit, et a casu sublevat, et alios
                    huiusmodi dilectionis effectus impendit. Sed quia homo
                    naturaliter se ipsum magis quam alium diligit; ex eadem
                    autem radice procedit ut aliquid diligatur et eius
                    contrarium odio habeatur; consequens est ut infra naturalis
                    dilectionis limites inimicorum dilectio non comprehendatur.
                    Tertius autem dilectionis gradus est ut dilectio proximi
                    etiam ad inimicos extendatur: quem quidem dilectionis gradum
                    dominus docet Matth. V, 44, dicens: diligite inimicos
                    vestros, benefacite eis qui oderunt vos; et in hoc
                    perfectionem dilectionis esse demonstrat: unde concludit
                    subdens: estote ergo perfecti sicut et pater vester
                    caelestis perfectus est.

                    Now there are three degrees in the comprehensiveness of
                    charity. Some men love their neighbours, either on account
                    of the benefits they receive from them, or by reason of some
                    tie of blood or of social life. This love is bounded by the
                    limits of human friendship, and of it our Lord says, “It you
                    love those who love you, what reward shall you have? do not
                    even the publicans this? And if you salute your brethren
                    only, what do you more? Do not even the heathens this?”
                    (Matt. v. 46). Others, again, include strangers in their
                    charity, as long as they meet with nothing in these
                    strangers antipathetic to themselves. This degree of charity
                    is limited by natural feeling; for as all men form one
                    species, each individual man is by nature the friend of all
                    others. Thus, it is natural to us to put one who has lost
                    his way on the right road, to help a man who has fallen
                    down, and to perform similar kindly offices. As, however, we
                    naturally prefer ourselves to others, it follows, that we
                    shall love one thing and hate what is opposed to it.
                    Therefore a merely natural love never includes the love of
                    our enemies. But the third degree of charity is the love
                    extended even to our enemies. Speaking of this love, our
                    Lord says (Matt. v. 44), “Love your enemies, do good to
                    those who hate you.”He shows that this love constitutes the
                    perfection of charity, by concluding His instruction with
                    the words, “Be, therefore, perfect, as also your heavenly
                    Father is perfect.”

                        Quod autem hoc sit ultra perfectionem communem, patet
                        per Augustinum in Enchiridio, qui dicit, quod

                        The fact that this perfection is beyond ordinary
                        perfection, appears in the words of St. Augustine
                        (<i>Enchirid.</i>), “These things belong to the perfect
                        among the sons of God. Nevertheless, all the faithful
                        ought to strive to fulfil them; and by prayer and
                        self-conquest the soul of man ought to be brought to
                        these sentiments. But this sublime virtue is not found
                        in the generality of mankind, although we believe that
                        the prayer: ‘Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive
                        them that trespass against us,’ is heard by God.”

                            pertinere quod etiam inimici diligantur. Sed hoc de

                            perfectione divini amoris, ad memoriam revocetur.
                            Dictum est enim supra, quod in hoc quod dicitur,
                            diliges dominum Deum tuum ex toto corde tuo, potest

                            est de perfectione consilii, et ulterius de
                            perfectione comprehensoris. Si enim sic
                            intelligatur: diliges dominum Deum tuum ex toto
                            corde tuo ut semper cor hominis feratur actu in
                            Deum, hoc pertinet ad perfectionem comprehensoris.
                            Si autem sic intelligatur, ut cor hominis nihil
                            acceptet quod sit divinae dilectioni contrarium; sic

                            But, as by the term “our neighbour” all men are
                            understood; and as no exception is made in the
                            precept of loving our neighbour as ourselves; it may
                            be thought, that the love of our enemies is
                            commanded as necessary to salvation. This difficulty
                            is easily solved, if we call to mind what has been
                            said about the perfection of Divine love. The
                            precept, “Love the Lord your God with your whole
                            heart,” etc., may be understood as a matter either
                            of precept, to be obeyed as a necessity, or as a
                            counsel, or as perfection attained only by the
                            Blessed in Heaven. If the command, “Love the Lord
                            your God with your whole heart” be understood to
                            mean that man’s heart is to be always actually fixed
                            on God, it can only be obeyed by the Blessed in
                            Heaven. If it be taken as signifying that man is
                            not. to admit anything into his heart contrary to
                            Divine love, it is, in this sense, a precept which
                            must of necessity be obeyed. If, again, we
                            understand by these words, the renunciation of all
                            things for the sake of greater freedom in communion
                            with God, it is a counsel of perfection. In the same
                            way we may say that it is a precept not to exclude
                            even our enemies from the universal love of our
                            neighbour enjoined upon us, nor to admit within our
                            heart anything opposed to this love.

                                aliquid huiusmodi. Sed ad diligendum inimicos
                                nihil movere potest nisi solus Deus. Diliguntur
                                enim in quantum sunt Dei, quasi ad eius imaginem

                                considerat divinum bonum, ut eos diligat. Unde,

                                tanto facilius animus eius flectitur ut diligat

                                But to love our enemies with an actual love when
                                there is no necessity for so doing, is a counsel
                                of perfection. Of course it is necessary for
                                salvation to love our enemies by doing them
                                actual service and assisting them, if they be in
                                any extremity, if, for example, they be dying of
                                hunger. The precept of brotherly love does not ‘
                                however, bind us to show any special affection
                                nor to do any particular service to our enemies,
                                unless they be in the extreme distress of which
                                we have spoken; neither are we bound by precept
                                to do any special service to any other of our
                                neighbours. Love of our enemies springs,
                                directly and purely, from love of God; whereas
                                our love for other men arises from divers
                                motives, e.g., from gratitude, from kinship,
                                from fellow-citizenship, and the like. But
                                nothing save the love of God can make us love
                                our enemies; for we love them because they are
                                His creatures, made in His image, and capable of
                                enjoying Him. And, as charity prefers God before
                                all other good, the consideration of the Divine
                                Good which inclines it to love its enemies,
                                outweighs the consideration of any injury
                                received from them which would incline our
                                nature to hate them. Thus, in proportion to the
                                love of God in a man’s soul, will be his
                                readiness to love his enemies.

                                    proximorum: quod videtur apostolus tangere
                                    cum dicit, I Cor. XIII, 3: si tradidero in
                                    cibos pauperum omnes facultates meas; et
                                    Cant. VIII 7 dicitur: si dederit homo omnem
                                    substantiam domus suae pro dilectione, quasi
                                    nihil despiciet illam. Unde et dominus hoc
                                    comprehendere videtur, dum consilium de
                                    perfectione sectanda cuidam daret, dicens
                                    Matth. XIX, 21: si vis perfectus esse, vade
                                    et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus;
                                    et veni, sequere me; ubi omnium bonorum
                                    exteriorum abdicationem ad duo videtur
                                    ordinare: scilicet ad dilectionem proximi,
                                    cum dicit, et da pauperibus; et ad
                                    dilectionem Dei, cum dicit, sequere me. Ad
                                    idem etiam pertinet, si quis damnum in
                                    exterioribus rebus pati non recuset propter
                                    dilectionem Dei vel proximi: unde apostolus
                                    commendat quosdam, dicens ad Hebr. X, 34:
                                    rapinam bonorum vestrorum cum gaudio
                                    suscepistis; et Prov. XII, 26, dicitur: qui
                                    negligit damnum propter amicum, iustus est.

                                    de bonis quae habent, proximis necessitatem
                                    habentibus subvenire non curant: unde
                                    dicitur I Ioan. III, 17: qui habuerit
                                    substantiam mundi huius, et viderit fratrem
                                    suum necessitatem patientem, et clauserit
                                    viscera sua ab eo; quomodo caritas Dei manet
                                    in eo?.

                                    The perfection of brotherly love depends,
                                    secondly, upon its intensity. We know that
                                    the more intensely a man loves one object,
                                    the more easily will he for its sake despise
                                    other things. Hence the perfection of his
                                    love for his neighbour, may be gauged by
                                    what he sacrifices on his neighbour’s
                                    account. Some men, in their love of others,
                                    will give up their material possessions,
                                    either dispensing them to their neighbours
                                    at their discretion, or relinquishing them
                                    entirely, in order to supply the necessities
                                    of other men. St. Paul seems to refer to
                                    this form of charity in his First Epistle to
                                    the Corinthians (xiii. 3), where he says,
                                    “If I should distribute all my goods to feed
                                    the poor.” In the book of Canticles, also,
                                    we are told that, “If a man should give all
                                    the substance of his house for love, he
                                    shall despise it as nothing” (Cant. viii.
                                    7). our Lord includes this in the counsel of
                                    perfection, which He gave when He said, “If
                                    you would be perfect, go, sell all that you
                                    hast, and give to the poor and you shall
                                    have treasure in Heaven; and come follow me”
                                    (Matt. xix. 2 1). In this passage the
                                    sacrifice of material possession seems to be
                                    recommended for two ends. The words, “give
                                    to the poor,” point to love of our
                                    neighbour; the other words, “follow Me,”
                                    indicate love of God. But a man fulfils the
                                    same end, whether he suffers the loss of his
                                    material goods for the love of God, or for
                                    the sake of his neighbour. St. Paul commends
                                    the charity of the Hebrews in these words,
                                    “You took with joy the being stripped of
                                    your own goods” (Heb. x. 34). In the Book of
                                    Proverbs (xii. 26) we are told also that,
                                    “He who neglects a loss for the sake of a
                                    friend is just.” St. John says in like
                                    manner (1 Ep. iii. 17), “He who has the
                                    substance of this world and sees his brother
                                    in need, and shuts up his bowels from him,
                                    how does the charity of God abide in him?”

                                        The second degree of love of our
                                        neighbour, consists in exposing
                                        ourselves to physical hardships for his
                                        sake. St. Paul gives us an example of
                                        this kind of charity when he says, “In
                                        labour and toil we worked day and night,
                                        lest we should be chargeable to any of
                                        you” (2 Thess. iii. 8). This second
                                        degree of charity also includes a
                                        willingness to bear suffering and
                                        persecution for the love of our
                                        neighbour. St. Paul mentions this
                                        charity in the 2nd Epistle to the
                                        Corinthians (i. 6), “Whether we be in
                                        tribulation, it is for your exhortation
                                        and salvation,” and also in his Epistle
                                        to Timothy, “Wherein I labour even unto
                                        bands as an evil doer; but the word of
                                        God is not bound. Therefore I endure all
                                        things, for the sake of the elect, that
                                        they may obtain salvation” (2 Tim. ii.
                                        9). Those fail to attain to this degree
                                        of charity who will deprive themselves
                                        of no luxury, and submit to no
                                        inconvenience for the sake of others. It
                                        is to such men as these that Amos (vi.
                                        4) addresses the following words: “You
                                        that sleep upon beds of ivory, and are
                                        wanton on your couches: you that eat the
                                        lambs out of the Rock, and the calves
                                        out of the midst of the herd; you that
                                        sing to the sound of the psaltery: they
                                        have thought themselves to have
                                        instruments of music like David; that
                                        drink wine in bowls, and anoint
                                        themselves with the best ointments; and
                                        they are not concerned for the
                                        affliction of Joseph.” And Ezechiel also
                                        says (xiii. 5), “You have not gone up to
                                        face the enemy, nor have you set up a
                                        wall for the house of Israel, to stand
                                        in battle in the day of the Lord.”

                                            in hoc cognovimus caritatem Dei
                                            quoniam ille pro nobis animam suam
                                            posuit, et nos debemus pro fratribus

                                            dicit enim dominus Ioan. XV, 13:
                                            maiorem hac dilectionem nemo habet
                                            ut animam suam ponat quis pro amicis

                                            fraternae dilectionis constituitur.

                                            The third degree of charity consists
                                            in sacrificing our life for another.
                                            St. John (1 Jn iii. 16) says, “In
                                            this we have known the charity of
                                            God, because He has laid down his
                                            life for us; and we ought to lay
                                            down our lives for the brethren.”
                                            Our Lord Himself declares that,
                                            “Greater love than this has no man,
                                            that a man lay down his life for his
                                            friends” (John xv. 13). Hence it is
                                            in this sacrifice of life that the
                                            perfection of charity consists.

                                                The word “life “may be
                                                understood, however, in two
                                                senses. There is the spiritual
                                                life whereby God Himself
                                                animates the soul. We may not
                                                sacrifice this life. For our
                                                love of our soul is
                                                proportionate to our love of
                                                God; and we ought to love God
                                                more than we love our neighbour.
                                                Therefore, we may not, in order
                                                to save another, injure our own
                                                soul by sin. We have also the
                                                physical life which animates our
                                                body. This life we ought to lay
                                                down for the brethren. For, it
                                                is our duty to prefer our
                                                neighbour to our body; and
                                                therefore it is right to
                                                sacrifice our physical life for
                                                the spiritual welfare of others.
                                                We are bound by precept to act
                                                thus if we see our neighbour
                                                exposed to any extreme spiritual
                                                danger. Thus, if we were to see
                                                another seduced from the Faith
                                                by unbelievers, we should be
                                                bound to expose ourselves to
                                                death if, thereby, we could save
                                                him from such ruin. But it
                                                pertains to the perfection of
                                                justice, and is a matter of
                                                counsel, to sacrifice life for
                                                the salvation of those who are
                                                not in grave spiritual
                                                necessity. St. Paul teaches us
                                                to do so by his own example, for
                                                he says, “But I, most gladly
                                                will spend and be spent myself
                                                for your souls” (2 Cor. xii.
                                                15). On this passage the Gloss
                                                remarks, “It is perfect charity
                                                to be prepared to die for the
                                                brethren.”The state of slavery
                                                does in some sort resemble
                                                death, and is therefore called
                                                civil death. For life is chiefly
                                                manifested in ability to move;
                                                he that cannot move save by the
                                                agency of others, may be
                                                accounted dead. Now, a slave has
                                                no power over himself, but is
                                                governed by the will of his
                                                master; and therefore this
                                                condition of bondage may be
                                                compared to death. Hence a man,
                                                who, for the love of another,
                                                delivers. himself to bondage,
                                                practises the same perfection of
                                                charity, as he who exposes
                                                himself to death. Nay, we may
                                                say that he does more; for
                                                slavery is more abhorrent to our
                                                nature than is death.

                                                    charity must next be
                                                    considered as manifested by
                                                    the value of what we do for
                                                    others. For our love for our
                                                    neighbour is proved by the
                                                    value of the gifts that we
                                                    bestow upon him. Now there
                                                    are three degrees in this
                                                    charity. The first degree
                                                    consists in ministering to
                                                    the bodily wants of our
                                                    brethren by clothing the
                                                    naked, feeding the hungry,
                                                    tending the sick, and the
                                                    like. our Lord promises to
                                                    consider as done to Himself,
                                                    everything of this nature
                                                    that we do for others. The
                                                    second degree of charity
                                                    consists in bestowing upon
                                                    our neighbour such spiritual
                                                    benefits as do not exceed
                                                    the capability of human
                                                    nature. Among such benefits
                                                    we may mention the
                                                    instruction of the ignorant,
                                                    advice given to those in
                                                    doubt, or the conversion of
                                                    such as have gone astray.
                                                    Such works of mercy are
                                                    commended in Job iv. 3,
                                                    “Behold, you have taught
                                                    many, and you have
                                                    strengthened the weary
                                                    hands: your words have
                                                    confirmed them that were
                                                    staggering, and you have
                                                    strengthened the trembling

                                                        says (1 Thess. ii. 13),

                Est autem considerandum, quod sicut supra praemisimus,
                perfectionis est non solum aliquod opus perfectum facere, sed
                etiam opus perfectum vovere: de utroque enim consilium datur, ut
                supra habitum est. Qui ergo aliquod opus perfectum ex voto
                facit, ad duplicem perfectionem pertingit; sicut qui
                continentiam servat, unam perfectionem habet, qui autem voto se
                obligat ad continentiam servandam et eam servat, habet et
                continentiae perfectionem et voti. Perfectio autem quae est ex
                voto, conditionem mutat et statum, secundum quod libertas et
                servitus diversae conditiones vel status esse dicuntur. Sic enim
                accipitur status 2 quaest. 9, ubi Adrianus Papa ait: si quando
                in causa capitali vel causa status interpellatum fuerit, non per
                exploratores, sed per se ipsos est agendum. Nam cum aliquis
                vovet continentiam servare, adimit sibi libertatem ducendi
                uxorem; qui autem simpliciter continet absque voto, praedicta
                libertate non privatur. Non ergo in aliquo mutatur eius
                conditio, sicut mutatur eius qui vovet. Nam et apud homines, si
                quis alicui obsequatur, non ex hoc conditionem mutat; sed si se
                obligat ad serviendum, iam alterius conditionis efficitur.

                IT must, as we have before said, be borne in mind that
                perfection does not consist in the mere accomplishment of a
                perfect work, but, likewise, in the vow to accomplish such a
                work. A counsel, as we have already observed, has been given us
                on each of these two points. He therefore who performs a perfect
                work under a vow attains to a twofold perfection. For, just as a
                man who observes continence is practising one form of
                perfection; so, he who obliges himself by vow to live in
                continence and who keeps his vow, practises both the perfection
                of continence and the perfection of a vow. For that perfection
                which comes from the observance of a vow changes the state and
                condition of a man as completely, as freedom alters the state
                and condition of a slave. This proposition is established in
                Gratian, <i>II quaestio IX</i>, where Pope Hadrian says, “If at
                any time we are called upon for judgment in a capital cause, or
                in a cause affecting a state of life, we must act at our own
                discretion, and not depend upon others to examine the case.”
                For, if a man make a vow to observe chastity, be deprives
                himself of liberty to marry. But he who simply observes chastity
                without a vow, is not deprived of his liberty. Therefore, he is
                not in an altered condition, as is the case with a man bound by
                a vow. Again, if one man serve another, his state is not thereby
                changed, as it is if, he lay himself under an obligation to
                serve him.

                    Sed considerandum quod potest aliquis sibi libertatem
                    adimere vel simpliciter, vel secundum quid. Si enim aliquis
                    se Deo vel homini obliget ad aliquid speciale faciendum et
                    pro aliquo tempore, non simpliciter libertatem amisit, sed
                    solum secundum illud ad quod se obligavit. Si autem se
                    totaliter in potestate alterius ponat, ita quod nihil sibi
                    libertatis retineat; simpliciter conditionem mutavit factus
                    simpliciter servus. Sic ergo dum aliquis Deo vovet aliquod
                    particulare opus, puta peregrinationem, aut ieiunium aut
                    aliquid huiusmodi, non simpliciter conditionem vel statum
                    mutavit, sed secundum aliquid tantum. Si vero totam vitam
                    suam voto Deo obligavit, ut in operibus perfectionis ei
                    deserviat, iam simpliciter conditionem vel statum
                    perfectionis assumpsit. Contingit vero aliquos perfectionis
                    opera facere non voventes; alios vero totam vitam suam voto
                    obligantes ad perfectionis opera, quae non implent. Unde
                    patet quosdam perfectos quidem esse, qui tamen perfectionis
                    statum non habent; alios vero perfectionis quidem statum
                    habere, sed perfectos non esse.

                    We must remember, however, that a man may deprive himself of
                    liberty either absolutely (<i>simpliciter</i>) or relatively
                    (<i>secundum quid</i>). If he bind himself, either to God or
                    man, to perform some specific work for some allotted time,
                    he renounces his freedom, not absolutely but partially,
                    i.e., with regard to the particular matter, about which he
                    has laid himself under an obligation. If, however, he place
                    himself entirely at the disposal of another, reserving to
                    himself no liberty whatsoever, he makes himself a slave
                    absolutely, and thereby absolutely alters his condition.
                    Thus, if a person make a vow to God to perform some
                    specified work, such as a pilgrimage or a fast, he does not
                    change his condition entirely, but only partially,
                    <i>i.e.,</i> with regard to that particular work which he
                    vows to accomplish. If he dedicate his whole life to serve
                    God in works of perfection he absolutely embraces the
                    condition or state of perfection. But, as some men perform
                    works of perfection without any vow, and others fail to
                    accomplish the works of perfection to which they have vowed
                    their whole lives, it is perfectly possible for persons to
                    be perfect without being in the state of perfection, or to
                    be in a state of perfection without being perfect.

                Ex his autem quae supra dicta sunt manifeste apparet, quibus
                competat in perfectionis statu esse. Dictum est enim supra, quod
                ad perfectionem divinae dilectionis triplici via proceditur:
                scilicet abrenuntiando exterioribus bonis; relinquendo uxorem,
                et alias cognationes carnales, et abnegando se ipsum vel per
                mortem quam pro Christo patitur, vel quia abnegat propriam
                voluntatem. Qui ergo ad haec perfectionis opera totam vitam suam
                voto obligant Deo, manifestum est eos perfectionis statum
                assumere. Et quia in omni religione haec tria voventur;
                manifestum est omnem religionem perfectionis statum esse.

                FROM all that has been said it is easy to see which are the
                classes of men whom the state of perfection befits. We know that
                there are three roads to the perfection of divine love, to wit
                the giving up of material possessions; the sacrifice of marriage
                and of earthly ties; and total self-denial either by death for
                Christ, or by the abnegation of self-will. Now, they who by vow
                dedicate their whole lives to these works of perfection,
                manifestly embrace the state of perfection. And, as in every
                religious order these three vows are made, it is plain that
                every form of religious life is included in the state of
                perfection.

                    Rursus autem ostensum est, tria pertinere ad perfectionem
                    dilectionis fraternae: ut scilicet inimici diligantur eisque
                    serviatur; et ut aliquis animam suam pro fratribus ponat,
                    vel exponendo periculis mortis, vel etiam vitam suam
                    totaliter ordinando in utilitatem proximorum; et quod
                    proximis spiritualia impendantur. Ad haec autem tria
                    manifestum est teneri episcopos. Cum enim Ecclesiae
                    universae curam susceperint, in qua plerumque inveniuntur
                    aliqui eos odientes, blasphemantes et persequentes, necesse
                    habent inimicis et persequentibus dilectionis et
                    beneficentiae vicem rependere: cuius exemplum in apostolis
                    apparet, quorum sunt episcopi successores: in medio enim
                    persecutorum commorantes eorum salutem procurabant. Unde et
                    dominus eis mandat Matth. X, 16: ecce ego mitto vos sicut
                    oves in medio luporum: ut scilicet plurimos morsus ab eis
                    accipientes, non solum non consumantur, sed et illos
                    convertant. Et Augustinus in Lib. de sermone domini in
                    monte, exponens id quod habetur Matth. V 39: si quis te
                    percusserit in dexteram maxillam, praebe illi et alteram,
                    sic dicit: hoc ad misericordiam pertinere hi maxime sentiunt
                    qui eis quos multum diligunt, serviunt, vel pueris vel
                    phreneticis, a quibus multa saepe patiuntur; et si eorum
                    salus id exigat, praebent se etiam ut plura patiantur. Docet
                    ergo dominus medicus animarum ut discipuli sui eorum quorum
                    saluti consulere volunt, imbecillitates aequo animo
                    tolerarent. Omnis namque improbitas ex imbecillitate animi
                    venit: quia nihil Innocentius est eo qui est in virtute
                    perfectus. Hinc est quod apostolus I Cor. IV, 12, dicit:
                    maledicimur, et benedicimus; persecutionem patimur, et
                    sustinemus; blasphemamur, et obsecramus.

                    Again, we have pointed out that there are three elements in
                    the perfection of brotherly love. It is necessary to perfect
                    brotherly love, first, that a man love his enemies and
                    assist them; secondly, that he lay down his life for the
                    brethren either by exposing himself to the danger of death
                    or by devoting his whole life to their service; and thirdly,
                    that he minister to their spiritual needs. Now, bishops are
                    bound to fulfil these three offices of charity. As they
                    undertake the entire charge of their churches, wherein
                    oftentimes many will be found to hate, persecute, and revile
                    them, they are under the obligation of repaying their
                    enemies and persecutors by benevolence and charity, after
                    the example of the Apostles, whose successors they are, and
                    who dwelt among those most hostile to them and laboured for
                    their conversion. Thus were verified the words of our Lord
                    (Matt. x. 16), “Behold I send you as sheep in the midst of
                    wolves.” For, although the Apostles were, so to speak, torn
                    by their enemies, they were not destroyed, but, on the
                    contrary, they converted those who maltreated them. St.
                    Augustine in his book,
                    <i>De Sermone Domini in monte,</i> has the following
                    commentary on the words, “If one strike you on your right
                    cheek, turn to him the other also” (Matt. v. 39): “These
                    words (he says), inviting us to mercy, appeal most to such
                    as have to minister to those whom they love, whether they be
                    children, or men of frenzied brain. For, from such persons
                    they suffer much; and they are prepared, if need be, to
                    suffer more. Thus, the great Physician and Master of souls
                    instructs His disciples, that they must bear, with serenity,
                    the follies of those whose salvation they desire to secure.
                    For crime is an indication of a weak mind, as innocence is a
                    proof of perfect strength.” Hence St. Paul, writing to the
                    Corinthians, says, “We are reviled and we bless; we are
                    persecuted and we suffer it; we are blasphemed and we
                    entreat”(1 Cor. iv. 12).

                        Tenentur etiam episcopi ut pro salute suorum subditorum
                        animam suam ponant. Dicit enim dominus Ioan. X, 11: ego
                        sum pastor bonus: bonus pastor animam suam ponit pro
                        ovibus suis: quod exponens Gregorius dicit: audistis,
                        fratres carissimi, eruditionem vestram et periculum
                        nostrum; et postea subdit: ostensa est nobis de
                        contemptu mortis via quam sequamur: primum exteriora
                        nostra misericorditer ovibus impendere; postremum vero,
                        si necesse sit, etiam mortem nostram pro eis debemus
                        ministrare; et postea subdit: lupus super oves venit,
                        cum quilibet iniustus et raptor fideles quosque atque
                        humiles opprimit. Sed is qui pastor videbatur esse et
                        non erat, relinquit oves et fugit: quia dum sibi ab eo
                        periculum metuit, resistere eius iniustitiae non
                        praesumit. Ex quibus verbis apparet quod de necessitate
                        pastoralis officii est ut periculum mortis non refugiat
                        propter gregis sibi commissi salutem.

                        Bishops are farther bound to sacrifice their lives for
                        the salvation of those committed to them, and thus to
                        put in practice the words of our Lord, “I am the Good
                        Shepherd: the Good Shepherd lays down his life for his
                        sheep” (John x. 11). Speaking of these words, St.
                        Gregory says, “In the Gospel which has been read to you,
                        beloved brethren, you learn both a lesson for
                        yourselves, and the danger which threatens us, There is
                        set before us both the contempt of death, with which we
                        ought to be inspired, and the model that we ought to
                        imitate.”He further adds, “Our first duty is, in
                        charity, to distribute our goods to our sheep; and we
                        are further bound, if need be, to serve them by our
                        death.... The wolf that comes upon the sheep signifies
                        any unjust seducer or oppressor of the faithful and the
                        lowly. He that is no true shepherd but only bears the
                        semblance of such, will leave his sheep and take to
                        flight, being too fearful of death to dare to resist
                        iniquity.” From these words it is clear, that it is one
                        of the duties of those discharging the episcopal office
                        to face death for the sake of the church committed to
                        them.

                            Obligatur ergo ex ipso officio sibi commisso ad hanc

                            cuius figuram Moyses gerens dicebat Deut. V, 5: ego
                            sequester et medius fui inter dominum et vos in
                            tempore illo. Et ideo preces et oblationes Deo in
                            persona populi offert: quia, ut dicitur Hebr. V, 1,
                            omnis pontifex ex hominibus assumptus, pro hominibus
                            constituitur in his quae sunt ad Deum, ut offerat
                            dona et sacrificia pro peccatis. Sed rursus personam

                            sacramenta ministrat. Unde apostolus dicit II Cor.
                            II, 10: ego quod donavi, si quid donavi, propter vos
                            in persona Christi: et in eadem epistola, dicit: an
                            experimentum quaeritis eius qui in me loquitur
                            Christus? Et I Cor. IX, 11: si nos vobis spiritualia
                            seminavimus, non magnum est si carnalia vestra
                            metamus. Ad huiusmodi autem perfectionem episcopi in
                            sua ordinatione se obligant, sicut et religiosi in
                            sua professione; unde apostolus dicit I ad Tim.
                            ult.: certa certamen bonum fidei, apprehende vitam
                            aeternam in qua vocatus es et confessus bonam
                            confessionem coram multis testibus; scilicet in tua
                            ordinatione, ut Glossa ibidem exponit. Et ideo
                            episcopi statum perfectionis habent, sicut et
                            religiosi. Sicut autem in humanis contractibus
                            aliquae solemnitates secundum humana iura

                            Hence, those who undertake this office are bound to
                            practise such perfection of charity as consists in
                            the sacrifice of their life for the brethren. In the
                            same manner, a bishop is bound by his office to
                            dispense spiritual gifts to his neighbour, and thus
                            to become a mediator between God and man, acting in
                            the place of Him who is “the one Mediator of God and
                            man, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Tim. ii). Moses,
                            speaking as a type of our Lord, said, “I was the
                            mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that
                            time” (Deut. v. 1). Hence, a bishop must, in the
                            name of his people, offer up prayers and
                            supplications to God. “For every high priest taken
                            from among men, is ordained for men in the things
                            that appertain to God, that he may offer up gifts
                            and sacrifices for sins” (Heb. v. 1). And, on the
                            other hand, he must act with regard to his people as
                            the vicar of God, giving to his flock by the power
                            of the Lord, judgment, instruction, example, and
                            sacraments. St. Paul says, “For what I have
                            pardoned, if I have pardoned anything, for your
                            sakes have I done it in the person of Christ” (2
                            Cor. ii. 10). Again, in the same epistle (xiii. 3)
                            he says, “Do you seek a proof of Christ who speaks
                            in me?” Again (1 Cor. ix. 11), he uses these words,
                            “If we have sown for you spiritual things, is it a
                            great matter if we reap your carnal things?” Now a
                            bishop, at his ordination or consecration, and a
                            religious at his profession, engages himself to this
                            degree of perfection. St. Paul encourages St.
                            Timothy to its practice, in the following words:
                            “Fight the good fight of faith: lay hold on eternal
                            life, to which you were called when you made a good
                            confession before many witnesses” (1 Tim. vi. 12).
                            This “good confession” is interpreted by the Gloss
                            to mean ordination. Hence, bishops, as well as

                            as human contracts are drawn up with certain
                            ceremonies, so, both the consecration of bishops and
                            the profession of religious are solemnized by
                            certain rites and blessings. Dionysius (VI. Cap.
                            <i>Eccles. Hierarch.)</i> speaking of monks, says,
                            “On this account the holy law has given them perfect
                            grace, and has granted it to them with a certain
                            sanctifying ceremonial (<i>invocatione</i>).”

                Posset autem alicui minus circumspecto videri quod status
                perfectionis religionis esset sublimior quam status pontificalis

                contemplativa, ad quam religionis status ordinari videtur. Dicit
                enim Dionysius 6 cap. Eccles. Hierar., quod religiosos alii
                quidem famulos, alii vero monachos nominant, ex Dei puro
                servitio et famulatu et indivisibili et singulari vita unienti

                praelationis non sit perfectus, quia divitias eis possidere
                licet; cum tamen dominus dicat Matth. XIX, 21: si vis perfectus
                esse, vade, et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus.

                TO one who has not duly considered the subject, the religious
                state might appear to be more sublime than the episcopal office.
                For the love of God, to the perfection of which religious
                dedicate their lives, far surpasses the love of our neighbour to
                which the pontifical state is devoted; just as the contemplative
                life, in which religious are engaged, is nobler than the active
                life, to which bishops are ordained. Dionysius (VI. Cap.
                <i>Eccles. Hierarch.)</i> says that, “Some persons call
                religious <i>servants,</i> and others call them <i>monks,</i> on
                account of their pure service and ministry to God, and by reason
                of their simple undivided life which lifts them by holy
                contemplation of those things which are unseen, to a godlike
                oneness and to perfection pleasing to the Lord.” Again the
                episcopal office may appear to fall short of perfection, because
                bishops are allowed to possess money, notwithstanding the words
                of our Lord, “If you will be perfect, go, sell what you hast,
                and give to the poor” (Matt. xix 21).

                    Sed hoc dictum veritati repugnat. Dionysius enim dicit, 5
                    cap. Eccles. Hierar., quod ordo episcoporum est perfectivus:
                    et in 6 cap. dicit ordinem monachorum esse ordinem
                    perfectorum. Manifestum est autem maiorem perfectionem
                    requiri ad hoc quod aliquis perfectionem aliis tribuat, quam
                    ad hoc quod aliquis in se ipso perfectus sit; sicut maius
                    est posse calefacere quam calere, et omnis causa potior est
                    effectu. Relinquitur ergo episcopalem statum maioris
                    perfectionis esse quam statum cuiuscumque religionis.
                  </td>
                  <td>
                    But this way of thinking is not in accordance with truth.
                    Dionysius says (V. Cap. <i>Eccles. Hierarch</i>.) that the
                    “duty of bishops is to produce perfection,” and elsewhere
                    (Cap. VI.), he says, that “the life of monks is a state of
                    the perfect.” Now it is evident that greater perfection is
                    needed in order to make others perfect than is required in a
                    state which in itself is perfect; just as it is better to
                    <i>do</i> something than to <i>be</i> something, and just as
                    a cause is more powerful than its effect. Hence, the
                    episcopal state is one of greater perfection, than is that
                    of any religious order.

                        Idem autem apparet, si quis consideret ea ad quae
                        utrique obligantur. Obligantur enim religiosi ad hoc
                        quod temporalia deserant, quod castimoniam servent, et
                        quod sub obedientia vivant: quibus multo est amplius et

                        sicut dictum est, episcopi obligantur. Unde manifestum
                        est graviorem esse episcopalem obligationem quam
                        religionis.

                        This conclusion is still more clearly established, if we
                        consider the obligations attached to the episcopal
                        office, and those belonging to the religious life.
                        Religious are bound to renounce material possessions, to
                        observe chastity, and to live in obedience. But the
                        duties of bishops are far more onerous and difficult of
                        fulfilment. For they, as we have seen, are obliged to
                        lay down their lives for their flocks. Hence the
                        obligation of a bishop is much weightier than is that of
                        a religious.

                            Amplius. In his ipsis ad quae religiosi obligantur,
                            episcopi quodammodo obligari videntur. Tenentur enim
                            episcopi bona temporalia quae habent, in necessitate
                            suis subditis exhibere, quos pascere debent non

                            subsidio. Unde Petro, Ioan ult., ter dictum est a
                            domino ut eius pasceret gregem; quod ipse retinens,
                            alios ad hoc ipsum exhortatur dicens, I Petr. ult.
                            2: pascite, qui in vobis est, gregem domini. Et
                            Gregorius dicit in auctoritate supra inducta, ex
                            persona episcoporum loquens: exteriora nostra

                            postea subdit: qui non dat pro ovibus substantiam
                            suam, quando pro his daturus est animam suam?

                            Bishops are further bound by the same obligations as
                            those imposed upon religious. For, as it is their
                            duty to feed their flocks, not only by word and
                            example, but likewise by temporal assistance, they
                            are obliged, if need arise, to distribute their
                            worldly goods among those committed to their care.
                            St. Peter was three times commanded by our Lord to
                            feed His sheep. The exhortation Bank into his mind,
                            and he recalls it in his epistle, saying, “Feed the
                            flock of God which is among you” (1 St. Peter v. 2).
                            St. Gregory, likewise, speaking as though in the
                            person of bishops, says: “We ought in charity to
                            distribute our goods among our sheep... for how
                            shall he who will not of his temporal substance
                            minister unto his flock, be ready for its sake to
                            sacrifice his life?”

                                chastity. For it is only meet that they who are
                                to preach purity to others, should themselves
                                lead spotless lives. Hence Dionysius (III. cap.
                                <i>Coelest. Hierarch.)</i> says that from the
                                abundance of their own chastity, they must
                                impart purity to others.

                                    Religious, by their vow of obedience, bind
                                    themselves to submit to one superior; but a
                                    bishop constitutes himself the servant of
                                    all of whom he undertakes the care. He is
                                    bound to imitate the example of St. Paul,
                                    who tells us that he sought not that which
                                    was profitable to himself but to many, that
                                    they might be saved (1 Cor. x. 33). Again
                                    the Apostle says of himself, “For whereas I
                                    was free unto all, I made myself the servant
                                    of all” (1 Cor. ix. 19). “For we preach not
                                    ourselves, but Jesus Christ our Lord; and
                                    ourselves your servants through Jesus” (2
                                    Cor. iv. 5). Hence it is the custom for the
                                    Sovereign Pontiff to subscribe himself as
                                    “the servant of the servants of God.” We
                                    must conclude, then, that the episcopal
                                    office is a condition of higher perfection
                                    than is the religious life.

                                        Dionysius, again, writes (VI. Cap.
                                        <i>Eccles. Hierarch.</i>) “The monastic
                                        state is not intended to lead others
                                        forward, but is ordained for its own
                                        sake, and remains on its own peculiar
                                        and sacred basis.” Bishops, on the other
                                        hand, are under the obligation of
                                        guiding others to God. St. Gregory,
                                        writing on the book of Ezechiel, says
                                        that, “no sacrifice is more acceptable
                                        to God than is zeal for souls.” These
                                        words clearly point out that the
                                        episcopal is, of all states, the most
                                        perfect. This conclusion is further
                                        proved by the custom of the church,
                                        which, when a religious is appointed to
                                        a bishopric, releases him from obedience
                                        to the superiors of his order. For this
                                        could not be done, were not the
                                        episcopal state one of greater
                                        perfection than the religious. In acting
                                        thus the Church of God obeys the counsel
                                        of St. Paul, “Be therefore zealous for
                                        the better gifts” (1 Cor. xii. 31).

                Ea vero quae in contrarium obiiciuntur, non difficile est
                solvere. Perfectio enim dilectionis proximi, ut supra dictum
                est, ex perfectione divinae dilectionis derivatur: quae quidem
                tantum in cordibus aliquorum praevalet ut non solum Deo frui
                velint et ei servire, sed etiam proximis propter Deum. Unde
                apostolus dicit II ad Cor. V 13 - 14: sive mente excedimus,
                scilicet per contemplationem, hoc est Deo, idest ad honorem Dei:
                sive sobrii sumus, quasi vobis condescendentes, hoc est vobis,
                idest ad utilitatem vestram. Caritas enim Christi urget nos, ut
                scilicet pro vobis omnia faciamus, ut Glosa exponit. Manifestum
                est autem quod maioris dilectionis signum est ut homo propter
                amicum etiam alii serviat, quam si soli amico servire velit.

                IT is not difficult to answer the objections brought against the
                perfection of the Episcopal office. The perfection of fraternal
                charity springs, as we have seen, from the perfection of the
                love of God, which in the hearts of some men is so vigorous that
                it urges them, not only to desire to enjoy God and to serve Him,
                but likewise for His sake to assist their neighbours. Hence in
                the 2nd Epistle to the Corinthians (v. 13), St. Paul says,
                “Whether we be transported in mind” (by contemplation) “it is to
                God” (<i>i.e.</i> to the. glory of God), “or whether we be
                sober” (in condescension. to you) “it is to you,”
                <i>i.e.</i> for your profit; “for the love of Christ presses
                us,” “causing us (as the Gloss explains) to do all things for
                you.” For it is clear that it is a greater sign of love if a
                man, for the sake of his friend, be willing to serve another,
                than if he will only render service to his friend in his own
                person.

                    Quod etiam dicitur de perfectione contemplativae vitae, non
                    videtur ad propositum esse. Cum enim episcopus mediator
                    inter Deum et homines constituatur, oportet ipsum et in
                    actione praecellere, inquantum minister hominum
                    constituitur, et in contemplatione praecipuum esse, ut ex
                    Deo hauriat quod hominibus tradat; unde Gregorius dicit in
                    pastorali sit praesul actione praecipuus, prae cunctis
                    contemplatione suspensus, rector internorum curam in
                    exteriorum occupatione non minuens, exteriorum providentiam
                    in interiorum solicitudine non relinquens. Sed et si
                    detrimentum aliquod in dulcedine contemplationis patiuntur
                    propter exteriorem occupationem qua proximis serviunt, hoc
                    ipsum perfectioni dilectionis divinae attestatur. Magis enim
                    aliquem amare convincitur qui propter eius amorem
                    iucunditate praesentiae eius ad tempus carere desiderat in
                    eius servitiis occupatus, quam si eius praesentia semper
                    frui vellet. Unde apostolus ad Rom. IX, 3, postquam dixerat
                    quod: neque mors neque vita separabit me a caritate Christi,
                    post modicum subiungit: optabam ego ipse anathema esse a
                    Christo pro fratribus meis: quod exponens Chrysostomus dicit
                    in Lib. de compunctione cordis: ita totam eius mentem
                    devicit amor Christi, ut in hoc quod ei prae ceteris omnibus
                    amabilius erat, esse cum Christo, rursus idipsum, quia ita
                    placeret Christo, contemneret.

                    The argument drawn from the comparison between the
                    perfection of the contemplative and the active life, does
                    not seem to have much bearing on the point in question. A
                    bishop, being singled out as mediator between God and men,
                    must, as minister to men, be pre-eminent in the active life.
                    At the same time he must excel in contemplation, in order to
                    draw from God the spiritual wisdom which he is bound to
                    impart to those committed to his care. Hence St. Gregory
                    says (in <i>Liber regulae pastoralia</i>), “A bishop should
                    be foremost in action, and he should be raised above all men
                    by contemplation. He should be solicitous, lest, on account
                    of external occupation, he relax in his zeal for spiritual
                    affairs; neither should his care for spiritual things lessen
                    his diligence concerning such as are temporal.” It may
                    happen, indeed, that a man occupied in the service of
                    others, may suffer some loss of sweetness in contemplation;
                    but this very sacrifice is a proof of the perfection of his
                    love of God. For if, for the sake of doing service to one
                    whom we love, we deprive ourselves of the happiness of being
                    in his presence, we show stronger affection for him, than if
                    we endeavoured always to enjoy his company. St. Paul writing
                    to the Romans (ix. 3) says, “Neither death, nor life shall
                    separate me from the love of God”; he then continues, “I
                    wished myself to be anathema from Christ for my brethren.”
                    St. Chrysostom, in his book,
                    <i>De compunctione cordis</i> has the following commentary
                    on these words: “The love of Christ had thus so completely
                    conquered the heart of this Apostle, that, in order to
                    please Him, he was ready to sacrifice His presence, which to
                    him was the thing dear above all others.”

                        Tertiae vero obiectioni dupliciter respondetur. Primo

                        quod evangelicae perfectioni non derogat. Unde prosper

                        subiungit: quo facto satis ostenditur et propria debere
                        propter perfectionem contemni, et sine impedimento

                        The third objection brought against the perfection of
                        the episcopal state admits of a double answer. First,
                        although a bishop holds certain possessions, he does not
                        regard them as his own; but he distributes them as
                        common property; and thus he does not violate
                        evangelical perfection. On this point Prosper says (XII.
                        quaestione 1), “It is right to possess the property of
                        the Church and to renounce one’s own belongings for the
                        love of perfection.”Again in the same chapter, after
                        quoting the example of St. Paulinus, he says, “By this
                        action we clearly learn, that it befits us to part with.
                        our own possessions for the sake of perfection, and
                        that, without any imperfection, we may possess the
                        common property of the Church.”

                            Circa quod tamen considerandum est, quod Ecclesiae
                            facultates si sic ab aliquo possideantur quod earum
                            fructus non lucrifaciat, sed solum dispenset, hoc
                            evangelicae perfectioni non derogat: alioquin
                            abbates et praepositi monasteriorum a religionis
                            perfectione deciderent contra votum paupertatis
                            agentes: quod est omnino absurdum. Si vero aliquis
                            ex communibus Ecclesiae facultatibus non solum
                            dispensator fructuum, sed dominus fiat eos
                            lucrifaciens, manifestum est eum aliquid proprium
                            possidere; et ita deficit a perfectione eorum qui
                            omnibus abrenuntiantes sine proprio vivunt. Sed quia
                            episcopi non solum facultates Ecclesiae possidere
                            possunt, sed etiam patrimonialia bona, de quibus
                            etiam eis testamentum condere licet; videtur quod ab
                            evangelica perfectione deficiant, ad quam invitavit
                            dominus Matth. XIX 21: si vis perfectus esse, vade
                            et vende omnia quae habes, et da pauperibus. Sed
                            haec quaestio de facili solvitur, si praedicta ad
                            memoriam revocentur. Dictum est enim supra, quod
                            abdicatio propriarum divitiarum non est perfectio,
                            sed quoddam perfectionis instrumentum. Possibile
                            autem est aliquem perfectionem acquirere sine
                            propriarum divitiarum abiectione actuali. Hoc autem
                            sic potest manifestari. Cum enim dominus
                            perfectionis documentum tradens dicat Matth. V 39 -
                            41: si quis percusserit te in maxillam dexteram,
                            praebe ei et alteram; et ei qui vult tecum in
                            iudicio contendere et tunicam tuam tollere, dimitte
                            ei pallium; et quicumque te angariaverit mille
                            passus, vade cum eo alia duo, non semper perfecti
                            hoc actu complent: alioquin dominus ab hac
                            perfectione defecit, quia alapa suscepta non
                            praebuit alteram, sed dixit: si male locutus sum,
                            perhibe testimonium de malo; si autem bene, quid me
                            caedis?, Ut dicitur Ioan. XVIII, 23. Sed nec Paulus
                            cum percuteretur, maxillam praebuit; sed, sicut
                            dicitur Act. XXIII 3, dixit: percutiet te Deus,

                            We must bear in mind that if anyone has charge of
                            the goods of the Church, and does not gain any
                            personal profit from them, but only acts as a
                            steward or dispenser, he does not fail in
                            evangelical perfection. Were this so, abbots and
                            superiors of monasteries would sin against their vow
                            of poverty and would fail in religious perfection,
                            which cannot at all be admitted. Of course, if a
                            bishop, not content with dispensing the revenues of
                            his see, should make himself their owner by using
                            them to his own personal profit, he would plainly be
                            the possessor of private property; and he would
                            thus, fail to attain to the perfection of those who
                            renounce everything, and live with nothing of their
                            own. But, it may be thought that bishops fail in the
                            evangelical perfection set forth in the words, “If
                            you would be perfect,” etc. (Matt. xix. 21), since
                            they are not only at liberty to possess the property
                            of their Church, but are also free to keep their own
                            patrimony, and to dispose of it by will. This
                            objection is easily answered, if the preceding
                            remarks be called to mind. As we have already said,
                            the renunciation of riches does not constitute
                            perfection; it is merely a means to it. It is quite
                            possible for a man to acquire perfection, without
                            actually giving up what he possesses. This may be
                            made clear by the following example. our Lord,
                            amongst other counsels of perfection, gave this: “If
                            someone strikes you on your right cheek, turn to him
                            the other: and if a man contends with you in
                            judgment and takes away your coat, let him take your
                            cloak also. And whoever forces you to go one mile,
                            go two miles with him” (Matt. v. 39-41). But even
                            the perfect do not obey these words literally. Nay,
                            our Lord Himself when He suffered a blow on the
                            face, did not turn His other cheek. He said, “If I
                            have spoken evil, give testimony of the evil, but if
                            well why do you strike me?” (John xviii. 23).
                            Neither did St. Paul, when he was smitten, offer his
                            cheek. He exclaimed, “God shall strike you, you
                            whited wall” (Acts xxiii. 3).

                                intelligere non in abstinendo nec in manducando
                                esse iustitiam, sed in aequanimitate tolerandi
                                inopiam. Unde et apostolus dicit, Philipp. IV,
                                12: scio (...) abundare et penuriam pati.

                                Hence, we see that it is not necessary that
                                these counsels should be actually obeyed; but,
                                as St. Augustine says in his book
                                <i>De Sermone Domini in Monte,</i> they are to
                                be understood as signifying the preparation of
                                the heart. For, perfection consists in a man’s
                                readiness to perform any work that may be
                                required of him. In like manner St. Augustine
                                cites in his book
                                <i>Quaestionum Evangelii</i> (and we find the
                                same in <i>Decretis,</i> Dist. xli.), our Lord’s
                                words, “Wisdom is justified by all her
                                children,” as proving that the sons of wisdom
                                understand that justice consists neither in
                                eating nor in abstinence, but in suffering want
                                with patience. St. Paul expresses the same
                                thought when he writes to the Philippians (iv.
                                12), “I know both how to abound and to suffer
                                need.”

                                    magnum certe monachorum certamen: et postea
                                    subdit: ibi, scilicet in monachico statu,
                                    ieiunium est durum, et vigiliae, et reliqua
                                    quae ad afflictionem corporis concurrunt:

                                    animam ars tota versatur. Et postea ponit

                                    Religious learn this serenity and patience
                                    in bearing poverty, by their practice of
                                    possessing nothing. Bishops, on the other
                                    hand, may attain to it, by exercising
                                    solicitude about their church and by
                                    fraternal charity, which ought to make them
                                    willing not merely to sacrifice their money,
                                    but, if need be, their very life for their
                                    flocks. St. Chrysostom says in his
                                    <i>Dialogue,</i> “Monks do in truth wage a
                                    severe war.” He then adds, “For the fasting,
                                    and vigils, and other penitential exercises
                                    of the monastic state are very hard and
                                    painful. But in the episcopal state, the
                                    conflict is more felt by the soul than by
                                    the body.” The saint further, by way of
                                    example, draws a comparison between a
                                    craftsman, who, by means of various
                                    instruments, produces marvellous pieces of
                                    mechanism, and a philosopher who displays
                                    his skill merely by the operations of his
                                    intellect.

                                        exercitio actus. Dominus enim apostolis
                                        mandavit, ut dicitur Matth. X, 9: nolite
                                        possidere aurum neque argentum, neque
                                        pecuniam in zonis vestris; non peram in

                                        calceamenta, neque virgam. Episcopi
                                        autem successores apostolorum sunt.
                                        Tenentur ergo ad haec mandata apostolis
                                        facta. Sed manifestum est id quod
                                        concluditur, verum non esse. Fuerunt
                                        enim multi in Ecclesia episcopi, de

                                        qui hoc non observaverunt, sicut
                                        Athanasius, Hilarius et alii plurimi. Ut
                                        autem Augustinus dicit in libro contra
                                        mendacium, non solum oportet praecepta
                                        Dei retinere, sed etiam vitam moresque
                                        iustorum. Itaque plura in verbis
                                        intelligere non valentes, in factis
                                        sanctorum colligimus, quemadmodum
                                        oportet accipi. Et huius ratio est quia
                                        idem spiritus sanctus qui loquitur in
                                        Scripturis, movet sanctos ad operandum,
                                        secundum illud Rom. VIII 14: qui spiritu
                                        Dei aguntur, hi filii Dei sunt. Et ideo
                                        non est credendum, id quod a sanctis
                                        viris communiter agitur, contra divinum

                                        to practise this perfection of the
                                        renunciation of riches, not in will
                                        alone, but also in deed. For, when our
                                        Lord sent His disciples on their
                                        mission, He said to them: “Do not
                                        possess gold, nor silver, nor money. in
                                        your purses: nor scrip for your journey,
                                        nor two coats, nor shoes, nor a staff”
                                        (Matt. x. 9). Now, as bishops are the
                                        successors of the Apostles, they ought
                                        to obey the precept given to the
                                        Apostles. But this conclusion is clearly
                                        fallacious. For some of the most saintly
                                        bishops of the Church, whose holiness is
                                        beyond question, such as Athanasius,
                                        Hilary, and many of their successors,
                                        have not observed this command of our
                                        Lord. As St. Augustine says, in his book
                                        <i>Contra mendacium,</i> “We must not
                                        only bear in mind the precepts of God,
                                        but we must also be attentive to the
                                        lives and customs of the just.” For,
                                        although we fail to understand many
                                        things that are written for us, we can
                                        gather their meaning from the deeds of
                                        the saints, and thus learn in what sense
                                        we are to interpret them. It is on this
                                        account, that the Holy Spirit, Who
                                        speaks by the Scriptures, inspires the
                                        actions of the Saints. St. Paul tells us
                                        the same truth when he says, “Whosoever
                                        are led by the Spirit of God, they are
                                        the sons of God (Rom. viii. 14). Hence,
                                        we have no right to conclude that what
                                        is commonly done by holy men, is
                                        contrary to the Divine commandments. our
                                        Lord, in the chapter of St. Matthew
                                        already quoted, gives a reason for His
                                        words to His Apostles, bidding them not
                                        to possess anything, nor to take
                                        anything on their journey. “The
                                        labourer,” He says, “is worthy of his
                                        hire.” Thus He gives a permission, not a
                                        command, to His disciples, to accept
                                        hospitality. Therefore, if any one of
                                        them desired not to avail himself of
                                        this permission, but preferred to carry
                                        provisions with him, be would not be
                                        disobeying a precept of his Master. For
                                        there is a difference between disobeying
                                        a command, and omitting (after the
                                        example of St. Paul) to make use of a
                                        permission.

                                            35-36. Quaesivit enim ab eis: quando

                                            We may further understand these
                                            words of Christ to the Apostles, by
                                            remembering that He was sending them
                                            to preach to the Jews, with whom it
                                            was customary for the teachers to
                                            Eve by the contributions of their
                                            disciples. our Lord (says St.
                                            Chrysostom) desired, first, that His
                                            disciples should be above suspicion,
                                            and should not be thought to be
                                            preaching for the sake of gain.
                                            Secondly, He wished them to be free
                                            from anxiety about material things.
                                            Thirdly, He willed that they should,
                                            by experience, learn that, without
                                            anxiety on their part, His power
                                            could provide them with all that
                                            they might need. But He acted
                                            differently on the Eve of His
                                            Passion, when He was about to send
                                            them forth to preach to the
                                            Gentiles. For, then, He said to
                                            them, “When I sent you without
                                            purse, and scrip, and shoes) did you
                                            want anything? But they said:
                                            nothing. Then said He unto them: But
                                            now he that has a purse let him take
                                            it, and likewise a scrip” (Luke
                                            xxii). These words prove that
                                            bishops, as successors of the
                                            Apostles, are not bound to possess
                                            nothing, nor to carry nothing with
                                            them on their journeys.

                ST. PAUL exhorts the Corinthians (1 Ep. xii. 31) to be “zealous
                for the better gifts.” Seeing, then, how far the episcopal
                office exceeds, in perfection, the religious life, ought men not
                to be more eager to be made bishops, than to become religious?
                If anyone who asks this question will give a little
                consideration to the matter, he will see that while there is
                abundant reason why the religious life should be desired, the
                episcopal office, on the contrary, should, by no means, be
                coveted. For he who enters religion, renounces himself together
                with all that belongs to him, and, for the love of God, submits
                himself to the government of another. On the other hand, he who
                is promoted to a bishopric, is raised to an exalted position in
                God’s kingdom upon earth. Consequently, as honour and power are
                not rightfully bestowed on any save on the best among men, it
                would be presumptuous to aspire to such a dignity.

                    apostolus quid sit episcopatus, quia nomen est operis, non
                    honoris. Graecum est enim atque inde translatum vocabulum,
                    quod ille qui praeficitur eis quibus praeficitur
                    superintendit, curam scilicet eorum gerens: scopos quippe
                    intentio est. Ergo episcopin, si velimus, Latine
                    superintendere dicere possumus, ut intelligat non se esse
                    episcopum qui praeesse dilexerit, non prodesse. Itaque a
                    studio cognoscendae veritatis nemo prohibetur, quod ad
                    laudabile pertinet otium; locus vero superior, sine quo regi
                    populus non potest, etsi ita teneatur atque administretur ut
                    decet, tamen indecenter appetitur. Quamobrem otium sanctum
                    quaerit caritas veritatis, negotium iustum suscipit
                    necessitas caritatis: quam sarcinam si nullus imponit,
                    percipiendae atque intuendae vacandum est veritati. Si autem
                    imponitur, suscipienda est propter caritatis necessitatem.
                    Chrysostomus etiam super Matthaeum, exponens illud,
                    principes gentium dominantur eorum, sic dicit: opus quidem
                    desiderare bonum, bonum est, quia nostrae voluntatis est, et
                    nostra est merces: primatum autem honoris concupiscere
                    vanitas est. Neque enim apostolus laudem habebit apud Deum
                    quia apostolus fuit, sed si opus apostolatus sui bene
                    implevit. Conversatio ergo melior desideranda est, non
                    dignior gradus.

                    St. Augustine, in chapter xix. <i>De civitate Dei</i>, says
                    that, “the Apostle wished to explain what is meant by the
                    episcopate, for it is a title not of honour but of labour.
                    The Latin word <i>episcopus</i> (from which is derived our
                    word episcopate) is precisely the same word as the Greek
                    <i>episkopos</i>, signifying an overseer or superintendent.
                    Hence he is no true bishop who desires to be placed above
                    others, rather than to be of use to them. We need not
                    disguise the truth, that the episcopate is accompanied by
                    honourable leisure. Nevertheless, it is a sublime post,
                    essential in the government of a people, and so much is
                    required for the due performance of the duties connected
                    with it, that no man possessed of common modesty, could
                    aspire to such an office. For, although the love of truth
                    may seek holy leisure; the necessity of charity accepts
                    fitting employment; and if no one lay this burden upon us,
                    we must devote ourselves to truth, both of perception and
                    study. But if the burthen be imposed upon us, we must accept
                    it as a duty of charity.” St. Chrysostom, commenting on the
                    words in the Gospel of St. Matthew, “the rulers of the
                    Gentiles have dominion over them,” says: “It is well to wish
                    for a good thing, because it be according to our will, and
                    is our reward; but it is vanity to desire a supremacy of
                    honour. The Apostle was not exalted by God because he was an
                    apostle, but because he duly accomplished the work of his
                    apostolate. Worthiness of life is to be desired, not
                    superior dignity.”

                        inducit; pontificalis autem dignitas perfectionem
                        praesupponit: qui enim pontificatus honorem suscipit,
                        spirituale magisterium assumit. Unde apostolus dicebat I

                        fieri qui perfectionem per experimentum non novit. Et,
                        sicut Gregorius dicit in pastorali, tantum debet
                        actionem populi actio transcendere praesulis, quantum
                        distare solet a grege vita pastoris. Quae quidem
                        differentia ex verbis domini manifeste colligitur. Cum
                        enim dominus paupertatis consilium daret, his verbis est
                        usus: si vis perfectus esse, vade, et vende omnia quae
                        habes, et da pauperibus.

                        We must, further, remark that the religious life leads
                        indeed to perfection, but does not presuppose it;
                        whereas the episcopal dignity presupposes perfection.
                        For he who enters the episcopal state takes upon himself
                        the office of a spiritual teacher. As St. Paul says (1
                        Tim. ii. 7), “I am appointed a preacher, an Apostle (I
                        say the truth, I lie not), a teacher of the Gentiles, in
                        faith and, truth.” It would be an absurdity to undertake
                        to teach others to be perfect, without previous personal
                        experience of perfection. St. Gregory says in his
                        Pastoral, “The deeds of a bishop ought to surpass those
                        of his flock, as greatly as his life is removed from
                        theirs.” This distinction is clearly expressed by our
                        Lord. For, when He gave the counsel of poverty, He
                        merely said, “If you would be perfect, go, sell what you
                        have, and give to the poor.” This shows that the
                        practice of poverty does not presuppose perfection,
                        although it leads men to it. But when He gave St. Peter
                        supremacy over his brethren, He said, “Simon, son of
                        John, do you love me?” And when St. Peter answered: “You
                        know that I love you,” Christ replied, in turn, “Feed my
                        sheep.”

                            Ubi manifeste apparet quod paupertatis assumptio
                            perfectionem non praeexigit, sed ad eam ducit. Cum
                            vero praelationis officium Petro committeret,
                            quaesivit: Simon Ioannis, diligis me plus his? Qui
                            cum responderet, tu scis quia amo te; subiecit:
                            pasce oves meas. Per quod manifeste datur intelligi
                            quod perfectionem caritatis praeexigit assumptio
                            praelationis. Praesumptuosum autem esse videtur ut
                            quis se aestimet esse perfectum: unde apostolus
                            dicit, Philipp. III, 12: non quod iam acceperim, aut
                            iam perfectus sim: et postea subdit: quicumque ergo
                            perfecti sumus, hoc sentiamus. Quod autem aliquis
                            perfectionem desideret, et eam assequi velit, non
                            praesumptionis, sed sanctae aemulationis esse
                            videtur: ad quam apostolus hortatur I ad Cor. XII
                            31: aemulamini charismata meliora. Et ideo
                            religionis statum assumere, laudabile est; ad
                            praelationis autem fastigium anhelare, est nimiae
                            praesumptionis. Unde Gregorius dicit in pastorali:
                            is qui recusavit praelationis officium, plene non
                            restitit; et is qui mitti voluit, ante se per
                            altaris calculum purgatum vidit: ne aut non purgatus
                            adire quisque sacra mysteria audeat, aut quem
                            superna gratia elegit sub humilitatis specie superbe
                            contradicat. Quia ergo valde difficile est purgatum
                            se quemlibet posse cognoscere, praedicationis
                            officium tutius declinatur.

                          <td>
                            Hence, it is evident, that elevation to the
                            episcopate assumes perfection in the person thus
                            honoured; and that it would be the height of
                            presumption, for any man to consider himself
                            perfect. Even St. Paul says, “Not as though I had
                            already attained or were already perfect” (Philipp.
                            iii. 12). Again, in the same chapter, he adds, “Let
                            us, therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus
                            minded.” To desire perfection, and to strive to
                            follow after it, is not presumption. It is that holy
                            zeal to which St. Paul exhorts us, saying, “Be,
                            therefore, zealous for the better gifts” (1 Cor.
                            xii. 31). Hence, it is praiseworthy to wish to
                            embrace the religious life, although a desire for
                            the episcopate is gross presumption. St. Gregory
                            says, in his Pastoral, “He who has refused a
                            bishopric has not completely resisted it; and he who
                            has willed to be raised to it, has first seen
                            himself cleansed by the stone of the altar.” By
                            these words we are to understand, that a man, chosen
                            for the episcopate, should not absolutely refuse
                            this honour. Nor yet should he aspire to it, unless
                            he knows that he be cleansed in preparation for it.
                            Nor should anyone, who is not thus purified, dare to
                            approach the sacred mysteries. Neither, if he be
                            chosen by divine grace, for this dignity, ought he,
                            through pride disguised as humility, to decline to
                            accept it. But, as it is exceedingly difficult for
                            any man to know whether he be purified or not, the
                            safest course is to decline a bishopric.

                                Another point must be considered in our
                                comparison between the religious and episcopal
                                state The religious life implies a renunciation
                                of earthly possessions; whereas a bishopric is
                                accompanied by great additional wealth. They who
                                become religious give up all they possess, thus
                                showing that they seek not temporal but
                                spiritual goods. They who undertake the
                                episcopal office are frequently wont to think
                                more of temporal, than of eternal riches. St.
                                Gregory says in his Pastoral, “that the truly
                                praiseworthy condition under which to accept a
                                bishopric, would be, if a man were to know, as a
                                certainty, that such an office would inv be
                                severe torture.” Again, he says, “It is not
                                every man who loves the sanctity of the
                                episcopal office. But that sanctity is
                                completely ignored by those, who, aspiring to
                                such a dignity, are entranced by the idea of
                                having others subject to them, are rejoiced at
                                the thought of being praised, set their hearts
                                on being honoured, and rejoice at the prospect
                                of affluence. In such a case as that, men are
                                coveting worldly advancement under the disguise
                                of an office, in which it is their duty to try
                                to extirpate earthly ambition.”

                                    periculis se exponit. Dicit enim Gregorius
                                    in pastorali: plerumque in occupatione
                                    regiminis ipse quoque boni operis usus
                                    perditur, qui in tranquillitate tenebatur:
                                    quia quieto mari recte navim et imperitus
                                    dirigit, turbato autem tempestatis fluctibus
                                    etiam peritus se nauta confundit. Quid
                                    namque est potestas culminis nisi tempestas
                                    mentis, in qua cogitationum semper procellis
                                    navis cordis quatitur, huc illuc et
                                    incessanter impellitur, ut per repentinos
                                    excessus oris et operis quasi per obviantia
                                    saxa frangatur. Cuius periculi exemplum in
                                    David apparet, qui, ut Gregorius dicit,
                                    David actoris iudicio pene in cunctis
                                    actibus placens, ut pressurae pondere
                                    caruit, in tumore vulneris erupit, factusque
                                    est in morte viri crudeliter rigidus qui in
                                    appetitu feminae fuit enerviter fluxus:
                                    prius perire deprehensum persecutorem
                                    noluit, et post cum damno exercitus devotum
                                    militem extinxit.

                                    Again, we must remember that bishops are
                                    exposed to many risks. We may, on this
                                    point, again quote St. Gregory. He writes in
                                    his Pastoral, “It often happens that in the
                                    office of governing, others, a man loses the
                                    habit of good works, which he practised in
                                    private life. For on a calm sea, even an
                                    inexperienced seaman can steer a vessel;
                                    whereas, in a gale, the most experienced
                                    mariner may lose his bearings. And may not a
                                    position of great power be fitly compared to
                                    a tempest of the mind, where the heart is
                                    incessantly rocked to and fro by waves of
                                    thought, to be dashed to pieces (as by
                                    rocks) by some sudden excess of word or
                                    deed?” David is quoted by St. Gregory as an
                                    example of the dangers to which men in an
                                    exalted position are exposed. “David,” he
                                    says, “whose every act was pleasing in the
                                    sight of the Supreme Judge, became, after he
                                    was raised to kingly magnificence, puffed up
                                    with pride, and so cruelly hardened, as to
                                    cause the death of a man. He, who, in former
                                    times, refused to slay his captured enemy,
                                    was, in his later days, so led away by his
                                    desire for a woman, that, to the detriment
                                    of his, own army, he artfully caused the
                                    death of a most loyal soldier.”

                                        eo quod fugio, sed ideo fugio ne vincar.
                                        Nulla securitas est vicino serpente
                                        dormire: potest fieri ut me non mordeat,

                                        mordeat. Quod igitur aliquis pericula
                                        peccati evitans religionis statum
                                        assumat, prudentiae est. Quod vero

                                        vel nimiae praesumptionis est, si se tam

                                        He who embraces the religious life
                                        escapes the danger of sin. Hence St.
                                        Jerome, speaking in the person of a
                                        monk, writes in his Epistle against
                                        Vigilantius, “When I forsake the world,
                                        I shall not be overcome, because I have
                                        fled it; but I shall flee from it, lest
                                        by it I should be overcome. There is no
                                        security in sleeping near a serpent;
                                        for, though perchance it may not molest
                                        me, it may on the other hand inflict on
                                        me a grievous wound. Thus, it is an act
                                        of prudence to enter religious life, in
                                        order to avoid the occasions of sin. But
                                        he who aspires to the episcopate, has
                                        either the extreme presumption to
                                        consider that he will be safe in the
                                        midst of dangers, or else he is so
                                        heedless of his salvation, that he cares
                                        not to escape from the occasions of
                                        sinning.” Hence, we must conclude, that,
                                        although the episcopal office be a state
                                        of perfection, it cannot, without the
                                        sin of covetousness, be desired.

                    1. First, they quote the following words of St. Chrysostom.
                    (<i>Dialogue, lib. VT</i>). “Let any man show me a monk
                    resembling even Elijah, and let us grant that this monk,
                    living alone, without annoyance or vexation of any kind, is
                    not troubled by temptation, and does not fall into grave
                    sin. I tell you, nevertheless, that such a man is not to be
                    compared to one, who, although the minister of the people,
                    and laden with the sins of men, perseveres with energy and
                    fidelity.” These words naturally convey the impression that
                    no monk, howsoever perfect he may be, can bear comparison
                    with a priest who is entrusted with the cure of souls, and
                    who discharges his trust with diligence. Again, St.
                    Chrysostom says, “Were I given my choice as to whether I
                    would prefer to serve God in the functions of the
                    priesthood, or in monastic solitude, I should, without
                    hesitation, choose the first of these conditions.” Hence the
                    cure of souls is, indubitably, to be preferred to religious
                    solitude, which is reckoned as the most perfect state of
                    life.

                        Yet, in the eyes of God, no sight is so execrable, so
                        sad, or so worthy of condemnation, as these sacred
                        offices fulfilled in such a manner.

                            especially in our days, more difficult, more
                            laborious or more beset by danger, than is the
                            office of bishop, priest, or deacon. Yet, in the
                            eyes of God, no one presents a more glorious
                            spectacle, than he who, in such an office, fights
                            manfully, according to the precepts of our Sovereign
                            Master.” Hence, the religious life is not a more
                            perfect state than is that of priests or deacons,
                            who have the cure of souls, and whose duty it is to
                            mingle with men.

                                4. Again, St. Augustine says to Aurelius, “It
                                is, indeed, lamentable, if we puff monks up with
                                pride, and decry the dignity of the clergy, to
                                whose order we belong. Shall we suffer ignorant
                                people to say of us: ‘a bad monk will make a
                                good cleric,’ when as we know that even a good
                                monk is not always a good cleric?” The
                                perfection of a good cleric is, therefore,
                                greater than is that of a good monk.

                                    5. The same Saint had previously written,
                                    “We must not open a way to the servants of
                                    God (<i>i.e.</i>, to monks), whereby they
                                    may think that it may be easier for them to
                                    be chosen for some better office
                                    (<i>i.e.</i>, for some clerical post), if,
                                    by such a step, leaving their monastery they
                                    should grow worse.” The clerical office is,
                                    consequently, better than the monastic
                                    state. In the same spirit St. Jerome writes
                                    to Rusticus, “So live in your monastery,
                                    that you may deserve to be made a cleric.”
                                    The clerical office is, therefore, superior
                                    to the monastic life.

                                        from a higher to a lower state.
                                        Nevertheless, it is lawful to pass from
                                        the monastic life to that of a cleric,
                                        entrusted with the cure of souls. We
                                        learn this fact from the words of Pope
                                        Gelasius (XVI. question I), “If there be
                                        any monk, who, by virtue of his holy
                                        life, should seem worthy to be raised to
                                        the priesthood, and if the abbot, under
                                        whose rule such a monk is fighting in
                                        the army of Christ, should beg this
                                        favour for him from the bishop, that
                                        monk ought to be chosen. Further a monk
                                        so elected, whether by the bishop or the
                                        people, must discreetly and uprightly
                                        fulfil all the duties of the priesthood
                                        in the place wherein it shall have
                                        seemed good to ordain him.” Several
                                        other rules about the same matter are
                                        laid down in this chapter and in
                                        <i>dist. 47.</i> Hence, it is plain to
                                        all men, that the state of any clerics,
                                        and especially of such as have the care
                                        of souls, is superior to the religious
                                        life.

                                            one thing, and a perfect
                                            <i>state</i> another. The state of

                                            pertain to perfection. Now, many

                                                ordinis. Manifestum est autem

                                                We must also remember that, in
                                                speaking of priests and
                                                archdeacons charged with the
                                                cure of souls, two points must
                                                be taken into consideration, to
                                                wit, the office of the cure of
                                                souls, and the dignity of their
                                                orders. Now, as parish priests
                                                and archdeacons often leave
                                                their parishes and
                                                archidiaconates to go into
                                                religion, it is clear, that, by
                                                accepting the cure of souls,
                                                they do not contract any
                                                perpetual obligation. But, from
                                                what has been already said, we
                                                know that no state of perfection
                                                can exist without a perpetual
                                                obligation. Hence, we cannot say
                                                that archdeacons, or parish
                                                priests, or candidates for
                                                ordination, have embraced a
                                                state of perfection, any more
                                                than we can say that novices,
                                                before their profession, have
                                                embraced this state.

                                                    we have already observed,
                                                    that a man who does not live
                                                    in a state of perfection may

                                                    to the habit of charity.
                                                    Thus, archdeacons and parish
                                                    priests may be perfect
                                                    according to the habit of
                                                    charity, and may share in
                                                    certain offices of
                                                    perfection, although they

                                                    perfection lies in the fact

                                                    bishops are consecrated, and

                                                    Hence it is clear that no

                                                    embraces a state implying

                                                        mariner who is able to
                                                        save his vessel when she
                                                        is in danger of being
                                                        submerged by a tempest,
                                                        is deservedly held by.
                                                        all men to be an
                                                        experienced seaman.” In
                                                        the same manner we may
                                                        say, that he who is able
                                                        to live uprightly in the
                                                        midst of bad men, gives
                                                        proof of greater virtue
                                                        than he who leads a
                                                        worthy life amongst good
                                                        men. Hence, St. Peter
                                                        says, in praise of Lot
                                                        (2 Pet. ii. 8), that “in
                                                        sight and hearing he was
                                                        just: dwelling among
                                                        them, who, from day to
                                                        day, vexed the just soul
                                                        with unjust works.” But
                                                        we cannot say, that to
                                                        live among wicked men
                                                        belongs to the state of
                                                        perfection, since,
                                                        according to the
                                                        teaching of the Holy
                                                        Scripture, prudence
                                                        instructs us to shun
                                                        their company. We see,
                                                        then, that the state of
                                                        priests, charged with
                                                        the care of souls, is
                                                        not more perfect; but
                                                        that it is more exposed
                                                        to danger, than is that
                                                        of religious.

                AFTER I had finished writing that upon which I have just been
                engaged, certain objections to my arguments came to my ears made
                by men who are too fond of disputing, to bestow much reflection
                either upon what they say or what they hear. In order to confute
                their arguments, I must return to what has already been said.

                    Primo quidem igitur multipliciter nituntur ostendere
                    archidiaconos vel parochiales presbyteros in statu
                    perfectionis esse, et maioris quam religiosi. Presbyter enim
                    si delinquat, iubetur eiici de statu suo secundum canones,
                    ut habetur 81 distin.: si quis amodo episcopus, et 14,
                    quaest. 4: si quis oblitus. Ergo erat in statu; alioquin a

                    1. First, these objectors endeavour to prove, by divers
                    arguments, that archdeacons and parish priests are in a
                    higher and more perfect state than are religious. For, if a
                    priest fall into sin, he is ordered by the Canons to be
                    deposed from his state (cf. Gratian, LXXXI, distinction: “
                    <i>Si quis amodo episcopus</i> ” and XIV. Quest. IV: “
                    <i>Si quis oblitus</i> ”). Hence he must have been in a
                    certain state, or he could not be deposed from it.

                        Item, invenitur status multipliciter dici. Importat enim
                        rectitudinem: nam homo erectus dicitur stare. Unde
                        Gregorius dicit in VII Moralium: ab omni statu
                        rectitudinis dispereunt qui per noxia verba dilabuntur.
                        Importat etiam permanentiam et fixionem, secundum illud
                        Gregorii in 8 Moral.: conditoris protectio et custodia
                        est, quod in statu permanemus. Et in 9 Homil. secundae
                        partis super Ezech.: lapis quadrus est, et quasi ex omni
                        latere statum habet, qui casum in aliqua permutatione
                        non habet. Importat etiam magnitudinem vel longitudinem:
                        dicitur enim a stando. Cum igitur archidiaconi et
                        parochiales presbyteri habeant magnitudinem spiritualem,
                        dum propter zelum animarum curam suscipiunt; habeant
                        etiam permanentiam, quia inter pericula immobiles
                        perseverant et fortes; habeant etiam rectitudinem et
                        intentionis et iustitiae: non est dicendum, huiusmodi in
                        statu non esse.

                      <td>
                        2. Now a state can be used in a threefold signification.
                        First, it implies uprightness of life; the elect are
                        spoken of as “standing in justice.” St. Gregory says
                        (VII. <i>Moral.</i>), “They who sin by mischievous
                        words, fall from the state of rectitude.” Again, a state
                        conveys an idea of permanence and, stability, as we see
                        from the words of St. Gregory (VIII. <i>Moral.</i>), “It
                        is the care and protection of our Creator that keeps us
                        in a state of being.”Again, in the ninth Homily (2
                        <sup>nd</sup> part) on Ezechiel, “A stone is square;
                        and, by means of each of its four sides, it is kept in
                        such a state, that it will not fall, howsoever its
                        position may be altered.” State (derived from
                        <i>stare</i> and <i>stando</i>) also signifies greatness
                        or length. Now archdeacons and parish priests have a
                        certain spiritual greatness, since, on account of their
                        zeal, they undertake the cure of souls. They, likewise,
                        give proofs of stability, for they remain firm and
                        constant in the midst of dangers. They are further
                        upright in intention, and just in their dealings. Why,
                        then, should we deny that they are in a state of
                        perfection.

                            Item, religionum institutio praeiudicare non potuit
                            diaconibus et presbyteris curam animarum habentibus.
                            Sed ante institutas religiones praedicti curam
                            animarum habentes statum perfectionis tenebant:
                            dicitur enim I Tim. V, 17: qui bene praesunt
                            presbyteri, scilicet vita et doctrina, digni
                            habeantur a subditis duplici honore; ut scilicet eis
                            spiritualiter obediant, et exteriora ministrent.
                            Ergo etiam post religiones institutas habent statum
                            perfectionis.
                          </td>
                          <td>
                            3. [Again, the establishment of religious orders
                            cannot be to the detriment of deacons and priests
                            who have charge of souls. But before religious
                            orders were founded, those in charge of souls were
                            in the state of percection.] Thus, St. Paul writes
                            to Timothy (1 Ep. v. 17), “Let the priests who rule
                            well,” to wit by good life and doctrine, “be
                            esteemed worthy of a double honour”; let them, that
                            is to say, be obeyed in spiritual matters, and be
                            provided for in their temporal wants. If, then,
                            before the existence of religious orders, priests
                            were in a state of perfection, the same must also be
                            the case since the religious life has been
                            established.

                                Item. Dicunt, quod tempore Hieronymi presbyter
                                et episcopus erant nomina synonima, ut patet per
                                illud quod dicit Hieronymus super epistolam ad
                                Titum: olim idem presbyter qui et episcopus. Sed
                                postea in toto orbe decretum est ut unus de
                                presbyteris praeponeretur, et schismatum semina
                                tollerentur. Si ergo episcopi sunt in statu
                                perfectiori quam religiosi, etiam presbyteri in
                                statu perfectiori erunt.

                                4. It is further said, that in the days of St.
                                Jerome, the titles <i>bishops</i> and
                                <i>priests</i> were synonymous. The following
                                words of this Saint (super
                                <i>Epist. ad Titum</i>) are quoted in proof of
                                this assertion: “Formerly bishop and priest were
                                one and the same, but now, it is decreed
                                throughout the whole world, that one man should
                                be set over priests, in order that the seeds of
                                schism may be extirpated.” If, then, the
                                episcopate be a state of greater perfection than
                                the religious life, why is not the priesthood,
                                likewise, a state of greater perfection?

                                    activa est magis fructifera, ut habetur

                                    5. Again, the more sublime and important the
                                    ecclesiastical office to which a man is
                                    appointed, the higher his state is
                                    accounted. Now, archdeacons and parish
                                    priests exercise a more exalted office than
                                    do religious. For, although the
                                    contemplative life be the safer, the active
                                    life is by far the more fruitful of the two
                                    (cf. Gratian,
                                    <i

                                    >). It follows therefore, that parish
                                    priests are in a state of greater perfection
                                    than is the case with religious.

                                        6. Further, our Lord says, “Greater love
                                        than this has no man, that a man lay
                                        down his life for his friend” (John xv.
                                        13). Now, good parish priests do
                                        sacrifice their lives for their flocks,
                                        and make themselves the servants of
                                        their people. In this they imitate St.
                                        Paul, who says (1 Cor. ix. 19), “For,
                                        whereas I was free as to all, I made
                                        myself the servant of all.”It would
                                        seem, then, that theirs must be the
                                        greater merit, since theirs is the
                                        severer toil. “I have laboured more
                                        abundantly than all they,” says St. Paul
                                        (1 Cor. xv. 15). And again he writes,
                                        “Every man shall receive his own reward,
                                        according to his own labour “(1 Cor.,
                                        iii. 8). Hence, parish priests should be
                                        regarded as in a more perfect state than
                                        religious.

                                            archdeacons; for the seven deacons
                                            elected by the Apostles were in a
                                            state of eminent perfection. We are
                                            told (Acts vi. 3), “Wherefore,
                                            brethren, look ye out among you
                                            seven men of good repute, full of
                                            the Holy Ghost and wisdom, whom we
                                            may appoint over this business.” On
                                            which words Venerable Bede says in
                                            his Gloss, “The Apostles designed
                                            that the Churches should establish
                                            seven deacons, who should be in a
                                            superior position to others, and who
                                            should stand round the altar, like
                                            columns.” If they were to be
                                            superior to others, and if they were
                                            to be set apart as columns round the
                                            altar, they must have been in a
                                            state of perfection. Now, according
                                            to the Gloss of Ven. Bede, their
                                            representatives are the archdeacons,
                                            who themselves minister, and who
                                            also superintend the ministry of
                                            others. Hence, it would appear that
                                            archdeacons are in a state of higher
                                            perfection than are the parish
                                            priests, over whom they are set; and
                                            that they are, consequently, in a
                                            more perfect state than are
                                            religious.

                    securior. Ad hoc probandum inducit quod dicitur Extra. de

                    1. First, because they can, without sin, resign their
                    office. We are told, first, that pastors of souls may resign
                    their posts and retire into religion; because while the
                    pastorate is a more useful and more perfect state than the
                    religious, the religious life is the safer of the two. In
                    proof of this, the passage, <i>Nisi cum pridem</i> from
                    <i>Extra de renuntiat.</i> is quoted.

                        religionis, vel aequalis ei; sed quia se uxori suae per

                        married state is more perfect than, or even equal to,
                        the religious, but because a husband binds himself
                        indissolubly to his wife. And, <i>a pari,</i> the fact
                        that a parish priest can pass into the religious life,
                        does not prove that the religious state exceeds, or even
                        equals, the pastorate in perfection.

                            I Reg. XVII, cum non posset pugnare in armis Saulis,
                            quae requirebant maiorem fortitudinem, contulit se
                            ad arma maioris humilitatis, licet minoris roboris

                            licet esset in statu perfectiori.

                            3. The example of David is also alleged as an
                            argument against our proposition. Being unable to
                            meet Saul with ordinary armour, which would have
                            been too heavy for him, David provided himself with
                            lowlier weapons, to wit with a sling and stones; and
                            with these alone he overthrew the mighty Philistine.
                            After this example, a parish priest may, likewise,
                            take to himself arms of greater humility,
                            <i>i.e.,</i> he may transfer himself from his own
                            more perfect state to the religious life.

                                4. It is further objected, that, if the essence
                                of a state depend upon the fact that that state
                                cannot be changed, it would not be lawful for a
                                man to pass from one state to another. Hence,
                                immutability is not essential to a state.

                                                promulgated in the time of Pope
                                                Innocent, forbids prelates of
                                                the highest rank (<i>i.e.</i>
                                                bishops) to become religious,
                                                without the permission of the
                                                Sovereign Pontiff. This appears
                                                in the decretal
                                                <i>Extra de renuntiatione,</i>
                                                cap. <i>Nisi cum pridem.</i> But
                                                before the promulgation of this
                                                decree, the highest in the
                                                Church as well as the lowest,
                                                were free to become religious;
                                                and yet bishops are in a more
                                                perfect state than are the
                                                inferior clergy. The fact, then,
                                                that parish priests can become
                                                religious without the permission
                                                of the Sovereign Pontiff, does
                                                not prevent their being in a
                                                more perfect state than are
                                                religious.

                WE will now carefully examine each of the arguments quoted in
                the last chapter (ch. 21, first set), in order to show how truly
                they may be set aside, as frivolous, absurd, and erroneous.

                    Quod enim primo inducunt quosdam canones ad probandum
                    presbyteros curatos et archidiaconos in statu esse, nihil ad
                    propositum facit. Nam in capitulis inductis nulla fit mentio
                    de statu, sed de gradu. Sic enim habetur 81, dist.: si quis
                    amodo episcopus, presbyter, diaconus feminam acceperit, vel
                    acceptam retinuerit, a proprio decidat gradu. Et XIV qu. 4
                    dicitur: si quis oblitus timorem domini et sanctarum
                    Scripturarum, etc., faeneraverit, etc., de gradu suo
                    deiectus, alienus habeatur a clero. Non ergo per hoc probari
                    potest a contrario sensu, quod habeat statum, sed gradum. Et
                    hoc necesse est; quia ubicumque est ordo vel superioritas
                    aliqua, ibi est aliquis gradus.

                    Ad 1. First. We are told that certain canonical decrees
                    prove that archdeacons and pastors of souls are in a fixed
                    state. This argument is worthless, for the Canons in
                    question speak, not of the state, of the clergy, but of
                    their rank. The words used in distinction LXXXI are,
                    “Henceforth, should any bishop, priest, or deacon, take a
                    wife, or keep one whom he has married, let him be degraded
                    from his rank.”Again (in XIV, question IV, can. “
                    <i>Si quis dicetur</i> ”), we find the following passage,
                    “If any man, forgetful of the Law of the Lord, and of the
                    words of Holy Scripture ‘who has not given his money out at
                    usury’ shall, after the constitution of the Great Council,
                    have committed usury, or received interest on his money, or
                    enriched himself by any dishonest practice, or by selling or
                    buying wine, corn or property of any kind, let him be
                    degraded from his rank; and let him be considered an outcast
                    from the clergy.” Thus, these words cannot be understood to
                    speak of clerical state, but of that clerical rank which
                    must necessarily exist. For, wheresoever there be any order
                    or superiority, there must be specified degrees of rank.

                        Quod vero secundo est positum, quam sit frivolum,
                        quilibet intelligens advertere potest. Nulli enim dubium
                        est statum multipliciter dici. Nam ille qui erigitur,

                        distinguitur status incipientium, proficientium et
                        perfectorum. Stare etiam firmitatem importat, secundum
                        illud apostoli I Cor. XV 58: stabiles estote et
                        immobiles in omni opere bono. Non autem sic loquimur de
                        statu, sed secundum quod dicitur status libertatis vel
                        servitutis, sicut accipitur 2, quaest. 6: si quando in
                        causa capitali vel causa status interpellatum fuerit,
                        non per exploratores, sed per se ipsos est agendum. Et
                        sic accipiendo statum, illi statum perfectionis
                        accipiunt qui se servos constituunt ad opera
                        perfectionis implenda, ut supra dictum est. Hoc autem
                        non contingit nisi per votum perpetuae obligationis,
                        quia servitus libertati opponitur. Quandiu igitur in sua
                        libertate aliquis habet recedere a perfectionis opere,
                        statum perfectionis non habet, sicut et supra ostensum
                        est.

                        Ad 2. With regard to the second argument, we may say
                        that its absurdity is so patent, that none can fail to
                        see it. No one doubts that the word <i>state</i> is used
                        with several meanings. For he who is erect is said to
                        stand. We also distinguish between the state of
                        beginners, of proficients, and of the perfect. To stand
                        also means to be firm. Thus St. Paul says (1 Cor. xv.
                        58), “Be steadfast and immoveable: always abounding in
                        the work of the Lord.” But this is not the usual way in
                        which the word <i>state</i> is used. We employ it,
                        rather, to indicate a certain condition; we say, a state
                        of liberty, or a state of slavery. It is made use of in
                        this sense in II, Quest. VI., where these words occur,
                        “If we should by chance be appealed to in a capital
                        charge, or in a suit concerning a state, we must act at
                        our own discretion, not by means of examiners.” If we
                        accept the word state in this sense, it is true to say,
                        that they embrace the state of perfection who, as we
                        have before said, bind themselves to the service of
                        works of perfection. This cannot be the case save by a
                        vow, implying a perpetual obligation of service or
                        servitude, as opposed to liberty. As long, then, as a
                        man is free to abandon the works of perfection, he is
                        not in a state of perfection.

                            Quod vero tertio propositum fuit, tam frivolum est
                            ut responsione non egeat. In hoc enim quod dicitur:
                            qui bene praesunt presbyteri etc., nec de
                            perfectione nec de statu fit mentio. Praeesse enim
                            non constituit statum, sed gradum; nec honor debetur
                            soli perfectioni, sed universaliter virtuti quae
                            designatur in hoc quod dicitur: bene praesunt.
                            Dicitur enim Rom. II, 10: gloria et honor et pax
                            omni operanti bonum.

                            frivolous, that it would seem hardly to need an
                            answer. In the words, “Priests who govern well,”
                            there is no mention either of a state, or of
                            perfection. Government does not indicate a state,
                            but a rank. Honour is due, not only to perfection,
                            but to all who do good works; and this fact is shown
                            by the very words, “they who govern well.” We read,
                            also, in the Epistle to the Romans (ii. 10), “Glory
                            and peace and honour to everyone who does good.”

                                In hoc vero quod quarto propositum est,
                                manifeste falsitas continetur; ubi dicitur quod
                                ante tempus Ieronymi et Augustini, non erat
                                aliud presbyter et episcopus. Huius enim
                                contrarium expresse dicit Augustinus in epistola
                                ad Ieronymum: quamquam secundum honorum
                                vocabula, quae iam Ecclesiae usus obtinuit,
                                episcopatus presbyterio maior sit, tamen in
                                multis rebus Augustinus Ieronymo minor est. Sed
                                ne aliquis calumnietur hoc circa tempora
                                Ieronymi in usum venisse, ut episcopus
                                presbytero maior sit; accipienda est auctoritas
                                Dionysii, qui scripsit ordinem ecclesiasticae
                                hierarchiae secundum quod erat in Ecclesia
                                primitiva. Dicit enim in 5 cap. ecclesiasticae
                                Hierarch., tres esse ordines ecclesiasticae
                                hierarchiae: scilicet episcoporum, presbyterorum
                                et diaconorum. Ubi notandum est, quod ordinem
                                diaconorum dicit esse purgativum, ordinem autem
                                sacerdotum illuminativum, ordinem vero
                                episcoporum perfectivum, et, sicut ipse dicit in
                                6 cap. eiusdem libri, tribus his ordinibus tres
                                ordines respondent: nam ordini diaconorum
                                subiicitur ordo immundorum qui purgatione
                                indigent; ordini vero presbyterorum subiicitur
                                ordo illuminandorum, scilicet sacer populus, qui
                                a presbyteris illuminatur per sacramentorum
                                susceptionem; ordini vero episcoporum subiicitur
                                ordo perfectorum, scilicet monachorum, qui per
                                eorum traditiones edocetur ad perfectissimam
                                perfectionem sursum actus. Ex quo patet secundum
                                Dionysium quod perfectio attribuitur solis
                                episcopis et monachis: episcopis autem tanquam
                                perfectoribus, monachis autem tanquam perfectis.
                                Sed ne quis dicat quod Dionysius tradit ordinem
                                ecclesiasticae hierarchiae ab apostolis
                                institutum, cum tamen ex domini institutione
                                idem essent presbyteri et episcopi; hoc
                                manifeste falsum apparet ex hoc quod dicitur
                                Luc. X 1: post haec autem designavit dominus,
                                etc., ubi dicit Glosa: sicut in apostolis forma
                                est episcoporum, sic in septuaginta forma est
                                presbyterorum secundi ordinis.

                                untruth. We are told, that, in the days of Sts.
                                Jerome and Augustine, a bishop and priest were
                                one and the same. Now, St. Augustine expressly
                                says the opposite in his epistle
                                <i>ad Hieronymum.</i> We give his words.
                                “Although,” he says, “in the language of good
                                men, which has become current in the Church, the
                                episcopate is accounted greater than the
                                priesthood, it is nevertheless, in many things
                                less.” But as some men may deny, that, in the
                                days of St. Jerome, bishops were generally
                                regarded as superior to priests, we will quote
                                the authority of Dionysius, who wrote concerning
                                the order of ecclesiastical hierarchy, as it was
                                established in the primitive Church. These are
                                his words: “There are three orders in the
                                ecclesiastical hierarchy, to wit, bishops,
                                priests, and deacons” (V. cap.
                                <i>Eccl. hierarch.).</i> We may remark, that the
                                same writer speaks of deacons as composing the
                                purifying order, of priests as forming the
                                illuminative order, and of bishops as being the
                                order producing perfection. “There are further,”
                                he continues, “three other orders corresponding
                                to the three already mentioned. For, the order
                                of the unpurified is subject to that of the
                                deacons, whose duty it is to cleanse. The order
                                of those needing light (<i>i.e.,</i> the holy
                                people of God) is subject to the order of
                                priests, whose office it is to illuminate by the
                                administration of the Sacraments. The order of
                                the perfect (<i>i.e.,</i> the monks) is subject
                                to the order of bishops, and is by them,
                                instructed in, and elevated to, sublime
                                perfection.” Hence, we see that Dionysius
                                attributes perfection only to bishops and monks:
                                to bishops as to the more perfect, to monks as
                                perfect. But, lest anyone should make the
                                objection, that he describes an ecclesiastical
                                hierarchy established by the Apostles, whereas,
                                by the institution of our Lord, bishops and
                                priests were one and the same, we will disprove
                                this fallacy by quoting the words of the Gloss
                                on St. Luke (x. 1), “After these things the Lord
                                appointed, etc.” The Gloss observes that,
                                “whereas the first order, that of the bishops,
                                is represented by the Apostles, the second
                                order, that of the priesthood, is typified by
                                the seventy-two disciples.”

                                    Ecclesia esset idem ordo vel status
                                    episcoporum et presbyterorum: sed quod
                                    istorum vocabulorum erat promiscuus usus,
                                    quia et presbyteri dicebantur episcopi quasi

                                    dignitatem. Unde ut Isidorus dicit, et
                                    habetur dist. 21, cap. cleros, presbyteri
                                    minores, licet sint sacerdotes, tamen

                                    It is strange how those who uphold this
                                    argument, appear to misunderstand simple
                                    words. They assert, that it is only since
                                    the days of St. Jerome, that bishops have
                                    been distinguished from priests. Yet, if
                                    anyone will examine the Old Law, of which
                                    the priesthood prefigured our priesthood, he
                                    will see that the High Priests were an order
                                    distinct from the priests. It is stated
                                    (distinct. XXI. cap. <i>De quibus</i>),
                                    that, “The High Priests and inferior priests
                                    were instituted by Moses, who, at the
                                    bidding of the Lord, anointed Aaron to be
                                    High Priest, and his sons inferior
                                    priests.”This passage proves that the words
                                    of St. Jerome have been misinterpreted. For,
                                    the Saint does not say, that in the
                                    primitive Church the order, or state, of the
                                    episcopate and that of the priesthood was
                                    one and the same. What he says is, that the
                                    same word was used to designate the two
                                    orders. For priests spoke of bishops,
                                    literally, as superintendents; and bishops
                                    used the same word of priests, on account of
                                    their priestly dignity. Hence Isidore says
                                    (and it is laid down, distinct. XXI, cap.
                                    <i>Cleros</i>) that, “the inferior clergy,
                                    although priests, have not attained to the
                                    highest dignity of the pontificate; for
                                    their foreheads are not anointed with
                                    chrism; neither have they power to confer
                                    the Holy Ghost, a power, as we know from the
                                    Acts of the Apostles, reserved to bishops.
                                    Hence (he concludes), in the early Church
                                    the same word was used both for bishops and
                                    priests; for the name denotes dignity and
                                    not age.” There is a difference in the thing
                                    signified; but the same word is, on account
                                    of the priestly dignity, used both for
                                    bishops and priests, In later times,
                                    however, it was found necessary, for the
                                    removal of a schism, arising from the
                                    similarity of name, to make a distinction in
                                    the appellation of the ranks of the clergy.
                                    Since then, the superior priesthood only has
                                    been called the episcopate; and the inferior
                                    clergy are known, simply, as priests.

                                        Ad 5. The argument brought forward in
                                        the fifth objection is not tenable. The
                                        contemplative life is superior to the
                                        active, not, merely, because it is more
                                        secure, but simply because it is better.
                                        This, our Lord’s own words point out:
                                        “Mary has chosen the better part” (Luke
                                        x. 43). And in so far as contemplation
                                        is superior to activity, so much the
                                        more would he seem to do for God, who,
                                        at the expense of his much loved
                                        contemplation, devotes himself, for
                                        God’s sake, to his neighbour’s
                                        salvation. Hence, it is a proof of a
                                        greater perfection of charity, to be
                                        willing, for the love of God and of our
                                        neighbour, to labour for the salvation
                                        of others, even though, by so doing,
                                        contemplation be somewhat impaired, than
                                        to cleave so closely to the sweetness of
                                        contemplation as to be unwilling to
                                        sacrifice it, even for the salvation of
                                        others. St. Paul was so zealous for the
                                        salvation of his brethren, that he
                                        desired, for their sake, not merely the
                                        prolongation of this present life, but
                                        also the temporary postponement of the
                                        Beatific vision. His own words to the
                                        Philippians (i. 23) are a proof of his
                                        disposition. “I am straitened,” he says,
                                        “between two: having a desire to be
                                        dissolved and to be with Christ, a thing
                                        by far the better. But to abide still in
                                        the flesh, is needful for you.”

                                            led to engage in them, rather from
                                            the tedium which they experience in
                                            contemplation, than from the desire

                                            divine love, which would induce them

                                            contemplation which is their
                                            delight. But, the faults of

                                                Sed hic considerandum est, quod
                                                non quicumque actu habet quod
                                                est perfectius, in perfectiori
                                                statu constituitur. Nullus enim
                                                dubitat quin virginitatem
                                                servare ad perfectionem
                                                pertineat, quia de hoc dominus
                                                dicit: qui potest capere,
                                                capiat: Matth. XIX, 12: et
                                                apostolus dicit I Cor. VII, 25:
                                                de virginibus praeceptum domini
                                                non habeo, consilium autem do;
                                                sunt enim consilia de operibus
                                                perfectionis: et tamen
                                                virginitas conservata absque
                                                voto, perfectionis statum non
                                                habet. Dicit enim Augustinus in
                                                libro de virginitate: neque enim
                                                ipsa, scilicet virginitas, quia
                                                virginitas est, sed quia Deo
                                                dicata est, honoratur: quae
                                                licet in carne servatur, ac per
                                                hoc etiam virginitas corporalis
                                                spiritualis est, quam vovet et
                                                servat continentia pietatis: et

                                                But, here we must remember, that
                                                not everyone who performs acts
                                                of perfection, is necessarily in
                                                a state of perfection. No one
                                                doubts, that a life of virginity
                                                pertains to perfection. our Lord
                                                says of it: “He that can take
                                                let him take” (Matt. xix. 12).
                                                And St. Paul writes to the
                                                Corinthians, (1 Ep. vii. 25),
                                                “Concerning virgins I have no
                                                commandment from the Lord, but I
                                                give a counsel.” Now there are
                                                counsels concerning the works of
                                                perfection; nevertheless a life
                                                of virginity without a vow, does
                                                not constitute a state of
                                                perfection. St. Augustine says,
                                                in his book,
                                                <i>De virginibus</i>, “Virginity
                                                is not honoured because it is
                                                virginity, but because it is
                                                dedicated to God. And by this
                                                consecration, even virginity of
                                                the body, preserved by piety,
                                                becomes spiritual.”And, again,
                                                he says, “That continence is to
                                                be numbered among the goods of
                                                the soul, by which the body is
                                                preserved inviolate, for the
                                                Creator of soul and body, and
                                                which is dedicated and
                                                consecrated to Him.”

                                                    Now, it is clear, that

                                                    were, they could not
                                                    relinquish an archidiaconate
                                                    or a parish, without a
                                                    dispensation from him who
                                                    has power to annul perpetual
                                                    vows. Hence, although an
                                                    archdeacon, or a parish
                                                    priest performs a work of
                                                    perfection or accepts a

                                                    work, he is, nevertheless,
                                                    not in a state of
                                                    perfection. And, if we
                                                    reflect carefully, we shall
                                                    see that the religious life
                                                    is, really, the state of
                                                    perfection; since, by the

                                                        Some men live in a state
                                                        of perfection, while
                                                        their charity is either
                                                        very imperfect, or does
                                                        not exist; for there are
                                                        many religious and
                                                        bishops living in a

                                                        the fact that there are
                                                        many good parish

                                                        not prove that they are
                                                        in a state of

                                                        married people, who have
                                                        attained to such
                                                        perfection of charity,
                                                        that they, also, are

                                                        however, does not prove

                                                            the Apostles were in
                                                            a state of
                                                            perfection, there is
                                                            no proof of the
                                                            truth of this
                                                            assertion, either in
                                                            the text of the

                                                            Gloss. We are told
                                                            that the deacons
                                                            were “filled with
                                                            the Holy Spirit and
                                                            with wisdom”; but
                                                            this merely shows,
                                                            that they possessed
                                                            that perfection of
                                                            grace which may
                                                            exist in those who
                                                            are not in a state
                                                            of perfection. And
                                                            the fact that they
                                                            ministered around
                                                            the altar, only
                                                            points out that they
                                                            held a certain high

                                                            For, as we have
                                                            before said, there
                                                            is a difference
                                                            between a state and
                                                            a rank. It is,
                                                            nevertheless, true
                                                            that the deacons
                                                            were in that state

                                                            said, “If you will

                                                            follow Me” (Matt.

                                                            deacons followed

                WE have already shown the absurdity of the arguments, on which
                is based the theory that archdeacons and parish priests are in a
                more perfect state than are religious. We will now, therefore,
                point out the frivolity of the objections raised against the
                proposition, that a man is placed in a state of perfection by
                means of a solemn blessing or consecration. (ch 21, second set)
                <tr style="text-align: justify" valign="top">
                  <td>
                    Ubi primo considerandum est, quod solemnis consecratio aut
                    benedictio non est causa quod homo sit in statu
                    perfectionis, sed inducitur quasi signum. Non enim adhibetur
                    nisi illis qui in aliquo statu ponuntur; non quidem semper
                    in statu perfectionis existentibus, sed statum quemcumque
                    adipiscentibus. Hi enim qui matrimonio iunguntur, in statu
                    aliquo ponuntur, quia ex tunc vir non habet potestatem sui
                    corporis, similiter neque mulier, ut dicitur I Cor. VII: est
                    enim in matrimonio perpetua obligatio unius ad alterum, ad
                    quam significandam ab Ecclesia solemnis benedictio nuptiarum
                    exhibetur; non tamen in statu perfectionis ponuntur, sed in
                    statu matrimonii. Unde et his qui in statu perfectionis
                    ponuntur, in signum perpetuae obligationis solemnis
                    consecratio aut benedictio exhibetur; sicut etiam cum
                    civiliter aliquis statum mutat, sicut cum servus
                    manumittitur, aliqua civilis solemnitas exhibetur.

                  <td>
                    But, first, we must remember that a solemn rite of this
                    nature, is not a cause, but a sign, of a state of
                    perfection. It is not bestowed on any save on those who are
                    entering some state of life; though that state need not
                    necessarily be one of perfection. Those who are joined in
                    matrimony embrace a state, in which neither husband nor wife
                    will hereafter belong to themselves (1 Cor. vii.). For,
                    matrimony is a perpetual bond uniting one to the other.
                    Hence, the Church, to signify this state of perpetuity
                    (though it be not a state of perfection), pronounces a
                    solemn nuptial blessing over man and wife. In the same way,
                    when a state is changed in social life, a certain form is
                    used; thus, when a slave receives his freedom a deed of
                    manumission is drawn up.

                        Hoc autem non frivole dicitur, sed auctoritate Dionysii

                        We are not speaking at random. For, all that we say, is
                        confirmed by the authority of Dionysius, who says (VI.
                        cap. <i>Eccles. hieiarch</i>.) that, “our divine masters
                        (to wit the Apostles), have vouchsafed to distinguish
                        men by certain holy appellations,” namely, those who are
                        in the state of the perfect; “some are servants, while
                        others are called monks by reason of their pure service
                        and ministry to God, and their single and undivided life
                        which unites them, by holy ties, to godlike unity and
                        perfection most pleasing to God. On this account, the
                        holy law has given them perfect grace, and has deemed
                        them worthy of invocation.” We are, also, expressly
                        told, that, as monks embrace a state of perfection, they
                        are blessed by a solemn rite, handed down by Apostolic
                        tradition.

                            proferuntur, sicut consecrentur et sanctificentur

                            secundum Dionysium; sed in quantum curam accipit:
                            tunc enim ei nulla solemnis benedictio exhibetur,

                            pastoralem consecratur propter perpetuam
                            obligationem qua se ad pastoralem curam obligat,

                            Ad 1. The argument, that both in the consecration of
                            a bishop and in the ordination of a priest, the same
                            words are used, viz., “may these hands be sanctified
                            and consecrated,” is irrelevant to our point. For,
                            we are not now speaking of a priest in his priestly
                            character. For, by his solemn consecration, he is
                            placed not in a state of perfection, be it active or
                            passive, but (as Dionysius tells us), in an
                            illuminative state. We are speaking of a priest, in
                            so far as he receives a certain charge or
                            commission. And, when this charge is laid upon him,
                            it is not accompanied by any special blessing; for
                            he does not, by it, embrace a state, but merely
                            accepts an office. A bishop, on the other hand, is
                            solemnly consecrated to the pastoral office, by
                            reason of the perpetual obligation, whereby be binds
                            himself to it.

                                Quod vero secundo proponitur, dicendum, quod
                                unctio capitis quae regibus exhibebatur, signum
                                erat status habentis principalem curam regni:
                                alii autem qui sunt officiales in regno, tanquam
                                non habentes perfectam regiminis rationem,
                                numquam ungebantur. Ita etiam et in regno
                                Ecclesiae episcopus ungitur tanquam
                                principaliter habens curam regiminis;
                                archidiaconi vero et presbyteri curati non
                                unguntur in susceptione curae, quia non
                                suscipiunt principaliter curam, sed quandam
                                subministrationem sub episcopali regimine, sicut
                                balivi vel praepositi sub rege. Nec propter hoc
                                sequitur quod rex habeat statum perfectionis;
                                quia cura eius se extendit ad temporalia, non ad
                                spiritualia, sicut cura episcopalis. Caritas
                                autem per se respicit spirituale bonum: unde et

                                Ad 2. With regard to the second objection (viz.,
                                that regarding the anointing of kings), we
                                answer that this unction was a sign, that be who
                                received it, was entering a state involving the
                                chief government of the kingdom. The other
                                officers of the kingdom were not anointed,
                                because they had no plenitude of power. In like
                                manner in the Kingdom of the Church, a bishop
                                receives unction on his head, to signify that he
                                is the principal ruler of his diocese, while
                                archdeacons and parish priests, who only hold a
                                commission from the bishop, and who act as his
                                lieutenants, are not anointed. But the fact of
                                his receiving unction, is no proof that a king
                                enters a state of perfection; since his charge
                                extends only to temporal matters. It is not like
                                that of bishops, which extends to such as are
                                spiritual. Charity, wherein perfection consists,
                                regards the spiritual welfare of others. Hence,
                                solicitude about the spiritual, not about the
                                temporal, wants of our neighbour, is essential
                                to perfection; although perfect charity may,
                                likewise, occupy itself about the material needs
                                of others.

                                    to the matter of which we are treating. The
                                    point with which we are at present dealing,
                                    is not that of perfection of merit, which
                                    may of course be greater in a parish priest,
                                    or even in a married man, than in a bishop
                                    or religious. The subject with which we are
                                    occupied is the state of perfection. It
                                    would seem, by the argument of our
                                    adversaries, that they do not understand the
                                    meaning of their own words; since, according
                                    to their reasoning, even bishops themselves,
                                    are not in a higher state of perfection than
                                    priests; for it may happen that their lives
                                    are less meritorious than are the lives of
                                    priests.

                                        episcopatus non sit ordo, manifeste
                                        continet falsitatem si absolute
                                        intelligatur. Expresse enim dicit

                                        ecclesiasticae hierarchiae: scilicet
                                        episcoporum, presbyterorum, et
                                        diaconorum: et 21 dist., cap. cleros
                                        habetur, quod ordo episcoporum
                                        quadripartitus est. Habet quidem enim
                                        ordinem episcopus per comparationem ad
                                        corpus Christi mysticum, quod est
                                        Ecclesia; super quam principalem accipit
                                        curam, et quasi regalem. Sed quantum ad
                                        corpus Christi verum, quod in sacramento
                                        continetur, non habet ordinem supra
                                        presbyterum. Quod autem aliquem ordinem
                                        habeat, et non iurisdictionem solam,
                                        sicut archidiaconus vel curatus, patet
                                        ex hoc quod episcopus potest multa
                                        facere quae non potest committere, sicut
                                        conferre ordines, consecrare basilicas,
                                        et huiusmodi; quae vero iurisdictionis
                                        sunt, potest aliis committere. Idem
                                        etiam patet ex hoc quod si episcopus
                                        depositus restituatur, non iterum
                                        consecratur tanquam potestate ordinis

                                        <i>i.e.,</i> that the episcopate is not
                                        an order, contains, if it be taken in
                                        its literal meaning, a palpable
                                        falsehood. For Dionysius expressly says
                                        that there are three orders of the
                                        ecclesiastical hierarchy, to wit,
                                        bishops, priests, and deacons. Again, in
                                        the distinct. XXI. cap.
                                        <i>Cleros,</i> it is said, that the
                                        order of bishops is divided into four
                                        parts. A bishop has a certain order with
                                        respect to the mystical body of Christ,
                                        <i>i.e.,</i> the Church in whose
                                        government he takes the chief part. But,
                                        with regard to the true Body of Christ
                                        which is contained in the Blessed
                                        Sacrament, he has no superiority over a
                                        priest. The proof that a bishop has a
                                        certain order, and not merely
                                        jurisdiction, like an archdeacon or
                                        parish priest, lies in the fact, that a
                                        bishop can do many things, such as
                                        administering Confirmation and Holy
                                        Orders, and consecrating churches, which
                                        he cannot commission others to do. The
                                        duties which are matters of jurisdiction
                                        only, he can transfer to others. Another
                                        proof that the episcopate is an order,
                                        lies in the fact, that, if a bishop be
                                        suspended, and then be ultimately
                                        restored to his see, he is not
                                        reconsecrated; for he has never lost the
                                        power of his order. This too is the case
                                        with men who are in other orders.

                                            an archdeacon or parish priest, is
                                            solemnly appointed, because he is
                                            invested with a ring, or some other
                                            symbol of the sort, is absolutely
                                            ridiculous. This investiture
                                            resembles certain civil ceremonies,

                fecerunt: ubi dicit Glossa, quod in hoc damnatur propositi
                fraus, et quod omnes huiusmodi similes sunt uxori Lot, quae
                retro aspexit; et hoc est apostatare. Unde si archidiaconi vel
                plebani in statu perfectionis essent, dimittentes
                archidiaconatum vel parochiae curam, damnabiliter apostatae
                essent.

                WE must next point out, that they argue with great
                inconsistency, who say that archdeacons and parish priests, in
                spite of their being able to resign their office, are in a state
                of perfection, equal to that of the episcopate or of the
                religious life. With regard to this point, it must be
                remembered, that, whoever leaves a state of perfection for one
                less perfect, is considered an apostate. Hence St. Paul writes
                concerning widows, “For when they have grown wanton in Christ
                they will marry; having damnation, because they have made void
                their first faith” (1 Tim. v. 11). On these words, the Gloss
                remarks, “Violation of a vow is damnable. Fidelity to a broken
                vow is, likewise, damnable. And they are in a state of damnation
                who make void their first promise of continence, and who, like
                the wife of Lot, look back; for this is apostasy.” Hence, if
                archdeacons or parish Priests were in a state of perfection,
                they would, by renouncing the archidiaconates or parishes, put
                themselves in a state of damnation by becoming apostates.

                    Quod ergo primo proponitur, quod archidiaconi et plebani

                    religionem intrare, sed etiam in saeculo remanere; sicut
                    patet de illis qui dimittunt parochias et accipiunt

                    Ad 1. Those who argue against us, maintain, first, that
                    archdeacons and parish priests can embrace the religious
                    life, not because the religious state is more perfect than
                    that in which they have been living, but because it is
                    safer. This, however, is eminently untrue. It is distinctly
                    stated, XIX. Quest. I., that, “such of the clergy as desire
                    to become religious, in order that, thus, they may be able
                    to lead a better life, shall be permitted by their bishops
                    to enter monasteries.” Hence, it is clear, that their desire
                    of embracing the religious state, must be on account of its
                    greater perfection, not by reason of the security which it
                    offers. Archdeacons and parish priests may not only resign
                    their archidiaconates or parishes in order to go into
                    monasteries, but they are free to resign them and stay in
                    the world. This is done by those who become prebendaries of
                    a cathedral. Likewise, if they be not in Holy Orders, they
                    are free to marry. We thus have an incontestable proof that
                    they are not in a state of perfection.

                        Quod vero secundo proponitur, quod religiosus non
                        propter hoc est perfectioris status quod non potest
                        religionem dimittere, quia nec etiam uxoratus potest
                        uxorem dimittere, qui tamen non est in statu
                        perfectionis: patet ex praedictis omnino frivolum esse.
                        Uterque enim status, scilicet religionis et matrimonii,
                        aliquid simile habet, scilicet perpetuam obligationem;
                        et ideo uterque status est quasi alicuius servitutis.
                        Sed obligatio matrimonii non est ad opus perfectionis,
                        sed ad reddendum carnale debitum: et ideo est quidem
                        status, sed non perfectionis. Status autem religionis
                        habet obligationem ad opera perfectionis, quae sunt
                        paupertas, continentia et obedientia; et ideo est status
                        perfectionis.

                        Ad 2. The second argument brought against us is, that if
                        the inability of a religious man to leave his order be a
                        proof that he is in a state of perfection, a married man
                        must also be in a perfect state, because he may not
                        forsake his wife. The absurdity of this reasoning is
                        made clear by what we have already said. The religious
                        life and the wedded life have this one circumstance in
                        common, that they both entail a perpetual obligation.
                        But while obligations of matrimony are not undertaken
                        with a view to the accomplishment of works of perfection
                        but to render a carnal debt, the ties of the religious
                        life bind men solely to works of perfection, i.e., to
                        poverty, chastity, and obedience. Hence, the religious
                        state is one of perfection.

                            perfectiori statu discedere ad minorem, sicut David

                            secundum aliquid verum est, et secundum aliquid
                            falsum. Potest enim aliquis propter infirmitatem ab

                            false. It embodies the proposition, that, as David
                            laid aside his armour for a sling and stones, so,
                            likewise, it is permissible for men to abandon a
                            more perfect state for one more lowly. A religious
                            may, by reason of his weakness, and with a
                            dispensation, quit his order for one less severe.
                            But the Church never allows a religious to leave the
                            religious life for that of a secular priest, be it
                            as archdeacon, or as parish priest. Hence, we see
                            that there is far more difference between the
                            excellence of the religious state and the state of
                            the archidiaconate or of parish priests (If theirs
                            is to be called a state), than there is between the
                            superiority of the more severe religious orders, and
                            that of the less rigorous ones.

                                immutability be essential to the perfection of a
                                state, it cannot be permissible to pass from one
                                state to another, is absolutely frivolous. It is
                                lawful to pass from a lower to a higher state,
                                but not <i>vice versa</i> (<i

                                >). For, a more perfect state embraces all that
                                is contained in that which is less perfect; but
                                the less perfect state does not contain what is
                                included in a state of greater perfection.
                                Therefore, a man who has bound himself to that
                                which is less, cannot be blamed for embracing
                                that which is greater.

                                    do not absolutely belong to them, must
                                    present to the bishops, for ordination, the
                                    priests who shall be responsible for the
                                    care of such churches. Further, they must

                                    temporal concerns of these churches. Nor

                                    bishop, to remove these priests from their

                                    saying, that parish priests, who, without
                                    consulting their bishop, resign their cures,
                                    render themselves liable to canonical
                                    penalties. But it is illogical to apply this
                                    general rule to a particular case, and to
                                    say, that priests cannot leave their

                                    Quest. I. cap. <i>Duae,</i> it is expressly
                                    stated that, “even against the desire of

                                        the point in question. It is urged, that
                                        religious pass from the religious life
                                        to a secular church, to which the cure
                                        of souls is attached. This is true. But
                                        they do not, in undertaking charge of a
                                        church, abandon the religious state. For
                                        it is established by XVI. Quest. I.
                                        <i>De monachis,</i> that “they, who,
                                        having lived a long while in religion,
                                        are admitted to Holy Orders, do not, on,
                                        that account, relinquish their former
                                        state.” But an archdeacon or parish
                                        priest can resign his office, and
                                        embrace the religious life; since, he is
                                        thereby passing from a less to a more
                                        perfect state under the guidance of the
                                        Divine Spirit (XIX. Quest. I.

                                            foolish to need an answer. It is
                                            urged, that because a man who was in
                                            charity can fall from charity,
                                            therefore, it does not follow that
                                            he who falls from a state of
                                            perfection, was not in a state of
                                            perfection. No one falls from
                                            charity except, by sin; and by sin,
                                            likewise, a man falls from a state
                                            of perfection. For as men are bound
                                            by a common law to the love of
                                            charity, they are also bound to a
                                            state of perfection by particular
                                            vows.

                                                viz., that by ecclesiastical
                                                constitution no bishop can
                                                become a religious without the
                                                permission of the Pope, from the
                                                practice of the Church is
                                                evidently untrue. The obstacle
                                                is, rather, on account of the
                                                perpetual obligation whereby
                                                bishops bind themselves to the
                                                care of their flocks. Hence St.
                                                Paul says (1 Cor. ix. 16),
                                                “Necessity is laid upon me; for
                                                woe is unto me if I preach not
                                                the Gospel.” He adds the cause
                                                of this necessity, when he says,
                                                “For whereas I was free unto
                                                all, I made myself the servant
                                                of all.” Hence this prohibition
                                                is not laid down in the
                                                <i>Decretals</i> as a statute,
                                                but as a fact, approved by
                                                reason.

                    1. The following words of St. Jerome which are found in the
                    decrees (distinct. LXV. <i>Olim</i>) are quoted by the
                    enemies of the religious life. “Before study was, by the
                    suggestion of Satan, introduced into the religious life,”
                    etc. —I wonder if they who quote these words are of opinion
                    that religious ought not to study? For study, especially of
                    Holy Scripture, peculiarly befits men consecrated to a life
                    of contemplation. St. Augustine thought study a fit
                    occupation for religious. He writes, (XIX.
                    <i>De Civitate Dei</i>), “None ought to be hindered from
                    knowledge of the truth, a knowledge which beseems
                    meritorious leisure.” If they who quote the saying of St.
                    Jerome, intend to prove that study is reprehensible in
                    religious, the words that follow in the same chapter ought
                    to convince them of their error. “The people will say among
                    themselves: I am of Paul, I am of Apollo.” Whence it is
                    clear what is meant by the words cited, “Before, by the
                    suggestion of the devil, there was study,”
                    <i>i.e.</i> dissensions in the Christian religion.

                        2. It is also maintained, that the power of binding and
                        loosing, or rather the right to exercise this power,
                        does not belong to religious who are priests. —I wonder
                        what those who speak thus, mean by their words. If they
                        mean, that because monks are ordained priests, they
                        cannot <i>ipso facto</i> exercise the power of the keys,
                        they are perfectly right. This applies, likewise, to
                        secular priests. For a secular priest does not receive
                        faculties to exercise the power of the keys because he
                        is ordained priest. He has these faculties given him on
                        account of the cure of souls, wherewith he is entrusted.
                        Therefore, if it be argued, that monks, as monks, may
                        not exercise the power of the keys, it is a plain
                        falsehood. This is evident from the following words
                        (XVI. Quest. L.): “Certain men, supported by no
                        authority whatsoever, and inflamed rather, by
                        presumptuous and bitter zeal than by charity, assert
                        that monks, being dead to the world, and living only to
                        God, are unworthy to exercise the functions of the
                        priesthood. They hold that monks cannot instruct men in
                        penance, or in the truths of Christianity, and that they
                        are unable, by the power divinely committed to them in
                        their priestly office, to absolve sinners. But this is
                        completely erroneous. Blessed Benedict, the gentle guide
                        of monks, has never prohibited them from performing this
                        office. And, it is observed, that those things only, are
                        unlawful to religious, which are forbidden them by their
                        rule.”

                            open to religious, also quote the following words:
                            “The office of a monk is not that of a doctor, but
                            of a mourner”(XVI. Quest. I.). If, by these words,
                            they intend to prove that because a man is a monk,
                            he need not, necessarily, be a teacher, the
                            proposition is perfectly true. Otherwise, every monk
                            must needs be a teacher. But, if they mean that the
                            fact that a man is a monk, is in some way
                            incompatible with his being, likewise, a teacher,
                            their opinion is clearly erroneous. On the contrary,
                            the office of teaching, especially of teaching Holy
                            Scripture, belongs, pre-eminently, to religious. On
                            the words of St. John’s Gospel, “The woman therefore
                            left her water pot,” etc., the Gloss says, quoting
                            St. Augustine: “From these words let those intending
                            to preach the Gospel learn to put away worldly
                            anxieties and cares. our Lord entrusted to those who
                            had left all things and followed Him, the office of
                            universal teaching, saying to His disciples, ‘Go,
                            therefore, teach all nations’” (Matt. xxviii.).

                                commissa; sicut clericus non potest
                                excommunicare ex hoc quod est clericus; potest

                                4. The same answer may be made to all other
                                objections of the same sort: as, for instance,
                                to the argument, that the position of the cleric
                                and the monk differ, for the cleric having
                                charge of souls, says “I feed my sheep,” but the
                                monk says “I am fed.” The same reply must, also,
                                be made to those who say, “Let the monk sit
                                solitary and hold his peace.” —These words, and
                                others resembling them, certainly point out the
                                conduct beseeming a monk as a monk; but they do
                                not forbid him to undertake superior offices, if
                                such be entrusted to him. A secular priest
                                cannot, by reason of his being a priest,
                                pronounce excommunication; but he has,
                                nevertheless, power to do so, if he be
                                commissioned by his bishop to excommunicate.

                                    duodecim apostolorum, quorum formam tenent

                                    5. Again, it is urged that only two orders
                                    were established by our Lord: one being that
                                    of the twelve Apostles, represented by
                                    bishops; the other that of the seventy-two
                                    disciples, represented by priests exercising
                                    the pastoral office. —If, from these
                                    premises, it be argued that monks, unless
                                    they be bishops or pastors, have not, as a
                                    matter, of course, the care of souls, the
                                    conclusion is perfectly true. But, if it be
                                    maintained that religious have not power to
                                    preach, or to hear confessions, even with
                                    the sanction of their bishop, the conclusion
                                    is clearly false. For the higher the dignity
                                    of any man, the greater is his power (XVI.
                                    Quest. I. <i>Sunt nonnulli</i>). Hence, if
                                    secular priests, not engaged in pastoral
                                    work, can, with the permission of a bishop,
                                    discharge these functions, religious are
                                    certainly better entitled to do so, if they
                                    have the same commission.

                                        quia, sicut scriptum est Prov. X, 18:
                                        qui profert contumeliam, insipiens est:
                                        et XX, 3: omnes stulti miscentur

                                        It has occurred to me to say these
                                        things in answer to those who strive to
                                        detract from the perfection of religious
                                        life. Nevertheless, I abstain from
                                        reproaches. For, “he who utters reproach
                                        is foolish” (Prov. x. 18), and “all
                                        fools are meddling with reproaches”
                                        (Prov. xx. 3). If anyone desire to send
                                        me a reply, his words will be very
                                        welcome to me. For the surest way to
                                        elucidate truth and to confound error is
                                        by confuting the arguments brought
                                        against the truth. Solomon says, “Iron
                                        sharpens iron, so a man sharpens the
                                        countenance of a friend” (Prov. xxvii.
                                        17).
